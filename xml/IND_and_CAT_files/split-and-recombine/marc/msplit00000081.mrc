Unfortunately, the development of traditional 'anonymous' SSRs from genomic DNA is costly and time-consuming. These problems are further compounded by a paucity of resources in taxa that lack clear economic importance. However, the advent of the genomics age has resulted in the production of vast amounts of publicly available DNA sequence data, including large collections of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a variety of different taxa. Recent research has revealed that ESTs are a potentially rich source of SSRs that reveal polymorphisms not only within the source taxon, but in related taxa, as well. In this paper, we review what is known about the transferability of EST-SSRs from one taxon to another with particular reference to the potential of these markers to facilitate population genetic studies. As an example of the utility of these resources, we then cross-reference existing EST databases against lists of rare, endangered and invasive plant species and conclude that half of all suitable EST databases could be exploited for the population genetic analysis of species of conservation concern. We then discuss the advantages and disadvantages of EST-SSRs in the context of population genetic applications. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aendangered species 3abioinformatics 3aexpressed sequence tags 3apopulation genetics 3ainvasive species 3anoxious weeds 3adatabases 3agenetic markers 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGenetics, Populationxmethods 2aMinisatellite Repeats 2aPlantsxclassificationxgenetics. 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 0athreatened species 0aplants1 aBurke, J.M.0 tHeredity.g2007 Aug., v. 99, no. 2 p.125-132x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68010013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080213b20080301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/02/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02768naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151100001800160245010300178300001300281500002400294500001500318520139300333650002801726650001901754650001801773650001001791650001101801650001001812650002301822650001701845650001401862650001801876650003801894650002601932651001101958653002001969700002101989700002202010773009702032852000902129856009102138930003302229945002502262946001102287655001202298IND4400423220221122075044.0080125e20080101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440042322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2007.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aAl-Momani, W.10aRisk factors associated with Mycoplasma agalactiae infection of small ruminants in northern Jordan  ap. 1-10.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSerological detection of Mycoplasma agalactiae was carried out in 104 small ruminants flocks consisting of 18 sheep, 27 goat and 59 flocks containing both sheep and goats in northern Jordan between 2002 and 2003. At least 5 serum samples per flock were tested using an indirect ELISA for antibodies to M. agalactiae. To increase the chances of detecting this mycoplasma, sick or older animals were sampled. A high seropositivity to M. agalactiae was found in small ruminants suggesting a major role for M. agalactiae in contagious agalactia in northern Jordan. There was no significant difference in the seroprevalence of M. agalactiae in sheep and goats at flock level (X Â² =0.14, d.f.=1, p =0.7). A total of 31 variables including production and health management practices were tested as risk factors for seropositive flocks and analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Increasing risk factors for M. agalactiae seropositive flocks were: using outsider rams, improper cleaning of the milking utensils and separating young from dam, with odds ratios of 5, 3, 4.2, respectively; having mastitis problems in the flock was negatively associated (p =0.04) with M. agalactiae seropositivity. Educating small ruminant farmers to avoid the use of outsider rams, ensuring adequate cleaning of milking utensils and separating the young from dams would enhance the health of small ruminants. 3aepidemiological studies 3aseroprevalence 3aserodiagnosis 3asheep 3aflocks 3agoats 3aantibody detection 3arisk factors 3aagalactia 3amycoplasmosis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aMycoplasma agalactiae 3aJordan 0asmall ruminants1 aNicholas, R.A.J.1 aAbo-Shehada, M.N.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2008 Jan. 1, v. 83, no. 1 p.1-10dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2007.08.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080415b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/03/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03549naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245015500125300001800280500001500298520238200313650001402695650000902709650001802718650001202736650001802748650002202766650001402788650001302802650002502815650001502840650001302855653001502868653002402883653002402907653001102931653001902942700001802961773009502979852000903074939003303083946001103116655001203127IND9207223120221121232049.0921125e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920722312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGadd, G.M.10aCalcium involement in dimorphism of Ophiostoma ulmi, the Dutch elm disese fungus, and characterization of calcium uptake by yeast cells and germ tubes  ap. 1561-1571.  a2019-12-05  aExogenous Ca2+, at concentrations up to 5 mM, induced partial germ tube formation in Ophiostoma (= Ceratocystis) ulmi in media normally supporting growth in the yeast-like phase. The calmodulin inhibitors calmidazolium (R24571) and trifluoperazine (TFP), and the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, suppressed germ tube formation in germ-tube-inducing medium without affecting yeast-like growth. R24571 was the most effective inhibitor, giving almost complete suppression at 3 micromolar. Addition of excess Ca2+ (up to 5 mM) did not reverse the inhibitory action of R24571 and only approximately 10% of yeast-like cells formed germ tubes on addition of Ca2+ in the presence of 20 micromolar-TFP or 15 micromolar-A23187. Intracellular cAMP increased on incubation with R24571 and A23187, possibly as a result of inhibition of the cAMP phosphodiesterase. The exogenous supply of the calcium-binding agents methylhydroxybenzoate (MHB) and EGTA also suppressed germ tube formation under inducing conditions. These results confirm an involvement of Ca2+ in the yeast-mycelium transition of 0. ulmi. Yeast-like cells and germ tubes of 0. ulmi exhibited metabolism-dependent Ca2+ uptake which was reduced in the absence of glucose, or by the presence of KCN, the ATPase inhibitors N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and diethylstilboestrol (DES), and the protonophoric uncoupler DNP, indicating dependence on the electrochemical proton gradient across the plasma membrane generated by the H+-ATPase. Germ tubes exhibited greater sensitivity to inhibitors of Ca2+ uptake than yeast-like cells, while Ca2+ uptake was competitively inhibited by Mg2+, Mn2+ and Zn2+. R24571 and A23187 inhibited Ca2+ uptake by germ tubes although TFP stimulated uptake in comparison to control cells. Ca2+ uptake by both cell types conformed to Michaelis-Menten kinetics at concentrations below approximately 200 micromolar but deviated strongly above this concentration. Kinetic analysis of Ca2+ uptake by yeast-like cells and germ tubes, at Ca2+ concentrations below 100 micromolar, revealed that both cell types possessed Ca2+ transport systems of similar specificity, with Km values ranging between approximately 15 and 25 micromolar, although germ tubes always exhibited greater Ca2+ uptake than yeast cells under similar experimental conditions, possibly a consequence of increased vacuolar compartmentation. 3amanganese 3azinc 3amorphogenesis 3acalcium 3aion transport 3aCeratocystis ulmi 3amagnesium 3akinetics 3ametabolic inhibitors 3ametal ions 3amycelium 0ainhibition 0adivalent metal ions 0agerm tube formation 0agrowth 0ainorganic ions1 aBrunton, A.H.0 tJournal of general microbiology.g1992 Aug., v. 138, no. pt.8 p.1561-1571x0022-12877nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02052naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011200129300001800241500001500259520101000274650002701284650003001311650001301341650001001354650002001364650001401384650001501398650002301413653001301436653001501449653002001464653003001484700001501514773009601529852000901625939003301634946001101667655001201678IND9303056020221121221355.0930519e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930305602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmer, A.C.V.14aThe role of VirA and VirG phosphorylation in chemotaxis towards acetosyringone by Agrobacterium tumefaciens  ap. 2509-2514.  a2019-12-05  aThe Ti-plasmid-encoded two-component sensor-regulator system comprising VirA and VirG confers upon Agrobacterium tumefaciens the ability to respond chemotactically to nanomolar concentrations of vir-inducing phenolics such as acetosyringone. Non-phosphorylatable, mutant VirA and VirG proteins are incapable of replacing their wild-type counterparts in conferring this phenotype. This indicates that, like vir-gene induction in response to acetosyringone, chemotaxis to the same ligand involves phosphorylation of VirA and VirG. However, unlike vir-induction, deletion of the periplasmic domain of VirA severely curtails acetosyringone chemotaxis, suggesting that acetosyringone may mediate effects through more than one region of VirA. When introduced into strains expressing wild-type VirA and VirG, the non-phosphorylatable versions suppress chemotaxis towards acetosyringone, implying that mutant copies of VirA and VirG compete with their wild-type counterparts in interactions between VirA and VirG. 3atransmembrane proteins 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aplasmids 3agenes 3aphosphorylation 3avirulence 3achemotaxis 3aphenolic compounds 0aproteins 0ati-plasmid 0avirulence genes 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aShaw, C.H.0 tJournal of general microbiology.g1992 Dec., v. 138, no. pt.12 p.2509-2514x0022-12877nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02357naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009300128300001600221500001500237520110700252650001701359650002101376650001601397650003201413650001601445650002001461650001601481650001601497650003701513650002201550650001201572650001301584650002401597653002101621653003101642700001701673700001701690700001401707700001401721700001801735773009301753852000901846939003301855946001101888655001201899IND9303682620221121221407.0930617e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930368262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshitake, A.10aN-linked carbohydrate chains protect laccase III from proteolysis in Coriolus versicolor  ap. 179-185.  a2019-12-05  aThe structure and function of the N-linked carbohydrate chains in laccase III, one of the ligninolytic glycoenzymes from the white-rot fungus Coriolus versicolor, have been partially characterized using endoglycosidases (Endo F and Endo H) and the N-asparagine-specific inhibitor, tunicamycin. In the presence of 10 micrograms tunicamycin ml-1 laccase and proteinase activities in culture filtrates of C. versicolor were measured over 3 weeks. Laccase activity was slightly decreased by the addition of tunicamycin, whereas proteinase activity was increased. The N-linked carbohydrate chains were not necessary for laccase secretion and activity. Endo-glycosidase digestion showed that laccase III contained at least four N-linked carbohydrate chains, of which two were high-mannose type or hybrid type and two were complex type. Judging from the differences in the resistance of the native and the carbohydrate-depleted laccase to proteolytic digestion and high temperature, the four N-linked carbohydrate chains have important protective functions against proteolytic attack and elevated temperature. 3aglycosidases 3aenzyme stability 3atunicamycin 3aligninolytic microorganisms 3aproteinases 3aenzyme activity 3aproteolysis 3adecay fungi 3astructure-activity relationships 3aculture filtrates 3alaccase 3aisozymes 3aCoriolus versicolor 0aendoglycosidases 0aphysicochemical properties1 aKatayama, Y.1 aNakamura, M.1 aIiura, Y.1 aKawai, S.1 aMorohoshi, N.0 tJournal of general microbiology.g1993 Jan., v. 139, no. pt.1 p.179-185x0022-12877nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03970naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072000900160072000900169072000900178100001500187245014400202300001600346500002400362500001500386520192700401650001602328650001502344650001902359650002802378650001402406650001602420650002002436650001302456650000702469650002302476650001802499650001402517650001602531650004702547650001202594650001602606650002302622650002602645650001102671650001102682650001402693650004202707650002202749650002202771650001102793650001202804650001302816653003602829653002302865700001602888700001802904700001602922700001802938700001302956773011802969852000903087856008103096930003303177945002503210946001303235655001203248IND4400599720221121185951.0080127e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440059972DNAL7 a182187542pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2007-05212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aR3001 aDann, H.M.10aComparison of Brown Midrib Sorghum-Sudangrass with Corn Silage on Lactational Performance and Nutrient Digestibility in Holstein Dairy Cows  ap. 663-672.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTotal mixed rations containing brown midrib sorghum-sudangrass silage (bmrSS) or corn silage (CS) at either 35 or 45% of dietary dry matter were fed to Holstein dairy cows to determine the effect on lactational performance and nutrient digestibility. Twelve cows were assigned to 1 of 4 diets in replicated 4 x 4 Latin squares with 21-d periods. In vitro 30-h neutral detergent fiber digestion, measured before the start of the trial, was 46.0% for CS and 58.3% for bmrSS. Dry matter intake was greatest when cows were fed the 35% CS (23.4 kg/d) and 45% CS (23.2 kg/d) diets, was least when cows were fed the 45% bmrSS diet (17.6 kg/d), and was intermediate when cows were fed the 35% bmrSS diet (20.1 kg/d). The bmrSS diets resulted in greater body weight gain per 21-d period but similar body condition scores compared with the CS diets. Yield of solids-corrected milk (SCM) was similar among the diets. Efficiency (SCM:dry matter intake) was 28% greater for cows fed the bmrSS than those fed the CS diets. In vivo digestibilities of organic matter and crude protein were greater for the CS diets than the bmrSS diets, but total tract digestibilities of neutral detergent fiber and starch were similar among diets. Ruminal pH was greater when cows were fed the 45% bmrSS diet (6.58), was least when cows were fed the 35% CS (6.10) and 45% CS diets (6.13), and was intermediate when cows were fed the 35% bmrSS diet (6.42). The ratio of acetate to propionate was greater for the bmrSS diets (2.77) than for the CS diets (2.41), with no difference among diets in total volatile fatty acid concentrations (122 mM). In conclusion, cows fed bmrSS had greater efficiency of SCM production, higher ruminal pH, and greater acetate to propionate ratios than cows fed CS. With these diets fed in a short-term study, bmrSS appeared to be an effective alternative to the CS hybrid when fed at either 35 or 45% of dietary dry matter. 3acow feeding 3adairy cows 3asorghum silage 3aneutral detergent fiber 3alactation 3acorn silage 3aliveweight gain 3aHolstein 3apH 3arumen fermentation 3adigestibility 3anutrients 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aEating 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aMilkxchemistryxcytologyxsecretion. 2aRandom Allocation 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSilage 2aSorghum 2aZea mays 0abrown midrib sorghum-sudangrass 0aanimal performance1 aGrant, R.J.1 aCotanch, K.W.1 aThomas, Ed.1 aBallard, C.S.1 aRice, R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2008 Feb., v. 91, no. 2 p.663-672dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2007-05213Available from publisher's Web site  a20080528b20080606c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/05/06  aOther US 7aarticle02232naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245008700167300001600254500002400270520129600294650002501590650001501615650001401630650001901644650001601663650002101679700001501700700002001715773012601735852000901861856004801870655001201918IND4393934220221121151854.0070812e199705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439393422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-997-0179-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLampi, Anna-Maija10aAntioxidant activity of minor amounts of Î³-tocopherol in natural triacylglycerols  ap. 549-555.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of minor amounts of Î³-tocopherol on the oxidation of natural triacylglycerols (TAG) of rapeseed (RO) and butter oils (BO) were studied. Four different TAG materials were blended from chromatographically purified TAG that contained 100-25% of RO TAG. The RO TAG contained from <1 to 43 Î¼g Î³-tocopherol per gram of TAG, which corresponded to <=6% of the total tocopherols in the original RO. The TAG were held at 40Â°C in the dark for 4 wk and followed at regular intervals by measurements of hydroperoxide formation by peroxide values and of secondary product formation by p-anisidine values at regular intervals. In all TAG, minor amounts of Î³-tocopherol retarded oxidation. In RO TAG, concentrations as low as 11 Î¼g/g of Î³-tocopherol (1.5% of the total tocopherols in the original RO) were enough to decrease hydroperoxide and secondary product formation to 46 and 39%, respectively. The effect was even more important in TAG mixtures that contained BO TAG. There were no significant differences between oxidation of the RO TAG at 24 Î¼g/g, the 75% RO TAG mixture at 11 Î¼g/g, and the 50% RO TAG mixture at 3 Î¼g/g of Î³-tocopherol. Even at these minor levels, Î³-tocopherol was a significant antioxidant, which is important in oxidation studies of purified model systems. 3aantioxidant activity 3abutter oil 3aoxidation 3aperoxide value 3atocopherols 3atriacylglycerols1 aHopia, Anu1 aPiironen, Vieno0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g1997 May, v. 74, no. 5 p.549-555dSpringer-Verlagw36205x0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-997-0179-9 7aarticle02445naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002000138245008500158300001800243500002400261500001500285520118300300650001201483650003201495650002001527650002101547650001801568650001301586650001201599650001101611650001401622650002201636650001201658650001501670650001501685653001001700700002401710700002001734700001801754700002501772773011501797852000901912856007801921655001201999IND4448764720221121123734.0110204e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444876472DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/erq4012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHikosaka, Kouki10aEffects of elevated COâ concentration on seed production in Câ annual plants  ap. 1523-1530.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe response of seed production to COâ concentration ([COâ]) is known to vary considerably among Câ annual species. Here we analyse the interspecific variation in COâ responses of seed production per plant with particular attention to nitrogen use. Provided that seed production is limited by nitrogen availability, an increase in seed mass per plant results from increase in seed nitrogen per plant and/or from decrease in seed nitrogen concentration ([N]). Meta-analysis reveals that the increase in seed mass per plant under elevated [COâ] is mainly due to increase in seed nitrogen per plant rather than seed [N] dilution. Nitrogen-fixing legumes enhanced nitrogen acquisition more than non-nitrogen-fixers, resulting in a large increase in seed mass per plant. In Poaceae, an increase in seed mass per plant was also caused by a decrease in seed [N]. Greater carbon allocation to albumen (endosperm and/or perisperm) than the embryo may account for [N] reduction in grass seeds. These differences in COâ response of seed production among functional groups may affect their fitness, leading to changes in species composition in the future high-[COâ] ecosystem. 3aannuals 3aconcentration of production 3acrop production 3anitrogen content 3ameta-analysis 3anitrogen 3aPoaceae 3acarbon 3aendosperm 3aspecies diversity 3alegumes 3aecosystems 3agrass seed 0aseeds1 aKinugasa, Toshihiko1 aOikawa, Shimpei1 aOnoda, Yusuke1 aHirose, T.q(Tadaki)0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2011 Feb., v. 62, no. 4 p.1523-1530dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq4013Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02804naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100001400164245011300178300001600291500002400307520141000331650002101741650002201762650002101784650002101805650002001826650002301846650001201869650002401881650001901905653002701924653001501951653002401966700001201990700001302002700001402015700001602029700001502045773009802060852000902158856008602167930003302253945002502286946001102311655001202322IND4406962020221121091929.0080620e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440696202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2007.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aPan, J.Q.10aReduced PKC expression in pulmonary arterioles of broiler chickens is associated with early feed restriction  ap. 434-439.  aIncludes references  aObjective: The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of early feed restriction on protein kinase C (PKC) expression in pulmonary arterioles, which has been revealed to promote pulmonary vascular remodeling in pulmonary hypertensive broilers. Methods: A total of 270 day-old mixed sex commercial broilers were randomly distributed to a normal temperature control group (NT), a low temperature control group (LT) and a low temperature plus feed restriction group (LR). The PHS incidence, the right/total ventricular weight ratio (RV/TV), the vessel wall area/vessel total area ratio (WA/TA), the mean media thickness in pulmonary arterioles (mMTPA) and the expression of PKC in the pulmonary arterioles were measured weekly. Results: Low temperature treatment significantly increased the PHS mortality. The RV/TV, WA/TA and mMTPA values of group LT were significantly elevated compared with those of group NT on d 35 and 42. The LT chickens had increased PKC expression compared with their NT counterparts on d 28 and afterwards. Feed restriction reduced the PHS mortality, RV/TV, WA/TA and mMTPA in cold-exposed broilers. The LR chickens had much lower PKC expression in pulmonary arterioles than the LT chickens. Conclusion: Early time feed restriction inhibited pulmonary vascular remodeling in broilers, which might be partly attributed to reduced PKC expression in pulmonary arterioles. 3abroiler chickens 3aprotein synthesis 3aprotein kinase C 3apulmonary artery 3abroiler feeding 3arestricted feeding 3aascites 3asignal transduction 3acold tolerance 0aprotein kinase C alpha 0aarterioles 0avascular remodeling1 aTan, X.1 aLi, J.C.1 aSun, W.D.1 aHuang, G.Q.1 aWang, X.L.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2008 June, v. 84, no. 3 p.434-439dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2007.06.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20081001b20081011c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/09/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02607naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100001900183245009600202300001600298500002400314500001500338520085400353650002301207650001801230650002401248650001201272650001601284650002601300650001001326650001501336650001401351650001201365650001601377650001101393650002401404650005001428650002501478650004201503650002201545650001001567650003801577653001501615653002101630700001501651700001401666700001701680700001801697700001601715773009801731852000901829856008601838930003301924945002501957946001101982655001201993IND4406962620221121091906.0080620e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440696262DNAL7 a177091232pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2007.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL8101 aGiammarino, A.10aInfluence of mycotoxins on spontaneous contraction in myometrial strips of prepubertal lamb  ap. 471-476.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of mycotoxin zearalenone and their major metabolites - and Î²-zearalenol on spontaneous contractions in isolated lamb uterine smooth muscle were examined. The study was carried out on 20 female prepubertal lambs aged between 45 and 50 days. Myometrial strips were set up in two isolated organ baths (10 ml) at 37 Â°C and were exposed to increasing concentrations (10-11 M-10-6 M) of these mycoestrogens and results were compared with the effect, at the same concentrations, of natural estrogen 17Î²-estradiol. Our findings suggest that mycotoxins and 17Î²-estradiol, at nanomolar concentrations, rapidly enhance phasic spontaneous smooth muscle contraction. In particular, zearalenone increases the uterine activity similarly to 17Î²-estradiol. On the contrary, its metabolite -zearalenol significantly inhibits myometrial contractility. 3amuscle contraction 3asmooth muscle 3aanimal reproduction 3apuberty 3azearalenone 3aestrogenic properties 3alambs 3amyometrium 3aestradiol 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aFemale 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMuscle Contractionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMycotoxinsxtoxicity 2aMyometriumxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSexual Maturation 2aSheep 2aUterusxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0amycotoxins 0a17beta-estradiol1 aManera, M.1 aRobbe, D.1 aPerugini, M.1 aMinervini, F.1 aAmorena, M.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2008 June, v. 84, no. 3 p.471-476dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2007.07.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20081001b20081011c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/09/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03096naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183072000900192100001300201245009200214300001600306500002400322500001500346520128000361650002601641650001601667650001801683650001701701650001801718650001601736650000901752650001101761650001901772650001801791650002401809650002401833650001001857650001501867650002101882650001501903650001001918650001201928650000901940650003301949650001101982650000901993650002102002651001302023653003302036653002002069700001502089700001902104700001602123700002002139773008702159852000902246856008602255930003302341945002502374946001102399655001202410IND4406965320221121065205.0080620e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440696532DNAL7 a175748852pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL800 0aX100 0aL8401 aLobo, L.10aTransthoracic echocardiography in Estrela Mountain dogs: Reference values for the breed  ap. 250-259.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOf 100 Estrela Mountain dogs, 74 were examined to obtain echocardiographic reference values for the breed.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of EGF on atrophic enteritis induced in piglets by experimental infection with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) strain Dr13. Two groups of 12 conventional, colostrum-deprived, 1-day-old, large White-Duroc cross breed piglets were inoculated orally with PEDV (3 x 10(5) 50% tissue culture infective doses), with or without EGF (10 Î¼g/kg/day, intraperitoneally once daily for 4 days after infection) and compared to 12 uninfected, untreated control piglets. PEDV + EGF piglets had less severe clinical signs than PEDV only piglets at 48 and 60 h post-infection (hpi). Histologically, the ratio of villous height:crypt depth of PEDV + EGF piglets was significantly higher than PEDV only piglets at 36 and 48 hpi. Immunohistochemistry for Ki67 demonstrated increased proliferation in intestinal crypt epithelial cells of PEDV + EGF piglets compared to PEDV only piglets at 36, 48 and 60 hpi. EGF stimulates proliferation of intestinal crypt epithelial cells and promotes recovery from atrophic enteritis in PEDV-infected piglets. 3aprotective effect 3aviral enteritis 3atissue repair 3alesions (animal) 3adiarrhea 3aepithelial cells 3aintestinal crypts 3abiochemical mechanisms 3adisease severity 3aepidermal growth factor 3apathogenesis 3aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus 3asmall intestine 3acell proliferation 3apiglets 3adisease course 2aAnimals 2aCoronavirus Infectionsxcomplicationsxveterinary. 2aEnteritisxdrug therapyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aEpidermal Growth Factorxpharmacology 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aJejunumxpathology 2aKi-67 Antigenxmetabolism 2aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus 2aRecombinant Proteins 2aSwine 0aintestinal mucosa 0aswine1 aKang, B.K.1 aKim, J.Y.1 aShin, K.S.1 aLee, C.S.1 aSong, D.S.0 tVeterinary journal.g2008 Aug., v. 177, no. 2 p.231-235dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.04.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20081001b20081011c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/09/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03453naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100001300183245010700196300001600303500002400319500001500343520136000358650002801718650001001746650001101756650001601767650002001783650002201803650002101825650002401846650002101870650002001891650002301911650001701934650002401951650002101975650002201996650001202018650002102030650002202051650002802073650000902101650001302110650001402123650003102137650001202168650003102180650001102211650003202222650003102254650000902285653001302294700001602307700001702323700001902340700001702359700001902376700001802395700001602413700001502429773008702444852000902531856008602540930003302626945002502659946001102684655001202695IND4406965820221121065243.0080620e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440696582DNAL7 a175695632pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aQ5021 aDaix, M.10aRelationship between leptin content, metabolic hormones and fat deposition in three beef cattle breeds  ap. 273-278.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the study was to determine if cattle breeds differing in their carcass characteristics also differ in the profiles of their leptin and metabolic hormones. Three breeds, Belgian Blue (BB) (n = 12), Limousin (L) (n = 12) and Aberdeen Angus (AA) (n = 12) with varying ability to deposit fat and protein were compared. Blood, muscle and subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissue were sampled. Animal performance, carcass and meat characteristics were determined as well as plasma leptin concentration, leptin gene expression in SC adipose tissue, leptin-receptor gene expression in SC adipose tissue and plasma concentration of insulin, tri-iodothyronin (T3), thyroxin (T4) and cortisol. The BB bulls showed the lowest values of leptin gene expression (P < 0.05). Values of plasma leptin concentration and of leptin-receptor gene expression tended to be lower in BB than in the other breeds. For a similar amount of adipose tissue (after normalisation), BB bulls showed a higher ratio of plasma leptin (P < 0.05), whereas normalised leptin gene and leptin-receptor gene expressions did not significantly differ between breeds. Belgian Blue bulls also differed in their metabolic hormone profile, tending to show lower values of insulin, T3 and T4 than the two other breeds. Cortisol levels were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in BB than in L and AA animals. 3acarcass characteristics 3aAngus 3aleptin 3abeef cattle 3atissue analysis 3alipid composition 3ameat composition 3atissue distribution 3athyroid hormones 3agene expression 3aprotein metabolism 3aBelgian Blue 3aprotein composition 3asubcutaneous fat 3ahormone secretion 3ainsulin 3alipid metabolism 3abreed differences 3aLimousin (cattle breed) 3abeef 3acortisol 3alean meat 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxgenetics 2aCattle 2aEnergy Metabolismxgenetics 2aLeptinxbloodxmetabolism. 2aMale 0abody fat1 aPirotte, C.1 aBister, J.L.1 aWergifosse, F.1 aCuvelier, C.1 aCabaraux, J.F.1 aKirschvink, N1 aIstasse, L.1 aPaquay, R.0 tVeterinary journal.g2008 Aug., v. 177, no. 2 p.273-278dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.04.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20081001b20081011c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/09/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02826naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245007200167300001600239500002400255520174700279650001702026650001602043653002102059653001402080653002702094700002002121700002102141700002002162700002402182773012502206852000902331856009202340930003302432946001102465655001202476IND4406973120221121065307.0080620e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440697312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2008.01014.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aREX, KATJA10aSpecies richness and structure of three Neotropical bat assemblages  ap. 617-629.  aIncludes references  aWe compared the assemblages of phyllostomid bats in three Neotropical rainforests with respect to species richness and assemblage structure and suggested a method to validate estimates of species richness for Neotropical bat assemblages based on mist-netting data. The fully inventoried bat assemblage at La Selva Biological Station (LS, 100 m elevation) in Costa Rica was used as a reference site to evaluate seven estimators of species richness. The Jackknife 2 method agreed best with the known bat species richness and thus was used to extrapolate species richness for an Amazonian bat assemblage (Tiputini Biodiversity Station; TBS, 200 m elevation) and an Andean premontane bat assemblage (Podocarpus National Park; BOM, 1000 m elevation) in Ecuador. Our results suggest that more than 100 bat species occur sympatrically at TBS and about 50 bat species coexist at BOM. TBS harbours one of the most species-rich bat assemblages known, including a highly diverse phyllostomid assemblage. Furthermore, we related assemblage structure to large-scale geographical patterns in floral diversity obtained from botanical literature. Assemblage structure of these three phyllostomid assemblages was influenced by differences in floral diversity at the three sites. At the Andean site, where understorey shrubs and epiphytes exhibit the highest diversity, the phyllostomid assemblage is mainly composed of understorey frugivores and nectarivorous species. By contrast, canopy frugivores are most abundant at the Amazonian site, coinciding with the high abundance of canopy fruiting trees. Assemblage patterns of other taxonomic groups also may reflect the geographical distribution patterns of floral elements in the Andean and Amazonian regions. 3abiodiversity 3ainventories 0afloral diversity 0ajackknife 0ataxonomic distinctness1 aKELM, DETLEV H.1 aWIESNER, KERSTIN1 aKunz, Thomas H.1 aVoigt, Christian C.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2008 July, v. 94, no. 3 p.617-629dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2008.01014.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080620b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02388naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001100138245016600149300001600315520103200331650002401363650002001387650003801407650002201445650003301467650000901500650001901509650001901528650002001547650002001567650001101587650001301598650002001611700001701631700001801648700002701666773014001693852000901833856007801842939003301920946001301953655001201966IND4457975220221121055635.0110513e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445797522DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.222582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, An14aThe effect of heat treatment on water sorption in polylactide and polylactide composites via changes in glass-transition temperature and crystallization kinetics  ap. 873-881.  aWater sorption into polylactide (PLA) and polylactide-montmorillonite (PLLA-MONT) composites containing 5 wt % of montmorillonite (MONT) under different heat treatment conditions was studied using the quartz crystal microbalance/heat conduction calorimetry (QCM/HCC) technique. Results showed that water sorption in neat polymer films and composite films increased with heat treatment temperature up to 120 Â°C. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to measure the glass-transition temperature and isothermal crystallization kinetics of all samples. The mobility of the amorphous domain in all samples increased with heat treatment temperature, indicated by the decrease in glass-transition temperature. PLA composites crystallized at a much faster rate than neat PLA did because MONT acted as a nucleating agent. Under the same heat treatment condition, water sorption in PLLA-MONT composites was always higher than that in neat PLA due to the presence of the hydrophilic hydroxyl groups on the surface of MONT particles. 3acomposite materials 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afilms (materials) 3aglass transition temperature 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ahydrophilicity 3amontmorillonite 3apolylactic acid 3aquartz 3asorption 3awater treatment1 aKoo, Donghun1 aZiegler, Mary1 aCairncross, Richard A.0 tJournal of polymer science.g2011 June 15, v. 49, no. 12 p.873-881dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.222583Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110513  aOther US 7aarticle02786naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100001400154245008800168300001600256500002400272500001500296520146600311650001501777650001401792650001601806650001601822650001901838650001801857650001601875650000901891650001301900650001901913650001401932650002001946650002201966653002501988653001502013700001502028773011002043852000902153856008502162930003302247945002502280946001102305655001202316IND4406958120221121044630.0080620e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440695812DNAL7 a10.1017/S00220299080032452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aKoess, C.10aDetection of mastitis in the bovine mammary gland by flow cytometry at early stages  ap. 225-232.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSubclinical mastitis is a costly disease and its diagnosis is difficult. Besides the somatic cell count (SCC) and bacteriology, the differential inflammatory cell count (DICC) is a meaningful tool for mastitis detection. As microscopy is very subjective because of the low number of events to be counted, flow cytometry has often been proposed for the differentiation of milk cells. The objective of this study was to determine whether it is possible to identify subclinical mastitis in cattle at an early stage by a simple and fast flow cytometric method. The aim was to identify the main leucocyte populations in flow cytometric dotplots (polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), lymphocytes and macrophages) and, with these, to elaborate a method of mastitis prognostics. Milk from 15 German Holstein cows was sampled in cross-sectional studies and SCC determined. After preparation, the milk cells were incubated with different specific antibodies that bind to different cell types and also to propidium iodide (PI), which differs between viable and non-viable cells. This procedure made it possible to localize cell types in a flow cytometric dot plot and to differentiate between viable and non-viable PMN. Percentages of viable PMN can be determined by a procedure consisting of a simple centrifugation, incubation with PI, and flow cytometric measurement. So it is possible to quickly determine the stage of the inflammation even in quarters with a low SCC. 3adairy cows 3aviability 3alymphocytes 3amacrophages 3aflow cytometry 3arapid methods 3aneutrophils 3amilk 3aHolstein 3amammary glands 3adetection 3abovine mastitis 3adisease diagnosis 0asubclinical mastitis 0aleukocytes1 aHamann, J.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2008 May, v. 75, no. 2 p.225-232dCambridge University Pressx0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299080032453Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/07/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02378naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001900172245011100191300001600302500002400318500001500342520098400357650002201341650001701363650002501380650002701405650002401432650002801456650001101484650001701495650000901512651001201521653001501533653002501548700001401573700001501587700002101602773011001623852000901733856008501742930003301827945002501860946001101885655001201896IND4406959220221121032834.0080620e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440695922DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797080063392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aJ500 0aF1101 aMelteras, M.V.10aCrop development and root distribution in lesser yam (Dioscorea esculenta): implications for fertilization  ap. 209-221.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA growth analysis study involving monthly excavation of Dioscorea esculenta plants revealed that the root system developed fully in the period before tuber initiation, and extended radially for a distance between 2.3 and 4.3 m. Primary roots initially remained in the top 10 cm of the soil profile, but descended to approximately 30 cm near their full extension. Tuber number increased from initiation around 21 weeks after planting (WAP) until maximum vine growth was reached around 33 WAP, but tuber dry weight continued to increase throughout the senescence period of the vine, to 45 WAP. Tubers lost dry matter but not fresh weight during dormancy in the soil, to 55 WAP. The results indicate that a distance of at least 4.5 m is required to separate experimental fertilizer treatments, and that post-establishment burial of fertilizers around the mound or ridge risks damage to roots near their base, while inter-row application is accessible to roots and may be preferable. 3aplant development 3aroot systems 3aspatial distribution 3afertilizer application 3aDioscorea esculenta 3adry matter accumulation 3atubers 3aplant damage 3ayams 3aVanuatu 0asenescence 0ainterrow application1 aLebot, V.1 aAsher, C.J1 aO'Sullivan, J.N.0 tExperimental agriculture.g2008 Apr., v. 44, no. 2 p.209-221dCambridge University Pressx0014-47977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797080063393Available from publisher's Web site  a20080709b20080801c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/07/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03806naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001700191245014700208300001600355500002400371500001500395520161400410650002602024650001102050650001902061650002302080650001802103650001302121650002302134650001202157650000902169650002602178650002302204650002002227650002002247650001502267650000902282650001802291650000902309650001802318650001402336650003702350650001602387650004702403650001202450650003502462650001102497650000902508650002402517650001002541650000902551650000902560650000902569650001702578653002102595653003402616700002002650700002102670700002202691700002102713700001702734773011002751852000902861856008502870930003302955945002502988946001103013655001203024IND4406957020221121032900.0080620e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440695702DNAL7 a184741312pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299080031782doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aNestares, T.10aCalcium-enriched goats' milk aids recovery of iron status better than calcium-enriched cows' milk, in rats with nutritional ferropenic anaemia  ap. 153-159.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCa-Fe interactions are known, but no studies are available about the effects of Ca-enriched goat or cow milk on Fe status in nutritional ferropenic anaemia (NFA).

The apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) and the Fe retention/intake (R/I) ratio were higher in control and anaemic rats fed goat milk diet (G diet), despite high-Ca content. Ca enrichment decreased Fe stores in liver and sternum in anaemic rats fed cow milk diet (C diet), however G diet did not modify Fe content in the organs studied in control and anaemic rats. In anaemic rats, Ca-supplementation decreased haematocrit, but platelets and serum Fe were not affected, however, in control rats platelets increased except for Ca-enriched G diet, this fact reveals that Ca-Fe interaction is minimized with G diet. Serum ferritin was always higher in rats fed G vs. C diet, both in control and anaemic rats fed either normal or Ca-enriched diets. Ca-supplementation decreased ferritin levels in control and anaemic rats fed C diet and also, though to a lesser extent, in those given the G diet. This indicates that with this G diet there is a better recovery of body Fe stores in anaemic rats, despite Ca-supplementation. In this study it is noteworthy that despite high Ca content, a goat milk diet resulted in minimal Ca-Fe interactions and did not adversely affect Fe status in rats with NFA. 3adiet-related diseases 3aanemia 3ahuman diseases 3anutritional status 3adose response 3aferritin 3afood fortification 3acalcium 3airon 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient retention 3ahuman nutrition 3ablood platelets 3ahematocrit 3amilk 3aanimal models 3arats 3adigestibility 3agoat milk 2aAnemia, Iron-Deficiencyxtherapy 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCattle 2aDiet 2aDietary Supplements 2aGoats 2aMale 2aMilk 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 0aanemia (disease) 0anutritional ferropenic anemia1 aBarrionuevo, M.1 aDÃ­az-Castro, J.1 aLÃ³pez-Aliaga, I.1 aAlfÃ©rez, M.J.M.1 aCampos, M.S.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2008 May, v. 75, no. 2 p.153-159dCambridge University Pressx0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299080031783Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/07/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03168naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100001600174245008500190300001600275500002400291520135900315650001201674650002001686650000901706650001001715650001701725650002401742650001401766650001601780650002501796650001201821650004601833650004601879650002301925650003801948650002401986650003802010650001802048650002402066650003202090650002102122651001002143651001002153700001902163700001602182700001802198700001602216700001702232700001402249700001702263773009802280852000902378856008602387930003302473945002502506946001102531655001202542IND4406961420221121032938.0080620e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440696142DNAL7 a175927382pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2007.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8231 aRinaldi, L.10aGiardia and Cryptosporidium in canine faecal samples contaminating an urban area  ap. 413-415.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of the present paper was to continue the study on the presence of parasitic elements in the canine faeces contaminating the urban environment of Naples (southern Italy), focussing on the protozoa Giardia and Cryptosporidium. The total number of sub-areas studied was 143, and the total number of canine faecal samples collected and examined was 415. Each faecal sample was tested for the presence of copro-antigens of Giardia and Cryptosporidium using two commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Giardia antigens were found in 19.6% (28/143) of the sub-areas and in 7.7% (32/415) of the canine faeces collected. Cryptosporidium antigens were found in 4.2% (6/143) of the sub-areas and in 1.7% (7/415) of the canine faeces collected. Co-infection was not found in any sample. The results of the logistic regression models did not show any association between the positivity to Giardia or Cryptosporidium and the independent demographic variables (human population density, male and female population density) taken into consideration. In conclusion, the findings of the present study revealed the presence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium in canine faecal samples from the urban environment of Naples; however, the zoonotic potential of these findings was not assessed due to the lack of information on species/genotypes detected. 3aGiardia 3aCryptosporidium 3adogs 3afeces 3adog diseases 3amicrobial detection 3apollution 3aurban areas 3adisease surveillance 2aAnimals 2aCryptosporidiumxisolation & purification 2aDog Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aDogsxparasitology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aGiardiaxisolation & purification 2aPublic Health 2aRegression Analysis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aUrban Population 3aItaly 0aItaly1 aMaurelli, M.P.1 aMusella, V.1 aVeneziano, V.1 aCarbone, S.1 aDi Sarno, A.1 aPaone, M.1 aCringoli, G.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2008 June, v. 84, no. 3 p.413-415dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2007.05.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20081001b20081011c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/09/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03220naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002100172245007800193300001600271500002400287520202900311650002002340650000902360650001002369650002502379650001402404650002402418650002702442650002002469650001202489650003602501773011002537852000902647856008502656930003302741945002502774946001102799655001202810IND4406959320221121032853.0080620e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440695932DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797080061692doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF500 0aJ5001 aO'Sullivan, J.N.10aRoot distribution of Yam (Dioscorea alata) determined by Strontium tracer  ap. 223-233.  aIncludes references  aStrontium was used as a tracer to detect root activity of yam (Dioscorea alata) at distances from 0.5 to 5.5 m from the plant's crown, and at depths of 7, 15, 25 and 40 cm, in field plantings separated by plastic root barriers. Tracer bands were installed at planting, and leaves were sampled at intervals throughout the growing season. Background Sr concentrations in leaves were found to be closely related to leaf Ca concentrations, allowing the expected background Sr to be calculated from the Ca concentration in each sample. The ratio of observed to expected Sr did not alter significantly with time of sampling or leaf age for control plants providing a robust parameter for comparison across harvests. Plants at all horizontal distances from the Sr placement up to 5.5 m showed significant elevation of leaf Sr by 13 weeks after planting (WAP). The depth placement at 15 cm showed earliest Sr elevation, followed by the 7 cm placement. However, both 25 cm and 40 cm placements resulted in significant leaf Sr elevation by 13 WAP, and their final Sr concentrations at 27 WAP did not differ significantly from those of shallower placements. Three fertilizer placement options were compared with respect to Sr uptake by the treated plants and by those in adjacent rows. Placement in a ring around the crown of the seed sett resulted in high leaf Sr concentration at 5 WAP, declining considerably at subsequent samplings. Placement underneath the seed sett produced a similar pattern but at lower concentrations. Banding midway between the plant rows, 0.5 m from plants, yielded a small increase at 5 WAP increasing to 13 WAP, and ultimately attaining similar concentrations to the other two placements. Plants in adjacent rows significantly accessed all three placements by 13 WAP. The results indicate greater reach of yam roots, both horizontally and vertically, than has been previously reported, and raise concerns about the adequacy of treatment separation in previously published fertilizer experiments with yams. 3aDioscorea alata 3ayams 3aroots 3aspatial distribution 3astrontium 3alabeling techniques 3afertilizer application 3anutrient uptake 3acalcium 3achemical constituents of plants0 tExperimental agriculture.g2008 Apr., v. 44, no. 2 p.223-233dCambridge University Pressx0014-47977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797080061693Available from publisher's Web site  a20080712b20080801c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/07/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02560naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100001400183245010400197300001600301500002400317500001500341520089000356650002601246650002301272650002101295650001301316650000901329650002601338650001601364650000901380650001201389650001701401650001201418650001601430650002101446650002501467650003101492650001101523650002501534650002301559650002401582653003201606653002101638653001601659700001401675700001901689773009801708852000901806856008601815930003301901945002501934946001101959655001201970IND4406959620221121033028.0080620e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440695962DNAL7 a176639962pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2007.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL8001 aTuran, E.14aThe elecrophysiological bulbocavernosus reflex test in female dogs: Its technique and applicability  ap. 321-325.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe intent of the study was to clarify the technique and the application of the electrophysiological bulbocavernosus reflex (EBCR) test in healthy female dogs. For this aim, 15 healthy female dogs were used in the study. The stimulations were made on the clitoris and the responses were recorded from the right side of the external anal sphincter muscle with a concentric needle recording electrode. The EBCR had response latencies between 18.99 and 25.69 ms with the mean value of 22.26 ms. The EBCR reflex test is not yet widely used for the evaluation of the functional integrity of sacral spinal cord segments and nerve roots in veterinary clinics. Our experiences indicated that the EBCR reflex test gives valuable data about sacral spinal reflex arc functionality and can be accepted as a routine diagnostic method in small animal clinics for evaluation of the sacral reflex arc. 3adiagnostic techniques 3amuscle contraction 3afemale genitalia 3areflexes 3adogs 3asmall animal practice 3aspinal cord 3aanus 3afemales 3asacral spine 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aDogsxphysiology 2aElectric Stimulation 2aElectrophysiologyxmethods 2aFemale 2aPerineumxphysiology 2aReflexxphysiology 2aTendonsxphysiology 0abulbocavernosus reflex test 0aelecrophysiology 0amethodology1 aUnsal, C.1 aYildirim, I.G.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2008 June, v. 84, no. 3 p.321-325dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2007.05.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20081001b20081011c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/09/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02940naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245026600201300001800467500002400485506007600509520130900585506003701894650000801931650002501939650001801964650002001982650002802002650002602030650002702056650002102083650001102104650002102115650002602136700001602162700001802178700002002196700001902216700002102235773013702256852000902393856008002402655001202482IND4411655320221207061008.0081017e20081015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441165532DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02155-072doi7 aPMC25702962pmcid7 a187575752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShinzato, Naoya10aSpecific DNA Binding of a Potential Transcriptional Regulator, Inosine 5'-Monophosphate Dehydrogenase-Related Protein VII, to the Promoter Region of a Methyl Coenzyme M Reductase I-Encoding Operon Retrieved from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus Strain ÎH  ap. 6239-6247.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo methyl coenzyme M reductases (MCRs) encoded by the mcr and mrt operons of the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus ÎH are expressed in response to Hâ availability. In the present study, cis elements and trans-acting factors responsible for the gene expression of MCRs were investigated by using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and affinity particle purification. A survey of their operator regions by EMSA with protein extracts from mrt-expressing cultures restricted them to 46- and 41-bp-long mcr and mrt upstream regions, respectively. Affinity particle purification of DNA-binding proteins conjugated with putative operator regions resulted in the retrieval of a protein attributed to IMP dehydrogenase-related protein VII (IMPDH VII). IMPDH VII is predicted to have a winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and two cystathionine Î²-synthase domains, and it has been suspected to be an energy-sensing module. EMSA with oligonucleotide probes with unusual sequences showed that the binding site of IMPDH VII mostly overlaps the factor B-responsible element-TATA box of the mcr operon. The results presented here suggest that IMPDH VII encoded by MTH126 is a plausible candidate for the transcriptional regulator of the mcr operon in this methanogen.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA-binding proteins 3abinding sites 3agene expression 3ahelix-turn-helix motifs 3ainosine monophosphate 3aoligonucleotide probes 3aoperator regions 3aoperon 3apromoter regions 3atranscription factors1 aEnoki, Miho1 aSato, Hiroaki1 aNakamura, Kohei1 aMatsui, TÅru.1 aKamagata, Yoichi0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Oct. 15, v. 74, no. 20 p.6239-6247dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02155-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01929naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001400154245011600168300001600284500002400300520080400324650002401128650001301152650002501165650001201190650002101202650001001223650001901233651001001252651001201262700001801274700001801292700001501310700001601325773014801341852000901489856005701498655001201555IND4456241620221121001958.0110408e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445624162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1989.tb01220.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTÃ³th, M.10aIdentification of four components from the female sex pheromone of the lima-bean pod borer, Etiella zinckenella  ap. 107-112.  aIncludes references  aFour compounds, tetradecyl acetate, (Z)-9-tetradecenyl acetate, (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate and (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate were identified from female sex pheromone extracts of Hungarian and Egyptian lima-bean pod borers (Etiella zinckenella Tr., Lepidoptera: Phycitidae) by gas chromatography with flame ionization (FID) and electroantennographic (EAD) detection.

Using the Ac element and several bacterial and plant marker genes, we have devised a versatile system for identifying plants in which a transposon has excised and reinserted elsewhere in the genome. The transposons have been designed to facilitate the identification of insertions downstream of promoters and in the vicinity of enhancers by the inclusion of a Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) gene either lacking a promoter or having a minimal promoter sequence. The system permits the transposon and the source of transposase to be maintained either stably in separate plants or in the same plant. Plants in which transposition is occurring can be identified by the frequent somatic activation of the GUS gene. The herbicide chlorsulfuron is used as a selective agent to identify progeny plants in which the transposon has excised from its original insertion site within a chlorsulfuron-resistant acetolactate synthase gene. Additional selectable markers permit the identification of plants containing a transposed element, but lacking transposase. Here we describe our initial characterization of the system and demonstrate its reliability and efficiency in identifying plants with transposed elements. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aacetolactate synthase 3achlorsulfuron 3acorn 3agene activation 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aplant development 3aplant taxonomy 3apromoter regions 3atransposons1 aSmith, David L.0 tplant journal.g1993 Feb., v. 3, no. 2 p.273-289dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw43419x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.1993.tb00178.x 7aarticle02613naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245010100167300001600268500002400284500001500308520136500323650002201688650002501710650002301735650001301758650002001771650001001791650001601801650002301817650001001840650001701850650001501867650002001882650002201902650001001924653002501934700001501959700001701974700001501991773009702006852000902103856005502112655001202167IND4459825620221120145818.0110708e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445982562DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00859.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSANS, F.X.10aTillage effects on weed communities in an organic winter wheat-sunflower-spelt cropping sequence  ap. 413-421.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aConservation tillage could provide environmental benefits to organic farming. However, potential weed problems often tend to discourage farmers from adopting it. The effects of tillage (reduced vs. conventional), fertilisation (slurry vs. manure compost) and the application of biodynamic preparations (with and without) on crop yield and on weed cover, diversity and biological attributes were investigated in a cropping sequence of wheat, sunflower and spelt. Total weed cover and perennial cover in reduced tillage treatments were two to three times greater than in conventional treatments. Monocotyledon cover in reduced tillage was three times that in conventional tillage in spelt, whereas the dicotyledon Stellaria media dominated in sunflower. Weed diversity was similar across treatments, regardless of cereal crop, whereas lower diversity values were observed with reduced tillage in sunflower, because of the dominance of S. media. There was virtually no effect of fertilisation and biodynamic preparations on weed parameters. Although wheat and spelt yield decreased in reduced tillage plots (14% and 8% respectively), the sunflower grain yield was unaffected. Reduced tillage could thus be useful in organic cropping systems but would require proper management of perennial and monocotyledonous weeds, which are often problematic for annual crops. 3aHelianthus annuus 3aconventional tillage 3aecosystem services 3acomposts 3areduced tillage 3awheat 3agrain yield 3aorganic production 3aweeds 3abiodiversity 3aLiliopsida 3aStellaria media 3acropping sequence 3acrops 0aconservation tillage1 aBERNER, A.1 aARMENGOT, L.1 aMÃDER, P.0 tWeed research.g2011 Aug., v. 51, no. 4 p.413-421dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0043-17377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00859.x 7aarticle01766naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245005400130300001400184500034300198500001500541520051700556650001601073650002501089650002501114653002701139653002001166653001701186653001201203700001701215773013001232852000901362930003301371945001301404946001101417655001201428IND2197943120221120145625.0990402e199809  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219794312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFulginiti, L.E.10aAgricultural productivity in developing countries  ap. 45-51.  aIn the special issue: Agricultural growth, poverty and the environment.

In agroforestry systems farmers use trees in this manner by deliberately combining them with agricultural crops on the same unit of land. Although advocates of agroforestry have asserted that soil conservation is one of its primary benefits, empirical estimates of these benefits have been lacking due to temporal and spatial complexity of agroforestry systems and the nonmarket aspect of soil capital assets. This study designs and applies a bio-economic framework for valuing the soil conservation benefits of agroforestry. The framework is tested with econometric analysis of data from surveys of households in Eastern Visayas, Philippines, where USAID/Government of Philippines introduced contour hedgerow agroforestry in 1983. By constructing a weighted soil quality index that also incorporates measures of soil fertility, texture and color in addition to erosion, we extend previous economic studies of soil resources. This index is regressed on a variety of farming and site specific bio-physical variables. Next, we use a Cobb-Douglas profit function to directly relate agricultural profits and soil quality. Thus, the value of soil conservation is measured as a quasi-rent differential or the share of producer surplus associated with a change in soil quality. Because this framework assumes the existence of markets, the assumption is tested by analysing the statistical significance of consumption side variables, e.g., number of household members, on production side variables, e.g., profits. Instrumental variables are used to handle the endogeneity of the soil index in the profit equation. Seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) analysis is used to accommodate correlation of errors across the soil and profit equations. Regression results reveal the importance of agroforestry intensity, private ownership, land fragmentation, and familiarity with soil conservation as positive covariates of soil quality. Analysis of production data indicate the importance of market prices, education, farming experience, farm size, topography, and soil quality as positive covariates of household profits. Investments in agroforestry to improve or maintain soil capital can increased annual agricultural profits by US$53 for the typical household, which is 6% of total income. However, there are significant up-front costs. Given that small farmers in tropical uplands are important players in the management of deteriorating soil and forest resources, policy makers may want to consider supporting farmers in the early years of agroforestry adoption. 3aagriculture 3aproduction economics 3aagroforestry 3asoil conservation 3aland use 3aeconometric models 3ahousehold surveys 3asoil fertility 3asoil texture 3asoil erosion 3aregression analysis 3afarm management 3ainnovation adoption 3aequations 3asoil quality 3aPhilippines 0aprofit functions 0acobb-douglas functions 0ahedgerow trees 0anon-market benefits 0aseemingly unrelated regression analysis1 aMercer, D.E.0 tAgricultural economics.g1998 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.31-46aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02411naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245010500123300001600228500001500244520120000259650002201459650002501481650002901506650002601535650002401561650002501585650001601610650002001626651001801646651001101664651001001675653001001685653002601695653004101721653001901762653001101781773013101792852000901923930003301932945001301965946001101978655001201989IND2163831920221120134521.0980903e199712  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216383192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Z.10aChina and Taiwan access to the World Trade Organization: implications for U.S. agriculture and trade  ap. 239-264.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper investigates the impact of China's and Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on U.S. and world agricultural trade by means of a 12-region, 14-sector Computable General Equilibrium model for world trade and production. The simulation results show that integrating China and Taiwan into the global trading system could induce more competition on labor-intensive products and reduce their prices. It could drive up the demand for capital and skill-intensive manufactured goods, thus further improving industrial countries' terms of trade. The expansion of labor-intensive sectors in China could also induce contraction in agricultural exports from China and increase its net agricultural imports by as much as US$9 billion annually, causing food and agricultural exports from other regions to increase. Total U.S. food and agricultural exports could increase by about US$2.4 billion annually, with the non-grain crop sectors gaining the most. The biggest winner from China's WTO accession is China itself. WTO membership could bring a net welfare gain of about US$30 billion a year for China, a substantial benefit compared with the gains for the USA (US$8.5 billion). 3asimulation models 3atrade liberalization 3aWorld Trade Organization 3aagricultural products 3ainternational trade 3aproduction economics 3aagriculture 3aeconomic impact 3aUnited States 3aTaiwan 3aChina 0atrade 0afactors of production 0acomputable general equilibrium model 0aterms of trade 0aaccess0 tAgricultural economics.g1997 Dec., v. 17, no. 2/3 p.239-264aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle03417naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100001800183245009200201300001800293500002400311506007600335520128700411506003701698650002501735650002101760650001401781650002001795650001001815650001501825650001801840650001201858650001301870650001301883650003901896650004801935650003401983650002902017650003302046650002302079650003702102650003802139650001702177650002802194650002302222650004402245650003302289650002202322650004202344650001702386650003802403650002702441700003102468700002102499700001902520773010702539852000902646856008202655856003002737655001202767IND4392807820221207054144.0070701e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439280782DNAL7 a174961202pmid7 aPMC19137272pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.106.0472412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Zhaojun10aTIME FOR COFFEE Encodes a Nuclear Regulator in the Arabidopsis thaliana Circadian Clock  ap. 1522-1536.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe plant circadian clock is required for daily anticipation of the diurnal environment. Mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana TIME FOR COFFEE (TIC) affects free-running circadian rhythms. To investigate how TIC functions within the circadian system, we introduced markers for the evening and morning phases of the clock into tic and measured evident rhythms. The phases of evening clock genes in tic were all advanced under light/dark cycles without major expression level defects. With regard to morning-acting genes, we unexpectedly found that TIC has a closer relationship with LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) than with CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1, as tic has a specific LHY expression level defect. Epistasis analysis demonstrated that there were no clear rhythms in double mutants of tic and evening-acting clock genes, although double mutants of tic and morning-acting genes exhibited a similar free-running period as tic. We isolated TIC and found that its mRNA expression is continuously present over the diurnal cycle, and the encoded protein appears to be strictly localized to the nucleus. Neither its abundance nor its cellular distribution was found to be clock regulated. We suggest that TIC encodes a nucleus-acting clock regulator working close to the central oscillator.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acircadian rhythm 3aepistasis 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahypocotyls 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3amutation 3aproteins 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiological Clocksxphysiology 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aCircadian Rhythmxphysiology 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutationxgenetics 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProtein Transport 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aMillar, A.

Using a previously isolated trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor nucleotide sequence as probe, two positive BAC clones were identified. The P2B8 BAC clone, of about 135 kbp and containing the complete BBI family, was chosen and partially sequenced. Our results confirm that a small multigene family codes for three double-headed inhibitors named: tc-BBI-1, tc-BBI-2 and et-BBI. They contain the binding loop trypsin/chymotrypsin (tc-BBI-1 and tc-BBI-2) and the elastase/trypsin one (et-BBI), respectively. Genes coding for tc-BBI-1 and et-BBI, were found to be very close to each other and arranged in a head to head fashion. Southern blot hybridisation on genomic DNA digested with PstI enzyme suggests that all three genes are present in a fragment of 19 kbp. Northern blot analyses on RNA isolated from various common bean organs showed that the expression of tc-BBI-1 and et-BBI was restricted to the developing cotyledons. 3aBowman-Birk inhibitor 3aDNA 3aNorthern blotting 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aRNA 3aSouthern blotting 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3abeans 3achymotrypsin 3aclones 3acotyledons 3aelastase 3amultigene family 3atrypsin1 aPiergiovanni, Angela Rosa1 aLioi, Lucia1 aCampion, Bruno1 aBollini, Roberto1 aSparvoli, Francesca0 tMolecular breeding.g2009 May, v. 23, no. 4 p.617-624dSpringer Netherlandsx1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-009-9260-4 7aarticle02497naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245014100169300001600310500002400326520144000350650002701790650001101817650001301828650001101841650001501852650001901867650001401886650001301900650002401913651001301937700002201950773011101972852000902083856005502092655001202147IND4461171820221120134625.0110805e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446117182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2028.2011.01260.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJew, Eleanor10aSocio-demographic factors influence the attitudes of local residents towards trophy hunting activities in the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania  ap. 277-285.  aIncludes references  aWithin the Kilombero Game Controlled Area (KGCA) of Tanzania, protection is offered to large mammal populations by trophy hunting concessions that maintain natural habitat through the prevention of extensive human encroachment. The opinions of local communities to wildlife management operations such as trophy hunting play an important role in their long-term viability. This study addresses the influence of socio-demographic factors on the opinions of local communities to trophy hunting in areas that are not part of community-based management projects, which is where most research of this type has previously been conducted. Semi-structured questionnaires were conducted in 24 villages within the Kilombero Valley (fifteen interviews per village) in August-December 2007. The extent to which socio-demographic factors including location (e.g. village of residence) and individual respondent characteristics (e.g. gender and age) influenced the respondents' opinions was analysed. Of these socio-demographic factors, all, except age and district of residence, were found to influence the opinions of local residents. Socio-demographic factors play an important role in determining local communities' attitudes towards trophy hunting, and this must be taken into account during the design and assessment of wildlife management conservation strategies, both locally in the KGCA and in similar national and international initiatives. 3aattitudes and opinions 3agender 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ainterviews 3aquestionnaires 3aviability 3avillages 3awildlife management 3aTanzania1 aBonnington, Colin0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2011 Sept., v. 49, no. 3 p.277-285dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0141-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2011.01260.x 7aarticle01894naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009300128300001400221520094200235650000901177650001001186650001201196650002001208650000801228650002401236651001801260653001501278653002101293653002101314700001601335773012701351852000901478930003301487945001301520946001101533655001201544IND2202403020221120134400.0000207e199703  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220240302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdesina, A.A.10aRelative efficiency of women as farm managers: profit function analysis in Cote d'Ivoire  ap. 47-53.  aThe efficiency of women farmers in the agricultural sector of developing countries is passionately debated. Very few studies have examined this issue in African agriculture. All previous studies were based on production functions, but have been criticised as suffering from simultaneous equation bias because the input levels are endogenous. The profit function method avoids these problems. No previous study has used the profit function method to test for technical, allocative and economic efficiency differences between women and men farmers. The objective of this paper was to determine whether women rice farmers are less efficient than men rice farmers in Cote d'Ivoire using the restricted normalised profit function method. Our results show that the relative degree of efficiency of women is similar to that of men. The paper provides empirical support for efforts to eliminate bias against women farmers in African agriculture. 3arice 3awomen 3afarmers 3afarm management 3amen 3aregression analysis 3aCote d'Ivoire 0aefficiency 0afarm comparisons 0aprofit functions1 aDjato, K.K.0 tAgricultural economics.g1997 Mar., v. 16, no. 1 p.47-53aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle01862naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245014000128300001600268520077100284650002401055650002001079650001201099650001801111650002001129650002601149650001101175650001601186650001401202650002201216651001801238700001701256700002001273773012901293852000901422930003301431945001301464946001101477655001201488IND2201895820221120134433.0991208e199608  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220189582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanclos, D.K.10aAssessing the effects of tariff reform on U.S. food manufacturing industries: the role of imperfect competition and intermediate inputs  ap. 201-212.  aRecent work indicates that the joint effects of intermediate input and final output tariff reforms on equilibrium in the differentiated final products sector are analytically ambiguous. This issue is addressed empirically for disaggregate, imperfectly competitive U.S. food manufacturing industries. The input tariff effect dominates in most industries, leading to increases in the number of U.S. firms and total industry output as a result of tariff reform. This provides evidence that the existing U.S. tariff profile discriminates against domestic food manufacturers, as input tariff effects outweigh the protection offered by output tariffs. This conclusion is robust to changes in the degree of interfirm rivalry (monopolistic competition or cournot oligopoly). 3aprofits and margins 3afood processing 3atariffs 3afood industry 3aeconomic impact 3aimperfect competition 3ayields 3afood prices 3aequations 3autility functions 3aUnited States1 aHertel, T.W.1 aTÄvatÄs, CÄ.0 tAgricultural economics.g1996 Aug., v. 14, no. 3 p.201-212aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle03349naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010000127300001400227520225400241650001202495650001802507650002002525650002002545650002402565650001602589650002402605650002502629650002202654650001902676651001102695653002502706653002302731700001502754773012802769852000902897930003302906945001302939946001102952655001202963IND2200527920221120134421.0990910e199609  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220052792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamianos, D.10aUnconventional adjustment strategies for rural households in the less developed areas in Greece  ap. 61-72.  aInternational competition in agricultural production is intensifying following the implementation of the 1993 accord of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The production of conventional farm products in surplus is being discouraged by means of indirect economic disincentives. The Common Agricultural Policy has already adjusted to unprotected national markets within the European Union and greater market orientation is being achieved mainly through price reductions. Farmers in the less developed areas in Greece, where agricultural activity is still the main source of income and employment, have been responding to policy reforms by seeking part-time employment and income in non-farm enterprises. The adoption of alternative, unconventional farm enterprises that use farm resources in an innovative and quantitatively different way does have the potential for bringing in a new source of income to farm business. For the purpose of this research three adjustment strategies were recognised. The 'conventional' (no change) pathway is based on traditional, region-specific products, production methods and services. The adoption of the 'new crop' pathway refers to the redeployment of resources into new agricultural products, whereas farms on the market integration pathway redeploy resources into new marketing services and agricultural product processing on the farm. The new crop and the market integration pathways are identified as unconventional adjustment strategies. Results derived from multinomial logit analysis highlight the major constraints and opportunities associated with the adoption of new crops and market integration practices. Farmers who have adopted unconventional practices are influenced by factors external to the farm, such as contacts with institutions, and have a high probability of having higher debts. These farmers are likely to depend heavily on seasonal labour and rented land. The fact that market integration activities are associated with smaller farms in conjunction with off-farm work signifies the importance of establishing an integrated rural development policy approach. Public policy involvement in enhancing dissemination of information concerning unconventional enterprises is emphasised. 3afarmers 3afarm families 3afarm management 3adecision making 3ainnovation adoption 3arural areas 3aresource allocation 3aprobability analysis 3autility functions 3asocioeconomics 3aGreece 0aagricultural regions 0aless favored areas1 aSkuras, D.0 tAgricultural economics.g1996 Sept., v. 15, no. 1 p.61-72aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02820naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245006700160300001800227500002400245520170800269650002001977650001901997650001902016650001002035650001802045650001502063650001502078650001502093650001902108650001502127650002302142650001102165650001802176651001202194700001702206700002202223773010802245852000902353856004802362655001202410IND4458205220221120124606.0110520e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445820522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-011-9792-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Xian10aMonitoring Lake Simcoe Water Clarity Using Landsat-5 TM Images  ap. 2015-2033.  aIncludes references  aThis study focuses on utilizing satellite remote sensing to monitor the water clarity of Lake Simcoe, Ontario, Canada, which has been suffering from the overload of phosphorus (TP) and therefore eutrophication for decades. The dataset includes 22 cloud-free Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images, as well as the nearly simultaneous in-situ observations from 15 stations on the lake. Compared to the general model used to estimate the Secchi Disk Transparency (SDT), a parameter for water clarity measurements, an improved model is developed, from the TM images. The results of these estimations are validated using the in-situ data by linear regression, and the accuracies are measured by the coefficient of determination R Â². The results reveal an indication of high model fit between the majority of SDT predictions and the in-situ observations. Also, the improved SDT model provides higher prediction accuracies than the general one when applied to 68.2% (15 out of 22) of the images. The estimated clarity maps indicate that the turbid water is normally distributed at the nearshore areas and the northeastern region. Meanwhile, the southwestern lake has much clearer water than the other regions. In addition, the southern bay has always been suffering from a serious water quality problem even till now. The water clarity of Lake Simcoe shows strong seasonal patterns, that it is at its worst in August and September annually and much better in the other sampling seasons. On an overall scale, the lake water clarity kept relatively stable from 1987 until the fall of 1992, followed by a gradual increase until 2000, after a slight decrease, and lastly stayed consistent until the summer of 2008. 3adata collection 3aeutrophication 3aimage analysis 3alakes 3alinear models 3amonitoring 3aphosphorus 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3awater quality 3aOntario1 aLi, Jonathan1 aBooty, William G.0 tWater resources management.g2011 June, v. 25, no. 8 p.2015-2033dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-47417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-011-9792-3 7aarticle03369naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245010700198300001800305500002400323500001500347506007600362520155300438506003701991650001302028650001102041650001602052650001602068650002402084650001102108650001802119650002402137650001402161650002302175650001002198650001502208650001902223650002902242650002702271650001102298650002102309650001302330653001502343700001502358700001902373700001902392700001802411700001802429700002002447700002202467700001902489700002202508773013602530852000902666856008002675655001202755IND4428223420221207083939.0091106e20091101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442822342DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00933-092doi7 aPMC27724492pmcid7 a197343362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Ying-Fei14aThe Complete Genome of Comamonas testosteroni Reveals Its Genetic Adaptations to Changing Environments  ap. 6812-6819.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMembers of the gram-negative, strictly aerobic genus Comamonas occur in various environments. Here we report the complete genome of Comamonas testosteroni strain CNB-2. Strain CNB-2 has a circular chromosome that is 5,373,643 bp long and has a G+C content of 61.4%. A total of 4,803 open reading frames (ORFs) were identified; 3,514 of these ORFs are functionally assigned to energy production, cell growth, signal transduction, or transportation, while 866 ORFs encode hypothetical proteins and 423 ORFs encode purely hypothetical proteins. The CNB-2 genome has many genes for transportation (22%) and signal transduction (6%), which allows the cells to respond and adapt to changing environments. Strain CNB-2 does not assimilate carbohydrates due to the lack of genes encoding proteins involved in glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways, and it contains many genes encoding proteins involved in degradation of aromatic compounds. We identified 66 Tct and nine TRAP-T systems and a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle, which may allow CNB-2 to take up and metabolize a range of carboxylic acids. This nutritional bias for carboxylic acids and aromatic compounds enables strain CNB-2 to occupy unique niches in environments. Four different sets of terminal oxidases for the respiratory system were identified, and they putatively functioned at different oxygen concentrations. This study conclusively revealed at the genomic level that the genetic versatility of C. testosteroni is vital for competition with other bacteria in its special niches.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aproteins 3aenergy 3acell growth 3achromosomes 3aopen reading frames 3aniches 3acarbohydrates 3asignal transduction 3anutrition 3arespiratory system 3agenes 3aphosphates 3aaromatic acids 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3aComamonas testosteroni 3aoxygen 3acarboxylic acids 3abacteria 0aadaptation1 aZhang, Yun1 aZhang, Jia-Yue1 aChen, Dong-Wei1 aZhu, Yongqian1 aZheng, Huajun1 aWang, Sheng-Yue1 aJiang, Cheng-Ying1 aZhao, Guo-Ping1 aLiu, Shuang-Jiang0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2009 Nov. 1, v. 75, no. 21 p.6812-6819dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00933-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01480naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002700149245008100176300001600257500002400273520056300297650001500860650002800875650001300903650001900916650002200935650001300957700002000970773009000990852000901080856008901089655001201178IND4463779820221120041051.0120802s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446377982DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00067-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbu-Goukh, Abu-Bakr A.10aChanges in pectic enzymes and cellulase activity during guava fruit ripening  ap. 213-218.  aIncludes references  aChanges in activities of the cell wall degrading enzymes, pectinesterase (PE), polygalacturonase (PG) and cellulase, were studied during the ripening of white- and pink-fleshed guava fruit types.

No significant (P<0.01) effects of diets and strain on the cholesterol or lipid contents of egg yolk were obtained. The fatty acid composition of yolk lipids was affected (P>0.05) by the experimental diets. The major effects of the diets were observed in fatty acids C16:0, C18:0, C18:1n9, C18:2n6, C20:4n6, C20:5n3 and C22:6n3. The addition of oils to the diets fed to hens allowed the production of eggs with higher n3/n6 and PUFA/SFA fatty acid ratios than the eggs from control hens. It was concluded that the amounts of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in egg yolk could be altered by dietary manipulation. 3acholesterol 3aegg yolk 3aegg yolk composition 3aexperimental diets 3afatty acid composition 3ahens 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aMurakami, A.E.1 aGomes, S.T.M.1 aMatsushita, M.1 aSouza, N.E. de0 tFood chemistry.g2003 Nov., v. 83, no. 2 p.287-292dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00094-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02313naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002100149245006200170300001600232500002400248520109100272650001501363650001401378650002701392650001301419650002601432650001801458650001401476650001001490650001101500650001801511650003301529650001201562650001301574650001001587650001301597650001101610650001301621700002001634700002501654773009001679852000901769856008901778655001201867IND4463780720221120040932.0120802s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446378072DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00089-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermosin, Isidro10aFree amino acid composition and botanical origin of honey  ap. 263-268.  aIncludes references  aThe main amino acids found in 31 Spanish honeys of five different single botanical origins, were proline, phenylalanine, tyrosine and lysine, followed by arginine, glutamic acid, histidine and valine.

Using structural and phylogenetic criteria, we identified two putative genuine La proteins (At32 and At79) and showed that both are expressed throughout plant development but at different levels and under different regulatory conditions. At32, but not At79, restores Saccharomyces cerevisiae La nuclear functions in non-coding RNAs biogenesis and is able to bind to plant 3'-UUU-OH RNAs. We conclude that these La nuclear functions are conserved in Arabidopsis and supported by At32, which we renamed as AtLa1. Consistently, AtLa1 is predominantly localized to the plant nucleoplasm and was also detected in the nucleolar cavity. The inactivation of AtLa1 in Arabidopsis leads to an embryonic-lethal phenotype with deficient embryos arrested at early globular stage of development. In addition, mutant embryonic cells display a nucleolar hypertrophy suggesting that AtLa1 is required for normal ribosome biogenesis. The identification of two distantly related proteins with all structural characteristics of genuine La proteins suggests that these factors evolved to a certain level of specialization in plants. This unprecedented situation provides a unique opportunity to dissect the very different aspects of this crucial cellular activity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiogenesis 3adevelopmental stages 3aembryogenesis 3agenome 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ahypertrophy 3amutants 3anon-coding RNA 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aplant development 3aproteins 3aribosomes1 aDeragon, Jean-Marc1 aDevic, Martine1 aGuilleminot, Jocelyne1 aBousquet-Antonelli, CÃ©cile0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 May, v. 35, no. 10 p.3306-3321x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm2003Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070617b20070702c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02814naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002100179245022000200300001800420506007600438520116600514506003701680650000801717650002501725650001501750650002001765650001901785650004301804650002201847650001401869700002101883700002001904700001701924700002401941700002201965700001801987700001802005773008202023852000902105856007802114856007302192930003302265946001102298990002302309655001202332IND4392505220221207074442.0070617e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439250522DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm2022doi7 aPMC19042862pmcid7 a174598882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiba, Yoshinobu10aChemical synthesis of a very long oligoribonucleotide with 2-cyanoethoxymethyl (CEM) as the 2'-O-protecting group: structural identification and biological activity of a synthetic 110mer precursor-microRNA candidate  ap. 3287-3296.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA long RNA oligomer, a 110mer with the sequence of a precursor-microRNA candidate, has been chemically synthesized in a single synthesizer run by means of standard automated phosphoramidite chemistry. The synthetic method involved the use of 2-cyanoethoxymethyl (CEM), a 2'-hydroxyl protecting group recently developed in our laboratory. We improved the methodology, introducing better coupling and capping conditions. The overall isolated yield of highly pure 110mer was 5.5%. Such a yield on a 1-Î¼mol scale corresponds to 1 mg of product and emphasizes the practicality of the CEM method for synthesizing oligomers of more than 100 nt in sufficient quantity for biological research. We confirmed the identity of the 110mer by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, as well as HPLC, electrophoretic methods, and RNase-digestion experiments. The 110mer also showed sense-selective specific gene-silencing activity. As far as we know, this is the longest chemically synthesized RNA oligomer reported to date. Furthermore, the identity of the 110mer was confirmed by both physicochemical and biological methods.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3abioactive properties 3adesorption 3aelectrophoresis 3agene silencing 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3asynthesis1 aMasuda, Hirofumi1 aWatanabe, Naoki1 aEgo, Takeshi1 aTakagaki, Kazuchika1 aIshiyama, Kouichi1 aOhgi, Tadaaki1 aYano, Junichi0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 May, v. 35, no. 10 p.3287-3296x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm2023Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070617b20070702c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03416naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201100002200218245009900240300001800339506007600357520169800433506003702131650001202168650001602180650001702196650001102213650001302224650002202237650003102259650002902290650002102319650001002340650002002350650001902370651002402389653001402413653002102427653002802448653002202476700001902498700002002517773017402537852000902711856008302720930003302803945002502836946001302861655001202874IND4418622020221207054518.0090403e20090331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441862202DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08102001062doi7 aPMC26640082pmcid7 a192898362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCook, Benjamin I.10aAmplification of the North American "Dust Bowl" drought through human-induced land degradation  ap. 4997-5001.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe "Dust Bowl" drought of the 1930s was highly unusual for North America, deviating from the typical pattern forced by "La Nina" with the maximum drying in the central and northern Plains, warm temperature anomalies across almost the entire continent, and widespread dust storms. General circulation models (GCMs), forced by sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from the 1930s, produce a drought, but one that is centered in southwestern North America and without the warming centered in the middle of the continent. Here, we show that the inclusion of forcing from human land degradation during the period, in addition to the anomalous SSTs, is necessary to reproduce the anomalous features of the Dust Bowl drought. The degradation over the Great Plains is represented in the GCM as a reduction in vegetation cover and the addition of a soil dust aerosol source, both consequences of crop failure. As a result of land surface feedbacks, the simulation of the drought is much improved when the new dust aerosol and vegetation boundary conditions are included. Vegetation reductions explain the high temperature anomaly over the northern U.S., and the dust aerosols intensify the drought and move it northward of the purely ocean-forced drought pattern. When both factors are included in the model simulations, the precipitation and temperature anomalies are of similar magnitude and in a similar location compared with the observations. Human-induced land degradation is likely to have not only contributed to the dust storms of the 1930s but also amplified the drought, and these together turned a modest SST-forced drought into one of the worst environmental disasters the U.S. has experienced.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adrought 3adust storms 3awind erosion 3aoceans 3aseawater 3awater temperature 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aanthropogenic activities 3avegetation cover 3acrops 3acrop production 3adust emissions 3aGreat Plains region 0aDust Bowl 0aland degradation 0asea surface temperature 0aDust Bowl drought1 aMiller, Ron L.1 aSeager, Richard0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 31, v. 106, no. 13 p.4997-5001dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08102001063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090428b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/04/27  aOther US 7aarticle02477naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245005700201300001800258506007600276520126500352506003701617650001001654650001101664650002201675650001501697650002201712700002001734700002101754700001601775773017401791852000901965856008301974930003302057946001302090655001202103IND4418622520221207054457.0090403e20090331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441862252DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09014901062doi7 aPMC26640182pmcid7 a193075552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, Bernd14aThe medial prefrontal cortex exhibits money illusion  ap. 5025-5028.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBehavioral economists have proposed that money illusion, which is a deviation from rationality in which individuals engage in nominal evaluation, can explain a wide range of important economic and social phenomena. This proposition stands in sharp contrast to the standard economic assumption of rationality that requires individuals to judge the value of money only on the basis of the bundle of goods that it can buy--its real value--and not on the basis of the actual amount of currency--its nominal value. We used fMRI to investigate whether the brain's reward circuitry exhibits money illusion. Subjects received prizes in 2 different experimental conditions that were identical in real economic terms, but differed in nominal terms. Thus, in the absence of money illusion there should be no differences in activation in reward-related brain areas. In contrast, we found that areas of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which have been previously associated with the processing of anticipatory and experienced rewards, and the valuation of goods, exhibited money illusion. We also found that the amount of money illusion exhibited by the vmPFC was correlated with the amount of money illusion exhibited in the evaluation of economic transactions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3acortex 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomists 3ahonors and awards1 aRangel, Antonio1 aWibral, Matthias1 aFalk, Armin0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 31, v. 106, no. 13 p.5025-5028dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09014901063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090404b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02232naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245010900203300001800312506007600330520085900406506003701265650002101302650001101323650001701334650001301351650001601364650002001380650001301400700001901413700001801432700001101450700001901461700001801480773017401498852000901672856008301681930003301764946001301797655001201810IND4418327620221207054507.0090327e20090324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441832762DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08117801062doi7 aPMC26607392pmcid7 a192554372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Qing-Tao10aBowl-shaped oligomeric structures on membranes as DegP's new functional forms in protein quality control  ap. 4858-4863.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the periplasm of Escherichia coli, DegP (also known as HtrA), which has both chaperone-like and proteolytic activities, prevents the accumulation of toxic misfolded and unfolded polypeptides. In solution, upon binding to denatured proteins, DegP forms large cage-like structures. Here, we show that DegP forms a range of bowl-shaped structures, independent of substrate proteins, each with a 4-, 5-, or 6-fold symmetry and all with a DegP trimer as the structural unit, on lipid membranes. These membrane-bound DegP assemblies have the capacity to recruit and process substrates in the bowl chamber, and they exhibit higher proteolytic and lower chaperone-like activities than DegP in solution. Our findings imply that DegP might regulate its dual roles during protein quality control, depending on its assembly state in the narrow bacterial envelope.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3alipids 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3aquality control 3atoxicity1 aBai, Xiao-Chen1 aChang, Lei-Fu1 aWu, Yi1 aWang, Hong-Wei1 aSui, Sen-Fang0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 24, v. 106, no. 12 p.4858-4863dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08117801063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090327b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02751naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245011300206300001800319506007600337520120500413506003701618650001501655650001701670650001401687650001301701650002201714650001301736650001701749650002101766650001101787650002001798650001301818650002901831650001901860650001401879700002101893700002101914700002201935773017401957852000902131856008302140930003302223946001302256655001202269IND4418327720221207054414.0090327e20090324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441832772DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08110581062doi7 aPMC26535622pmcid7 a192738412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuezada, Cindy M.12aA family of Salmonella virulence factors functions as a distinct class of autoregulated E3 ubiquitin ligases  ap. 4864-4869.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProcesses as diverse as receptor binding and signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics, and programmed cell death are manipulated by mimics of host proteins encoded by pathogenic bacteria. We show here that the Salmonella virulence factor SspH2 belongs to a growing class of bacterial effector proteins that harness and subvert the eukaryotic ubiquitination pathway. This virulence protein possesses ubiquitination activity that depends on a conserved cysteine residue. A crystal structure of SspH2 reveals a canonical leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain that interacts with a unique E3 ligase [which we have termed NEL for Novel E3 Ligase] C-terminal fold unrelated to previously observed HECT or RING-finger E3 ligases. Moreover, the LRR domain sequesters the catalytic cysteine residue contained in the NEL domain, and we suggest a mechanism for activation of the ligase requiring a substantial conformational change to release the catalytic domain for function. We also show that the N-terminal domain targets SspH2 to the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells and propose a model whereby binding of the LRR to proteins at the target site releases the ligase domain for site-specific function.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella 3aactive sites 3aapoptosis 3abacteria 3acrystal structure 3acysteine 3acytoskeleton 3aepithelial cells 3amodels 3aplasma membrane 3aproteins 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination 3avirulence1 aHicks, Stuart W.1 aGalÃ¡n, Jorge E.1 aStebbins, C.

As a chromatin-associated multifunctional protein, how MeCP2 integrates external signals and regulates neuronal function remain unclear. Although neuronal activity-induced phosphorylation of MeCP2 at serine 421 (S421) has been reported, the full spectrum of MeCP2 phosphorylation together with the in vivo function of such modifications are yet to be revealed. Here, we report the identification of several MeCP2 phosphorylation sites in normal and epileptic brains from multiple species. We demonstrate that serine 80 (S80) phosphorylation of MeCP2 is critical as its mutation into alanine (S80A) in transgenic knock-in mice leads to locomotor deficits. S80A mutation attenuates MeCP2 chromatin association at several gene promoters in resting neurons and leads to transcription changes of a small number of genes. Calcium influx in neurons causes dephosphorylation at S80, potentially contributing to its dissociation from the chromatin. We postulate that phosphorylation of MeCP2 modulates its dynamic function in neurons transiting between resting and active states within neural circuits that underlie behaviors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalanine 3abinding proteins 3acalcium 3achromatin 3adephosphorylation 3adissociation 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3amice 3amutation 3aneurons 3aphosphorylation 3aserine1 aHu, Keping1 aChang, Qiang1 aWu, Hao1 aSherman, Nicholas E.1 aMartinowich, Keri1 aKlose, Robert J.1 aSchanen, Carolyn1 aJaenisch, Rudolf1 aWang, Weidong1 aSun, Yi Eve0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 24, v. 106, no. 12 p.4882-4887dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08116481063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090327b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02666naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245012800205300001800333506007600351520130400427506003701731650001201768650001601780650002001796650001701816650001401833700001701847700002301864700002301887700002401910700002201934773017401956852000902130856008302139930003302222946001302255655001202268IND4418327820221207053824.0090327e20090324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441832782DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09009391062doi7 aPMC26607652pmcid7 a192738432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotta, Simone C.10aDissecting the brain's fear system reveals the hypothalamus is critical for responding in subordinate conspecific intruders  ap. 4870-4875.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEffective defense against natural threats in the environment is essential for the survival of individual animals. Thus, instinctive behavioral responses accompanied by fear have evolved to protect individuals from predators and from opponents of the same species (dominant conspecifics). While it has been suggested that all perceived environmental threats trigger the same set of innately determined defensive responses, we tested the alternate hypothesis that different stimuli may evoke differentiable behaviors supported by distinct neural circuitry. The results of behavioral, neuronal immediate early gene activation, lesion, and neuroanatomical experiments indicate that the hypothalamus is necessary for full expression of defensive behavioral responses in a subordinate conspecific, that lesions of the dorsal premammillary nucleus drastically reduce behavioral measures of fear in these animals, and that essentially separate hypothalamic circuitry supports defensive responses to a predator or a dominant conspecific. It is now clear that differentiable neural circuitry underlies defensive responses to fear conditioning associated with painful stimuli, predators, and dominant conspecifics and that the hypothalamus is an essential component of the circuitry for the latter two stimuli.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimals 3afearfulness 3agene activation 3ahypothalamus 3apredators1 aGoto, Marina1 aGouveia, Flavia V.1 aBaldo, Marcus V.C.1 aCanteras, Newton S.1 aSwanson, Larry W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 24, v. 106, no. 12 p.4870-4875dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09009391063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090327b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02921naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245011600209300001800325506007600343520125500419506003701674650001001711650001801721650002001739650001401759650001701773650001901790650001001809650001801819650001401837650001501851650001101866650000901877650001201886650001301898650001901911650001401930700002401944700001801968700002301986700001902009700002302028700001602051773017402067852000902241856008302250930003302333946001302366655001202379IND4418328420221207053856.0090327e20090324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441832842DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08112281062doi7 aPMC26607222pmcid7 a192649612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimmons, Danielle A.10aUp-regulating BDNF with an ampakine rescues synaptic plasticity and memory in Huntington's disease knockin mice  ap. 4906-4911.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCognitive problems occur in asymptomatic gene carriers of Huntington's disease (HD), and mouse models of the disease exhibit impaired learning and substantial deficits in the cytoskeletal changes that stabilize long-term potentiation (LTP). The latter effects may be related to the decreased production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) associated with the HD mutation. This study asked whether up-regulating endogenous BDNF levels with an ampakine, a positive modulator of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, rescues plasticity and reduces learning problems in HD (CAG140) mice. Twice-daily injections of a short half-life ampakine normalized BDNF levels, activity-driven actin polymerization in dendritic spines, and LTP stabilization in 8-week-old mutants. Comparable results were obtained in 16-week-old HD mice with more severe LTP deficits. Ampakine treatments had no measurable effect on the decreased locomotor activity observed in the mutants but offset their impairments in long-term memory. Given that ampakines are well tolerated in clinical trials and were effective in this study after brief exposures, these results suggest a novel strategy for chronic treatment of the cognitive difficulties that occur in the early stages of HD.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3aanimal models 3aclinical trials 3acognition 3acytoskeleton 3adisease models 3agenes 3aglutamic acid 3ahalf life 3alocomotion 3amemory 3amice 3amutants 3amutation 3apolymerization 3areceptors1 aRex, Christopher S.1 aPalmer, Linda1 aPandyarajan, Vijay1 aFedulov, Vadim1 aGall, Christine M.1 aLynch, Gary0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 24, v. 106, no. 12 p.4906-4911dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08112281063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090327b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03026naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245011100170300001600281500002400297520170700321650002002028650002002048650001102068650001602079650001402095650001502109650000802124650001402132650001002146650001802156650002302174650001502197650001102212650001902223650001702242650001602259650001202275650001902287650001602306700002202322700002002344773012802364852000902492856005502501655001202556IND4431947420221122135844.0100129e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443194742DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4549.2008.00331.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAZAM, KHAIRUL10aQuality assessment of farmed black tiger shrimp (penaeus monodon) in supply chain: organoleptic evaluation  ap. 164-175.  aIncludes references  aOrganoleptic quality of the farmed shrimp (Penaeus monodon) throughout the supply chain was investigated under two conditions - normal practices using no ice and under experimental conditions using ice at the ratio of 1:1 (ice : shrimp). Overall, organoleptic acceptability score ranged between highly acceptable and moderately acceptable (shrimp farm = 8.8, depot = 5.47, commission agent = 6.67 and processing plant = 6.33 in a scale of 10) for shrimp under normal practices and a relatively better score and quality of shrimp under experimental conditions as judged by the organoleptic evaluation. The overall organoleptic score between the two experiments did not differ significantly (P [less-than or equal to] 0.05). From the moment the shrimp is caught, the deterioration process starts and its quality is affected. The most frequent problem is temperature fluctuation in raw materials due to (1) mishandling after harvest, (2) lengthy transportation times to processing plants or (3) manual processing where shrimp are kept for several hours waiting under each stakeholder supply chain. These result in uncertainty of the shelf life and lower quality products. A score sheet is prepared based on well-defined characteristic changes (appearance, flavor, odor and texture) that occur in the deteriorative process of shrimp. Demerit points are assigned to attributes and the resulting scores prescribe overall acceptable quality. Considering food safety, organoleptic evaluation is one of the most often used simple methods for assessing freshness and quality in the fish and shrimp inspection services, and routinely applicable on all levels of marketing from harvesting to the processing plants. 3aPenaeus monodon 3afish inspection 3aflavor 3afood safety 3afreshness 3aharvesting 3aice 3amarketing 3aodors 3araw materials 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 3asupply chain 3atemperature 3atexture 3atransportation 3auncertainty1 aNAZMUL ALAM, S.M.1 aNAHER, SHAM SUN0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2010 Feb., v. 34, no. s1 p.164-175dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4549.2008.00331.x 7aarticle02817naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002900179245011900208300001800327506007600345520130100421506003701722650000801759650001501767650002101782650002301803650001401826650001301840650001101853650001301864650001101877650002701888700002001915700003001935700002001965700002301985700001702008773008302025852000902108856007802117856007302195930003302268946001102301990002302312655001202335IND4393181820221207074545.0070716e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439318182DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm3722doi7 aPMC19194862pmcid7 a175378172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPettersen, Henrik Sahlin10aUracil-DNA glycosylases SMUG1 and UNG2 coordinate the initial steps of base excision repair by distinct mechanisms  ap. 3879-3892.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA glycosylases UNG and SMUG1 excise uracil from DNA and belong to the same protein superfamily. Vertebrates contain both SMUG1 and UNG, but their distinct roles in base excision repair (BER) of deaminated cytosine (U:G) are still not fully defined. Here we have examined the ability of human SMUG1 and UNG2 (nuclear UNG) to initiate and coordinate repair of U:G mismatches. When expressed in Escherichia coli cells, human UNG2 initiates complete repair of deaminated cytosine, while SMUG1 inhibits cell proliferation. In vitro, we show that SMUG1 binds tightly to AP-sites and inhibits AP-site cleavage by AP-endonucleases. Furthermore, a specific motif important for the AP-site product binding has been identified. Mutations in this motif increase catalytic turnover due to reduced product binding. In contrast, the highly efficient UNG2 lacks product-binding capacity and stimulates AP-site cleavage by APE1, facilitating the two first steps in BER. In summary, this work reveals that SMUG1 and UNG2 coordinate the initial steps of BER by distinct mechanisms. UNG2 is apparently adapted to rapid and highly coordinated repair of uracil (U:G and U:A) in replicating DNA, while the less efficient SMUG1 may be more important in repair of deaminated cytosine (U:G) in non-replicating chromatin.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aEscherichia coli 3acell proliferation 3achromatin 3acytosine 3ahumans 3amutation 3auracil 3auracil-DNA glycosylase1 aSundheim, Ottar1 aGilljam, Karin Margaretha1 aSlupphaug, Geir1 aKrokan, Hans Einar1 aKavli, Bodil0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 June, v. 35, no. 12 p.3879-3892x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm3723Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070716b20070802c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02702naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001900179245006900198300001800267506007600285520141500361506003701776650002001813650002201833650001201855650001801867650001401885650001501899650001401914650003501928700001901963773008301982852000902065856007802074856007302152930003302225946001102258990002302269655001202292IND4392812120221207074554.0070701e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439281212DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm2382doi7 aPMC19202422pmcid7 a175265292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBromberg, Yana10aSNAP: predict effect of non-synonymous polymorphisms on function  ap. 3823-3835.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany genetic variations are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Non-synonymous SNPs are 'neutral' if the resulting point-mutated protein is not functionally discernible from the wild type and 'non-neutral' otherwise. The ability to identify non-neutral substitutions could significantly aid targeting disease causing detrimental mutations, as well as SNPs that increase the fitness of particular phenotypes. Here, we introduced comprehensive data sets to assess the performance of methods that predict SNP effects. Along we introduced SNAP (screening for non-acceptable polymorphisms), a neural network-based method for the prediction of the functional effects of non-synonymous SNPs. SNAP needs only sequence information as input, but benefits from functional and structural annotations, if available. In a cross-validation test on over 80 000 mutants, SNAP identified 80% of the non-neutral substitutions at 77% accuracy and 76% of the neutral substitutions at 80% accuracy. This constituted an important improvement over other methods; the improvement rose to over ten percentage points for mutants for which existing methods disagreed. Possibly even more importantly SNAP introduced a well-calibrated measure for the reliability of each prediction. This measure will allow users to focus on the most accurate predictions and/or the most severe effects.

Here, we demonstrate that local structure of acceptor RNA at a potential nucleation site, rather than overall thermodynamic stability, is a critical determinant for the minus-strand transfer step (annealing of acceptor RNA to (-) strong-stop DNA followed by reverse transcriptase (RT)-catalyzed DNA extension). In our system, destabilization of a stem-loop structure at the 5' end of the transactivation response element (TAR) in a 70-nt RNA acceptor (RNA 70) appears to be the major nucleation pathway. Using a mutational approach, we show that when the acceptor has a weak local structure, NC has little or no effect. In this case, the efficiencies of both annealing and strand transfer reactions are similar. However, when NC is required to destabilize local structure in acceptor RNA, the efficiency of annealing is significantly higher than that of strand transfer. Consistent with this result, we find that MgÂ²âº (required for RT activity) inhibits NC-catalyzed annealing. This suggests that MgÂ²âº competes with NC for binding to the nucleic acid substrates. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of NC-dependent and -independent minus-strand transfer.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3atranscriptional activation 3aannealing 3aions 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aDNA 3amagnesium 3athermodynamics 3areverse transcription 3aRNA 3anucleocapsid proteins 0atranscription (genetics)1 aHeilman-Miller, Susan L.1 aLevin, Judith G.0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 June, v. 35, no. 12 p.3974-3987x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm3753Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070716b20070802c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03085naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001900179245016400198300001800362506007600380520151700456506003701973650003202010650001502042650002202057650002402079650001102103650001802114650002302132650001702155650002202172650001802194650002902212650002602241700001602267700002202283773008302305852000902388856007802397856007302475930003302548946001102581990002302592655001202615IND4393183220221207074542.0070716e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439318322DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm4242doi7 aPMC19194812pmcid7 a175578122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCotney, Justin10aRelative abundance of the human mitochondrial transcription system and distinct roles for h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 in mitochondrial biogenesis and gene expression  ap. 4042-4054.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman mitochondrial transcription requires the bacteriophage-related RNA polymerase, POLRMT, the mtDNA-binding protein, h-mtTFA/TFAM, and two transcription factors/rRNA methyltransferases, h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2. Here, we determined the steady-state levels of these core transcription components and examined the consequences of purposeful elevation of h-mtTFB1 or h-mtTFB2 in HeLa cells. On a per molecule basis, we find an ~6-fold excess of POLRMT to mtDNA and ~3-fold more h-mtTFB2 than h-mtTFB1. We also estimate h-mtTFA at ~50 molecules/mtDNA, a ratio predicted to support robust transcription, but not to coat mtDNA. Consistent with a role for h-mtTFB2 in transcription and transcription-primed replication, increased mitochondrial DNA and transcripts result from its over-expression. This is accompanied by increased translation rates of most, but not all mtDNA-encoded proteins. Over-expression of h-mtTFB1 did not significantly influence these parameters, but did result in increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, h-mtTFB1 mRNA and protein are elevated in response to h-mtTFB2 over-expression, suggesting the existence of a retrograde signal to the nucleus to coordinately regulate expression of these related factors. Altogether, our results provide a framework for understanding the regulation of human mitochondrial transcription in vivo and define distinct roles for h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 in mitochondrial biogenesis and gene expression that together likely fine-tune mitochondrial function.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3abiogenesis 3achemical elements 3agene overexpression 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3amethyltransferases 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aWang, Zhibo1 aShadel, Gerald S.0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 June, v. 35, no. 12 p.4042-4054x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm4243Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070716b20070802c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02592naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002100179245009800200300001800298506007600316520110200392506003701494650002901531650001501560650001901575650002101594650001901615650001501634650001801649650001401667650002801681650001801709650002101727650002301748650002001771700002101791700002301812773008301835852000901918856007801927856007302005930003302078946001102111655001202122IND4393184720221207074436.0070716e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439318472DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm3882doi7 aPMC19194932pmcid7 a175696732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosado, IvÃ¡n V.10aFunctional analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomal protein Rpl3p in ribosome synthesis  ap. 4203-4213.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRibosome synthesis in eukaryotes requires a multitude of trans-acting factors. These factors act at many steps as the pre-ribosomal particles travel from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm. In contrast to the well-studied trans-acting factors, little is known about the contribution of the ribosomal proteins to ribosome biogenesis. Herein, we have analysed the role of ribosomal protein Rpl3p in 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis. In vivo depletion of Rpl3p results in a deficit in 60S ribosomal subunits and the appearance of half-mer polysomes. This phenotype is likely due to the instability of early and intermediate pre-ribosomal particles, as evidenced by the low steady-state levels of 27SAâ, 27SBS and 7SL/S precursors. Furthermore, depletion of Rpl3p impairs the nucleocytoplasmic export of pre-60S ribosomal particles. Interestingly, flow cytometry analysis indicates that Rpl3p-depleted cells arrest in the G1 phase. Altogether, we suggest that upon depletion of Rpl3p, early assembly of 60S ribosomal subunits is aborted and subsequent steps during their maturation and export prevented.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiogenesis 3acell nucleolus 3aeukaryotic cells 3aflow cytometry 3ainterphase 3anucleic acids 3aphenotype 3aphysiological transport 3apolyribosomes 3aprotein subunits 3aribosomal proteins 3atransactivators1 aKressler, Dieter1 ade la Cruz, JesÃºs0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 June, v. 35, no. 12 p.4203-4213x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm3883Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070716b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02740naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002500179245016100204300001200365506007600377520130500453506003701758650001901795650001801814650001601832650000901848650001801857650001301875650001801888650002101906700002001927700002901947700002201976773008001998852000902078856007802087856007402165930003302239946001102272990002302283655001202306IND4391155020221207054122.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439115502DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm1462doi7 aPMC18856652pmcid7 a173923412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZanghi, Christine N.12aA tractable method for simultaneous modifications to the head and tail of bacteriophage lambda and its application to enhancing phage-mediated gene delivery  ap. e59.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is considerable interest in the use of bacteriophage vectors for mammalian cell gene transfer applications, due to their stability, excellent safety profile and inexpensive mass production. However, to date, phage vectors have been plagued by mediocre performance as gene transfer agents. This may reflect the complexity of the viral infection process in mammalian cells and the need to refine each step of this process in order to arrive at an optimal, phage-based gene transfer system. Therefore, a flexible system was designed that alowed for the introduction of multiple modifications on the surface of bacteriophage lambda. Using this novel method, multiple peptides were displayed simultaneously from both the phage head and tail. Surface head display of an ubiquitinylation motif greatly increased the efficiency of phage-mediated gene transfer in a murine macrophage cell line. Gene transfer was further increased when this peptide was displayed in combination with a tail-displayed CD40-binding motif. Overall, this work provides a novel system that can be used to rationally improve bacteriophage gene transfer vectors and shows it may be possible to enhance the efficiency of phage-mediated gene transfer by targeting and optimizing multiple steps within the viral infection pathway.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteriophages 3agene transfer 3amacrophages 3amice 3anucleic acids 3apeptides 3aphage vectors 3aviral morphology1 aSapinoro, Ramil1 aBradel-Tretheway, Birgit1 aDewhurst, Stephen0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Apr., v. 35, no. 8 p.e59-e59x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1463Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02356naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002300179245011300202300001200315506007600327520085800403506003701261650000801298650002201306650002501328650001401353650001101367650004201378650001101420650004301431650002501474650002901499700001901528700002101547700002201568700002301590773008001613852000901693856007801702856007401780930003301854946001101887655001201898IND4391154420221207054122.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439115442DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm1082doi7 aPMC18856502pmcid7 a173896452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFollows, George A.10aReal-time PCR mapping of DNaseI-hypersensitive sites using a novel ligation-mediated amplification technique  ap. e56.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMapping sites within the genome that are hypersensitive to digestion with DNaseI is an important method for identifying DNA elements that regulate transcription. The standard approach to locating these DNaseI-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) has been to use Southern blotting techniques, although we, and others, have recently published alternative methods using a range of technologies including high-throughput sequencing and genomic array tiling paths. In this article, we describe a novel protocol to use real-time PCR to map DHS. Advantages of the technique reported here include the small cell numbers required for each analysis, rapid, relatively low-cost experiments with minimal need for specialist equipment. Presented examples include comparative DHS mapping of known TAL1/SCL regulatory elements between human embryonic stem cells and K562 cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aSouthern blotting 3aembryonic stem cells 3aequipment 3agenome 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahumans 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregulatory sequences 3atranscription (genetics)1 aJanes, Mary E.1 aVallier, Ludovic1 aGreen, Anthony R.1 aGottgens, Berthold0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Apr., v. 35, no. 8 p.e56-e56x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1083Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02784naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001900179245010500198300001200303506007600315520139700391506003701788650001401825650001601839650001501855650002401870650002601894700002301920700001501943700001701958700001801975700002501993700002002018700002702038773008002065852000902145856007802154856007402232930003302306946001102339655001202350IND4391155820221207085446.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439115582DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm0882doi7 aPMC18856452pmcid7 a174261302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatveeva, Olga10aComparison of approaches for rational siRNA design leading to a new efficient and transparent method  ap. e63.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCurrent literature describes several methods for the design of efficient siRNAs with 19 perfectly matched base pairs and 2 nt overhangs. Using four independent databases totaling 3336 experimentally verified siRNAs, we compared how well several of these methods predict siRNA cleavage efficiency. According to receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and correlation analyses, the best programs were BioPredsi, ThermoComposition and DSIR. We also studied individual parameters that significantly and consistently correlated with siRNA efficacy in different databases. As a result of this work we developed a new method which utilizes linear regression fitting with local duplex stability, nucleotide position-dependent preferences and total G/C content of siRNA duplexes as input parameters. The new method's discrimination ability of efficient and inefficient siRNAs is comparable with that of the best methods identified, but its parameters are more obviously related to the mechanisms of siRNA action in comparison with BioPredsi. This permits insight to the underlying physical features and relative importance of the parameters. The new method of predicting siRNA efficiency is faster than that of ThermoComposition because it does not employ time-consuming RNA secondary structure calculations and has much less parameters than DSIR. It is available as a web tool called 'siRNA scales'.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adatabases 3amethodology 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asmall interfering RNA1 aNechipurenko, Yury1 aRossi, Leo1 aMoore, Barry1 aSÃ¦trom, PÃ¥l1 aOgurtsov, Aleksey Y.1 aAtkins, John F.1 aShabalina, Svetlana A.0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Apr., v. 35, no. 8 p.e63-e63x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm0883Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03062naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245014700202300001800349506007600367520141000443506003701853650000801890650002101898650002101919650001801940650001601958650001701974650002001991650001102011650002502022650002102047700003302068700002102101700002402122700002402146700002402170700002602194700002502220773008202245852000902327856007902336856007402415930003302489946001102522990002302533655001202556IND4391156620221207085447.0070506e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439115662DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkl11222doi7 aPMC18745912pmcid7 a173249432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenear, Donald F.10aPressure dissociation of integration host factor-DNA complexes reveals flexibility-dependent structural variation at the protein-DNA interface  ap. 1761-1772.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aE. coli Integration host factor (IHF) condenses the bacterial nucleoid by wrapping DNA. Previously, we showed that DNA flexibility compensates for structural characteristics of the four consensus recognition elements associated with specific binding (Aeling et al., J. Biol. Chem. 281, 39236-39248, 2006). If elements are missing, high-affinity binding occurs only if DNA deformation energy is low. In contrast, if all elements are present, net binding energy is unaffected by deformation energy. We tested two hypotheses for this observation: in complexes containing all elements, (1) stiff DNA sequences are less bent upon binding IHF than flexible ones; or (2) DNA sequences with differing flexibility have interactions with IHF that compensate for unfavorable deformation energy. Time-resolved FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) shows that global topologies are indistinguishable for three complexes with oligonucleotides of different flexibility. However, pressure perturbation shows that the volume change upon binding is smaller with increasing flexibility. We interpret these results in the context of Record and coworker's model for IHF binding (J. Mol. Biol. 310, 379-401, 2001). We propose that the volume changes reflect differences in hydration that arise from structural variation at IHF-DNA interfaces while the resulting energetic compensation maintains the same net binding energy.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3abinding proteins 3abinding sites 3adeformation 3adissociation 3aenergy transfer 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3aoligonucleotides1 aTretyachenko-Ladokhina, Vira1 aOpel, Michael L.1 aAeling, Kimberly A.1 aWesley Hatfield, G.1 aFranklin, Laurie M.1 aDarlington, Reuben C.1 aAlexander Ross, J.B.0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Mar., v. 35, no. 6 p.1761-1772x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkl11223Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02967naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001600179245014000195300001800335506007600353520132500429506003701754650001801791650001801809650002501827650002401852650001001876650001901886650001801905650002901923650002601952650003101978700001602009700002002025700002102045700002502066700002302091700001802114700001902132773008202151852000902233856007802242856007402320930003302394946001102427990002302438655001202461IND4391156820221207085457.0070506e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439115682DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm0592doi7 aPMC18746072pmcid7 a173249422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoer, Brian10aElevating the levels of Sox2 in embryonal carcinoma cells and embryonic stem cells inhibits the expression of Sox2:Oct-3/4 target genes  ap. 1773-1786.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent studies have identified large sets of genes in embryonic stem and embryonal carcinoma cells that are associated with the transcription factors Sox2 and Oct-3/4. Other studies have shown that Sox2 and Oct-3/4 work together cooperatively to stimulate the transcription of their own genes as well as a network of genes required for embryogenesis. Moreover, small changes in the levels of Sox2:Oct-3/4 target genes alter the fate of stem cells. Although positive feedforward and feedback loops have been proposed to explain the activation of these genes, little is known about the mechanisms that prevent their overexpression. Here, we demonstrate that elevating Sox2 levels inhibits the endogenous expression of five Sox2:Oct-3/4 target genes. In addition, we show that Sox2 repression is dependent on the binding sites for Sox2 and Oct-3/4. We also demonstrate that inhibition is dependent on the C-terminus of Sox2, which contains its transactivation domain. Finally, our studies argue that overexpression of neither Oct-3/4 nor Nanog broadly inhibits Sox2:Oct-3/4 target genes. Collectively, these studies provide new insights into the diversity of mechanisms that control Sox2:Oct-3/4 target genes and argue that Sox2 functions as a molecular rheostat for the control of a key transcriptional regulatory network.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding sites 3aembryogenesis 3aembryonic stem cells 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aneoplasm cells 3anucleic acids 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation1 aKopp, Janel1 aMallanna, Sunil1 aDesler, Michelle1 aChakravarthy, Harini1 aWilder, Phillip J.1 aBernadt, Cory1 aRizzino, Angie0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Mar., v. 35, no. 6 p.1773-1786x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm0593Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02388naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002300179245006900202300001800271506007600289520097900365506003701344650000801381650001401389650002501403650002001428650001001448650001101458650001901469650001401488650001901502650002501521700002401546700002601570700002401596773008201620852000901702856007801711856007401789930003301863946001101896990002301907655001201930IND4391158120221207085452.0070506e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439115812DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm0612doi7 aPMC18746092pmcid7 a173320152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro, Mauro A.A.10aImpaired expression of NER gene network in sporadic solid tumors  ap. 1859-1867.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNucleotide repair genes are not generally altered in sporadic solid tumors. However, point mutations are found scattered throughout the genome of cancer cells indicating that the repair pathways are dysfunctional. To address this point, in this work we focus on the expression pathways rather than in the DNA structure of repair genes related to either genome stability or essential metabolic functions. We present here a novel statistical analysis comparing ten gene expression pathways in human normal and cancer cells using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data. We find that in cancer cells nucleotide-excision repair (NER) and apoptosis are the most impaired pathways and have a highly altered diversity of gene expression profile when compared to normal cells. We propose that genome point mutations in sporadic tumors can be explained by a structurally conserved NER with a functional disorder generated from its entanglement with the apoptosis gene network.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aapoptosis 3abiochemical pathways 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apoint mutation 3astatistical analysis1 aMombach, JosÃ© C.M.1 ade Almeida, Rita M.C.1 aMoreira, JosÃ© C.F.0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Mar., v. 35, no. 6 p.1859-1867x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm0613Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03254naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001800179245008500197300001800282500001500300506007600315520145100391506003701842650001101879650002301890650001401913650002201927650001901949650002001968650001301988650001102001650001602012650001902028650001202047650001302059650001202072650001802084650002202102650001802124653001002142700003202152700002002184700002002204700002002224700001702244700002902261700001902290700002102309700002302330773008202353852000902435856007802444856007402522930003302596946001102629655001202640IND4391158720221207085444.0070506e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439115872DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm0872doi7 aPMC18746212pmcid7 a173320122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGog, Julia R.10aCodon conservation in the influenza A virus genome defines RNA packaging signals  ap. 1897-1907.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenome segmentation facilitates reassortment and rapid evolution of influenza A virus. However, segmentation complicates particle assembly as virions must contain all eight vRNA species to be infectious. Specific packaging signals exist that extend into the coding regions of most if not all segments, but these RNA motifs are poorly defined. We measured codon variability in a large dataset of sequences to identify areas of low nucleotide sequence variation independent of amino acid conservation in each segment. Most clusters of codons showing very little synonymous variation were located at segment termini, consistent with previous experimental data mapping packaging signals. Certain internal regions of conservation, most notably in the PA gene, may however signify previously unidentified functions in the virus genome. To experimentally test the bioinformatics analysis, we introduced synonymous mutations into conserved codons within known packaging signals and measured incorporation of the mutant segment into virus particles. Surprisingly, in most cases, single nucleotide changes dramatically reduced segment packaging. Thus our analysis identifies cis-acting sequences in the influenza virus genome at the nucleotide level. Furthermore, we propose that strain-specific differences exist in certain packaging signals, most notably the haemagglutinin gene; this finding has major implications for the evolution of pandemic viruses.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3avirion 3asequence diversity 3aevolution 3aInfluenza A virus 3abioinformatics 3adata collection 3amutation 3acodons 3aamino acids 3ahemagglutinins 3amutants 3apandemic 3aviruses 3anucleic acids 3anucleotide motifs 3aRNA packaging 0agenes1 aAfonso, Emmanuel Dos Santos1 aDalton, Rosa M.1 aLeclercq, India1 aTiley, Laurence1 aElton, Debra1 avon Kirchbach, Johann C.1 aNaffakh, Nadia1 aEscriou, Nicolas1 aDigard, P.q(Paul)0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Mar., v. 35, no. 6 p.1897-1907x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm0873Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02608naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002700179245009800206300001800304506007600322520114700398506003701545650000801582650001501590650001701605650001201622650002201634650000901656650003001665700002401695700002401719700002601743700002801769700001901797700002401816700002301840773008201863852000901945856007801954856007402032930003302106946001102139655001202150IND4391161220221207085452.0070506e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439116122DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm0642doi7 aPMC18746122pmcid7 a173443222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaus-Drobek, Magdalena10aRestriction endonuclease MvaI is a monomer that recognizes its target sequence asymmetrically  ap. 2035-2046.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRestriction endonuclease MvaI recognizes the sequence CC/WGG (W stands for A or T, '/' designates the cleavage site) and generates products with single nucleotide 5'-overhangs. The enzyme has been noted for its tolerance towards DNA modifications. Here, we report a biochemical characterization and crystal structures of MvaI in an apo-form and in a complex with target DNA at 1.5 Ã resolution. Our results show that MvaI is a monomer and recognizes its pseudosymmetric target sequence asymmetrically. The enzyme consists of two lobes. The catalytic lobe anchors the active site residues Glu36, Asp50, Glu55 and Lys57 and contacts the bases from the minor grove side. The recognition lobe mediates all major grove interactions with the bases. The enzyme in the crystal is bound to the strand with T at the center of the recognition sequence. The crystal structure with calcium ions and DNA mimics the prereactive state. MvaI shows structural similarities to BcnI, which cleaves the related sequence CC/SGG and to MutH enzyme, which is a component of the DNA repair machinery, and nicks one DNA strand instead of making a double-strand break.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aactive sites 3acalcium 3acrystal structure 3aions 3arestriction endonucleases1 aCzapinska, Honorata1 aSokoÅowska, Monika1 aTamulaitis, Gintautas1 aSzczepanowski, Roman H.1 aUrbanke, Claus1 aSiksnys, Virginijus1 aBochtler, Matthias0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Mar., v. 35, no. 6 p.2035-2046x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm0643Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02867naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002200179245007400201300001800275506007600293520135700369506003701726650000801763650001601771650002201787650001601809650001301825650002001838650003001858650003001888650003001918650001101948700002101959700002801980700002102008700002402029700002202053773008202075852000902157856007802166856007402244930003302318946001102351990002302362655001202385IND4391160320221207074645.0070506e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439116032DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm0412doi7 aPMC18746032pmcid7 a173414632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBitinaite, Jurate10aUSERTM friendly DNA engineering and cloning method by uracil excision  ap. 1992-2002.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHere we report a PCR-based DNA engineering technique for seamless assembly of recombinant molecules from multiple components. We create cloning vector and target molecules flanked with compatible single-stranded (ss) extensions. The vector contains a cassette with two inversely oriented nicking endonuclease sites separated by restriction endonuclease site(s). The spacer sequences between the nicking and restriction sites are tailored to create ss extensions of custom sequence. The vector is then linearized by digestion with nicking and restriction endonucleases. To generate target molecules, a single deoxyuridine (dU) residue is placed 6-10 nt away from the 5'-end of each PCR primer. 5' of dU the primer sequence is compatible either with an ss extension on the vector or with the ss extension of the next-in-line PCR product. After amplification, the dU is excised from the PCR products with the USER enzyme leaving PCR products flanked by 3' ss extensions. When mixed together, the linearized vector and PCR products directionally assemble into a recombinant molecule through complementary ss extensions. By varying the design of the PCR primers, the protocol is easily adapted to perform one or more simultaneous DNA manipulations such as directional cloning, site-specific mutagenesis, sequence insertion or deletion and sequence assembly.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3achemical elements 3aengineering 3aexcision 3agenetic vectors 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3auracil1 aRubino, Michelle1 aVarma, Kamini Hingorani1 aSchildkraut, Ira1 aVaisvila, Romualdas1 aVaiskunaite, Rita0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Mar., v. 35, no. 6 p.1992-2002x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm0413Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01855naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100003100149245008000180300001600260500002400276520088600300650002301186650002301209650002901232650002201261650001401283650001001297650002301307700002301330773009001353852000901443856008901452655001201541IND4463778620221122010320.0120802s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446377862DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00256-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWanakhachornkrai, Pitipong10aComparison of determination method for volatile compounds in Thai soy sauce  ap. 619-629.  aIncludes references  aDynamic headspace (DHS) sampling, direct solvent extraction (DSE) and vacuum simultaneous steam distillationâsolvent extraction (VâSDE) were used for sample preparation in volatile compound analysis in Thai soy sauce.

A comparative study of volatile compounds obtained from these preparation techniques was performed. Some similarities were observed among different characteristic volatile profiles obtained from each preparation technique. Highly volatile compounds were detected only by DHS whereas DSE and VâSDE gave a wide spectrum of chemical classes of compounds detected. Moreover, differences of volatile compounds detected from both soy sauces were noted. This might be due to the differences of production process employed and strains of microorganism used. 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amass spectrometry 3asoy sauce 3asteam 3avolatile compounds1 aLertsiri, Sittiwat0 tFood chemistry.g2003 Dec., v. 83, no. 4 p.619-629dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00256-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02532naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002100179245006500200300001800265506007600283520094100359506003701300650001201337650002701349650003001376650001701406650001701423650001201440650001801452650001601470650001401486650001601500700001401516700002301530700001801553700002101571700002201592700002101614700001901635700002001654700001901674773008101693852000901774856007801783856007401861930003301935946001101968990002301979655001202002IND4391719120221207060526.0070523e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439171912DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm1612doi7 aPMC18888342pmcid7 a174523642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgiwara, Hideaki10aActin-related protein Arp4 functions in kinetochore assembly  ap. 3109-3117.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe actin-related proteins (Arps) comprise a conserved protein family. Arp4p is found in large multisubunits of the INO80 and SWR1 chromatin remodeling complexes and in the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex. Here we show that arp4 (arp4S23A/D159A) temperature-sensitive cells are defective in G2/M phase function. arp4 mutants are sensitive to the microtubule depolymerizing agent benomyl and arrest at G2/M phase at restrictive temperature. Arp4p is associated with centromeric and telomeric regions throughout cell cycle. Ino80p, Esa1p and Swr1p, components of the INO80, NuA4 and SWR1 complexes, respectively, also associate with centromeres. The association of many kinetochore components including Cse4p, a component of the centromere nucleosome, Mtw1p and Ctf3p is partially impaired in arp4 cells, suggesting that the G2/M arrest of arp4 mutant cells is due to a defect in formation of the chromosomal segregation apparatus.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abenomyl 3achromosome segregation 3ahistone acetyltransferase 3akinetochores 3amicrotubules 3amutants 3anucleic acids 3anucleosomes 3atelomeres 3atemperature1 aUi, Ayako1 aKawashima, Satoshi1 aKugou, Kazuto1 aOnoda, Fumitoshi1 aIwahashi, Hitoshi1 aHarata, Masahiko1 aOhta, Kunihiro1 aEnomoto, Takemi1 aSeki, Masayuki0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 May, v. 35, no. 9 p.3109-3117x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1613Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070523b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01985naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245007100171300001600242500002400258520095300282650001801235650001701253650001201270650004301282650001101325650001501336650001801351650001601369650001501385650001701400700003001417773009001447852000901537856008901546655001201635IND4463778220221122010356.0120802s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446377822DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00227-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSa, Marcela C. de10aCarotenoid composition of cooked green vegetables from restaurants  ap. 595-600.  aIncludes references  aIt is generally recognised that databases should be in terms of the food as eaten, but data on cooked foods are lacking. In this work, Î²-carotene, lutein, violaxanthin and neoxanthin in cooked green vegetables from restaurants were determined by HPLC. In general, there was no statistical difference in the carotenoid concentrations of vegetables taken from different restaurants. This result is surprising at first glance because of the many factors that can cause variation in the raw materials, aside from those brought about by the cooking conditions. However, the interplay of many factors might have masked individual effects. Moreover, taking the analytical sample from a large restaurant batch might have compensated the individual variations, giving more representative average concentrations. Between-lot variations of samples from the same restaurant were sometimes appreciable. Violaxanthin was the carotenoid most affected by cooking. 3abeta-carotene 3acooked foods 3acooking 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alutein 3aneoxanthin 3araw materials 3arestaurants 3avegetables 3aviolaxanthin1 aRodriguez-Amaya, Delia B.0 tFood chemistry.g2003 Dec., v. 83, no. 4 p.595-600dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00227-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03019naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002400179245011100203300001800314506007600332520125100408506003701659650002001696650003201716650001501748650001801763650001401781650002501795650001401820650000901834650001001843650001801853650002601871650001801897650002101915650002201936700002001958700003801978700001902016700002202035700002102057700002102078700002202099700002402121700002202145773008202167852000902249856007802258856007302336930003302409946001102442655001202453IND4392504620221207060608.0070617e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439250462DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm2122doi7 aPMC19042702pmcid7 a174523532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsunaga, Fujihiko10aGenomewide and biochemical analyses of DNA-binding activity of Cdc6/Orc1 and Mcm proteins in Pyrococcus sp  ap. 3214-3222.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe origin of DNA replication (oriC) of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi contains multiple ORB and mini-ORB repeats that show sequence similarities to other archaeal ORB (origin recognition box). We report here that the binding of Cdc6/Orc1 to a 5 kb region containing oriC in vivo was highly specific both in exponential and stationary phases, by means of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with hybridization on a whole genome microarray (ChIP-chip). The oriC region is practically the sole binding site for the Cdc6/Orc1, thereby distinguishing oriC in the 1.8 M bp genome. We found that the 5 kb region contains a previously unnoticed cluster of ORB and mini-ORB repeats in the gene encoding the small subunit (dp1) for DNA polymerase II (PolD). ChIP and the gel retardation analyses further revealed that Cdc6/Orc1 specifically binds both of the ORB clusters in oriC and dp1. The organization of the ORB clusters in the dp1 and oriC is conserved during evolution in the order Thermococcales, suggesting a role in the initiation of DNA replication. Our ChIP-chip analysis also revealed that Mcm alters the binding specificity to the oriC region according to the growth phase, consistent with its role as a licensing factor.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA replication 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aPyrococcus 3abinding sites 3achromatin 3adevelopmental stages 3aevolution 3agels 3agenes 3ahybridization 3amicroarray technology 3anucleic acids 3aprecipitin tests 3asequence homology1 aGlatigny, Annie1 aMucchielli-Giorgi, Marie-HÃ©lÃ¨ne1 aAgier, Nicolas1 aDelacroix, HervÃ©1 aMarisa, Laetitia1 aDurosay, Patrice1 aIshino, Yoshizumi1 aAggerbeck, Lawrence1 aForterre, Patrick0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 May, v. 35, no. 10 p.3214-3222x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm2123Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070617b20070702c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02881naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001300149245014500162300001600307500002400323500001500347520137600362650001201738650001801750650001801768650004301786650002101829650001201850650002001862650002201882650001901904650001901923650002001942650001701962650001201979650002101991650001002012650001302022650001002035650001302045650001302058650000702071650001802078653002102096700001802117700001402135700001402149773009002163852000902253856008902262655001202351IND4463778420221122010425.0120802s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446377842DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00254-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHela, W.10aDetermination of sulfonamides in animal tissues using cation exchange reversed phase sorbent for sample cleanup and HPLCâDAD for detection  ap. 601-608.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA new extraction method for 12 sulfonamides (sulfadiazine, sulfathiazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamerazine, sulfamethizole, sulfadimidine, sulfisoxazole, sulfamethoxazole, sulfatroxazole, sulfachlorpyrazine, sulfaphenazole and dapsone) in muscle, liver and kidney was developed. Fortified tissues of muscle, liver and kidney from bovine, pig and chicken were studied. A 10 g tissue and 10 ml acetonitrile were homogenised with an Ultra-Turrax. Next, the tissue was defatted with 5 ml n-hexane, centrifuged and filtered into flasks. Then the extracts were acidified with 10 ml hydrochloric acid and diluted with deionised water. Next, the samples were loaded on OASISÂ® MCX columns, which were conditioned with 5 ml methanol and 5 ml water. The columns were washed with 5 ml hydrochloric acid and 5 ml methanol. Then the samples were eluted with 5 ml ammonia solution/acetonitrile (v/v 1/19), allowed to dry under nitrogen and reconstituted in 200 Î¼l acetonitrile/water-mixture (v/v 1/4). The analyses were carried out on HPLCâDAD. Mobile phase was 0.01 M ammonium acetate pH 4.6 (A) and acetonitrile (B). Chromatographic separation was obtained by gradient elution (5% B to 40% within 16 min, back to 5% in 1 min, equilibration for 3 min). The sulfonamides were detected at 260 nm and dapsone at 294 nm. The detection limits of the HPLC method were 1 ppb for all analytes. 3aammonia 3asulfamerazine 3asulfathiazole 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3asulfamethoxazole 3adapsone 3adetection limit 3ahydrochloric acid 3amuscle tissues 3asulfamethazine 3acation exchange 3asulfadiazine 3akidneys 3aammonium acetate 3aswine 3achickens 3aliver 3amethanol 3anitrogen 3apH 3asulfapyridine 0asulfadimethazine1 aBrandtner, M.1 aWidek, R.1 aSchuh, R.0 tFood chemistry.g2003 Dec., v. 83, no. 4 p.601-608dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00254-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03318naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002000149245011200169300001600281500002400297520209200321650002002413650001002433650002702443650001202470650002102482650001002503650001302513650001902526650001202545650000702557650003902564650001802603650002502621650001502646650001902661650001202680700001602692773009002708852000902798856008902807655001202896IND4463780420221121231716.0120802s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446378042DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00086-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdebowale, K.O.10aFoaming, gelation and electrophoretic characteristics of mucuna bean (Mucuna pruriens) protein concentrates  ap. 237-246.  aIncludes references  aThe influences of pH, ionic strength and carbohydrates on the foaming and gelation properties of mucuna bean protein concentrate (MPC) were investigated. The protein concentrate was extracted by alkaline solubilization at pH8, followed by isoelectric precipitation at pH 4. The protein solubilityâpH profile showed minimum solubility (19.4%) at pH 4.0 (iso electric point) and maximum solubility (96%) was obtained at pH 12. Foaming capacity increased as the sample concentration increased. Increase in sample concentration also enhanced foaming stability at the various times studied. pH had a pronounced effect on the foaming properties of MPC. At pH 4, MPC exhibited minimum foaming capacity and maximum foaming stability. At lower pH values, there was enhanced foaming capacity and a reduction in the foaming stability. Alkaline media (pH 8 and 10) enhanced foaming but the foams were less stable. Sucrose, maltose, lactose and potato starch improved the foaming capacity and stability of the protein concentrate. Increase in ionic strength, from 0.1 to 0.4 M, improved foaming capacity and stability, while further increase beyond the ionic strength resulted in a reduction of the foaming properties. In all cases studied, gelation improved with increases in concentration of the protein concentrate in the media. Gelation properties were reduced in alkaline and acidic media, except at pH 4, where least gelation concentration endpoint (LGE) was 8. Gelation properties of MPC improved in the presence of carbohydrates in the mixture. Gel-forming properties also increased with increases in ionic strength of the media from 0.1 to 0.4 M, while further increase, from 0.6 to 1.0 M, reduced the gelation properties of MPC. Five polypeptide protein sub-units, at apparent molecular weights of 200, 116, 82, 63, and 59 kDa, were obtained from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions (without 2-mercaptoethanol). In addition, two other sub-units, at apparent molecular weights of 97 and 40 kDa, were obtained under reducing conditions (with 2-mercaptoethanol). 3aMucuna pruriens 3abeans 3achemical precipitation 3afoaming 3afoaming capacity 3afoams 3agelation 3aionic strength 3alactose 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apotato starch 3aprotein concentrates 3asolubility 3asolubilization 3asucrose1 aLawal, O.S.0 tFood chemistry.g2003 Nov., v. 83, no. 2 p.237-246dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00086-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04061naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001800179245014700197300001200344506007600356520256500432506003702997650002503034650001603059650002203075650001803097650001003115650001103125650001503136650002603151650001103177650001603188650002303204700001903227700002203246700001603268773007903284852000903363856007803372856007403450930003303524946001103557990002303568655001203591IND4391720020221207074054.0070523e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439172002DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm1302doi7 aPMC18888202pmcid7 a174309692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Taesung10aError-pooling-based statistical methods for identifying novel temporal replication profiles of human chromosomes observed by DNA tiling arrays  ap. e69.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStatistical analysis on tiling array data is extremely challenging due to the astronomically large number of sequence probes, high noise levels of individual probes and limited number of replicates in these data. To overcome these difficulties, we first developed statistical error estimation and weighted ANOVA modeling approaches to high-density tiling array data, especially the former based on an advanced error-pooling method to accurately obtain heterogeneous technical error of small-sample tiling array data. Based on these approaches, we analyzed the high-density tiling array data of the temporal replication patterns during cell-cycle S phase of synchronized HeLa cells on human chromosomes 21 and 22. We found many novel temporal replication patterns, identifying about 26% of over 1 million tiling array sequence probes with significant differential replication during the four 2-h time periods of S phase. Among these differentially replicated probes, 126 941 sequence probes were matched to 417 known genes. The majority of these genes were found to be replicated within one or two consecutive time periods, while the others were replicated at two non-consecutive time periods. Also, coding regions found to be more differentially replicated in particular time periods than noncoding regions in the gene-poor chromosome 21 (25% differentially replicated among genic probes versus 18.6% among intergenic probes), while such a phenomenon was less prominent in gene-rich chromosome 22. A rigorous statistical testing for local proximity of differentially replicated genic and intergenic probes was performed to identify significant stretches of differentially replicated sequence regions. From this analysis, we found that adjacent genes were frequently replicated at different time periods, potentially implying the existence of quite dense replication origins. Evaluating the conditional probability significance of identified gene ontology terms on chromosomes 21 and 22, we detected some over-represented molecular functions and biological processes among these differentially replicated genes, such as the ones relevant to hydrolase, transferase and receptor-binding activities. Some of these results were confirmed showing >70% consistency with cDNA microarray data that were independently generated in parallel with the tiling arrays. Thus, our improved analysis approaches specifically designed for high-density tiling array data enabled us to reliably and sensitively identify many novel temporal replication patterns on human chromosomes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of variance 3achromosomes 3acomplementary DNA 3agene ontology 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainterphase 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3aprobability 3areplication origin1 aKim, Youngchul1 aBekiranov, Stefan1 aLee, Jae K.0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 May, v. 35, no. 9 p.e69-e69x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1303Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070523b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02190naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001400149245010000163300001600263500002400279520108800303650001601391650001301407650002701420650001401447650000901461650002201470650002801492650001501520700001701535700002201552700001601574700002101590700001701611773009001628852000901718856008901727655001201816IND4463779020221121231734.0120802s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446377902DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00060-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnton, M.10aChemical and structural characterisation of low-density lipoproteins purified from hen egg yolk  ap. 175-183.  aIncludes references  aLow-density lipoproteins (LDL) are considered to be the main contributors to the exceptional emulsifying activity of hen egg yolk. However, the lack of understanding of the molecular basis for LDL functionality is a significant obstacle for good control of yolk emulsions. Consequently, we have attempted to link the structure and the characteristics of LDL with their emulsifying properties. After purification of LDL, we have determined their protein and lipid compositions, their ultrastructure, and then extracted their apoproteins for physicochemical characterisation. LDL are composed of about 12% of proteins and 87% of lipids and present a spherical shape with a mean diameter of about 35 nm. LDL solubility is high, whatever the medium conditions, because of their low density. LDL contain five major apoproteins out of which the apoprotein of 15 kDa is considered to be the most surface-active. After extraction, this apoprotein showed a high proportion of amphipathic Î±-helix chains, explaining the high capacity of this apoprotein to adsorb at the oilâwater interface. 3aapoproteins 3aegg yolk 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3ahens 3alipid composition 3alow density lipoprotein 3asolubility1 aMartinet, V.1 aDalgalarrondo, M.1 aBeaumal, V.1 aDavid-Briand, E.1 aRabesona, H.0 tFood chemistry.g2003 Nov., v. 83, no. 2 p.175-183dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00060-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01905naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100003200149245007700181300001600258500002400274520087600298650002201174650000801196650001001204650002601214650001701240650001101257650001301268650000901281650001901290700003001309700002801339773009001367852000901457856008901466655001201555IND4463779920221121231713.0120802s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446377992DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00068-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamÃ­rez JimÃ©nez, Antonio.10aEvolution of non-enzymatic browning during storage of infant rice cereal  ap. 219-225.  aIncludes references  aNon-enzymatic browning, during the storage of infant rice cereals, was assessed by determinations of furosine, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), colour, and available lysine. Cereal samples were stored at 32 or 55 Â°C for 1, 3, 6, or 12 months in air or nitrogen atmospheres. Samples were also stored at 25 or 55 Â°C under modified water activity (A(w)=0.65) conditions for 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks. Furosine, HMF and colour are useful indicators in accelerated storage (55 Â°C) under both normal and elevated A(w) conditions. Colour is also useful for controlling storage at 25 and 32 Â°C. After 1 year of storage, there was a loss in available lysine of 7.14% at 32 Â°C and 24.5% at 55 Â°C. Under high Aw (0.65) conditions, this loss was 12.9% at 25 Â°C and 52.9% at 55 Â°C after 1 month of storage.

However, its role in tissue-specific expression is not known. For example, differing modes of its recognition by general transcription machinery can provide an additional layer of control within which a single tissue-restricted transcription factor may operate. Erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF) is a hematopoietic-specific transcription factor that is critical for the activation of subset of erythroid genes. We find that EKLF interacts with TATA binding protein-associated factor 9 (TAF9), which leads to important consequences for expression of adult Î²-globin. First, TAF9 functionally supports EKLF activity by enhancing its ability to activate the Î²-globin gene. Second, TAF9 interacts with a conserved Î²-globin downstream promoter element, and ablation of this interaction by Î²-thalassemia-causing mutations decreases its promoter activity and disables superactivation. Third, depletion of EKLF prevents recruitment of TAF9 to the Î²-globin promoter, whereas depletion of TAF9 drastically impairs Î²-promoter activity. However, a TAF9-independent mode of EKLF transcriptional activation is exhibited by the Î±-hemoglobin-stabilizing protein (AHSP) gene, which does not contain a discernable downstream promoter element. In this case, TAF9 does not enhance EKLF activity and depletion of TAF9 has no effect on AHSP promoter activation. These studies demonstrate that EKLF directs different modes of tissue-specific transcriptional activation depending on the architecture of its target core promoter.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aadults 3agenes 3amutation 3apromoter regions 3atransactivators 3atranscriptional activation1 aCohet, Nathalie1 aMorlÃ©, FranÃ§ois1 aBieker, James J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 17, v. 106, no. 11 p.4213-4218dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08083471063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02687naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245007700200300001800277506007600295520104800371506003701419650003101456650001101487650001801498650002901516650002201545650002401567650001801591650001101609650001801620650002901638650001201667700001701679700001201696700002001708700002501728700002101753700001901774700002201793700002201815700002001837773017401857852000902031856008302040930003302123946001302156655001202169IND4418019520221207075944.0090320e20090317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441801952DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08120711062doi7 aPMC26573832pmcid7 a192463762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Junhua10aAtomic structure reveals the unique capsid organization of a dsRNA virus  ap. 4225-4230.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFor most dsRNA viruses, the genome-enclosing capsid comprises 120 copies of a single capsid protein (CP) organized into 60 icosahedrally equivalent dimers, generally identified as 2 nonsymmetricallyinteracting CP molecules with extensive lateral contacts. The crystal structure of a partitivirus, Penicillium stoloniferum virus F (PsV-F), reveals a different organization, in which the CP dimer is related by almost-perfect local 2-fold symmetry, forms prominent surface arches, and includes extensive structure swapping between the 2 subunits. An electron cryomicroscopy map of PsV-F shows that the disordered N terminus of each CP molecule interacts with the dsRNA genome and probably participates in its packaging or transcription. Intact PsV-F particles mediate semiconservative transcription, and transcripts are likely to exit through negatively charged channels at the icosahedral 5-fold axes. Other findings suggest that the PsV-F capsid is assembled from dimers of CP dimers, with an arrangement similar to flavivirus E glycoproteins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPenicillium brevicompactum 3acapsid 3acoat proteins 3acryo-electron microscopy 3acrystal structure 3adouble-stranded RNA 3adsRNA viruses 3agenome 3aglycoproteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviruses1 aDong, Liping1 aLin, Li1 aOchoa, Wendy F.1 aSinkovits, Robert S.1 aHavens, Wendy M.1 aNibert, Max L.1 aBaker, Timothy S.1 aGhabrial, Said A.1 aTao, Yizhi Jane0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 17, v. 106, no. 11 p.4225-4230dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08120711063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02303naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245011400205300001800319506007600337520103100413506003701444650002001481650001301501650002101514650001901535650000801554650002101562650001301583700002101596773017401617852000901791856008301800930003301883946001301916655001201929IND4418017720221207075939.0090320e20090317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441801772DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08124091062doi7 aPMC26574382pmcid7 a192463782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ding-Shyue10aOrdered water structure at hydrophobic graphite interfaces observed by 4D, ultrafast electron crystallography  ap. 4122-4126.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInterfacial water has unique properties in various functions. Here, using 4-dimensional (4D), ultrafast electron crystallography with atomic-scale spatial and temporal resolution, we report study of structure and dynamics of interfacial water assembly on a hydrophobic surface. Structurally, vertically stacked bilayers on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surface were determined to be ordered, contrary to the expectation that the strong hydrogen bonding of water on hydrophobic surfaces would dominate with suppressed interfacial order. Because of its terrace morphology, graphite plays the role of a template. The dynamics is also surprising. After the excitation of graphite by an ultrafast infrared pulse, the interfacial ice structure undergoes nonequilibrium "phase transformation" identified in the hydrogen-bond network through the observation of structural isosbestic point. We provide the time scales involved, the nature of ice-graphite structural dynamics, and relevance to properties related to confined water.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acrystallography 3agraphene 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aice 3aphase transition 3aterraces1 aZewail, Ahmed H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 17, v. 106, no. 11 p.4122-4126dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08124091063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02634naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245011100204300001800315506007600333520098300409506003701392650000801429650002701437650001901464650001901483650001101502650001401513650002201527650002201549650002901571650002101600650001901621700001801640700002401658700002401682700002301706700002101729700002301750700002001773700002301793773017401816852000901990856008301999930003302082946001302115655001202128IND4418018320221207074059.0090320e20090317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441801832DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08133601062doi7 aPMC26574352pmcid7 a192516412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeiman, Petr G.10aType VI secretion apparatus and phage tail-associated protein complexes share a common evolutionary origin  ap. 4154-4159.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtein secretion is a common property of pathogenic microbes. Gram-negative bacterial pathogens use at least 6 distinct extracellular protein secretion systems to export proteins through their multilayered cell envelope and in some cases into host cells. Among the most widespread is the newly recognized Type VI secretion system (T6SS) which is composed of 15-20 proteins whose biochemical functions are not well understood. Using crystallographic, biochemical, and bioinformatic analyses, we identified 3 T6SS components, which are homologous to bacteriophage tail proteins. These include the tail tube protein; the membrane-penetrating needle, situated at the distal end of the tube; and another protein associated with the needle and tube. We propose that T6SS is a multicomponent structure whose extracellular part resembles both structurally and functionally a bacteriophage tail, an efficient machine that translocates proteins and DNA across lipid membranes into cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aGram-negative bacteria 3abacteriophages 3abioinformatics 3alipids 3apathogens 3aprotein secretion 3aprotein transport 3atype VI secretion system 3aviral morphology 3aviral proteins1 aBasler, Marek1 aRamagopal, Udupi A.1 aBonanno, Jeffrey B.1 aSauder, J.

Posttransplant antibody responses were measured by paired comparative analysis of pretransplant and posttransplant serum samples from 18 pediatric renal transplant recipients, measured against 5,056 unique protein targets on the ProtoArray platform. The specificity of antibody responses were measured against gene expression levels specific to the kidney, and 2 other randomly selected organs (heart and pancreas), by integrated genomics, employing the mapping of transcription and ProtoArray platform measures, using AILUN. The likelihood of posttransplant non-HLA targets being recognized preferentially in any of 7 microdissected kidney compartments was also examined. In addition to HLA targets, non-HLA immune responses, including anti-MICA antibodies, were detected against kidney compartment-specific antigens, with highest posttransplant recognition for renal pelvis and cortex specific antigens. The compartment specificity of selected antibodies was confirmed by IHC. In conclusion, this study provides an immunogenic and anatomic roadmap of the most likely non-HLA antigens that can generate serological responses after renal transplantation. Correlation of the most significant non-HLA antibody responses with transplant health and dysfunction are currently underway.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3aantibody specificity 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3acortex 3agene expression 3agenomics 3aheart 3aimmune response 3akidney transplant 3akidneys 3apancreas 3apelvis 3aserodiagnosis 3atranscriptome1 aWadia, Persis1 aChen, Rong1 aKambham, Neeraja1 aNaesens, Maarten1 aSigdel, Tara K.1 aMiklos, David B.1 aSarwal, Minnie M.1 aButte, Atul J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 17, v. 106, no. 11 p.4148-4153dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09005631063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03194naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245008700206300001800293506007600311520144200387506003701829650002901866650002201895650002001917650002001937650002001957650001001977650004201987650001102029650001302040650001902053650002502072650001402097650001302111650002102124650002202145650000902167650002902176650001402205700001802219700001202237700001602249700001602265700002102281700001402302773017402316852000902490856008302499930003302582946001302615655001202628IND4417722320221207074104.0090313e20090310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441772232DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08134031062doi7 aPMC26459122pmcid7 a192341132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoder-Himes, D.R.10aMapping the Burkholderia cenocepacia niche response via high-throughput sequencing  ap. 3976-3981.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDetermining how an organism responds to its environment by altering gene expression is key to understanding its ecology. Here, we used RNA-seq to comprehensively and quantitatively assess the transcriptional response of the bacterial opportunistic cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogen and endemic soil dweller, Burkholderia cenocepacia, in conditions mimicking these 2 environments. By sequencing 762 million bases of cDNA from 2 closely related B. cenocepacia strains (one isolated from a CF patient and one from soil), we identified a number of potential virulence factors expressed under CF-like conditions, whereas genes whose protein products are involved in nitrogen scavenging and 2-component sensing were among those induced under soil-like conditions. Interestingly, 13 new putative noncoding RNAs were discovered using this technique, 12 of which are preferentially induced in the soil environment, suggesting that ncRNAs play an important role in survival in the soil. In addition, we detected a surprisingly large number of regulatory differences between the 2 strains, which may represent specific adaptations to the niches from which each strain was isolated, despite their high degree of DNA sequence similarity. Compared with the CF strain, the soil strain shows a stronger global gene expression response to its environment, which is consistent with the need for a more dynamic reaction to the heterogeneous conditions of soil.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBurkholderia cenocepacia 3acomplementary DNA 3acystic fibrosis 3aedaphic factors 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aniches 3anitrogen 3anon-coding RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3apatients 3aprotein products 3asequence homology 3asoil 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirulence1 aChain, P.S.G.1 aZhu, Y.1 aWurtzel, O.1 aRubin, E.M.1 aTiedje, James M.1 aSorek, R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 10, v. 106, no. 10 p.3976-3981dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08134031063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090314b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03684naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002800184245009000212300001800302506007600320520180300396506003702199650002202236650001202258650001602270650003002286650002802316650002902344650000902373650002102382650001502403650002002418650002302438700001602461700002102477700002102498700002502519700002202544700002202566700002202588700002102610700001802631700001702649700002202666700002002688700002202708700002402730700002802754773017402782852000902956856008302965930003303048946001303081655001203094IND4417721420221207074051.0090313e20090310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441772142DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09001891062doi7 aPMC26466242pmcid7 a192375562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbrahamsson, Annelie E.10aGlycogen synthase kinase 3Î² missplicing contributes to leukemia stem cell generation  ap. 3925-3929.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent evidence suggests that a rare population of self-renewing cancer stem cells (CSC) is responsible for cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) represents an important paradigm for understanding the genetic and epigenetic events involved in CSC production. CML progresses from a chronic phase (CP) in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that harbor the BCR-ABL translocation, to blast crisis (BC), characterized by aberrant activation of Î²-catenin within granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP). A major barrier to predicting and inhibiting blast crisis transformation has been the identification of mechanisms driving Î²-catenin activation. Here we show that BC CML myeloid progenitors, in particular GMP, serially transplant leukemia in immunocompromised mice and thus are enriched for leukemia stem cells (LSC). Notably, cDNA sequencing of Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway regulatory genes, including adenomatous polyposis coli, GSK3Î², axin 1, Î²-catenin, lymphoid enhancer factor-1, cyclin D1, and c-myc, revealed a novel in-frame splice deletion of the GSK3Î² kinase domain in the GMP of BC samples that was not detectable by sequencing in blasts or normal progenitors. Moreover, BC CML progenitors with misspliced GSK3Î² have enhanced Î²-catenin expression as well as serial engraftment potential while reintroduction of full-length GSK3Î² reduces both in vitro replating and leukemic engraftment. We propose that CP CML is initiated by BCR-ABL expression in an HSC clone but that progression to BC may include missplicing of GSK3Î² in GMP LSC, enabling unphosphorylated Î²-catenin to participate in LSC self-renewal. Missplicing of GSK3Î² represents a unique mechanism for the emergence of BC CML LSC and might provide a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomplementary DNA 3acyclins 3aepigenetics 3aglycogen synthase kinases 3aguanosine monophosphate 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3amice 3amyeloid leukemia 3aprediction 3aregulator genes 3atau-protein kinase1 aGeron, Ifat1 aGotlib, Jason R.1 aDao, Kim-Hien T.1 aBarroga, Charlene F.1 aNewton, Isabel G.1 aGiles, Francis J.1 aDurocher, Jeffrey1 aCreusot, Remi S.1 aKarimi, Mobin1 aJones, Carol1 aZehnder, James L.1 aKeating, Armand1 aNegrin, Robert S.1 aWeissman, Irving L.1 aJamieson, Catriona H.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 10, v. 106, no. 10 p.3925-3929dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09001891063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090314b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03180naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245013700206300001800343506007600361520157300437506003702010650002702047650001402074650001502088650002002103650002202123650002002145650001402165650002702179650001602206650002502222650002302247700001302270700001702283700002302300700002002323700002502343700001802368773017402386852000902560856008302569930003302652946001302685655001202698IND4417721620221207074006.0090313e20090310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441772162DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08094141062doi7 aPMC26561832pmcid7 a192235832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaustin, Benjamin10aMechanism of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL inhibition of NLRP1 inflammasome: Loop domain-dependent suppression of ATP binding and oligomerization  ap. 3935-3940.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNLRP1 (NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 1) is a contributor to innate immunity involved in intracellular sensing of pathogens, as well as danger signals related to cell injury. NLRP1 is one of the core components of caspase-1-activating platforms termed "inflammasomes," which are involved in proteolytic processing of interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) and in cell death. We previously discovered that anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL bind to and inhibit NLRP1 in cells. Using an in vitro reconstituted system employing purified recombinant proteins, we studied the mechanism by which Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL inhibit NLRP1. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL inhibited caspase-1 activation induced by NLRP1 in a concentration-dependent manner, with Ki [almost equal to] 10 nM. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were also determined to inhibit ATP binding to NLRP1, which is required for oligomerization of NLRP1, and Bcl-XL was demonstrated to interfere with NLRP1 oligomerization. Deletion of the flexible loop regions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, which are located between the first and second Î±-helices of these anti-apoptotic proteins and which were previously shown to be required for binding NLRP1, abrogated ability to inhibit caspase-1 activation, ATP binding and oligomerization of NLRP1. Conversely, synthetic peptides corresponding to the loop region of Bcl-2 were sufficient to potently inhibit NLRP1. These findings thus demonstrate that the loop domain is necessary and sufficient to inhibit NLRP1, providing insights into the mechanism by which anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL inhibit NLRP1.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acaspase-1 3acell death 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aoligomerization 3apathogens 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3aproteolysis 3arecombinant proteins 3asynthetic peptides1 aChen, Ya1 aZhai, Dayong1 aNegrate, Gaelle Le1 aLartigue, Lydia1 aSatterthwait, Arnold1 aReed, John C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 10, v. 106, no. 10 p.3935-3940dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08094141063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090314b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03125naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245013800208300001800346506007600364520145200440506003701892650001001929650001901939650002101958650002101979650002002000650001502020650001302035650001402048650001002062700002202072700002002094700002102114700001802135700001302153700001902166700001902185700002102204700002602225700002302251700002102274773017402295852000902469856008302478930003302561946001302594655001202607IND4417722220221207074048.0090313e20090310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441772222DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08131881062doi7 aPMC26459112pmcid7 a192341222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalasaz, AmirAli H.10aIsolating highly enriched populations of circulating epithelial cells and other rare cells from blood using a magnetic sweeper device  ap. 3970-3975.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe enumeration of rare circulating epithelial cells (CEpCs) in the peripheral blood of metastatic cancer patients has shown promise for improved cancer prognosis. Moving beyond enumeration, molecular analysis of CEpCs may provide candidate surrogate endpoints to diagnose, treat, and monitor malignancy directly from the blood samples. Thorough molecular analysis of CEpCs requires the development of new sample preparation methods that yield easily accessible and purified CEpCs for downstream biochemical assays. Here, we describe a new immunomagnetic cell separator, the MagSweeper, which gently enriches target cells and eliminates cells that are not bound to magnetic particles. The isolated cells are easily accessible and can be extracted individually based on their physical characteristics to deplete any cells nonspecifically bound to beads. We have shown that our device can process 9 mL of blood per hour and captures >50% of CEpCs as measured in spiking experiments. We have shown that the separation process does not perturb the gene expression of rare cells. To determine the efficiency of our platform in isolating CEpCs from patients, we have isolated CEpCs from all 47 tubes of 9-mL blood samples collected from 17 women with metastatic breast cancer. In contrast, we could not find any circulating epithelial cells in samples from 5 healthy donors. The isolated CEpCs are all stored individually for further molecular analysis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3abreast neoplasms 3aepithelial cells 3agene expression 3ametastasis 3apatients 3aprognosis 3awomen1 aPowell, Ashley A.1 aHuber, David E.1 aBerbee, James G.1 aRoh, Kyung-Ho1 aYu, Wong1 aXiao, Wenzhong1 aDavis, Mark M.1 aPease, R.

SOX4 expression is elevated in many types of tumors; however, its role in DDR is still largely unknown. Here, we show that SOX4, a new DNA damage sensor, is required for the activation of p53 tumor suppressor in response to DNA damage. Notably, SOX4 interacts with and stabilizes p53 protein by blocking Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, SOX4 enhances p53 acetylation by interacting with p300/CBP and facilitating p300/CBP/p53 complex formation. In concert with these results, SOX4 promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and it inhibits tumorigenesis in a p53-dependent manner. Therefore, these findings highlight SOX4 as a potential key factor in regulating DDR-associated cancer.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3aacetylation 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenesis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3aneoplasms 3aubiquitination1 aZhao, Jie1 aZhang, Wei-Na1 aLi, Hui-Yan1 aRui, Mu.1 aZhou, Tao1 aZhang, Hai-Ying1 aGong, Wei-Li1 aYu, Ming1 aMan, Jiang-Hong1 aZhang, Pei-Jing1 aLi, Ai-Ling1 aZhang, Xue-Min0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 10, v. 106, no. 10 p.3788-3793dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08101471063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090314b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03229naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245009300202300001800295506007600313520158600389506003701975650001902012650001202031650001502043650001002058650001902068650001302087650001302100650001302113650001802126650001502144650001902159650001202178650001202190650001202202650000902214700002602223700002202249700002002271700001902291700002102310700001902331700002502350773017402375852000902549856008302558930003302641946001302674655001202687IND4417718320221207052654.0090313e20090310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441771832DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08127701062doi7 aPMC26561502pmcid7 a192235902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWille, Holger10aSurface charge of polyoxometalates modulates polymerization of the scrapie prion protein  ap. 3740-3745.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPrions are composed solely of an alternatively folded isoform of the prion protein (PrP), designated PrPSc. N-terminally truncated PrPSc, denoted PrP 27-30, retains infectivity and polymerizes into rods with the ultrastructural and tinctorial properties of amyloid. We report here that some polyoxometalates (POMs) favor polymerization of PrP 27-30 into prion rods, whereas other POMs promote assembly of the protein into 2D crystals. Antibodies reacting with epitopes in denatured PrP 27-30 also bound to 2D crystals treated with 3 M urea. These same antibodies did not bind to either native PrPSc or untreated 2D crystals. By using small, spherical POMs with Keggin-type structures, the central heteroatom was found to determine whether prion rods or 2D crystals were preferentially formed. An example of a Keggin-type POM with a phosphorous heteroatom is the phosphotungstate anion (PTA). Both PTA and a Keggin-type POM with a silicon heteratom have low-charge densities and favor formation of prion rods. In contrast, POMs with boron or hydrogen heteroatoms exhibiting higher negative charges encouraged 2D crystal formation. The 2D crystals of PrP 27-30 produced by selective precipitation with POMs were larger and more well ordered than those obtained by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Our findings argue that the negative charge of Keggin-type POMs determines the quaternary structure adopted by PrP 27-30. The mechanism by which POMs function in competing prion polymerization pathways--one favoring 2D crystals and the other, amyloid fibrils--remains to be established.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPrPSc proteins 3aamyloid 3aantibodies 3aboron 3acentrifugation 3acrystals 3aepitopes 3ahydrogen 3apathogenicity 3aphosphorus 3apolymerization 3ascrapie 3asilicon 3asucrose 3aurea1 aShanmugam, Maheswaran1 aMurugesu, Muralee1 aOllesch, Julian1 aStubbs, Gerald1 aLong, Jeffrey R.1 aSafar, Jiri G.1 aPrusiner, Stanley B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 10, v. 106, no. 10 p.3740-3745dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08127701063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090314b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03290naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001400184245011200198300001800310506007600328520149600404506003701900650003001937650001701967650001301984650001301997650001802010650001302028650002702041650002502068650003802093650002102131650001302152650001402165650002202179650003002201700001502231700001702246700001702263700001402280700001802294700001302312700001502325700001502340700001402355700001602369700001502385773017402400852000902574856008302583930003302666946001302699655001202712IND4417717920221207052720.0090313e20090310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441771792DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09002121062doi7 aPMC26561462pmcid7 a192251062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Qing12aA bacterial type III effector family uses the papain-like hydrolytic activity to arrest the host cell cycle  ap. 3716-3721.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPathogenic bacteria deliver effector proteins into host cells through the type III secretion apparatus to modulate the host function. We identify a family of proteins, homologous to the type III effector Cif from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, in pathogens including Yersinia, Photorhabdus, and Burkholderia that contain functional type III secretion systems. Like Cif, this family of proteins is capable of arresting the host cell cycle at Gâ/M. Structure of one of the family members, Cif homolog in Burkholderia pseudomallei (CHBP), reveals a papain-like fold and a conserved Cys-His-Gln catalytic triad despite the lack of primary sequence identity. For CHBP and Cif, only the putative catalytic Cys is susceptible to covalent modification by E-64, a specific inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteases. Unlike papain-like enzymes where the S2 site is the major determinant of cleavage-site specificity, CHBP has a characteristic negatively charged pocket occupying surface areas corresponding to the S1/S1' site in papain-like proteases. The negative charge is provided by a conserved aspartate, and the pocket best fits an arginine, as revealed by molecular docking analysis. Mutation analysis establishes the essential role of the catalytic triad and the negatively charged pocket in inducing cell cycle arrest in host cells. Our results demonstrate that bacterial pathogens have evolved a unique papain-like hydrolytic activity to block the normal host cell cycle progression.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBurkholderia pseudomallei 3aPhotorhabdus 3aYersinia 3aarginine 3aaspartic acid 3abacteria 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acysteine proteinases 3aenteropathogenic Escherichia coli 3amolecular models 3amutation 3apathogens 3asequence analysis 3atype III secretion system1 aCui, Jixin1 aZhu, Yongqun1 aWang, Guolun1 aHu, Liyan1 aLong, Chengzu1 aCao, Ran1 aLiu, Xinqi1 aHuang, Niu1 aChen, She1 aLiu, Liping1 aShao, Feng0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 10, v. 106, no. 10 p.3716-3721dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09002121063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090314b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03627naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002700184245006800211300001800279506007600297520185200373506003702225650001102262650002002273650001802293650001602311650002202327650001102349650001702360650002302377650002202400650001802422650001802440650002402458650001802482650003702500650001402537650002602551650001302577650003202590650002002622700002002642700001902662700001802681700002402699700002602723773017402749852000902923856008302932930003303015946001303048655001203061IND4417720720221207074821.0090313e20090310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441772072DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08133341062doi7 aPMC26561742pmcid7 a192289412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNold-Petry, Claudia A.13aIL-32-dependent effects of IL-1Î² on endothelial cell functions  ap. 3883-3888.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIncreasing evidence demonstrates that interleukin (IL)-32 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, inducing IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, and chemokines via nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and activating protein (AP)-1 activation. Here we report that IL-32 is expressed and is also functional in human vascular endothelial cells (EC) of various origins. Compared with primary blood monocytes, high levels of IL-32 are constitutively produced in human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC), aortic macrovascular EC, and cardiac as well as pulmonary microvascular EC. At concentrations as low as 0.1 ng/ml, IL-1Î² stimulated IL-32 up to 15-fold over constitutive levels, whereas 10 ng/ml of TNFÎ± or 100 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were required to induce similar quantities of IL-32. IL-1Î²-induced IL-32 was reduced by inhibition of the IÎºB kinase-Î²/NF-ÎºB and ERK pathways. In addition to IL-1Î², pro-coagulant concentrations of thrombin or fresh platelets increased IL-32 protein up to 6-fold. IL-1Î² and thrombin induced an isoform-switch in steady-state mRNA levels from IL-32Î±/Î³ to Î²/Îµ. Adult EC responded in a similar fashion. To prove functionality, we silenced endogenous IL-32 with siRNA, decreasing intracellular IL-32 protein levels by 86%. The knockdown of IL-32 resulted in reduction of constitutive as well as IL-1Î²-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (of 55% and 54%, respectively), IL-1Î± (of 62% and 43%), IL-6 (of 53% and 43%), and IL-8 (of 46% and 42%). In contrast, the anti-inflammatory/anti-coagulant CD141/thrombomodulin increased markedly when IL-32 was silenced. This study introduces IL-32 as a critical regulator of endothelial function, expanding the properties of this cytokine relevant to coagulation, endothelial inflammation, and atherosclerosis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aatherosclerosis 3acell adhesion 3acoagulation 3aendothelial cells 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1alpha 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3alipopolysaccharides 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amonocytes 3asmall interfering RNA 3athrombin 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aumbilical veins1 aNold, Marcel F.1 aZepp, Jarod A.1 aKim, Soo-Hyun1 aVoelkel, Norbert F.1 aDinarello, Charles A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 10, v. 106, no. 10 p.3883-3888dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08133341063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090314b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03034naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245005500205300001800260506007600278520175200354506003702106650003102143650001202174650001902186650002402205650003302229650002502262700002302287700003802310773017402348852000902522856008302531930003302614946001302647655001202660IND4417716720221207074829.0090313e20090310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441771672DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09001731062doi7 aPMC26453482pmcid7 a192289432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajda, Andrew J.10aNormal forms for reduced stochastic climate models  ap. 3649-3653.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe systematic development of reduced low-dimensional stochastic climate models from observations or comprehensive high-dimensional climate models is an important topic for atmospheric low-frequency variability, climate sensitivity, and improved extended range forecasting. Here techniques from applied mathematics are utilized to systematically derive normal forms for reduced stochastic climate models for low-frequency variables. The use of a few Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) (also known as Principal Component Analysis, Karhunen-LoÃ©ve and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition) depending on observational data to span the low-frequency subspace requires the assessment of dyad interactions besides the more familiar triads in the interaction between the low- and high-frequency subspaces of the dynamics. It is shown below that the dyad and multiplicative triad interactions combine with the climatological linear operator interactions to simultaneously produce both strong nonlinear dissipation and Correlated Additive and Multiplicative (CAM) stochastic noise. For a single low-frequency variable the dyad interactions and climatological linear operator alone produce a normal form with CAM noise from advection of the large scales by the small scales and simultaneously strong cubic damping. These normal forms should prove useful for developing systematic strategies for the estimation of stochastic models from climate data. As an illustrative example the one-dimensional normal form is applied below to low-frequency patterns such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in a climate model. The results here also illustrate the short comings of a recent linear scalar CAM noise model proposed elsewhere for low-frequency variability.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3ameteorological data 3aprincipal component analysis 3astochastic processes1 aFranzke, Christian1 aCrommelin, D.

Both by-products of ovine cheese manufacture were clarified by thermocalcic precipitation and microfiltration using two pore size membranes (0.65 and 0.20 Î¼m). Next, they were ultrafiltrated/diafiltrated, and then, the liophilization of the corresponding retentates was carried out. The functionality of these powders, as well as that of untreated ultrafiltrated whey protein concentrate (WPC) and microfiltration retentates powders, was evaluated. The clarification treatment increased solubility of the WPC produced from ovine whey and deproteinized ovine whey. Moreover, these products had foaming properties, whereas conventional WPC and microfiltration retentate powders (MFRP) were unable to produce foams. The whey product obtained after clarification using a 0.65 Î¼m microfiltration membrane had the best foaming properties. The clarification treatment did not significantly increase emulsifying activity and stability, except for the Sorelho product obtained using a 0.65 Î¼m membrane. MFRP from ovine whey and Sorelho, the by-products of the clarification procedure, showed similar solubility and higher emulsifying activity than conventional WPC, although their emulsion stability was lower. The clarification procedure studied, particularly when a 0.65 Î¼m microfiltration membrane was used, improved some functional properties of the whey and Sorelho protein concentrates, and also generated microfiltration retentates for potential use in food manufacturing. 3aprotein concentrates 3acheesemaking 3awhey protein 3asheep 3achemical precipitation 3afood industry 3abyproducts 3afoaming properties 3acheese whey 3amicrofiltration 3awhey 3asolubility 3aemulsifying properties 3afoams 3apowders 0aclarification 0aprecipitation1 aPereira, C.D.1 aCobos, A.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2004 July, v. 18, no. 4 p.601-610dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002200179245010300201300001800304506007600322520129700398506003701695650002101732650001801753650002101771650001301792650001901805650002301824650001201847650001801859650002401877650001401901650002101915650001801936650002301954650001401977650002501991700002402016700002402040700002102064700002202085700002202107773008302129852000902212856007802221856007302299930003302372946001102405655001202416IND4392811520221207074822.0070701e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439281152DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm3182doi7 aPMC19202582pmcid7 a175177722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmeres, Stefan L.10aRNA chaperone activity of L1 ribosomal proteins: phylogenetic conservation and splicing inhibition  ap. 3752-3763.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRNA chaperone activity is defined as the ability of proteins to either prevent RNA from misfolding or to open up misfolded RNA conformations. One-third of all large ribosomal subunit proteins from E. coli display this activity, with L1 exhibiting one of the highest activities. Here, we demonstrate via the use of in vitro trans- and cis-splicing assays that the RNA chaperone activity of L1 is conserved in all three domains of life. However, thermophilic archaeal L1 proteins do not display RNA chaperone activity under the experimental conditions tested here. Furthermore, L1 does not exhibit RNA chaperone activity when in complexes with its cognate rRNA or mRNA substrates. The evolutionary conservation of the RNA chaperone activity among L1 proteins suggests a functional requirement during ribosome assembly, at least in bacteria, mesophilic archaea and eukarya. Surprisingly, rather than facilitating catalysis, the thermophilic archaeal L1 protein from Methanococcus jannaschii (MjaL1) completely inhibits splicing of the group I thymidylate synthase intron from phage T4. Mutational analysis of MjaL1 excludes the possibility that the inhibitory effect is due to stronger RNA binding. To our knowledge, MjaL1 is the first example of a protein that inhibits group I intron splicing.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aMethanococcus 3aRNA conformation 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3acatalytic activity 3aintrons 3amessenger RNA 3amutational analysis 3aphylogeny 3aprotein subunits 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes 3athymidylate synthase1 aShcherbakov, Dmitry1 aNikonova, Ekaterina1 aPiendl, Wolfgang1 aSchroeder, RenÃ©e1 aSemrad, Katharina0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 June, v. 35, no. 11 p.3752-3763x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm3183Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070701b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02692naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245009500173300001600268500002400284500001500308520159600323650001701919650003401936650001301970650001801983650001902001650001802020650001202038650001902050650001502069650001202084651001202096653001902108773013402127852000902261856004802270655001202318IND4422837320221121034554.0090703e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442283732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-009-9183-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, H.

This review paper characterizes the status of the collective institutional response (government, industry, First Nation, community, civil society) to climate change in the forest sector of the Canadian province of Ontario, and highlights the presence and nature of inter-institutional networks as part of the response. Based on a synthesis of the commonalities in the public administration and policy literature on tackling wicked problems, and the resilience literature, inter-institutional networks, which foster exchange of different types of knowledge, are an important aspect of enhancing the adaptive capacity of social-ecological systems such as the forest sector. Based on a content analysis of publicly available documents and insights gained from representatives of government, community members and non-governmental organizations, mitigation and adaptations strategies are described. At the provincial level there have been some new innovations in inter-institutional networks, but expansion of the forest stakeholders involved in such networks would further enhance adaptive capacity. In particular, it is important to network with First Nations and other forest-dependent communities who have a heightened vulnerability to climate change. The presence of a collaborative capacity builder could foster the transfer, receipt and integration of knowledge across the networks, and ultimately build long-term collaborative problem-solving capacity in the Ontario forest sector. 3astakeholders 3anongovernmental organizations 3aindustry 3apublic policy 3aclimate change 3aFirst Nations 3asociety 3arisk reduction 3atechnology 3aforests 3aOntario 0anew technology0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2009 Aug., v. 14, no. 6 p.513-536dSpringer Netherlandsx1381-23867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-009-9183-8 7aarticle04658naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002200179245015800201300001600359500002400375506007600399520240300475506003702878650003502915650001602950650002102966650004302987650001103030650001803041650001303059650002203072650002603094650002103120650001103141650001803152650001303170650001403183650002503197650002003222650002503242650002603267650002003293650001003313650002103323650005203344650004703396650003103443650005303474650004603527650005303573650005003626700001603676700001903692700001903711700001803730700001703748773010003765852000903865856007803874856003203952655001203984IND4395598920221207054851.0070930e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439559892DNAL7 a176707512pmid7 aPMC27496242pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcm1532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinmacher, D.A.10aSomatic Embryogenesis in Peach Palm Using the Thin Cell Layer Technique: Induction, Morpho-histological Aspects and AFLP Analysis of Somaclonal Variation  ap. 699-709.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The thin cell layer (TCL) technique is based on the use of very small explants and has allowed enhanced in vitro morphogenesis in several plant species. The present study evaluated the TCL technique as a procedure for somatic embryo production and plantlet regeneration of peach palm. METHODS: TCL explants from different positions in the shoot apex and leaf sheath of peach palm were cultivated in MS culture medium supplemented with 0-600 Î¼M Picloram in the presence of activated charcoal. The production of primary calli and embryogenic calli was evaluated in these different conditions. Histological and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses were conducted to study in vitro morphogenetic responses and genetic stability, respectively, of the regenerated plantlets. KEY RESULTS: Abundant primary callus induction was observed from TCLs of the shoot meristem in culture media supplemented with 150-600 Î¼M Picloram (83-97 %, respectively). The production of embryogenic calli depends on Picloram concentration and explant position. The best response observed was 43 % embryogenic callus production from shoot meristem TCL on 300 Î¼M Picloram. In maturation conditions, 34 Â± 4 somatic embryos per embryogenic callus were obtained, and 45Â·0 Â± 3Â·4 % of these fully developed somatic embryos were converted, resulting in plantlets ready for acclimatization, of which 80 % survived. Histological studies revealed that the first cellular division events occurred in cells adjacent to vascular tissue, resulting in primary calli, whose growth was ensured by a meristematic zone. A multicellular origin of the resulting somatic embryos arising from the meristematic zone is suggested. During maturation, histological analyses revealed bipolarization of the somatic embryos, as well as the development of new somatic embryos. AFLP analyses revealed that 92 % of the regenerated plantlets were true to type. The use of TCL explants considerably improves the number of calli and somatic embryos produced in comparison with previously described protocols for in vitro regeneration of peach palm. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the TCL somatic embryogenesis protocol developed is feasible, although it still requires further optimization for in vitro multiplication of peach palm, especially the use of similar explants obtained from adult palm trees.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBactris gasipaes var. gasipaes 3aacclimation 3aactivated carbon 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3acallus 3aculture media 3aexplants 3agenetic stability 3ain vitro regeneration 3ain vitro studies 3aleaves 3amorphogenesis 3apicloram 3aplantlets 3aprimary productivity 3ashoot meristems 3asomaclonal variation 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asomatic embryos 3atrees 3avascular tissues 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aArecaceaexcytologyxembryologyxgenetics. 2aCloning, Organismxmethods 2aEmbryonic Developmentxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMeristemxcytologyxembryologyxgenetics. 2aPicloramxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aPlant Shootsxcytologyxembryologyxgenetics.1 aKrohn, N.G.1 aDantas, A.C.M.1 aStefenon, V.M.1 aClement, C.R.1 aGuerra, M.P.0 tAnnals of botany.g2007 Oct., v. 100, no. 4 p.699-709dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcm1533Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/ 7aarticle02028naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002500128245011700153300001600270520084500286650002201131650003201153650001201185650002701197650002201224650002001246650002001266650001301286650002301299650001801322650002201340650002201362700001501384700001501399700001701414700001601431700001601447773009001463852000901553939003301562946001101595655001201606IND9301900820221121025000.0930331e19930120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930190082DNAL7 a84295642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSankaranarayanan, R.10aCrystallization and preliminary X-ray studies of the basic lectin from winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus)  ap. 558-560.  aThe basic lectin from winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus) could be crystallized using polyethyleneglycol (PEG) 4000 (I), PEG 8000 (II) and 2-methylpentane-2,4-diol (MPD) (III) as precipitants.

By polymerase chain reaction techniques, cDNA clones of three isoabrins, carrying A and B-chain sequences, were isolated and their nucleotide sequences were determined. The isoabrins consist of an A-chain comprised of 250 of 251 amino acids, followed by a 10 amino acid linker and a B-chain of 267 amino acids. There is substantial conservation in the B-chain of the three isoabrins, with less than six amino acid substitutions, whereas as many as 46 amino acid substitutions occur in the A-chains. Based on the relationships between the biological activities and the putative amino acid sequences of the isoabrins, three isoabrins. abrin-a, -b and -d, could be identified and the potential epitope of immunological response of these isoabrins could be assigned. 3aphytotoxins 3aAbrus precatorius 3aimmunochemistry 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3aglycoproteins 2aAbrinxchemistryxgeneticsximmunology. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCross Reactions 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0agenbank/m98344 0aDNA 0agenbank/m98345 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/m983461 aLee, M.C.1 aLee, T.C.1 aLin, J.Y.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g1993 Jan. 5, v. 229, no. 1 p.263-267x0022-28367nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03026naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245007500147300001600222500001500238520166300253650003201916650001301948650001201961650002501973650002701998650001502025650001502040650002402055650002402079650002102103650002202124650002802146650002402174650002502198650002402223650001302247650001602260650002502276650002102301653002202322653002302344700002202367773009002389852000902479939003302488946001102521655001202532IND9301900720221121024939.0930331e19930120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930190072DNAL7 a84295582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdzhubei, A.A.10aLeft-handed polyproline II helices commonly occur in globular proteins  ap. 472-493.  a2019-12-05  aThe main-chain conformations of 80 proteins were analysed to identify helical structures that commonly occur but do not fall into the known classes of alpha-helix, 3(10)-helix and beta-sheet. The analysis yielded 96 occurrences of four or more sequential residues forming the threefold left-handed poly-L-proline II (PPII) helix. This contradicts the previously held opinion that left-handed helices are rare in globular proteins. The main-chain dihedral angles of these helices form a cluster in phi,psi space that has a maximum at -75 degrees, 145 degrees, corresponding to conformations with the number of residues per turn (n) = -3.0. We show that 51% of PPII-helices lie within the range of n = -3.0(+/- 0.2). It is shown that the PPII segments are distinct from the conformation typical of beta-pleated sheets. Although proline residues commonly occurred in PPII-helices, this side-chain is not obligatory, as 28 of these helices not contain proline. In addition, we found 120 segments with three C(alpha) atoms forming a PPII-helix. PPII-helices tend to occur on the surface of the protein and, having few main-chain hydrogen bonds with the rest of the protein, tend to be the more mobile segments of the molecule. The geometry of PPII helix allows the polypeptide chain to progress immediately from this conformation to right-handed alpha-helix and 3(10) helix, as well as to beta-sheet or reverse turn. We conclude that PPII-helices should be considered as a regular conformation and should be added to beta-sheets, alpha-helices and 3(10)-helices in databases of protein structures, in secondary structure prediction and in tertiary model-building. 3aprotein secondary structure 3aproteins 3aproline 3aamino acid sequences 3amolecular conformation 3aprediction 2aAlgorithms 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aComputer Simulation 2aHydrogen Bonding 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptidesxchemistry 2aProtein Conformation 2aProteinsxchemistry 2aSolvents 2aTemperature 2aTerminology as Topic 2aWaterxchemistry 0aprotein structure 0ahelical structures1 aSternberg, M.J.E.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g1993 Jan. 20, v. 229, no. 2 p.472-493x0022-28367nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02161naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002200128245008500150300001600235500001500251520076700266650001801033650002001051650003201071650002301103650001401126650002501140650001901165650001601184650002701200650002401227650002501251650002201276650002101298650002801319650002001347650003301367650002201400653002201422653003101444653002001475700001601495700001401511773008901525852000901614939003301623946001101656655001201667IND9301903020221121024925.0930331e19921105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930190302DNAL7 a14477832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChelvanayagam, G.10aAnatomy and evolution of proteins displaying the viral capsid jellyroll topology  ap. 220-242.  a2019-12-05  aIn this paper the anatomy of 25 structures containing a jellyroll motif, consisting of eight antiparallel beta-strands forming a so-called beta-barrel, was investigated. This involved performing a careful structural alignment based on hydrogen bonds for the equivalent regions of the tertiary folds and a subsequent analysis of conserved amino acids, equivalenced residue-residue contacts, and various parameters describing the size, shape and other geometrical characteristics of these regions. It was found that the jellyroll motif is best viewed as a two-sheet wedge structure rather than a barrel. The more conserved parameters are discussed. A model of evolutionary development for the jellyroll fold in the various protein and viral structures is proposed. 3aplant viruses 3aprotein folding 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3asequence alignment 3aevolution 3aamino acid sequences 3aviral proteins 3aAphthovirus 3amolecular conformation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBiological Evolution 2aCapsidxchemistry 2aHydrogen Bonding 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Folding 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aX-Ray Diffraction 0aprotein structure 0aFeline panleukopenia virus 0ajellyroll motif1 aHeringa, J.1 aArgos, P.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g1992 Nov. 5, v. 228, no. 1 p.220-242x0022-28367nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03427naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002300181245009000204300001800294500002400312506007600336520092000412506003701332650002301369650003601392650001001428650002201438650000901460650001101469650001201480650001601492650001401508650001401522650001001536650001401546650002401560650001201584650004001596650005001636650002301686650003301709650002601742650001401768650003701782650003601819650001101855650001801866650003601884650003601920650000901956650002401965650002801989650004302017650007502060650002202135650001002157650003102167650001402198700002202212700002302234700001802257700004102275700002202316700002202338700002002360700002302380700002402403773011702427852000902544856008002553655001202633IND4408025020221207054906.0080718s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440802502DNAL7 a184746392pmid7 aPMC24932142pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01568-072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFittipaldi, Nahuel10aD-Alanylation of Lipoteichoic Acid Contributes to the Virulence of Streptococcus suis  ap. 3587-3594.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe generated by allelic replacement a ÎdltA mutant of a virulent Streptococcus suis serotype 2 field strain and evaluated the contribution of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) D-alanylation to the virulence traits of this swine pathogen and zoonotic agent. The absence of LTA D-alanylation resulted in increased susceptibility to the action of cationic antimicrobial peptides. In addition, and in contrast to the wild-type strain, the ÎdltA mutant was efficiently killed by porcine neutrophils and showed diminished adherence to and invasion of porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells. Finally, the ÎdltA mutant was attenuated in both the CD1 mouse and porcine models of infection, probably reflecting a decreased ability to escape immune clearance mechanisms and an impaired capacity to move across host barriers. The results of this study suggest that LTA D-alanylation is an important factor in S. suis virulence.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptococcus suis 3aantimicrobial cationic peptides 3abrain 3aendothelial cells 3amice 3amodels 3amutants 3aneutrophils 3apathogens 3aserotypes 3aswine 3avirulence 2aAlaninexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aAntimicrobial Cationic Peptidesxpharmacology 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aCarbon-Oxygen Ligases 2aCell Line 2aD-Alanine Transaminasexgenetics 2aEndothelial Cellsxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aGene Deletion 2aLipopolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMice 2aMicrobial Viability 2aNeutrophilsximmunology 2aStreptococcal Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aStreptococcus suisxdrug effectsxgeneticsximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aSurvival Analysis 2aSwine 2aTeichoic Acidsxmetabolism 2aVirulence1 aSekizaki, Tsutomu1 aTakamatsu, Daisuke1 aHarel, JosÃ©e1 aDomÃ­nguez-Punaro, MarÃ­a de la Cruz1 aVon Aulock, Sonja1 aDraing, Christian1 aMarois, Corinne1 aKobisch, MarylÃ¨ne1 aGottschalk, Marcelo0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 Aug., v. 76, no. 8 p.3587-3594dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01568-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03783naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245017900202300001800381500002400399506007600423520199700499506003702496650002702533650002002560650001802580650002602598650001602624650002702640650002902667650002702696650001502723650001202738650001802750650001302768650001002781650001102791650001402802650002002816650000902836650001202845650001402857650002002871650001302891650001702904650001402921700002402935700002102959700001902980773011702999852000903116856008003125655001203205IND4408025120221207075842.0080718s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440802512DNAL7 a10.1128/IAI.01620-072doi7 aPMC24932152pmcid7 a184904562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBina, Xiaowen R.10aVibrio cholerae RND Family Efflux Systems Are Required for Antimicrobial Resistance, Optimal Virulence Factor Production, and Colonization of the Infant Mouse Small Intestine  ap. 3595-3605.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVibrio cholerae is a gram-negative human intestinal pathogen that causes the diarrheal disease cholera. Humans acquire cholera by ingesting V. cholerae-contaminated food or water. Upon ingestion, V. cholerae encounters several barriers to colonization, including bile acid toxicity and antimicrobial products of the innate immune system. In many gram-negative bacteria, resistance to the antimicrobial effects of these products is mediated by RND (resistance-nodulation-division) family efflux systems. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the V. cholerae RND efflux systems are required for antimicrobial resistance and virulence. The six V. cholerae genes encoding RND efflux pumps were deleted from the genome of the O1 El Tor strain N16961, resulting in the generation of 14 independent RND deletion mutants, including one RND-null strain. Determination of the antimicrobial susceptibilities of the mutants revealed that the RND efflux systems were responsible for resistance to multiple antimicrobial compounds, including bile acids, antimicrobial peptides, and antibiotics. VexB (VC0164) was found to be the RND efflux pump primarily responsible for the resistance of V. cholerae to multiple antimicrobial compounds in vitro. In contrast, VexD (VC1757) and VexK (VC1673) encoded efflux pumps with detergent-specific substrate specificities that were redundant with VexB. A strain lacking VexB, VexD, and VexK was attenuated in the infant mouse model, and its virulence factor production was unaffected. In contrast, a V. cholerae RND-null strain produced significantly less cholera toxin and fewer toxin-coregulated pili than the wild type and was unable to colonize the infant mouse. The decreased virulence factor production in the RND-null strain was linked to reduced transcription of tcpP and toxT. Our findings show that the V. cholerae RND efflux systems are required for antimicrobial resistance, optimal virulence factor production, and colonization of the infant mouse.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aVibrio cholerae 3aanimal models 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacterial colonization 3abile acids 3acholera 3acholera toxin 3afimbriae 3agenes 3ahumans 3aingestion 3ainnate immunity 3amice 3amutants 3apathogens 3asmall intestine 3atoxicity 3atransporters 3avirulence1 aProvenzano, Daniele1 aNguyen, Nathalie1 aBina, James E.0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 Aug., v. 76, no. 8 p.3595-3605dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01620-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03246naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001700193245011000210300001600320500002400336506007600360520145300436506003701889650002101926650001601947650001801963650001701981650001601998650001602014650003102030650001002061650001602071650001602087650001102103650002202114650001102136650001802147650001202165650001602177650001302193650002102206650001302227650000902240650002502249650002902274650001902303650001402322650001402336650001102350700002502361700002302386700002002409773010202429852000902531856009202540655001202632IND4407977320221207075857.0080718s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440797732DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2008.00404.x2doi7 aPMC25767402pmcid7 a186166062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenon, Veena10aTranscriptional profiling of the Candida albicans Ssk1p receiver domain point mutants and their virulence  ap. 756-763.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Ssk1p response regulator of Candida albicans is required for oxidant adaptation, survival in human neutrophils, and virulence in a disseminated murine model of candidiasis. We have previously shown that the amino acid residues D556 and D513 of the Ssk1p receiver domain are critical to the Ssk1p in oxidant stress adaptation and morphogenesis. Herein, transcriptional profiling is used to explain the oxidant sensitivity and morphogenesis defect of two point mutants (D556N and D513K, respectively) compared with a WT strain. In the D556N mutant, during oxidative stress (5 mM HâOâ), a downregulation of genes associated with redox homeostasis and oxidative stress occurred, which accounted for about 5% of all gene changes, including among others, SOD1 (superoxide dismutase), CAP1 (required for some types of oxidant stress), and three genes encoding glutathione biosynthesis proteins (GLR1, GSH1, and GSH2). Mutant D513K was not sensitive to peroxide but was impaired in its yeast $/to hyphal transition. We noted downregulation of genes associated with morphogenesis and cell elongation. Virulence of each mutant was also evaluated in a rat vaginitis model of candidiasis. Clearance of an SSK1 null and the D556N mutants from the vaginal canal was significantly greater than wild type or the D513K mutant, indicating that a change in a single amino acid of the Ssk1p alters the ability of this strain to colonize the rat vaginal mucosa.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida albicans 3aamino acids 3aanimal models 3abiosynthesis 3acandidiasis 3acell growth 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglutathione 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahyphae 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3aneutrophils 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3aproteins 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription (genetics) 3avaginal mucosa 3avaginitis 3avirulence 3ayeasts1 aDe Bernardis, Flavia1 aCalderone, Richard1 aChauhan, Neeraj0 tFEMS yeast research.g2008 Aug., v. 8, no. 5 p.756-763dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2008.00404.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02197naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245012600175300001600301500002400317520113100341650002101472650000801493650001601501650001801517650001601535650003101551650003001582650001101612700001701623700001601640773010201656852000901758856009201767655001201859IND4407977420221121000910.0080718s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440797742DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2008.00392.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobsen, Mette D.10aMultilocus sequence typing confirms synonymy but highlights differences between Candida albicans and Candida stellatoidea  ap. 764-770.  aIncludes references  aWe used multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) to investigate 35 yeast isolates representing the two genome-sequenced strains plus the type strain of Candida albicans, four isolates originally identified as Candida stellatoidea type I and 28 representing type strains of other species now regarded as synonymous with C. albicans. DNA from all 32 C. albicans synonyms readily formed PCR products with the C. albicans MLST primer sets. Their sequences placed all of them within the existing C. albicans clade structure, represented by 1516 isolates. One isolate, originally received as Mycotorula sinensis, was resistant to flucytosine, but no other unusual susceptibilities were found to polyene, azole or echinocandin antifungal agents. The four isolates of C. stellatoidea type I coclustered with two other sucrose-negative isolates, originally identified as examples of Candida africana, in a group of strains highly distinct from the majority of C. albicans. Our results not only confirm the synonymity of all the isolates with C. albicans but also confirm an obvious genotypic difference in the case of C. stellatoidea type I. 3aCandida albicans 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aechinocandins 3aflucytosine 3amultilocus sequence typing 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ayeasts1 aBoekhout, T.1 aOdds, F.

The enzymatic inactivation of quorum signals has shown promise for use in genetically modified organisms resistant to pathogens. We recently characterized the ability of a cytochrome P450, P450BM-3, to oxidize the quorum sensing signals known as acyl homoserine lactones. The oxidation of the acyl homoserine lactones reduced their activity as quorum signals. The enzyme also oxidized the inactive lactonolysis products, acyl homoserines. The enzyme showed similar binding affinity for the acyl homoserine lactones and acyl homoserines. The latter reaction may lead to problems when lactonases and the P450-dependent system are used in tandem, as oxidation of the acyl homoserines produced by lactonolysis in vivo may compete with acyl homoserine lactone oxidation by the cytochrome P450. We report here that a single mutation (R47S) in P450BM-3 is capable of increasing the acyl homoserine lactone: acyl homoserine substrate binding selectivity of the enzyme nearly 250-fold, reducing the potential for competition by acyl homoserines and significantly enhancing the potential for use of P450BM-3 as part of a pathogen resistance system in genetically modified crops. 3abacteria 3abinding capacity 3abiotechnology 3acytochrome P-450 3agenes 3ahomoserine 3alactones 3amutation 3aoxidation 3apathogens 3apopulation density 3aquorum sensing 3atransgenic plants1 aStewart, Larissa1 aLopez, Claudia1 aHaines, Donovan C.0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2008 July 31, v. 135, no. 4 p.374-376dElsevierx0168-16567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2008.05.0053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01653naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245011200146300001600258500001500274520042300289650001300712650001800725650001200743650003800755650001900793650001800812650001600830650002300846650002600869650001800895650003800913650004300951650002500994650004101019653002401060700001501084773007901099852000901178939003301187946001101220655001201231IND9102786120221120220357.0910709s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910278612DNAL7 a18836032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKramer, Petr.10aFlow injection immunoanalysis (FIIA)--a new immunoassay format for the determination of pesticides in water  ap. 239-243.  a2019-12-04  aThis paper presents the development of a new heterogeneous enzyme immunoassay format for the detection of pesticides.

The tool was used to simulate runoff and sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads for a small gaged watershed located in North Carolina. Output from the tool was compared to observed runoff and pollutant loads for 11 storms. Statistical comparisons between observed and model-simulated loads at two monitoring stations showed no significant difference between observed and predicted runoff volumes and nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads, indicating that the modeling tool provides reasonable estimates of pollutant loads from storm events. 3awater pollution 3awatersheds 3arunoff 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3ageographic information systems 3asimulation models 3awatershed management 3acomputer software 3asediments 3aAGNPS model 3aNorth Carolina 0acomputer simulation 0awater, soil, and hydro-environmental decision support system1 aCoffey, S.W.1 aOsmond, D.L.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1997 , v. 40, no. 4 p.971-975x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US 7aarticle02172naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245015900129300001600288500001500304520085600319650002501175650001701200650001801217650001401235650001601249650001901265650001801284650001001302650001401312650001301326650001301339650002301352650001001375650001201385650001201397650001201409650002001421653001601441653001201457653001401469653002701483653001101510653001201521773006701533852000901600930003301609945001301642946001101655655001201666IND2056552920221120210338.0970416e19961127gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205655292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllerich, F.H.10aInheritance patterns of new genetic markers and occurrence of spontaneous mosaicism in the monogenic blowfly Chrysomya rufifacies (Diptera: Calliphoridae)  ap. 232-241.  a2019-12-05  aFour new genetic markers for Chrysosoma rufifacies, a fly with maternal sex determination, were characterized.

In the field experiment, using the mechanical thinner on noninoculated trees immediately after operating the equipment on inoculated trees significantly (P < 0.01) increased fire blight incidence resulting in 90 Â± 20.01 (mean Â± SE) infected shoots compared with 23.5 Â± 8.97 diseased shoots in similar trees that were not thinned mechanically. A similar result was obtained in greenhouse experiments whereby healthy apple plants positioned adjacent to diseased plants before the group was subjected to the mechanical thinner developed more than twice the number of infected shoots as that on similar plants that were not thinned. These results indicate that under conditions conducive to infection, the mechanical blossom thinner significantly increases the risk of spreading Erwinia amylovora. The use of the thinner should therefore be limited to orchards with no history of disease in the last 3 years and on days when predicted weather is not suitable for tree infection by E. amylovora; otherwise, a severe fire blight epidemic could develop in the orchard. 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aorchards 3adeblossoming 3aapples 3aErwinia amylovora 3agreenhouse experimentation 3adisease transmission 3arisk assessment 3apathogenicity 3acrop yield 3afield experimentation 3apruning 3aMalus domestica 3acrop management 3aorganic production 3apruning tools 3aPennsylvania 0acrop production 0acrop load management 0arotating string thinner1 aSchupp, James R.0 tHortScience.g2009 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.862-865x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/07/25  aOther US 7aarticle04148naa a2200877 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194100001900203245016800222300001600390500002400406520134800430650002201778650001901800650001701819650001301836650001901849650001301868650001101881650002501892650001301917650002501930650001801955650001701973650001401990650004702004650001202051650002602063650002602089650007402115650002802189650002902217650001302246650001102259650003302270650004902303650001402352650002602366650002702392650005602419650002702475650002702502650002402529650007502553651001102628651001302639651002602652653001702678653001902695700002102714700002702735700002702762700002702789700003102816700002202847700002002869700002002889700002202909700002202931700002502953773011402978852000903092856008803101930003303189945002503222946001103247655001203258IND4416561620221120185422.0090220e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441656162DNAL7 a190413132pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2008.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL823 0aL821 0aX380 0aX3851 aMarcili, Arlei10aTrypanosoma cruzi in Brazilian Amazonia: Lineages TCI and TCIIa in wild primates, Rhodnius spp. and in humans with Chagas disease associated with oral transmission  ap. 615-623.  aIncludes references  aIn this study, we provide phylogenetic and biogeographic evidence that the Trypanosoma cruzi lineages T. cruzi I (TCI) and T. cruzi IIa (TCIIa) circulate amongst non-human primates in Brazilian Amazonia, and are transmitted by Rhodnius species in overlapping arboreal transmission cycles, sporadically infecting humans. TCI presented higher prevalence rates, and no lineages other than TCI and TCIIa were found in this study in wild monkeys and Rhodnius from the Amazonian region. We characterised TCI and TCIIa from wild primates (16 TCI and five TCIIa), Rhodnius spp. (13 TCI and nine TCIIa), and humans with Chagas disease associated with oral transmission (14 TCI and five TCIIa) in Brazilian Amazonia. To our knowledge, TCIIa had not been associated with wild monkeys until now. Polymorphisms of ssrDNA, cytochrome b gene sequences and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) patterns clearly separated TCIIa from TCIIb-e and TCI lineages, and disclosed small intra-lineage polymorphisms amongst isolates from Amazonia. These data are important in understanding the complexity of the transmission cycles, genetic structure, and evolutionary history of T. cruzi populations circulating in Amazonia, and they contribute to both the unravelling of human infection routes and the pathological peculiarities of Chagas disease in this region. 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aChagas disease 3awild animals 3aPrimates 3ainsect vectors 3aRhodnius 3ahumans 3adisease transmission 3agenotype 3agenetic polymorphism 3aribosomal DNA 3acytochrome b 3aphylogeny 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 2aAnimals 2aAotidaexparasitology 2aCebidaexparasitology 2aChagas Diseasexepidemiologyxparasitologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aCytochromes bxgenetics 2aDNA, Protozoanxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aInsect Vectorsxparasitology 2aMonkey Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPrimatesxparasitology 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Techniquexmethods 2aRhodniusxparasitology 2aSaguinusxparasitology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTrypanosoma cruzixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 3aBrazil 3aAmazonia 0aBrazilxepidemiology. 0awild monkeys 0aoral infection1 aValente, Vera C.1 aValente, SebastiÃ£o A.1 aJunqueira, Angela C.V.1 aSilva, FlÃ¡via Maia da1 aPinto, Ana YecÃª das Neves1 aNaiff, Roberto D.1 aCampaner, Marta1 aCoura, JosÃ© R.1 aCamargo, Erney P.1 aMiles, Michael A.1 aTeixeira, Marta M.G.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2009 Apr., v. 39, no. 5 p.615-623dElsevier Sciencex0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2008.09.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle01887naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006200126300001600188500001500204520086000219650003501079650002201114650001101136650001301147650002001160653001601180653001701196653001401213653001501227653001801242653001001260653000901270653001901279700001701298700001601315773007801331852000901409930003301418945001301451946001301464655001201477IND2062720520221120185309.0980325e199707  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206272052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBader, M.J.10aDynamic stability of two tractor front-end loader systems  ap. 865-869.  a2019-12-05  aA one-quarter scale model tractor and loader were designed, fabricated, and used in an experiment to evaluate two tractor-loader configurations relative to stability using roll angle as the means of assessment. The non-conventional loader system consisted of a conventional loader attached to a steerable carrier which in turn was attached to the tractor by the front axle and drawbar of the tractor. The stabilizing axle for the non-conventional loader system was the front axle as opposed to the conventional system in which the stabilizing axle was the rear axle. The experiment showed that the non-conventional loader had an inherent advantage in stability as assessed by roll angle. The roll angle was smaller at higher velocity than at lower velocity because the tires underwent greater deformation at the higher velocity than at the lower velocity. 3aoccupational health and safety 3afront-end loaders 3adesign 3atractors 3aphysical models 0acomparisons 0ascale models 0astability 0aroll angle 0aforward speed 0aloads 0aroll 0arotation angle1 aWalton, L.R.1 aWells, L.G.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1997 , v. 40, no. 4 p.865-869x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US 7aarticle02411naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245019400187300001600381520092200397650002001319650001201339650001601351650001001367650001201377650002401389650001801413650001801431650002501449650001301474650001101487650004201498650002801540650001301568650001601581651001201597653000901609653000901618700003001627700002301657773010901680852000901789856008501798930003301883946001301916655001201929IND4400829320221120185340.0080203e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440082932DNAL7 a161334462pmid7 a10.1007/s00251-005-0035-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhm-Laursen, Line 10aIdentification of two new alleles, IGHV3-23*04 and IGHJ6*04, and the complete sequence of the IGHV3-h pseudogene in the human immunoglobulin locus and their prevalences in Danish Caucasians  ap. 621-627.  aMore than 100 variable (V), 27 diversity (D), and six joining (J) genes are encoded in the human heavy chain locus, and many of these genes exists in different allelic forms.

We here report the identification of two novel and seemingly functional alleles of human heavy chain genes. The variable IGHV3-23*04 allele is found with an allele frequency of 0.21 amongst Danish Caucasians, whereas the novel joining IGHJ6*04 allele is rare (allele frequency 0.02). We also report the full sequence of IGHV3-h. The gene exists in two allelic forms but is only found in 58% of the Danish Caucasians studied. The methionine translation initiation codon is mutated, ATG[rightward arrow]AAG, and we therefore propose that the gene is a pseudogene incapable of being translated. 3aimmunoglobulins 3aalleles 3apseudogenes 2aAdult 2aAlleles 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aWhite People. 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Heavy Chainsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPseudogenes 0aDenmark 0aIGHV 0aIGHJ1 aLarsen, Stine Rosenkilde 1 aBarington, Torben 0 tImmunogenetics.g2005 Oct., v. 57, no. 9 p.621-627dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0093-77117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00251-005-0035-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20080203b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02577naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006800127300001600195520168400211650001801895650001101913650001501924650002301939650001501962650001501977650001101992650001102003653002302014653002802037700001602065773007802081852000902159930003302168945001302201946001302214655001202227IND2062721520221120180052.0980325e199707  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206272152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarker, G.L.10aEffect of temperature on the drying rate of gin run cotton seed  ap. 891-896.  aMoisture control during the harvesting, storage, and processing phases of cotton production is essential for producing a quality product. Basic information relating environmental parameters to equilibrium moisture content and the moisture transfer rates for cotton and its component parts will lead to a better understanding of the processes involved and design and control criteria for cotton conditioning equipment. This report depicts the moisture desorption rates for gin run cotton seed. Absorption values are shown for temperatures of 20 and 35 degrees C and desorption values for temperatures ranging from 20 to 130 degrees C (68-266 degrees F). The desorption (drying) moisture data were plotted against time and found to be exponential in nature. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to fit the value of the coefficients in the theoretical falling rate equation to the experimental data. The desorption (drying) data fit the theoretical falling rate (exponential decay) function reasonably well, especially at temperatures above 100 degrees C. Temperature significantly affected the coefficient containing the diffusivity parameter in the nonlinear equations. A generalized solution of the falling rate equation was developed as a function of absolute temperature, which should be suitable for engineering calculations. Results indicate that moisture absorption by cotton seed undergoes two absorption phases. The first absorption phase appears to be physical in nature and approximates the curves of other biological materials. The second phase, which shows an increased moisture absorption rate after a leveling off period, may indicate increased metabolic activity. 3awater content 3acotton 3acottonseed 3adrying temperature 3adesorption 3aabsorption 3adryers 3adesign 0aprocessing quality 0ahigh temperature drying1 aLaird, J.W.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1997 , v. 40, no. 4 p.891-896x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US 7aarticle03094naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245013400133300001600267500001500283520222700298650002902525650001002554650003102564650002302595653001302618653001102631700001302642773008202655852000902737939003302746946001302779655001202792IND8903872420221120175935.0890719e198904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890387242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBusch-Petersen, E.10aStability of two mass-reared genetic sexing strains of Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae) based on pupal color dimorphisms  ap. 315-322.  a2019-12-04  aTwo genetic sexing strains of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) were mass-reared. Both strains contain a Y-autosome translocation which links the wild-type brown allele of the white pupae (wp) gene to the male-determining Y chromosome. Continuous inbreeding of each strain results in the production of brown male and white female puparia, thus enabling the automated separation of the sexes before release of sterilized males in sterile insect technique pest management control or eradication programs against this pest. Past experience has shown such strains to be prone to breakdown through a variety of mechanisms. The present experiments were designed to assess the stability of both strains under mass-rearing conditions. Aberrant brown female pupae appeared in the T:Y(wp+)101 strain in the first generation of mass rearing. By the fifth generation, the reproducing component constituted 24.4% of the brown pupae. The corresponding level of aberrant phenotypes in the brown pupae of the T:Y(wp+)30C strain was 2.3% by generation 10. The first reproducing aberrant females appeared in generation 4 of this strain. The frequency of reproducing aberrant white male pupae in T:Y(wp+)101 also increased with successive generations, reaching 12.4% in generation 5. No increase in aberrant white males was observed in T:Y(wp+)30C. The results indicated that the breakdown of the T:Y(wp+)101 strain was caused by a low degree of male recombination combined with a high genetic load carried by the mutant wp allele. Whether or not the rate of breakdown observed in this strain was accelerated by an accidental introduction of wild-type genotypes could not be conclusively determined. The slight breakdown in T:Y(wp+)30C was attributed solely to an introduction of wild-type material, and no indication of male recombination could be found. The overall viability of the latter strain was not significantly different from that of the standard, mass-reared "Sohag" strain. It is concluded that T:Y(wp+)30C is acceptable for mass rearing and that it shows excellent potential for utilization in sterile insect technique programs relying and depending upon the release of genetically sexed sterile males. 3asterile insect technique 3apupae 3asex determination analysis 3aCeratitis capitata 0agenetics 0asexing1 aKafu, A.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1989 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.315-322x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04564naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001700185245017500202300001600377500002400393500001500417520202800432650002302460650002302483650003502506650001002541650002402551650003202575650001502607650003102622650002002653650002502673650002302698650005302721650001602774650001202790650002202802650002402824650001102848650003802859650001302897650006702910650005902977650005403036650003103090650000903121650003503130650002203165650004203187650004303229650002403272650007203296650006503368653001503433653001903448700001603467700001703483700001803500700002003518773011403538852000903652856008803661930003303749945002503782946001103807655001203818IND4416561520221120180021.0090220e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441656152DNAL7 a190270202pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2008.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL822 0aL2001 aKemper, K.E.10aHaemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis did not adapt to long-term exposure to sheep that were genetically resistant or susceptible to nematode infections  ap. 607-614.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe tested the hypothesis that Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis would adapt to long-term exposure to sheep that were either genetically resistant or susceptible to H. contortus. Sheep genotypes were from lines with 10 years prior selection for low (resistant, R) or high (susceptible, S) faecal worm egg count (WEC) following H. contortus infection. Long-term exposure of H. contortus and T. colubriformis to R or S genotypes was achieved using serial passage for up to 30 nematode generations. Thus, we generated four nematode strains; one strain of each species solely exposed to R sheep and one strain of each species solely exposed to S sheep. Considerable host genotype differences in mean WEC during serial passage confirmed adequate nematode selection pressure for both H. contortus (R 4900 eggs per gram (epg), S 19,900 epg) and T. colubriformis (R 5300 epg, S 13,500 epg). Adaptation of nematode strain to host genotype was tested using seven cross-classified tests for H. contortus, and two cross-classified and one outbred genotype test for T. colubriformis. In the cross-classified design, where each strain infects groups of R, S or randomly bred control sheep, parasite adaptation would be indicated by a significant host genotype by nematode strain interaction for traits indicating parasite reproductive success; specifically WEC and, for H. contortus strains, packed cell volume. We found no significant evidence of parasite adaptation to host genotype (P >0.05) for either the H. contortus or T. colubriformis strains. Therefore, we argue that nematodes will not adapt quickly to sheep bred for nematode resistance, where selection is based on low WEC, although selecting sheep using a subset of immune functions may increase adaptation risk. Our results support the hypothesis that nematode resistance is determined by many genes each with relatively small effect. In conclusion, selection of sheep for nematode resistance using WEC should be sustainable in the medium to long-term. 3aselection response 3agenetic resistance 3aTrichostrongylus colubriformis 3asheep 3anematode infections 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahematocrit 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3afecal egg count 3aHaemonchus contortus 3adisease resistance 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgeneticsximmunology. 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxmethods 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenotype 2aHaemonchiasisxgeneticsximmunologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aHaemonchusxclassificationxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aMale 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 2aRandom Allocation 2aSheep Diseasesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aSheep, Domesticxgeneticsximmunology. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTrichostrongylosisxgeneticsximmunologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aTrichostrongylusxclassificationxpathogenicityxphysiology. 0aadaptation 0aserial passage1 aElwin, R.L.1 aBishop, S.C.1 aGoddard, M.E.1 aWoolaston, R.R.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2009 Apr., v. 39, no. 5 p.607-614dElsevier Sciencex0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2008.08.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02572naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011200127300001600239500001500255520167000270650001401940650001001954650001301964651001201977653001601989653003002005653002202035653003602057700001602093773008202109852000902191939003302200946001302233655001202246IND8903871920221120164526.0890718e198904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890387192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClancy, K.M.10aEffect of plant resistance, competition, and enemies on a leaf-galling sawfly (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae)  ap. 284-290.  a2019-12-04  aThe relative importance of three sources of larval mortality (host plant resistance, intraspecific competition, and natural enemies) was evaluated for a population of leaf-galling sawflies, Pontania sp., near P. pacifica Marlatt, on arroyo willow, Salix lasiolepis Bentham, at a site in Flagstaff, Ariz., from 1981 to 1984. The ratio of the percentage of sawfly larvae killed by natural enemies to the percentage lost to host plant defenses (i.e., abortion, defined as an aborted formation of a gall resulting from death of the egg or small larva) was 1.53:1. Mortality from abortion was divided into a host plant resistance component (constitutive abortion, e.g., a plant resistance factor preventing establishment of the egg or small larva) and an intraspecific competition-mediated component (because abortion increased as within-leaf gall densities rose). Natural enemies caused twice as much mortality as plant resistance and 6.36 times greater mortality than intraspecific competition. These results support the hypothesis that third-trophic-level effects exert a stronger selective pressure on many insect populations than competition for limiting resources. There was evidence that intraspecific competition for limiting food resources occurred for these Pontania sp. sawflies; increased within-leaf gall densities had a density-denpendent, linear, negative effect on gall size, and consequently, on larval boimass because sawfly size was positively correlated with gall size. However, only about 3% of the variation in gall size was explained by within-leaf gall density. Thus, gall (and larval) size were only weakly affected by intraspecific competition. 3aparasites 3aSalix 3aPontania 3aArizona 0aHymenoptera 0aparasites of insect pests 0asalix lasiolepsis 0aresistance to injurious factors1 aPrice, P.W.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1989 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.284-290x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01813naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006700129300001600196500001500212520098800227650003001215650001201245650002301257650001901280650001901299651001001318651001501328700001901343773008201362852000901444939003301453946001301486655001201499IND8903872320221120164609.0890719e198904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890387232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchotzko, D.J.10aLygus hesperus distribution and sampling procedures in lentils  ap. 308-314.  a2019-12-04  aThe spatial distribution, minimum number of samples, and number of sweeps per sample required to estimate populations of Lygus hesperus Knight (Heteroptera: Miridae) in lentils were determined from three plot types, using 1 to 25 randomly collected 180 degree sweeps with a sweep net. Overall, 92% of the adult populations and 85% of the nymphal populations had means less than the variance, indicating a negative binomial distribution. The negative binomial K appeared to vary over the season and with density of the adults. The number of sweeps per sample was inversely related to the K value of nymphs, whereas the density was directly related to nymphal K values. The slope for Taylor's power law appeared to be related to the adult density, although it was consistent for all nymphal densities in our experiments. On average, five 25-sweep samples were required for adult population estimates, and about 10 single-sweep samples were recommended for nymphal population estimates. 3ageographical distribution 3asurveys 3apopulation density 3aLygus hesperus 3aLens culinaris 3aIdaho 0aWashington1 aO'Keeffe, L.E.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1989 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.308-314x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02334naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011800127300001600245520129400261650000901555650002101564650002601585650002201611650001201633650002001645650002301665650000901688650003501697650002001732653002601752653001301778700001501791700001701806773008401823852000901907939003301916946001101949655001201960IND9205503220221120164532.0920902e19920615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920550322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTopham, R.W.10aAlterations in the mucosal processing of iron in response to very-short-term dietary iron depletion and repletion  ap. 877-884.  aThe transfer of control rats to a low-iron diet for only 24 h resulted in a 2-fold increase in iron uptake by brush-border membrane vesicles. Extension of the low-iron feeding period to 72 h or 2 weeks resulted in only small additional increases in iron uptake by vesicle preparations. In contrast, the transfer of iron-deficient rats to a control diet resulted in a progressive decrease in iron uptake by vesicles that reached a level equivalent to that of control rats in 2 weeks. 59Fe labelling of detergent extracts of these vesicle preparations provided evidence for the presence of an iron-binding protein composed of subunits of 52 000 Da. The changes in the 59Fe labelling of this protein component were consistent with the changes observed in iron uptake by intact brush-border membrane vesicles. The 59Fe-labelling profiles of mucosal ferritin and transferrin from a test dose also were changed substantially in response to very-short-term alterations in dietary iron. Even though changes in dietary iron rapidly altered iron uptake by brush-border membrane vesicles and the incorporation of 59Fe from the test dose into mucosal transferrin, changes in the incorporation of 59Fe into mucosal ferritin best reflected the actual changes in the transfer of iron from dose to plasma. 3airon 3adietary minerals 3anutrient deficiencies 3aintestinal mucosa 3acytosol 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient transport 3arats 3abrush border membrane vesicles 3airon absorption 0airon binding capacity 0avesicles1 aEads, C.E.1 aButler, B.F.0 tBiochemical journal.g1992 June 15, v. 284, no. pt.3 p.877-884x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01448naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245007200124300001600196500001500212520048900227650001400716650002200730650000900752653001100761653001300772653001000785653001000795653002200805653002300827653001000850653002100860653001300881700002200894773007800916852000900994930003301003945001301036946001301049655001201062IND2060986320221120160146.0971220e199705  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206098632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, K.T.10aThree-dimensional building stiffness model for post-frame buildings  ap. 795-801.  a2019-12-05  aA three-dimensional stiffness model was developed to provide procedures to incorporate the frame-diaphragm interaction into design of metal-clad post-frame buildings.

This study was designed to investigate the plasma disposition and efficacy of ivermectin (IVM) following pour-on, per os and intravenous administrations. Eighteen female horses weighing 510-610kg were used in this study. The animals were allocated into three groups (per os, pour-on and intravenous groups). The equine paste, bovine pour-on and bovine injectable formulations of IVM were administered orally, topically and intravenously at the dose rates of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.2mg/kg bodyweight, respectively. Heparinized blood samples and hair samples were collected at various times between 1h and 40 days. The samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector. Faecal strongyle egg counts (EPG) were performed by a modified McMaster's technique before and at weekly intervals during 10 weeks after treatment. The results indicated that the plasma concentration and systemic availability of IVM was lower but the plasma persistence was prolonged after pour-on administration compared with per os route. IVM (paste) reduced the EPG by >95% for 10 weeks, whereas the reduction in pour-on group varied from 82 to 97%. EPG reduction in pour-on group was lower than that of per os group. Degradation on the application site, cutaneous biotransformation, binding of IVM to the haircoat and/or sebum are probably responsible for the relatively lower bioavailability of IVM in horses after pour-on administration. In conclusion, the poor plasma availability observed after pour-on administration could result in subtherapeutic plasma concentrations, which may promote the development of drug resistance in parasites. 3ahorses 3aivermectin 3apour-on formulations 3aoral administration 3adrug evaluation 3abioavailability 3apharmacokinetics 3aintravenous injection 3ablood sampling 3adosage 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3afecal egg count 3ahelminths 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAdministration, Topical 2aAnimals 2aAntiparasitic Agentsxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aArea Under Curve 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aHalf-Life 2aHorse Diseasesxdrug therapyxparasitology. 2aHorses 2aInjections, Intramuscularxveterinary 2aIvermectinxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 2aStrongylida Infectionsxdrug therapyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aStrongylusxgrowth & development 0aplasma disposition 0ahair samples1 aCirak, Veli Y.1 aSenlik, Bayram1 aAksit, Dilek1 aDurmaz, Murat1 aMcKellar, Quintin A.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 May 28, v. 170, no. 1-2 p.120-126dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.01.0413Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/07/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02152naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002100161245013100182300001600313500001500329520090900344650002401253650003701277650002001314650002301334650001801357650001401375650001601389650001501405650001601420650002501436650002201461651001801483651001101501653002301512700001801535773007301553852000901626930003301635945002501668946001301693655001201706IND4422596920221120143932.0090701e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442259692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFarmer, Frank L.13aAn Empirical Examination of Characteristics of Mexican Migrants to Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Areas of the United States  ap. 220-240.  a2019-12-04  aThis research examines differences between those Mexican migrants choosing metropolitan destinations and those choosing destinations outside metropolitan areas of the United States. Using general estimating equations, the study presents data indicating that since the 1960s migrants choosing rural destinations are less fluent in English, slightly older, much less educated, far more likely to be unskilled, more likely to be married, and more likely to be undocumented. The picture is more complex when consideration is restricted to those migrants arriving in rural areas since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. These migrants are far more likely to be single, have more education but have less English fluency, have less work experience, and have less family experience with migration to the United States. They are more likely to come from small towns and rural areas of Mexico. 3amathematical models 3asociodemographic characteristics 3amigrant workers 3amigratory behavior 3arural society 3aequations 3aurban areas 3afarm labor 3arural areas 3astatistical analysis 3aMexican Americans 3aUnited States 3aMexico 0amigration behavior1 aMoon, Zola K.0 tRural sociology.g2009 June, v. 74, no. 2 p.220-240x0036-01127nnas  aDNAL  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/08/08  aOther US 7aarticle02941naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001900171245008800190300001600278500001500294520154900309650002001858650002301878650000801901650001601909650001801925650002301943650002301966650001201989650001202001650002102013650001902034653001502053700001602068700001402084700001502098700002202113700001802135700001702153773008702170852000902257856007702266930003302343945002502376946001102401990002302412655001202435IND4417491020221120144032.0090310s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441749102DNAL7 a10.1159/0001729812doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGalofrÃ©, J.C.10aRelationship between Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone and Insulin in Euthyroid Obese Men  ap. 188-194.  a2019-12-04  aBackground/Aims: Obesity has been associated with hypothyroidism and impaired insulin sensitivity. However, few studies have specifically addressed the association between insulin sensitivity and thyroid function. Our aim was to look for a relation between these 2 factors in a sample of obese males. Methods: One hundred and forty-four euthyroid male obese patients - mean age 42.6 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 41.8 - were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The hospital study protocol at entrance included baseline serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), insulin and glucose concentrations. Data were studied using an age-adjusted simple and multivariate linear regression analysis with TSH as the dependent and insulin and BMI as the independent variables. Results: Mean TSH and insulin were 1.6 and 21.2 mU/l, respectively. It was found that their relationship follows a regression model: TSH = 1.725-0.019 (age) + 0.003 (insulin) + 0.017 (BMI). Further data showed a positive correlation between BMI and TSH (r = 0.22; p < 0.05), as well as between serum baseline insulin (>10 mU/l) and TSH concentration (r = 0.27; p < 0.05). This association was stronger in patients with higher insulin values (>21.2 mU/l; r = 0.40; p < 0.01). However, negative correlations between age and insulin (r = -0.14; not significant) and age and TSH (r = -0.35; p < 0.05) were observed. Conclusions: In obese males, insulin resistance is significantly related with impairment of thyroid function, and this situation seems to be attenuated with age. 3abody mass index 3ametabolic syndrome 3amen 3athyrotropin 3ablood glucose 3amiddle-aged adults 3ainsulin resistance 3aobesity 3ainsulin 3athyroid function 3ahypothyroidism 0aoverweight1 aPujante, P.1 aAbreu, C.1 aSantos, S.1 aGuillen-Grima, F.1 aFrÃ¼hbeck, G.1 aSalvador, J.0 tAnnals of nutrition & metabolism.g2008, v. 53, no. 3-4 p.188-194x0250-68077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1159/0001729813Available from publisher's Web site  a20090325b20090508c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/03/24  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03621naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011700125300001600242520255800258650001302816650002402829650001502853650001102868650002402879650001302903650002002916650001902936650002302955650001402978650001602992650001603008653002803024653001303052700001203065773007803077852000903155930003303164945001303197946001303210655001203223IND2060986020221120135316.0971220e199705  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206098602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, A.10aEffects of structural and stacking configuration of containers for transporting chicks in their microenvironment  ap. 777-782.  aBreeder (layer) chicks in transit are vulnerable to oxygen shortages that stem from the lack of mechanical ventilation in holding areas such as warehouse and cargo compartments of aircraft. Such vulnerable periods tend to occur around departure time of an aircraft when the cargo door is closed but the compartment has not been pressurized and vice versa upon landing. To maintain the well-being of the chicks, sufficient air exchange through the containers is essential during these periods. This study examined the airflow rates and internal thermal conditions of a commercial chick container as influenced by its structural and stacking configurations. Specifically, a 2X2 factorial arrangement of container structures was examined that consisted of a regular cardboard box (62 X 47 X 15 cm) and a box modified by adding extra vent holes (128 vs 92) on the side walls; each type of box was covered with either the regular cardboard lid or a modified plastic poultry grid lid The effects on airflow rate of vertical distances (VD) from 2.5 cm (currently used) to 17.8 cm between the boxes were evaluated with one stack of four containers. The effects on air flow rate of horizontal distances (HD) from 5.1 to 15.2 cm between the stacks were evaluated with four stacks of six containers each. NI/CR electrical heating wires evenly located above the excelsior bedding were used to simulate sensible heat production rate (21 W at 30 degrees C) of 88 unfed day-old chicks that are normally held per container. The results revealed that the measured ventilation rate under the current box structure and stacking arrangement (averaging 0.013 L/s/chick or 0.028 CFM/chick) seemed sufficient during cold weather but was considerably below values recommended for mild to hot weather. An improved, practical container structure and stacking configuration features the regular container body with the grid lid, 7.6 cm VD between boxes, 5.1 cm HD between stacks linked with the existing cardboard spacers. The improved structure and stacking configurations had an average air flow rate of 0.062L/s/chick. The corresponding internal temperature rise of the containers relative to the test room temperature was 3.4, 4.7, 4.8, 5.0, 5.5, and 4.8 K for layer 1 (bottom layer), 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (top layer), respectively, compared to 5.5, 8.1, 9.1, 9.8, 9.9, 7.8 K for the current box structure and stacking arrangement. Because of the excessive airflow rate and potential cold draft for the top layer, the original cardboard lid was recommended for the top containers. 3achickens 3acontainer transport 3acontainers 3adesign 3anatural ventilation 3aair flow 3aair temperature 3aanimal welfare 3aair transportation 3amortality 3aheat stress 3acold stress 0ainternational transport 0astacking1 aXin, H.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1997 , v. 40, no. 3 p.777-782x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US 7aarticle02701naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245009800145300001600243520114800259650003101407650001901438650002301457650001301480650002701493650002501520650002301545650000901568650003701577650001201614650000901626650002901635650001101664650004701675650002201722650003201744650004801776650000901824650002501833650006501858650002301923650003201946653003501978700002002013700001702033773007802050852000902128939003302137946001302170655001202183IND8903869620221120135326.0890718e198905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890386962DNAL7 a24984722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aL'Abbe, M.R.10aChanges in selenium and antioxidant status during DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis in rats  ap. 766-771.  aFemale weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were used to examine the changes that occurred in selenium and antioxidant status during the development of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors. Animals were fed an AIN-76 diet, modified to contain 20% fat (3:1 wt/wt, lard:corn oil) and 0.1, 0.035, 0.1, 1.0, 2.0 or 4.0 mg Se/kg diet. At wk 5, rats in groups 2-6 were administered by intragastric tube 4.32 mg of DMBA dissolved in corn oil. Control rats received corn oil only. A blood sample was removed from the tail vein and analyzed for selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GSHPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity at wk 5, and every 4 wk until wk 25. At the end of the experiment, rats were classified by tumor status, and each diet group was subdivided into two groups: those rats remaining free of tumors for 25 wk and those with tumors. DMBA treatment caused an initial decrease in erythrocyte SeGSHPx and SOD activity in rats with tumors remained lower than controls, while SeGSHPX activity increased in rats with no tumors. These changes, however, were not associated with any changes in lipid peroxidation. 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3acarcinogenesis 3anutritional status 3aselenium 3aglutathione peroxidase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3alipid peroxidation 3arats 2a9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aErythrocytesxenzymology 2aFemale 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexbloodxmetabolism. 2aLiverxenzymology 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aMammary Neoplasms, Experimentalxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aSeleniumxadministration & dosagexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSpleenxenzymology 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexblood 0a7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene1 aFischer, P.W.F.1 aChavez, E.R.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1989 May, v. 119, no. 5 p.766-771x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03783naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100001500176245011200191300001600303500002400319520185400343650001102197650001502208650002802223650002402251650002002275650001702295650002102312650001002333650004302343650002502386650001202411650006902423650002102492650003602513650001102549650001402560650003802574650004202612650008902654650000902743650003502752653002102787653002302808700001402831700001402845700001502859700001502874700001802889773009602907852000903003856008803012930003303100945002503133946001103158655001203169IND4437322420221120135450.0100522e20100528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443732242DNAL7 a201972122pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8101 aPÃ©rez, R.10aPlasma disposition and fecal elimination of doramectin after oral or intramuscular administration in horses  ap. 112-119.  aIncludes references  aA study was done to compare plasma disposition kinetics and the fecal elimination profile of doramectin (DRM) after oral or intramuscular (IM) administration in horses. Ten clinically healthy horses, 328-502kg body weight (bw), were assigned to 2 experimental groups of 5 horses each. Group 1 was treated with an oral dose of 0.2mgDRM/kgbw, while Group 2 was treated with 0.2mgDRM/kgbw by IM route. Blood and fecal samples were collected at different times between 0.5h and 60 days post-treatment. After plasma and fecal drug extraction and derivatization, samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A non-compartmental kinetic analysis was performed. Results were expressed as meanÂ±standard deviation and were compared using Mann-Whitney U-test. The parent molecule was detected in plasma between 30min and either 30 (oral) or 60 (IM) days post-treatment. Peak plasma concentrations (C max) of 51.6Â±22.2 and 33.3Â±10.5ng/mL were obtained after oral administration and IM route, respectively. Differences between administration route were not statistically significant (P =0.42). The value for the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was 178.6Â±53.7 and 393.6Â±66.6ngday/mL for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. These differences were significant (P <0.0079). The averages for mean residence time (MRT) values were 7.7Â±0.9 and 13.2Â±4.5 days for oral and IM treated groups, respectively. In horses treated using the oral route, the peak fecal concentration ( F C max ) was 2295Â±593ng/g observed at 1.9Â±0.5 days after oral treatment. Whereas, for those treated by IM route, the F C max was lower (162Â±26ng/g) (P <0.0079) and it was observed at 5.6Â±2.9 days. The results of this study showed that the administration route affects plasma disposition kinetics, bioavailability and fecal elimination of DRM. 3ahorses 3adoramectin 3aintramuscular injection 3aoral administration 3abioavailability 3ablood plasma 3apharmacokinetics 3afeces 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aArea Under Curve 2aFecesxchemistryxparasitology. 2aFemale 2aHalf-Life 2aHorsesxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aInjections, Intramuscularxveterinary 2aIvermectinxadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aMale 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 0afecal elmination 0aplasma disposition1 aGodoy, C.1 aPalma, C.1 aMuÃ±oz, L.1 aArboix, M.1 aAlvinerie, M.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 May 28, v. 170, no. 1-2 p.112-119dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.01.0383Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/07/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02965naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245009500184300001600279500002400295520132500319650001701644650001301661650001201674650002301686650001101709650001201720650001201732650001001744650000901754650001401763650002301777650002401800650001201824650008701836650005001923650002201973650002601995650002102021650001802042650003202060651001302092651001202105651001302117651003102130700002402161700001602185700002502201700001702226773009902243852000902342856004802351655001202399IND4435658020221120135317.0100416e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443565802DNAL7 a201406722pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-010-9445-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSusaeta, Andres10aAssessing Public Preferences for Forest Biomass Based Energy in the Southern United States  ap. 697-710.  aIncludes references  aThis article investigated public preferences for forest biomass based liquid biofuels, particularly ethanol blends of 10% (E10) and 85% (E85). We conducted a choice experiment study in three southern states in the United States: Arkansas, Florida, and Virginia. Reducing atmospheric COâ, decreasing risk of wildfires and pest outbreaks, and enhancing biodiversity were presented to respondents as attributes of using biofuels. Results indicated that individuals had a positive extra willingness to pay (WTP) for both ethanol blends. The extra WTP was greater for higher blends that offered larger environment benefits. The WTPs for E10 were $0.56 gallonâ»Â¹, $0.58 gallonâ»Â¹, and $0.48 gallonâ»Â¹, and for E85 they were $0.82 gallonâ»Â¹, $1.17 gallonâ»Â¹, and $1.06 gallonâ»Â¹ in Arkansas, Florida, and Virginia, respectively. Although differences in WTP for E10 were statistically insignificant among the three states, significant differences were found in the WTP for E85 between AR and FL and between AR and VA. Preferences for the environmental attributes appeared to be heterogeneous, as respondents' were willing to pay a premium for E10 in all three states to facilitate the reduction of COâ and the improvement of biodiversity but were not willing to pay more for E85 in order to enhance biodiversity. 3abiodiversity 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aecosystem services 3aenergy 3aethanol 3aforests 3apests 3arisk 3awildfires 3awillingness to pay 2aBiofuelsxeconomics 2aBiomass 2aConservation of Energy Resourcesxeconomicsxlegislation & jurisprudencexmethods. 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxprevention & control 2aFinancial Support 2aGovernment Regulation 2aModels, Economic 2aPublic Policy 2aTreesxgrowth & development 3aArkansas 3aFlorida 3aVirginia 0aSoutheastern United States1 aAlavalapati, Janaki1 aLal, Pankaj1 aMatta, Jagannadha R.1 aMercer, Evan0 tEnvironmental management.g2010 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.697-710dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-010-9445-y 7aarticle03585naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002300142245007100165300001600236500002400252520252800276650004402804650001002848650001202858650004402870650002302914650000902937650002102946700001302967700002902980700001703009700003003026773012503056852000903181856004503190655001203235IND4436428620221120123659.0100430e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443642862DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2009001852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedman, Jacqueline10aDetermining nutritional labeling data for fats and oils by Â¹H NMR  ap. 439-451.  aIncludes references  aThe nutrition labeling compositional data (NLCD) required for fat-containing food products consists of the percentages of saturated, cis-monounsaturated, and cis-polyunsaturated fat as well as trans content. The capability of Â¹H NMR spectroscopy to determine the NLCD components in oils that do not contain significant levels of trans isomers has already been established in the literature, but not its capability to differentiate between cis- and trans-unsaturation. In the present study, the determination of all four NLCD components in fats and oils has been demonstrated for the first time. A preliminary analysis of the intensity-normalized Â¹H NMR spectra of defined mixtures of pure triacylglycerols (TAG) by partial least squares (PLS) regression revealed that the (mono)allylic proton resonances of cis and trans bonds were sufficiently well separated to allow for accurate quantitation of trans content by simple peak integration. This chemometric approach also served to facilitate the identification of optimal integration limits for these cis- and trans-allylic resonances. Fixed integration limits were also set for the other resonances employed in the determination of the four NLCD components, and a standardized spectral preprocessing procedure was established. The Â¹H NMR NLCD data obtained for the TAG mixtures by this methodology was a good match to the actual values, calculated from the known molar composition of these gravimetrically prepared mixtures. A procedure for the conversion of the NMR mol% NLCD to units of wt%, previously developed for Â¹Â³C NMR, was adapted for Â¹H NMR and shown to be effective in compensating for the overestimation of wt% saturates and underestimation of wt% unsaturates by Â¹H NMR if this conversion is not made. The Â¹H NMR methodology for NLCD determination was validated by analyzing AOCS Laboratory Proficiency Program GC samples as well as samples taken from a hydrogenator over time and analyzed for trans content by GC and IR spectroscopy. Comparison of the Â¹H NMR mol% and wt% NLCD obtained for these validation samples with the data obtained from the reference methods indicated that Â¹H NMR can deliver high-quality, accurate NLCD, much like Â¹Â³C NMR, but in a much shorter time frame. Thus, Â¹H NMR provides a more rapid and cost-effective means of obtaining NLCD than Â¹Â³C NMR and can replace GC as a primary reference method for the calibration of simpler and automatable instrumental methods such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3afoods 3aisomers 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anutrition labeling 3aoils 3atriacylglycerols1 aGao, Lei1 aGarcÃ­a-GonzÃ¡lez, Diego1 aEhsan, Sadia1 avan de Voort, Frederik R.0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2010 Apr., v. 112, no. 4 p.439-451dWiley-VCH Verlagx1438-76977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.200900185 7aarticle02078naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002300161245011600184300001300300500001500313520076900328650002201097650001101119650001201130650002001142650002801162650002901190650002001219651003101239653002601270653002801296653002501324700002601349773007401375852000901449856012701458930003301585945002501618946001301643655001201656IND4417492420221120123625.0090310s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441749242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The genesis of this special issue flows from the efforts of the Southern Region Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (S-SARE) program to bring more social science research into its portfolio of projects. Our concern is that by providing best management practices (Band-Aids) to a fundamentally unsustainable agricultural system, the sustainable agriculture movement (and SARE's granting program) favors the environmental component at the expense of economic and social âlegsâ of the sustainable stool. While focusing on the history and work of the SARE program, we provided a social science perspective on sustainable agriculture. 3arural communities 3agrants 3afarmers 3aquality of life 3asustainable agriculture 3aenvironmental protection 3arural sociology 3aSoutheastern United States 0aSARE granting program 0aagricultural management 0aeconomic development1 aConstance, Douglas H.0 tSouthern rural sociology.g2008, v. 23, no. 1 p.1-22x0885-34367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ag.auburn.edu/auxiliary/srsa/pages/Articles/SRS%202008%2023%201%201-22.pdf3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090604b20090703c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/05/05  aOther US 7aarticle01439naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245010200123300001600225520065700241650002000898650001300918650001100931650002700942650000700969653001500976700001900991773008401010852000901094939003301103946001301136655001201149IND9205500920221120120540.0920903e199206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920550092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, D.H.10aEffect of pH on the minimum inhibitory concentration of monolaurin against Listeria monocytogenes  ap. 449-450.  aThe effect of pH on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of glycerol monolaurate (monolaurin) against four strains of Listeria monocytogenes at 35 degrees C in tryptic soy broth supplemented with 0.6% yeast extract was investigated. Our results demonstrate that the MIC of monolaurin was lower than MIC values reported for other common food antimicrobials such as potassium sorbate, tertiary butylhydroquinone, propyl paraben, and butylated hydroxyanisole. The MIC of monolaurin was reduced by decreasing the pH value of the medium. A 3-fold MIC reduction occurred when the pH decreased from pH 7.0 (10 micrograms/ml) to pH 5.0 (3 micrograms/ml). 3adodecanoic acid 3aglycerol 3aesters 3aListeria monocytogenes 3apH 0ainhibition1 aMarshall, D.L.0 tJournal of food protection.g1992 June, v. 55, no. 6 p.449-450x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02413naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245010400147300001600251520093000267650001501197650002101212650000901233650002001242650001901262650002001281650001501301650001301316650002301329650004701352650001201399650002301411650000901434650005901443650002201502650001101524650001401535650002001549650005101569650001101620650002201631650001901653653002201672653002001694700001901714773008201733852000901815930003301824945001301857946001301870655001201883IND2180512820221120103743.0981015e199802  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218051282DNAL7 a95325122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchepers, A.J.10aEvaluation of the utilization of dietary nitrogen by dairy cows based on urea concentration in milk  ap. 579-584.  aThe objective of this study was to determine whether milk urea concentration is a valuable tool to monitor the utilization of dietary N by dairy cows. Data from 11 feed trials (n = 2828 observations of 356 cows) were used in this study. Dietary protein utilization was evaluated according to the Dutch DVE-OEB system. A close correlation (0.8) was found between rumen-degraded protein balance in the ration and urea concentration in milk. The effects of the balance of true protein digested in the small intestine and net energy on milk urea concentration were small but significant. Parity and stage of lactation did not significantly influence milk urea concentration. Because of the large variation among and within cows, the monitoring of protein utilization of an individual cow was inaccurate. However, milk urea concentration in bulk milk is a valuable tool to monitor the rumen-degraded protein balance in the ration. 3adairy cows 3amilk composition 3aurea 3adietary protein 3aenergy balance 3asmall intestine 3aprediction 3aaccuracy 3arumen fermentation 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aDiet 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aMilkxchemistry 2aNitrogenxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aParity 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aUreaxanalysis 0aprotein digestion 0aprotein balance1 aMeijer, R.G.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Feb., v. 81, no. 2 p.579-584x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03314naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245008200186300001600268500002400284520170200308650002002010650001602030650001402046650001502060650002002075650002202095650001502117650002002132650001702152650002002169650002102189650001402210650004902224650001802273650003002291650001102321650002602332650005602358653001202414653003502426653001702461653003002478653003702508700002002545700002102565700002402586773010502610852000902715856004802724655001202772IND4441306720221120093049.0100813e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444130672DNAL7 a201308912pmid7 a10.1007/s00394-010-0094-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÃhrvik, Veronica10aFolates in bread: retention during bread-making and in vitro bioaccessibility  ap. 365-372.  aIncludes references  aBackground Bread is an important folate source in several countries. However, bread-making was reported to cause losses of endogenous bread folates (~40%) as well as added synthetic folic acid (~30%). Furthermore, the bread matrix is suggested to inhibit absorption of folates. Purpose To (1) estimate retention of both, endogenous folates and synthetic fortificants, during bread-making, (2) assess in vitro folate bioaccessibility from breads and a breakfast meal and (3) assess in vitro folate uptake. Methods Retention of folate forms was assessed by preparing fortified (folic acid and [6S]-5-CHâ-Hâfolate) wholemeal breads and collect samples from dough, proofed dough and the bread. In vitro folate bioaccessibility was assessed using the TNO gastrointestinal model TIM. In vitro folate uptake was assessed using a novel Caco-2 cell/stable isotope model. Folate content in samples was measured using LCMS. Results Bread-making resulted in losses of 41% for endogenous folates and up to 25 and 65% for folic acid and [6S]-5-CHâ-Hâfolate fortificant, respectively. 75% of endogenous bread folates and 94% of breakfast folates were bioaccessible as assessed by TIM. From [6S]-5-CHâ-Hâfolate-fortified bread, relative folate uptake into Caco-2 cells was 71 Â± 11% (P < 0.05) when compared with a standard solution. Conclusion Retention of folic acid fortificant during bread-making was substantially higher compared to retention of [6S]-5-CHâ-Hâfolate fortificant. Data from the TIM and Caco-2 cell trials suggest an inhibiting effect of the tested bread matrices on in vitro bioaccessibility of folates, whereas folate bioaccessibility from a breakfast meal is almost complete. 3abioavailability 3abread dough 3abreakfast 3afolic acid 3astable isotopes 3awhole wheat bread 2aAlgorithms 2aBreadxanalysis 2aCaco-2 Cells 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aCookingxmethods 2aDigestion 2aFolic Acidxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFood Analysis 2aFood, Fortifiedxanalysis 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aTetrahydrofolatesxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aFolates 0aTNO gastrointestinal model TIM 0aBread-making 0aIn vitro bioaccessibility 0aCaco-2-cell/stable isotope model1 aÃhrvik, Helena1 aTallkvist, Jonas1 aWitthÃ¶ft, Cornelia0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2010 Sept., v. 49, no. 6 p.365-372dSpringer-Verlagx1436-62077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-010-0094-y 7aarticle02895naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001900167245011000186300001600296500002400312520165600336650002401992650001502016650002202031650002302053650001602076650000902092650001102101650002102112650001702133650003702150651001202187700001402199773009302213852000902306856008902315930003302404945002502437946001102462655001202473IND4437315320221120072527.0100522e20100607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443731532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aVÃ¡zquez, R.F.10aRainfall-runoff modelling of a rocky catchment with limited data availability: Defining prediction limits  ap. 128-140.  aIncludes references  aA distributed model was used to simulate the main hydrological processes in the Ourthe catchment, situated in the southern hilly part of Belgium. The study revealed important uncertainties associated with the current modelling, particularly with regard to the data of the groundwater system. These are likely to influence the global performance of the numerical model and as such a joint deterministic-stochastic protocol based on Monte Carlo simulations was used to calibrate the model and to assess its current prediction limits. Despite the lack of appropriate time series of observations of the groundwater system, the model performance was assessed not only on the overall simulation of streamflow but also on the prediction of hydrograph subflows for which a digital recursive filter was developed and used. The subflow estimates revealed the importance of the groundwater system as a main contributor to the streamflow. Correspondingly, the deterministic-stochastic analysis showed that the sensitivity of predictions to the horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity of the modelled groundwater system is highest. In general, broad prediction limits were obtained. The model had some difficulties to mimic well the low flows as well as flows above 60mÂ³ sâ»Â¹. These are believed to be the consequence of the significant data uncertainties and errors in boundary conditions, among other aspects. Nevertheless, the study revealed that considering the subflow estimates for evaluating model performance constitutes a tougher evaluation condition offering the potential of enhancing specificity in the assessment of the model prediction limits. 3awatershed hydrology 3awatersheds 3ahydrologic models 3aMonte Carlo method 3astream flow 3arain 3arunoff 3agroundwater flow 3ahydrogeology 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3aBelgium1 aFeyen, J.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2010 June 7, v. 387, no. 1-2 p.128-140dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.04.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100607b20100703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/06/07  aNon-US 7aarticle01852naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245005000129300001800179520082300197650002301020650001501043650001701058650001801075650003101093650001601124650001801140650001601158650001301174650001201187650002001199653001601219653004301235653001201278700001601290773008001306852000901386930003301395945001301428946001301441655001201454IND2080027720221120072635.0980507e199709  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND208002772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSidahmed, M.M.10aMeasuring spray droplets with PMS-FSSP probes  ap. 1237-1242.  aThis study is concerned with the effect of size-calibration of the Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe FSSP (model FSSP-100) on measurement of typical agricultural sprays. The FSSP was calibrated using the technique developed by Pinnick et al.

This calibration and the manufacturer-supplied calibration (which is based on a smoothed response curve) were compared with measurements of water sprays from a cold fogger, a flat fan nozzle, and a hollow cone nozzle. The manufacturer-supplied calibration distorted the shape of the drop size distributions, but the mean and median diameters and the diameters at 10, 50, and 90 percentiles remained fairly accurate (within 10%). 3aprobes (equipment) 3apesticides 3adroplet size 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3ameasurement 3aspectrometers 3acalibration 3aaccuracy 3anozzles 3adroplet studies 0acomparisons 0aforward scattering spectrometer probes 0afoggers1 aYates, W.E.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1997 , v. 40, no. 5 p.1237-1242x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US 7aarticle02957naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245012200145300001600267520140900283650001101692650001601703650001901719650001901738650001601757650002101773650001601794650001801810650000901828650001901837650002001856650001201876650002301888650003001911650007101941650002702012650003402039650003702073650000902110650002802119650003002147650002102177653001102198700001802209700001802227700002002245773008202265852000902347930003302356945001302389946001302402655001202415IND2180686920221120072658.0981027e199803  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218068692DNAL7 a95658762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrang, B.D.10aEffect of long-chain fatty acids on triglyceride accumulation, gluconeogenesis, and ureagenesis in bovine hepatocytes  ap. 728-739.  aA relationship between increased lipid concentration in the liver and reduced hepatic function has been suggested; however, there is little direct evidence of change in specific hepatic functions. Hepatocytes were obtained from ruminating calves and were incubated as monolayers for 36 h. The media contained a mixture of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) at 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mM NEFA with molar proportions of 0.435 oleate, 0.319 palmitate, 0.144 stearate, 0.049 linoleate, and 0.053 palmitoleate. Ureagenesis or gluconeogenesis was measured from 48 to 51 h after plating using hepatocytes that had only previous (12 to 48 h), only concurrent (48 to 51 h), or previous and concurrent (12 to 51 h) exposure to NEFA. A previous 36-h exposure to NEFA caused cell triglyceride accumulation, yielding triglyceride concentrations that corresponded with liver that is clinically described as normal to moderately fatty. Previous, prolonged exposure to NEFA reduced ureagenesis and increased gluconeogenesis. Concurrent exposure to NEFA did not significantly affect gluconeogenesis or ureagenesis and did not alter the residual effect of prolonged incubation with NEFA. Reduced ureagenesis was related to increased cell triglyceride accumulation independently of other direct NEFA effects. Decreased ureagenic capacity may play a role in the morbidity associated with periparturient fatty liver in dairy cows. 3acalves 3ahepatocytes 3acultured cells 3adisease models 3afatty liver 3atriacylglycerols 3afatty acids 3aculture media 3aurea 3aliver function 3agluconeogenesis 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aFatty Acidsxpharmacology 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aGlucagonxpharmacology 2aGluconeogenesisxdrug effects 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aPropionatesxmetabolism 2aTriglyceridesxmetabolism 2aUreaxmetabolism 0auptake1 aBertics, S.J.1 aGrummer, R.R.1 aArmentano, L.E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Mar., v. 81, no. 3 p.728-739x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02683naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008500129300001800214500001500232520150900247650002001756650001301776650001301789650001501802650001301817650001501830650000901845650001601854650001101870650001301881650002101894651001301915653001601928653001601944653001201960653002101972653001701993700001802010700001902028700001802047773008002065852000902145930003302154945001302187946001302200655001202213IND2080028420221120072649.0980507e199709  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND208002842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeatwole, C.D.10aMovement of field-applied atrazine, metolachlor and bromide in a sandy loam soil  ap. 1267-1276.  a2019-12-05  aAtrazine, metolachlor, and bromide movement in the top 1.5 m of a Suffolk sandy loam soil (coarse-loamy, siliceous, thermic Typic Hapludult) in the Virginia Coastal Plain, were characterized under management practices typical of the region. The study was conducted during the 1990 corn growing season, from May to September, on two 18 x 27 m plots in a field that was in the second year of a two-year no-till small grain/soybean/corn rotation. One plot was moldboard plowed and disked before corn planting and chemical application while the other remained no-till. Simulated rainfall (37 mm) the second day after chemical application resulted in bromide leaching below 1.2 m, and atrazine and metolachlor were detected to the 0.9-1.2 m depth layer. Leaching was significant in the first 30 days following chemical application, after which there was no significant downward movement of chemicals. Chemical concentrations tended to be greater in the no-till profile initially, and greater in the tilled profile at the end of the season. Atrazine was more persistent than metolachlor, with 50% (NT) and 56% (TP) of the applied atrazine remaining in the 1.5 m soil profile at the end of the 157 day study period, as compared to 8% (NT) and 4% (TP) of metolachlor. Due to greater infiltration and the possible compounding effect of preferential flow, the no-till plot presented a greater potential for herbicide leaching compared to the tilled plot in the first rainfall events following chemical application. 3awater pollution 3aatrazine 3aZea mays 3ano-tillage 3aleaching 3asoil depth 3arain 3ametolachlor 3arunoff 3abromides 3asandy loam soils 3aVirginia 0acomparisons 0apersistence 0atillage 0amovement in soil 0ainfiltration1 aZacharias, S.1 aMostaghimi, S.1 aDillaha, T.A.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1997 , v. 40, no. 5 p.1267-1276x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US 7aarticle02557naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181072000900190100001500199245009200214300001600306500002400322500001500346520094300361650002501304650003101329650002201360650001601382650002601398650002101424650001901445650002001464650001001484650002001494650003601514650002801550650001001578650002101588651001001609653002501619700001501644700001401659700001601673700001501689700001601704773010001720852000901820856006901829930003301898945002501931946001101956655001201967IND4386714520221120063002.0070111e20060524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438671452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2005.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL840 0aL200 0aF0001 aChen, C.S.10aEffects of Scutellariae Radix on gene expression in HEK 293 cells using cDNA microarray  ap. 346-351.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the present study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of Scutellaria Radix (SR). The complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray method was used to survey the effects of SR on the changes of gene expression profile in HEK293 cells. Based on differential expression, 66 genes were selected for further analysis from 9600 candidate genes in the microarray; 23 genes were validated by RT-PCR. The broad spectrum of the differentially expressed genes, including those associated with inflammation, immune response, energy metabolism, as well as others, such as ISGF3G, IL6ST, CD98, ATP5G2, PHKG2, YB-1 and SLC7A4, indicate overall cellular response to SR treatment. Our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of SR may be related to IL6ST down-expression, and over-expression of CD98. Moreover, SR-related improvement in immune response may be related to the ISGF3G over-expression. 3atraditional medicine 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acomplementary DNA 3aethnobotany 3amicroarray technology 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3agene expression 3agenes 3aimmune response 3achemical constituents of plants 3aScutellaria baicalensis 3aroots 3aherbal medicines 3aChina 0amedicinal properties1 aChen, N.J.1 aLin, L.W.1 aHsieh, C.C.1 aChen, G.W.1 aHsieh, M.T.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2006 May 24, v. 105, no. 3 p.346-351dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2005.11.0123electronic resource  a20070320b20070402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/03/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02824naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245012400142300001600266520113100282650000901413650001701422650001801439650001601457650001501473650001301488650002401501650002501525650002801550650001101578650002601589650001301615650001601628650001201644650001101656650003201667650000901699650002501708650003601733650001101769650005901780650002801839650002101867650002001888650002201908653001501930653002201945653002301967700001501990700001802005700001702023700002002040773008202060852000902142930003302151945001302184946001302197655001202210IND2181213320221120062824.0981120e199804  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218121332DNAL7 a95943842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurso, G.10aEffect of sustained-release somatotropin on performance and grazing behavior of ewes housed at different stocking rates  ap. 958-965.  aThis study evaluated the effects of recombinant bovine somatotropin (bST; one injection of 320 mg per ewe) on milk production and composition and on the grazing behavior of multiparous ewes in the third to fourth lactation. Forty Comisana lactating ewes were divided into four groups: 1) untreated, grazing on natural pasture (botanical composition: 35% of Graminaceae, 49% of Fabaceae, 6% of Cruciferae, 10% of other families) at a low stocking rate (16 m2/d); 2) untreated, grazing at a high stocking rate (8 m2/d); 3) treated with bST, grazing at a low stocking rate; and 4) treated with bST, grazing at a high stocking rate. The diets of the ewes were supplemented with vetch and oat hay (500 g/d) and with concentrate (500 g/d). Treatment increased milk production (923.8 vs. 669.5 g/d) but had little effect on fat and protein contents. Administration of bST significantly increased herbage intake; the effect on intake was more marked at the high stocking rate. Under these grazing conditions, the treated ewes reduced selective intake behavior and, thus, achieved good feed intake despite the low biomass availability. 3aewes 3asomatotropin 3astocking rate 3afeed intake 3amilk yield 3aewe milk 3amilk fat percentage 3achemical composition 3amilk protein percentage 3aforage 3abotanical composition 3apastures 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDelayed-Action Preparations 2aDiet 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aEnergy Metabolismxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aGrowth Hormonexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aLactationxdrug effects 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aSheepxphysiology 0adry matter 0aselective grazing 0acontrolled release1 aAvondo, M.1 aBordonaro, S.1 aMarletta, D.1 aGuastella, A.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Apr., v. 81, no. 4 p.958-965x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle05400naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100002200185245006900207300001400276500002400290520286300314650000903177650001703186650000903203650001703212650002403229650002403253650001903277650002003296650001303316650002503329650002103354650002103375650001503396650003103411650002503442650003003467650001203497650002603509650003303535650003203568650007203600650000903672650004103681650005103722650004603773650007203819650000903891650003703900650009603937650004204033650003004075650002604105653004504131700001904176700002104195700002904216700002304245700002204268700002504290700002204315700002104337773009404358852000904452856008804461930003304549945002504582946001104607655001204618IND4437324320221120062926.0100522e20100528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443732432DNAL7 a201939812pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.01.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL822 0aL8321 aDingman, Patricia10aAssociation of Wolbachia with heartworm disease in cats and dogs  ap. 50-60.  aIncludes references  aAlthough the presence of adult Dirofilaria immitis in the pulmonary arteries and its associated arteritis and thromboembolic disease can explain some of the manifestations of canine and feline heartworm disease, the cause of other findings remains unclear. Cats with D. immitis antibodies but lacking adult parasites in the pulmonary arteries frequently develop histological lesions of the airways, resulting in a condition termed Heartworm-Associated Respiratory Disease. All D. immitis parasites harbor Wolbachia pipientis bacteria and D. immitis-infected animals can have circulating Wolbachia antibodies and pro-inflammatory Wolbachia antigens (WSP) deposited in tissues. Little is known about the role that Wolbachia plays in lung disease of animals naturally infected with D. immitis. The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of Wolbachia to the pathogenesis of natural heartworm disease in cats and dogs. We hypothesized that animals having sufficient Wolbachia burden to be detected in lung tissue by immunohistochemistry and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) would have more severe pulmonary disease than those with bacteria below the limits of detection. We further hypothesized that animals that were immunoreactive to pro-inflammatory WSP would have more severe pulmonary lesions than those that were seronegative for WSP antibodies. Blood and lung tissue samples were collected from cats and dogs representing three different D. immitis infection statuses: heartworm-free, heartworm-exposed, heartworm-infected. There was a positive but weak correlation between the magnitude of D. immitis antibody titers and WSP titers in cats (r =0.57, p <0.001) and in dogs (r =0.39, p <0.001). Pulmonary lesions were more common in HW-infected animals than in HW-free animals. Pulmonary arteriolar occlusion was more common in HW-infected cats (57%; p =0.003) than in HW-infected dogs (17%). Although pulmonary lesions were most common in HW-infected animals, there was no clear additive effect when either Wolbachia DNA/WSP was detected in lung tissue or when circulating Wolbachia antibodies were detected. There were no significant differences in the magnitude of pulmonary lesion scores within each HW-infection status group regardless of whether Wolbachia DNA/WSP or antibodies were detected. The relationship between Wolbachia and lung pathology in heartworm-infected animals remains to be determined. The lack of clear evidence for a role of Wolbachia in heartworm disease creates a dilemma for veterinarians treating animals in D. immitis-endemic areas. Although the indiscriminant use of antibiotics should be avoided, many clinicians prescribe doxycycline based on the favorable responses observed in human filarial diseases and promising results from the first published studies of doxycycline use in D. immitis-infected dogs. 3acats 3acat diseases 3adogs 3adog diseases 3aWolbachia pipientis 3aDirofilaria immitis 3adirofilariasis 3amixed infection 3aetiology 3abacterial infections 3apulmonary artery 3alesions (animal) 3aantibodies 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aimmunohistochemistry 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agents 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aAntibodies, Helminthxblood 2aCat Diseasesxdrug therapyximmunologyxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aCats 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDirofilaria immitisximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aDirofilariasisximmunologyxparasitology. 2aDog Diseasesxdrug therapyximmunologyxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aDogs 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aLung Diseases, Parasiticxdrug therapyximmunologyxmicrobiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 2aWolbachiaximmunology 0aheartworm-associated respiratory disease1 aLevy, Julie K.1 aKramer, Laura H.1 aJohnson, Calvin M.,cJr.1 aLappin, Michael R.1 aGreiner, Ellis C.1 aCourtney, Charles H.1 aTucker, Sylvia J.1 aMorchon, Rodrigo0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 May 28, v. 170, no. 1-2 p.50-60dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.01.0373Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/07/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03112naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245011500141300001600256520155500272650000901827650001401836650001201850650001901862650002101881650002501902650001301927650000901940650001201949650003301961650002301994650002502017650003102042650002802073650006702101650002102168650000902189650002602198650000902224650002502233650002002258653000902278653003202287700001402319700001702333700001302350700001602363700001802379700001602397773007802413852000902491939003302500946001302533655001202546IND8903869920221120045046.0890718e198905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890386992DNAL7 a27238302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBond, V.10aEffects of dietary fish oil or pectin on blood pressure and lipid metabolism in the DOCA-salt hypertensive rat  ap. 813-817.  aThis study investigated the effects of diets containing fish oil or pectin on blood pressure and lipid metabolism in the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rat. Three groups (8 rats/group) of unilaterally nephrectomized rats were fed for 21 d one of three purified diets: a) 8% fish oil + 2% safflower oil + 5% alpha cellulose (fish oil diet), b) 10% safflower oil + 5% pectin (pectin diet), or c) 10% safflower oil + 5% alpha cellulose (control diet). Each of the diets contained 6% NaCl and all rats received DOCA (30 mg/kg body wt, subcutaneously) twice weekly. Systolic blood pressure of rats fed fish oil was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than that of rats fed the control diet; there was no significant difference between the pectin and control groups. Plasma renin activity and net sodium and potassium balances were similar among the three groups. Plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in the group fed the fish oil diet than in the group fed the control diet. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol did not differ between rats fed the pectin and rats fed the control diet. Plasma triglyceride concentration did not differ among the three groups. Thus, dietary fish oil attenuated the development of DOCA-salt hypertension, unrelated to alterations of net sodium balance. Fish oil feeding also lowered total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, but did not alter the HDL/LDL ratio. In contrast, dietary pectin exerted no effect on blood pressure or lipid metabolism. 3adiet 3afish oils 3apectins 3ablood pressure 3alipid metabolism 3adesoxycorticosterone 3aacetates 3arats 2aAnimals 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effects 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDesoxycorticosterone 2aDietary Fatsxpharmacology 2aFish Oilsxpharmacology 2aHypertensionxchemically inducedxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMale 2aPectinsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aSodium Chloride 0asalt 0adeoxycorticosterone acetate1 aOrdor, O.1 aBruckner, G.1 aWebb, P.1 aKotchen, T.1 aTearney, R.J.1 aAdams, R.G.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1989 May, v. 119, no. 5 p.813-817x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03194naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002400177245014100201300001800342500002400360520186600384650001002250650002102260650001802281650002202299650001702321650002202338650001402360650002302374650002202397650001402419650001702433650001802450700001602468773009602484852000902580856009002589930003302679945002502712946001102737655001202748IND4437325320221120035521.0100522e20101015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443732532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF110 0aQ5051 aGinÃ© Bordonaba, J.10aManipulating the taste-related composition of strawberry fruits (Fragaria Ã ananassa) from different cultivars using deficit irrigation  ap. 1020-1026.  aIncludes references  aDemand and, consequently, production of strawberry fruits has increased over the past few years and, as a result, the water abstractions for cultivation of this fruit have risen considerably. To limit the amounts of water used for several horticultural crops, water deficit irrigation (DI) has been seen as a potential alternative for new cultivation systems. DI in strawberry fruits is generally associated with reduction in berry size and yield; however, a recent study demonstrated that DI on strawberry can increase the concentration of some taste- and health-related compounds in fruits from cv. Elsanta. Hence, the aim of the present study was to further corroborate such findings and to assess the response (and variability) among different strawberry cultivars (namely Christine, Elsanta, Florence, Sonata and Symphony) to imposed water-DI conditions. Water-DI affected both fruit physiology and biochemistry. Nevertheless, the response to drought stress was different for each of the cultivars tested. Plants from cvs. Elsanta, Sonata and Symphony showed a greater reduction in berry size, accompanied by a significant increase in dry matter content for fruit harvested from DI-treated plants. Concomitant to this, and where dry matter was increased, the concentrations of sugars and some acids were generally higher in DI-derived fruit. In contrast, cvs. Florence and Christine did not show significant variations in berry weight or any of the target analytes measured when grown under the conditions imposed in this study. The results presented herein suggest that reducing water irrigation between flower initiation and fruit harvest may be a viable technique for increasing the concentrations of taste-related compounds in cvs. Elsanta, Sonata and Symphony and it may not have a negative impact on overall fruit size of cvs. Christine and Florence. 3ataste 3aflavor compounds 3afood analysis 3afruit composition 3astrawberries 3aFragaria ananassa 3acultivars 3adeficit irrigation 3abreed differences 3asweetness 3awater stress 3afruit quality1 aTerry, L.A.0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Oct. 15, v. 122, no. 4 p.1020-1026dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0603Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/06/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02497naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001800177245011100195300001800306500002400324520093400348650002201282650001701304650001601321650001701337650000901354650001801363650001901381650002201400650002801422650002101450650002401471650002701495653001301522653001401535653004501549700001701594700001701611700001501628700001401643700001501657700001901672773009601691852000901787856009001796930003301886945002501919946001101944655001201955IND4437325220221120035539.0100522e20101015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443732522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ500 0aT300 0aX3801 aQuiÃ±ones, M.10aLong-term intake of CocoanOX attenuates the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats  ap. 1013-1019.  aIncludes references  aWe have evaluated the effect of the long-term intake of a cocoa powder, with high concentration of polyphenols, named CocoanOX (CCX), on the development of hypertension of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Systolic blood pressure was measured weekly in the rats, from the 6th to 24th week of life, by the tail cuff method. The development of hypertension was attenuated in the groups treated with captopril or CCX. The antihypertensive effect was more accentuated in the group treated with captopril, and it was paradoxically more accentuated in the group treated with the lowest dose of CCX than in the other CCX groups. The arterial blood pressure increased in the treated SHR when the corresponding antihypertensive treatment was removed. Both, CCX and the standard cocoa, improved the aorta endothelial function in the SHR. In conclusion, CCX could be used as a functional food ingredient with antihypertensive activity. 3along term effects 3acocoa powder 3apolyphenols 3ahypertension 3arats 3aanimal models 3ablood pressure 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aantihypertensive effect 3afunctional foods 3adietary supplements 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 0aCocoanOX 0acaptopril 0aangiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors1 aSÃ¡nchez, D.1 aMuguerza, B.1 aMoulay, L.1 aLaghi, S.1 aMiguel, M.1 aAleixandre, A.0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Oct. 15, v. 122, no. 4 p.1013-1019dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0593Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/06/21  aNon-US 7aarticle04266naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100002400185245014900209300001400358500002400372500001500396520242200411650002302833650002102856650001302877650002402890650002502914650002002939650002102959650002102980650001203001650005703013650004703070650001003117650005903127650003703186650003203223650001803255650002603273650001203299651001003311651001003321653002303331653002303354700002003377700001903397773009403416852000903510856008803519930003303607945002503640946001103665655001203676IND4437324620221120035605.0100522e20100528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443732462DNAL7 a201495412pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL822 0aF1301 aAmaradasa, Bimal S.10aVertical migration of Haemonchus contortus infective larvae on Cynodon dactylon and Paspalum notatum pastures in response to climatic conditions  ap. 78-87.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObservations were made on vertical migration patterns of Haemonchus contortus infective larvae on Cynodon dactylon (bermudagrass) and Paspalum notatum (bahiagrass) pastures under summer climatic conditions typical of East Texas. Ten thousand H. contortus infective larvae (L3) were introduced to 100cmÂ² subplots of each pasture species within a plot area of 1mÂ². Subplots were inoculated with larvae by applying them in an aqueous medium to the soil or mat beneath the vegetation. Herbage from the inoculated areas was harvested on 5 sampling days over a span of 21 days. L3 recoveries were observed and recorded each day on four herbage strata viz. 0-5, 5-10, 10-20 and >20cm from ground level. The log transformed larval recovery data were analyzed for effect of day, stratum, and dayÃstratum interaction for each grass species during two separate experimental periods. Precipitation, relative humidity and temperature during the study were subjected to correlation and multiple regression analyses with the larval counts. Significant (P â¤0.0017) differences were found for the effect of day on larval recoveries. No significant differences were detected for stratum or dayÃstratum interaction effects, though stratum provided a strong indication of influencing larval recovery. A high positive correlation (â¥0.93) between rainfall and total average daily larval counts was apparent. The multiple regression analysis did not show significant results for any of the climatic factors tested. This study showed that the H. contortus infective larvae can survive beyond 21 days in the soil and infest pasture grasses when the climatic conditions are favorable. Avoiding use of H. contortus contaminated pasturelands in summer at the onset of rainfall following a dry spell may effectively reduce nematode loads in susceptible farm animals. Additional studies should focus on factors affecting long term L3 survivability, migrational pattern on these and other plant species and the relationship between climatic factors and larval migration patterns throughout the year. Total larval recovery of H. contortus in this study was greater in bahiagrass than bermudagrass. While the design of this study did not allow for testing one pasture species against another, studies with potted plants would allow for some valid comparisons. Soil characteristics may also play a role in L3 survival and subsequent migration. 3amigratory behavior 3aCynodon dactylon 3apastures 3anematode infections 3aHaemonchus contortus 3anematode larvae 3aclimatic factors 3aPaspalum notatum 2aAnimals 2aGastrointestinal Diseasesxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aGoat Diseasesxparasitologyxtransmission. 2aGoats 2aHaemonchiasisxparasitologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aHaemonchusxgrowth & development 2aLarvaxgrowth & development 2aLinear Models 2aPoaceaexparasitology 2aWeather 3aTexas 0aTexas 0avertical migration 0amigration behavior1 aLane, Robert A.1 aManage, Ananda0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 May 28, v. 170, no. 1-2 p.78-87dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.01.0263Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/07/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02266naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245004400145300001600189520112100205650001501326650002101341650001501362650001801377650001701395650002301412650001201435650001101447650001101458650001401469650002001483650001101503650001401514650002401528650001701552650001001569653001301579700001601592700001601608700002201624773008201646852000901728930003301737945001301770946001301783655001201796IND2181213720221120035527.0981120e199804  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218121372DNAL7 a95943872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinsel, M.L.10aRisk factors for twinning in dairy cows  ap. 989-993.  aRecords for 52,362 lactations over a 10-yr period from 260 dairy farms in North America that used a common commercial software for record keeping were evaluated for potential risk factors for twinning. Records were evaluated for the associations of reproductive disease, parity, production, drug therapy, and the occurrence of subsequent twins. The rate of twinning on these farms steadily increased over the observation period from 1.4% in 1983 to 2.4% in 1993. The rate of twinning also increased as parity of the cow increased, from 1.0% for cows in their first lactation to >4.1% for cows in their fifth or higher lactation. No association between twinning and season of year was detected. A multivariate logistical regression analysis found that the rate of twinning increased with increases in milk production, incidence of cystic ovarian disease, and the use of common pharmaceuticals, including GnRH, PGF2 alpha, and antibiotics. Results of the regression model also indicated that the single most important reason for the recent increase in the rate of twinning was a concurrent increase in milk production. 3adairy cows 3alactation number 3amilk yield 3aovarian cysts 3arisk factors 3aseasonal variation 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aLogistic Models 2aParity 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Multiple 2aRisk Factors 2aTwins 0atwinning1 aMarsh, W.E.1 aRuegg, P.L.1 aEtherington, W.G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Apr., v. 81, no. 4 p.989-993x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03503naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002100176245008200197300001400279500002400293520192900317650001102246650001902257650002402276650002502300650001402325650002002339650002002359650002502379650003002404650001202434650001102446650003302457650001102490650006202501650000902563650002402572650004702596650004402643700002102687700001702708773009402725852000902819856008802828930003302916945002502949946001102974655001202985IND4437324820221120035012.0100522e20100528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443732482DNAL7 a201531152pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.01.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8221 aStancampiano, L.10aSpatial niche competition among helminth parasites in horse's large intestine  ap. 88-95.  aIncludes references  aThe spatial distribution of large intestinal helminth parasites of 50 horses was studied. Both adult and mucosal larval stages were examined and counted within the ventral colon, dorsal colon and caecum. Thirty-three species of adult parasites were identified and their distribution in the three large intestinal regions reported, together with the localization of cyathostome encysted larvae and of empty mucosal cysts. In order to highlight interspecific interactions, both Spearman pairwise correlation (among all parasites) and multivariable negative binomial regression (among the most abundant parasites) were performed. Interactions among parasite species are very important from the ecological and parasitological point of view as they can modulate the abundance and the spatial distribution of parasites, as well as the composition of the infracommunity. The main results were: the selection of preferred sites of horse's large intestinal helminths has been confirmed; all statistically significant pairwise correlation coefficients (359 out of 666) were positive; the build up of multivariable regression models brought to light both negative and positive interactions; the most interesting competitive interactions have been observed between the most abundant and relatively large strongyle species: Strongylus edentatus and Strongylus vulgaris in the caecum and ventral colon. When S. edentatus is in the caecum, the favourite site of S. vulgaris, the latter decreases especially in the caecum. On the other hand, when S. edentatus is in the ventral colon, its favourite site, there is no negative relationship with S. vulgaris in the ventral colon and the positive correlation observed with bivariate analysis is maintained. The common belief that the horse large intestinal parasite community is isolationist, due to the absence of negative pairwise interaction, is therefore contradicted by the present study. 3ahorses 3ahorse diseases 3aStrongylus vulgaris 3aStrongylus edentatus 3ahelminths 3alarge intestine 3anematode larvae 3aspatial distribution 3ainterspecific competition 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aHorse Diseasesxparasitology 2aHorses 2aIntestinal Diseases, Parasiticxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aRegression Analysis 2aStrongyle Infections, Equinexparasitology 2aStrongyloideaxisolation & purification1 aGras, L.

To determine if mice also develop decreased plasma PLP concentrations during pregnancy, and if plasma PLP levels in pregnancy reflect tissue levels of PLP and pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate (PMP), we measured PLP concentrations in plasma, erythrocytes and whole blood, and liver and brain PLP and PMP in control and pregnant mice. Mice were fed a nonpurified diet containing 8.13 mg pyridoxine-HCl/kg. The PLP analyses were performed with our newly developed apotryptophanase method in which the substrate S-benzyl-L-cysteine is hydrolyzed to benzyl mercaptan, reacted with Ellman's reagent and measured spectrophotometrically. During pregnancy, plasma PLP levels decreased 50% below control levels, but erythrocyte and whole blood PLP levels increased 2.9- and 1.6-fold, respectively. Liver PLP and PMP decreased 25%, in parallel with plasma PLP, but brain PLP and PMP concentrations were unchanged during pregnancy. These results suggest that metabolism or utilization of vitamin B-6 is altered in pregnancy, and that plasma PLP concentrations alone may not be a good indicator of nutritional status in pregnancy. 3apregnancy 3anutritional status 3apyridoxine 3ablood 3aliver 3abrain 3apyridoxal phosphate 3apyridoxamine 3aphosphates 3amice 2aAnimals 2aBrainxmetabolism 2aErythrocytesxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMethods 2aMice 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animalxbloodxmetabolism. 2aPyridoxal Phosphatexbloodxmetabolism. 2aPyridoxaminexanalogs & derivativesxbloodxmetabolism. 0acomposition1 aLeibman, D.1 aSmolen, A.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1989 May, v. 119, no. 5 p.750-756x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02611naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001700169245011900186300001800305500002400323520088900347650002501236650001301261650001901274650002701293650002501320650002001345650001801365650001401383650001901397650001501416650001401431650003401445650003001479650007301509650001701582650002301599650002301622650002401645650002101669650004101690650002401731650004401755650001301799700002401812700002101836700001701857700002201874773009901896852000901995856005302004655001202057IND4439035420221117184521.0100625e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443903542DNAL7 a204513742pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOng, Soon-An10aPerformance evaluation of laboratory scale up-flow constructed wetlands with different designs and emergent plants  ap. 7239-7244.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of present study was to assess the simultaneous removal of organic pollutants and nutrients by five laboratory scale up-flow constructed wetlands (UFCWs). Aerobic and anaerobic regions were well developed at the upper and lower beds, respectively, in the UFCW reactors with supplementary aeration. The emergent plants employed were Phragmites australis and Manchurian wild rice. The COD, T-N, T-P, NHâ-N and NOâ-N removal efficiencies for the UFCW reactors were in the range of 90-94%, 69-92%, 29-52%, 59-98% and 45-100%, respectively. The organic matter and NHâ-N removal efficiencies in the aerated wetland reactors were better than the non-aerated wetland reactors. The supplementary aeration has enhanced the aerobic biodegradation of organic matter and nitrification. The Manchurian wild rice outperformed P. australis in the removals of T-P, T-N and NHâ-N. 3aPhragmites australis 3aaeration 3abiodegradation 3achemical oxygen demand 3aconstructed wetlands 3aemergent plants 3anitrification 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3apollutants 3awild rice 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediationxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aLaboratories 2aNitratesxanalysis 2aOryzaxmetabolism. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxygenxanalysis 2aPhosphorusxisolation & purification 2aPoaceaexmetabolism 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxanalysis 2aWetlands1 aUchiyama, Katsuhiro1 aInadama, Daisuke1 aIshida, Yuji1 aYamagiwa, Kazuaki0 tBioresource technology.g2010 Oct., v. 101, no. 19 p.7239-7244dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.04.032 7aarticle02861naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245008100143300001600224500001500240520161900255650001501874650001601889650001201905650001301917650002101930650001601951650001901967650001801986650001902004650001502023650004702038650001202085650002302097650002002120650001102140650001402151650002902165650003202194653001502226773008202241852000902323930003302332945001302365946001302378655001202391IND2180688520221117184524.0981027e199803  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218068852DNAL7 a95658922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStuder, E.12aA veterinary perspective of on-farm evaluation of nutrition and reproduction  ap. 872-876.  a2019-12-05  aReproductive herd health programs of the 1960s and 1970s focused primarily on the control of infectious and noninfectious diseases of the reproductive tract, estrus detection, breeding technique, semen quality and handling, and endocrine imbalances. Despite veterinary intervention, conception rates dropped from 55% before this period to 45% after this period, but milk production increased greatly. Because studies have shown that the additional nutritional needs for high producing cows may be a factor limiting reproduction, bovine practitioners have become more involved with dairy nutrition. New emphasis has been placed on the concept of total production medicine with the anticipation that improved nutrition would improve reproduction. Because of a better understanding of the dynamics of energy in the dairy cow and its effect on reproduction, fertility examinations now include nutrition monitoring and body condition scoring. Several relationships between nutrition and fertility have been identified: high producing thin cows that drop 0.75 to 1.0 in body condition score resulting in anestrus; fat dry cows that develop fatty livers and associated postpartum disease; heifers that have good milk production but prolonged anestrus; dry cows with ration imbalances during the transition period that develop milk fever, retained placenta, displaced abomasum, metritis, or endometritis; lactating cows with disease in midlactation, especially feet and leg problems, resulting in lowered fertility; and healthy, lactating cows with poor conception that have high concentrations of urea N in blood or milk. 3adairy cows 3afatty liver 3aheifers 3aanestrus 3afemale fertility 3afeed intake 3aenergy balance 3aveterinarians 3abody condition 3amilk fever 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCattle Diseases 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aVeterinary Medicinextrends 0adry period0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Mar., v. 81, no. 3 p.872-876x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02026naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009700127300001600224520114000240650001901380650001901399650002501418650001701443650002401460650001501484650001801499650001801517653001501535773008201550852000901632930003301641945001301674946001301687655001201700IND2181212320221117184457.0981120e199804  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218121232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuncan, S.E.10aDairy products: the next generation.

However, niche markets are becoming increasingly lucrative. Meeting the needs of consumers within those niche markets provides an opportunity for the expansion of sales through the development of innovative dairy products. Dairy products as we have known them are evolving into the next generation of dairy products with new images, new functions, and new nutritional possibilities. Expansion of product sales and usage within niche markets require targeting the special needs and expectations of populations within those markets by the use of innovative new technologies or alternative uses of existing technologies for the development of new products. Technologies that alter nutritional profile, develop new functional characteristics, isolate or amplify specific components, extend shelf-life, or increase versatility are currently available to the dairy industry. Liaisons between research and industry are imperative to promote effective technology transfer and utilization of product and process technologies. 3adairy products 3adairy industry 3aconsumer preferences 3anew products 3aproduct development 3aseparation 3abiotechnology 3alow fat foods 0aage groups0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Apr., v. 81, no. 4 p.877-883x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02836naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009700126300001400223500001500237520135100252650001401603650001101617650002601628650002901654650001001683650001401693650001201707650001801719650002001737650001801757650001001775650001101785650001301796650002201809650001801831650001801849650001401867650001601881650002601897650002301923650001701946650001901963650001201982653001801994653001302012700001602025700001702041700001502058700002202073700001602095773006902111852000902180930003302189945001302222946001102235655001202246IND2200805620221117174649.0990928e199901  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220080562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDolfini, S.14aThe maize lilliputian mutation is responsible for disrupted morphogenesis and minute stature  ap. 11-17.  a2019-12-05  aA recessive maize mutant disrupted in seedling development was isolated following transpositional mutagenesis with Mutator. This mutant, lilliputian (lil1), exhibits a phenotype consisting of a large primary root, extremely reduced stature, crinkly leaves and has been mapped by TB-A translocations on the short arm of chromosome 2. Comparative histological analyses revealed an increase in cell number in the mutant root and leaves, as well as an irregularity in cell shapes, suggesting that the altered morphology of fill roots and leaves is related to an uncoordinated increase in cell divisions and to a defect in division plane alignment. On the other hand, the reduced stature of the mutant plant may be ascribed to a defect in cell elongation. In situ hybridization of primary root tissues reveals higher levels of alpha-tubulin transcripts in the pericycle and in cells surrounding vascular elements in mutant rather than in wild-type tissues. These features suggest a role of the Lil1 gene in the correct functioning of microtubules. Moreover, the fact that the mutation is recognizable even in the dormant embryo and that mutant seedlings are obtained from immature (12 DAP) lil1 embryos indicates that the defect in cell division pattern accounting for the disrupted seedling morphology manifests itself even during embryo development. 3aseedlings 3aheight 3aplant vascular system 3achromosome translocation 3aroots 3aphenotype 3atubulin 3acell division 3arecessive genes 3aembryogenesis 3ashape 3aleaves 3aZea mays 3aplant development 3amessenger RNA 3amorphogenesis 3ahistology 3amutagenesis 3aplant characteristics 3achromosome mapping 3amicrotubules 3aembryo (plant) 3amutants 0atransposition 0amutation1 aLandoni, M.1 aConsonni, G.1 aRascio, N.1 aDalla Vecchia, F.1 aGavazzi, G.0 tplant journal.g1999 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.11-17x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01913naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001500143245006500158300001600223520089900239650001901138650002101157650001001178650002001188650001501208650001101223651001801234700001801252700001501270700001601285773012401301852000901425856008301434939003301517946001301550655001201563IND4458150720221117160828.0110520e20110520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445815072DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12021312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, S.M.10aImpact of Polar Ozone Depletion on Subtropical Precipitation  ap. 951-954.  aOver the past half-century, the ozone hole has caused a poleward shift of the extratropical westerly jet in the Southern Hemisphere. Here, we argue that these extratropical circulation changes, resulting from ozone depletion, have substantially contributed to subtropical precipitation changes. Specifically, we show that precipitation in the southern subtropics in austral summer increases significantly when climate models are integrated with reduced polar ozone concentrations. Furthermore, the observed patterns of subtropical precipitation change, from 1979 to 2000, are very similar to those in our model integrations, where ozone depletion alone is prescribed. In both climate models and observations, the subtropical moistening is linked to a poleward shift of the extratropical westerly jet. Our results highlight the importance of polar regions for the subtropical hydrological cycle. 3aclimate models 3ahydrologic cycle 3aozone 3aozone depletion 3asubtropics 3asummer 3aPolar Regions1 aPolvani, L.M.1 aFyfe, J.C.1 aSigmond, M.0 tScience.g2011 May 20, v. 332, no. 6032 p.951-954dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12021313Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110520  aOther US 7aarticle03082naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245011500147300001600262520148300278650001501761650002001776650001401796650001701810650002201827650001801849650002101867650001901888650001201907650001201919650001301931650001201944650001101956650001501967650002201982650001702004650003202021650001102053650006102064650001902125650001702144650003002161651001602191651001602207653002202223700002102245700001802266700002102284700001802305700001902323773008202342852000902424930003302433945001302466946001302479655001202492IND2180502120221117160906.0981015e199802  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218050212DNAL7 a95324952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElbers, A.R.W.10aRisk factors for clinical mastitis in a random sample of dairy herds from the southern part of The Netherlands  ap. 420-426.  aThe incidence of clinical mastitis in dairy cows was estimated in 171 randomly selected dairy herds from the southern part of The Netherlands.

The modeling incidence rate of clinical mastitis at the herd level indicated that a number of risk factors were associated with a higher rate of clinical mastitis: one or more cows that were leaking milk, one or more cows with trampled teats, no disinfection of the maternity area after calving, consistent use of post-milking teat disinfection, Red and White cattle (Meuse-Rhine-Yssel) as the predominant breed, and an annual bulk milk somatic cell count <150,000 cells/ml. The following risk factors were associated with a higher rate of clinical mastitis caused by Escherichia coli: cows with trampled teats, no disinfection of the maternity area after calving, consistent use of post-milking teat disinfection, use of a thick layer of bedding in the stall, and the stripping of foremilk before cluster attachment. The following risk factors were associated with a higher rate of clinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus: Red and White cattle (Meuse-Rhine-Yssel) as the predominant breed, cows with trampled teats, the stripping of foremilk before cluster attachment, no regular disinfection of the stall, no regular replacement of stall bedding, and an annual bulk milk somatic cell count <150,000 cells/ml. 3adairy cows 3abovine mastitis 3aincidence 3arisk factors 3abreed differences 3aanimal health 3amilking machines 3acattle housing 3amilking 3ahygiene 3aHolstein 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Count 2aDairyingxmethods 2aDisinfection 2aEscherichia coli Infections 2aFemale 2aMastitis, Bovinexepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aMilkxcytology 2aRisk Factors 2aStaphylococcal Infections 3aNetherlands 0aNetherlands 0ameuse-rhine-yssel1 aMiltenburg, J.D.1 aLange, D. de.1 aCrauwels, A.P.P.1 aBarkema, H.W.1 aSchukken, Y.H.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Feb., v. 81, no. 2 p.420-426x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02693naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245007000124300001600194520175300210650001301963650001701976650002001993650002102013650002002034653002402054653002302078653001702101653001702118700001802135700001502153700001702168773007802185852000902263930003302272945001302305946001302318655001202331IND2062720820221123041245.0980325e199707  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206272082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWay, T.R.10aTractor tire aspect ratio effects on soil stresses and rut depths  ap. 871-881.  aA 580/70R38 tractor drive tire with an aspect ratio of 0.756 and a 650/75R32 tire with an aspect ratio of 0.804 were operated at two dynamic loads and two inflation pressures on a sandy loam and a clay loam with loose soil above a hardpan. Soil stresses were determined just above the hardpan beneath the centerlines and edges of the tires. Rut depths were measured at the centerline and edge of each tire track. The octahedral shear stress and rut depth were not significantly different for the tires. The peak octahedral normal stress was not significantly different for the two tires when the dynamic load was 17.2 kN, but was significantly greater for the 650/75R32 tire when the dynamic load was 30.9 kN. Soil stresses and rut depths increased with increasing dynamic load at constant inflation pressure, and with increasing inflation pressure at constant dynamic load. Net traction and tractive efficiency decreased with increasing inflation pressure at constant dynamic load. At constant inflation pressure, tractive efficiency increased with increasing dynamic load. In comparisons of the centerline and edge locations, soil stresses were significantly less beneath the edges than the centerlines of the tires. Ratios of the mean stress beneath the centerline to the mean beneath the edge for four combinations of dynamic load and inflation pressure ranged from 2.18 to 3.77 for the peak octahedral normal stress and 1.76 to 3.18 for the corresponding octahedral shear stress. Ratios of the rut depth at the centerline to the edge ranged from 1.04 to 1.49. In summary, for these two tires with their slightly different aspect ratios, no fundamental differences were found that would clearly indicate that one tire was better than the other. 3atractors 3adynamic load 3asoil compaction 3asandy loam soils 3aclay loam soils 0atractive efficiency 0ainflation pressure 0aradial tires 0anet traction1 aKishimoto, T.1 aBurt, E.C.1 aBailey, A.C.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1997 , v. 40, no. 4 p.871-881x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US 7aarticle02407naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245008900202300001600291506007600307520091400383506003701297650003201334650001401366650001001380650003001390650001301420650001001433650002301443650000901466650001301475650002401488650002501512650002901537700002001566700002101586700001701607700001701624700002201641773012401663852000901787856008301796939003301879946001301912655001201925IND4458151120221207083854.0110520e20110520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445815112DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12028452doi7 aPMC31284302pmcid7 a215969892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Cheng-Ran10aChromatin "Prepattern" and Histone Modifiers in a Fate Choice for Liver and Pancreas  ap. 963-966.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTranscriptionally silent genes can be marked by histone modifications and regulatory proteins that indicate the genes' potential to be activated. Such marks have been identified in pluripotent cells, but it is unknown how such marks occur in descendant, multipotent embryonic cells that have restricted cell fate choices. We isolated mouse embryonic endoderm cells and assessed histone modifications at regulatory elements of silent genes that are activated upon liver or pancreas fate choices. We found that the liver and pancreas elements have distinct chromatin patterns. Furthermore, the histone acetyltransferase P300, recruited via bone morphogenetic protein signaling, and the histone methyltransferase Ezh2 have modulatory roles in the fate choice. These studies reveal a functional "prepattern" of chromatin states within multipotent progenitors and potential targets to modulate cell fate induction.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3achromatin 3agenes 3ahistone acetyltransferase 3ahistones 3aliver 3amethyltransferases 3amice 3apancreas 3aregulatory proteins 3aregulatory sequences 3atranscription (genetics)1 aCole, Philip A.1 aMeyers, David J.1 aKormish, Jay1 aDent, Sharon1 aZaret, Kenneth S.0 tScience.g2011 May 20, v. 332, no. 6032 p.963-966dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12028453Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110520  aOther US 7aarticle03720naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195072000900204100002100213245009000234300001600324500002400340520170000364650002002064650001202084650001102096650001102107650001702118650001302135650002202148650001302170650001702183650002002200650001002220650001502230650002102245650001202266650002202278650006502300650002102365650003702386650007302423650004402496650003202540650002502572650003702597650005602634650002102690650004102711700002102752700002102773773009702794852000902891856008902900930003302989945002503022946001103047655001203058IND4437319320221123023139.0100522e20100610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443731932DNAL7 a202074262pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL810 0aL600 0aL400 0aM0011 aGarceau, Nicolas10aInhibition of goldfish mitochondrial metabolism by in vitro exposure to Cd, Cu and Ni  ap. 107-112.  aIncludes references  aAlthough impairment of aerobic capacities has been reported in metal-contaminated wild fish, little is known about the direct toxicity of the metals themselves at the low concentrations found in the field compared to indirect consequences mediated by metal effects on ecological variables such as prey type and abundance, predation and competition. This study examined the in vitro effects of Cd, Cu and Ni on mitochondrial enzyme activity and maximal (State 3) mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate in goldfish (Carassius auratus) tissues at concentrations representative of values reported in wild metal-contaminated fish. There was little effect of adding metals to liver or muscle homogenates on the activity of citrate synthase (CS), although a slight inhibition of liver CS was observed at the highest Cd concentration tested. In contrast, adding high concentrations of Ni to muscle homogenates increased muscle CS activity. Unlike CS, the metalloenzyme cytochrome C oxidase (CCO) was quite sensitive to metal additions; its activity was consistently enhanced by all three metals tested. When added to liver mitochondrial preparations, both Cd and Cu strongly inhibited State 3 respiration. In contrast, Ni did not affect mitochondrial respiration even at the highest concentration tested. Taken together, these results demonstrate that low concentrations of Cd, Cu and Ni have toxic effects on mitochondrial metabolism and enzyme activities and suggest that the inhibition of aerobic capacities frequently reported for wild metal-contaminated fish is at least partly due to metal effects on mitochondrial function, although the mechanisms probably do not involve direct enzyme inhibition. 3awater pollution 3acadmium 3acopper 3anickel 3aheavy metals 3atoxicity 3aCarassius auratus 3agoldfish 3amitochondria 3aenzyme activity 3aliver 3ametabolism 3ain vitro studies 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxtoxicity 2aCitrate (si)-Synthasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aCopperxtoxicity 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aElectron Transport Complex IVxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aEnvironmental Exposurexadverse effects 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxtoxicity 2aGoldfishxmetabolism 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMitochondriaxdrug effectsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aNickelxtoxicity 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aPichaud, Nicolas1 aCouture, Patrice0 tAquatic toxicology.g2010 June 10, v. 98, no. 2 p.107-112dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.01.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20100602b20100703c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/06/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02343naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001900166245009600185300001400281500002400295520108800319650001101407650001101418650001701429650002301446650002301469650002001492650002201512650001701534650002601551651001501577700001901592700001801611700001701629700001701646773008401663852000901747856007201756930003301828945002501861946001101886655001201897IND4386715620221123023137.0070111e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438671562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2006.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF832 0aF6001 aTubajika, K.M.14aThe effects of kaolin, harpin, and imidacloprid on development of Pierce's disease in grape  ap. 92-99.  aIncludes references  aIncidence of Pierce's disease (PD), caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, continues to increase in many vineyards in California due to the establishment and spread of the vector Homalodisca coagulata (Say) (glassy winged sharpshooter, GWSS).

Results from field studies as validated by a greenhouse study show that kaolin, harpin, and imidacloprid would be useful in reducing the development of PD in grape. 3agrapes 3akaolin 3aimidacloprid 3aXylella fastidiosa 3abacterial proteins 3adisease control 3adisease incidence 3aplant growth 3afield experimentation 3aCalifornia1 aCiverolo, E.L.1 aPuterka, G.J.1 aHashim, J.M.1 aLuvisi, D.A.0 tCrop protection.g2007 Feb., v. 26, no. 2 p.92-99dButterworthx0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2006.04.0063electronic resource  a20070330b20070402c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/03/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02976naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002200141245010700163300001800270520147000288650002401758650002801782650001401810650002301824650001901847650002101866650001501887650002001902650003201922650001701954650003201971650001102003650001202014650001102026650001102037650000702048650001902055650001002074650001402084700002302098700001702121700002502138700001902163700001902182700002402201700001602225700001902241773007302260852000902333856008102342946001102423655001202434IND4440983120221123023319.0100806e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444098312DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwq0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForcella, Matilde12aA membrane-bound trehalase from Chironomus riparius larvae: purification and sensitivity to inhibition  ap. 1186-1195.  aA preparation of a membrane-bound trehalase from the larvae of the midge Chironomus riparius (Diptera: Chironomidae) was obtained by detergent solubilization, ion-exchange chromatography and concanavalin A affinity chromatography. Trehalase was purified 1080-fold to a specific activity of 75 U mgâ»Â¹. The initial rate of trehalase activity followed Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km of 0.48 Â± 0.04 mM. Catalytic efficiency was maximal at pH 6.5. The activity was highly inhibited by mono- and bicyclic iminosugar alkaloids such as (in order of potency) casuarine (ICââ = 0.25 Â± 0.03 Î¼M), deoxynojirimycin (ICââ = 2.83 Â± 0.34 Î¼M) and castanospermine (ICââ = 12.7 Â± 1.4 Î¼M). Increasing substrate concentration reduced the inhibition. However, in the presence of deoxynojirimycin, Lineweaver-Burk plots were curvilinear upward. Linear plots were obtained with porcine trehalase. Here, we propose that deoxynojirimycin inhibits the activity of trehalase from C. riparius according to a ligand exclusion model. Inhibition was further characterized by measuring enzyme activity in the presence of a series of casuarine and deoxynojirimycin derivatives. For comparison, inhibition studies were also performed with porcine trehalase. Results indicate substantial differences between midge trehalase and mammalian trehalase suggesting that, in principle, inhibitors against insect pests having trehalase as biochemical targets can be developed. 3aChironomus riparius 3aaffinity chromatography 3aalkaloids 3acatalytic activity 3aconcanavalin A 3adeoxynojirimycin 3adetergents 3aenzyme activity 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainsect pests 3aion exchange chromatography 3alarvae 3aligands 3amidges 3amodels 3apH 3asolubilization 3aswine 3atrehalase1 aCardona, Francesca1 aGoti, Andrea1 aParmeggiani, Camilla1 aCipolla, Laura1 aGregori, Maria1 aSchirone, Raffaella1 aFusi, Paola1 aParenti, Paolo0 tGlycobiology.g2010 Sept., v. 20, no. 9 p.1186-1195x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwq0873Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03524naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245009600183300001600279500002400295520151300319650002501832650002001857650000901877650002001886650002201906650001401928650001701942650002101959650001801980650001201998650002402010650002202034650001702056650003002073650001002103650002002113650001102133650001502144650001302159650003702172650001202209650001602221650002102237650005002258650004002308650004902348650003202397650004902429650004402478650006402522700001802586700002002604700002302624700002202647700001902669773012902688852000902817856004802826655001202874IND4447446020221123005756.0110114e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444744602DNAL7 a204221672pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-010-9529-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanni, Mohamed10aMixture Toxicity Assessment of Nickel and Chlorpyrifos in the Sea Bass Dicentrarchus labrax  ap. 124-131.  aIncludes references  aThe present research work was designed to study Dicentrarchus labrax biotransformation and detoxification responses to acute exposure to nickel (Ni) and chlorpyrifos (CHP). Sexually immature sea bass were treated by intraperitoneal injection of nickel chloride (500 Î¼g kgâ»Â¹), chlorpyrifos (10 mg kgâ»Â¹), and their binary mixture for 1, 3, and 7 days. Ni and CHP accumulation was quantified in liver after the exposure periods. The following biological responses were measured: (1) NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (NCR) activity, as phase I biotransformation parameter; (2) gluthathione S-transferase (GST) activity as a phase II conjugation enzyme, acetylcholinesterase activity, and metallothionein (MT) content. Ni bioaccumulation in the liver resulted in an increasing uptake up to 15.48 Î¼g gâ»Â¹ wet weight (Ni-treated animals) and 16.73 Î¼g gâ»Â¹ wet weight (mixture-treated animals) after 7 days of exposure. CHP accumulation showed a distinct pattern in animals exposed to the mixture of chemicals in comparison with CHP-treated animals. NCR activity exhibited a marked activation in CHP and mixture-treated animals. GST activity was significantly increased starting from 1 day exposure in CHP-treated animals and after 3 days in Ni-treated animals. MT accumulation increased in all conditions, with a marked synergetic effect after 7 days of exposure. These data should be carefully considered in view of the biological effects of mixture pollutants, particularly in fish farming conditions. 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3abass 3abioaccumulation 3abiotransformation 3achlorides 3achlorpyrifos 3acytochrome P-450 3adose response 3aenzymes 3aexperimental design 3aexposure duration 3afish culture 3aintraperitoneal injection 3aliver 3ametallothionein 3anickel 3apollutants 3atoxicity 2aAcetylcholinesterasexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aBassxmetabolism 2aChlorpyrifosxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aGlutathione Transferasexmetabolism 2aLiverxdrug effectsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aMetallothioneinxmetabolism 2aNADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductasexmetabolism 2aNickelxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity.1 aJebali, Jamel1 aGuerbej, Hamadi1 aDondero, Francesco1 aBoussetta, Hamadi1 aViarengo, Aldo0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2011 Jan., v. 60, no. 1 p.124-131dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-010-9529-y 7aarticle03456naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001400190245016100204300001600365500002400381500001500405520190300420650002502323650001002348650001902358650002802377650001602405650001902421650001402440650000902454650003602463650002102499650002102520650001802541651001602559651001602575653002402591653002502615700001402640700001302654773010002667852000902767856006902776930003302845945002502878946001102903655001202914IND4386715520221123005815.0070111e20060524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438671552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2005.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL840 0aF0001 aLee, H.S.10aHypolipemic effect of water extracts of Picrorrhiza rhizoma in PX-407 induced hyperlipemic ICR mouse model with hepatoprotective effects: A prevention study  ap. 380-386.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe preventive hypolipemic effect of water extract of Picrorrhiza rhizoma (PR) was observed in Poloxamer (PX)-407 induced hyperlipemic mice with their hepatoprotective effects. Doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of PR extracts were given orally once a day for 12 weeks initiated with intraperitoneal injection of PX-407 (0.5 g/kg), and changes in body weight and gains, liver weight, serum aspartate transferase (AST) and alanine transferase (ALT) levels were monitored with serum low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. The efficacy of PX-407 was compared to that of 10 mg/kg of simvastatin (SIMVA). No meaningful changes in the body weight were detected in all dosing groups compared to that of vehicle control group. Dramatic decrease of both absolute and relative liver weight was dose-dependently observed in all PR extracts dosing groups compared to that of vehicle control group. The serum AST and ALT levels were significantly and dose-dependently decreased in PR extracts dosing groups. However, slight increase of liver weight, serum AST and ALT levels were detected in SIMVA-dosing groups. The serum LDL, triglyceride and total cholesterol levels were dose-dependently decreased in PR extracts dosing groups and SIMVA-dosing group compared to that of vehicle control group, respectively. The serum HDL levels were slightly but dose-dependently increased in PR extracts dosing groups compared to that in vehicle control group, respectively. However, the efficacy on the serum lipid levels of PR extracts was lower than that of SIMVA--about 200 mg/kg of PR extracts which showed similar effect compared to that of SIMVA 10 mg/kg. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that water extract of PR has a relatively good favorable preventive effect on the PX-407 inducing hyperlipemia with favorable hepatoprotective effect. 3atraditional medicine 3astems 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahepatoprotective effect 3aethnobotany 3aplant extracts 3abioassays 3amice 3achemical constituents of plants 3aScrophulariaceae 3aherbal medicines 3ahypolipidemia 3aSouth Korea 3aNorth Korea 0aPicrorrhiza rhizoma 0amedicinal properties1 aAhn, H.C.1 aKu, S.K.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2006 May 24, v. 105, no. 3 p.380-386dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2005.11.0103electronic resource  a20070320b20070402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/03/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02491naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002100124024001800145040001800163100002200181245014900203300001800352506007600370520111900446506003701565650000801602650001801610650002501628650002101653650002701674650001901701650001101720650001501731650001401746650001801760700002101778700001801799700002201817773009301839852000901932856008201941946001102023990002302034655001202057IND4440983920221207095901.0100806e19980615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444098392DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/26.12.28792doi7 aPMC1476462pmcid7 a96112312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Jiang-Cheng10aCharacterization of Werner syndrome protein DNA helicase activity: Directionality, substrate dependence and stimulation by replication protein A  ap. 2879-2885.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWerner syndrome is an inherited disease characterized by premature aging, genetic instability and a high incidence of cancer. The wild type Werner syndrome protein (WRN) has been demonstrated to exhibit DNA helicase activity in vitro. Here we report further biochemical characterization of the WRN helicase. The enzyme unwinds double-stranded DNA, translocating 3'[rightward arrow]5' on the enzyme-bound strand. Hydrolysis of dATP or ATP, and to a lesser extent hydrolysis of dCTP or CTP, supports WRN-catalyzed strand-displacement. Km values for ATP and dATP are 51 and 119 Î¼M, respectively, and 2.1 and 3.9 mM for CTP and dCTP, respectively. Strand-displacement activity of WRN is stimulated by single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs). Among the SSBs from Escherichia coli, bacteriophage T4 and human, stimulation by human SSB (human replication protein A, hRPA) is the most extensive and occurs with a stoichiometry which suggests direct interaction with WRN. A deficit in the interaction of WRN with hRPA may be associated with deletion mutations that occur at elevated frequency in Werner syndrome cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA helicases 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aEscherichia coli 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abacteriophages 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3aneoplasms 3astoichiometry1 aGray, Matthew D.1 aOshima, Junko1 aLoeb, Lawrence A.0 tNucleic acids research.g1998 June 15, v. 26, no. 12 p.2879-2885w43119x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/26.12.28793Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03290naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245009000144300001800234520190500252650001702157650001202174650001502186650001402201650001702215650001802232650001602250650002802266650006102294650002502355650002802380650002202408650002002430650003102450650001802481650003702499650001702536653001802553653002302571700001802594700001602612700001302628773008702641852000902728930003302737945001302770946001302783655001202796IND2327830920221122234835.0020702e200112  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232783092DNAL7 a117706372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, M.10aFate of salmonellae in calcium-supplemented orange juice at refrigeration temperature  ap. 2053-2057.  aRecent outbreaks of salmonellosis associated with orange juice have raised interest concerning the survival and growth of Salmonella in juice supplemented with calcium. A study was done to determine the influence of various calcium supplements on the survival of salmonellae in orange juice held at 4 degrees C for up to 32 days. Isolates of Salmonella Muenchen (inoculum 1), Salmonella isolates from humans and animals (inoculum 2), and Salmonella isolates from produce outbreaks (inoculum 3) were inoculated into pasteurized orange juices with pH values ranging from 3.96 to 4.19 and containing 350 mg of calcium per 240-ml serving (1.46 mg of calcium/ml). Populations of Salmonella declined rapidly in juice containing calcium lactate (CaL), with counts decreasing from 4.86 log10 CFU/ml to <1 log10 CFU/ml within 16 days, regardless of the Salmonella serotypes present in inoculum. Counts decreased from 4.89 log10 CFU/ml to <1 log10 CFU/ml in orange juice supplemented with CaL and tricalcium phosphate (TCP) within 30 days. These reductions were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) higher than those of the control (no calcium added), in which Salmonella populations decreased 3.19 +/- 0.20 log10 CFU/ml over 32 days. Populations in orange juice containing TCP or calcium citrate (CC) declined 1.34 +/- 0.20 log10 CFU/ml and 1.96 +/- 0.20 log10 CFU/ml, respectively, over 32 days. These counts were significantly higher than respective control counts in juice stored for 32 days. Populations of Salmonella of inoculum 3 inoculated into juice containing calcium citrate malate (CCM) were significantly higher than in the control. Higher numbers of cells in inoculum 3 also survived compared to numbers of cells of inocula 1 or 2 in juice supplemented with CCM. This study reveals that the form of calcium used to supplement orange juice influences the ability of salmonellae to survive. 3aorange juice 3acalcium 3aSalmonella 3amortality 3acold storage 3arefrigeration 3afood safety 2aBeveragesxmicrobiology 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aCitrusxmicrobiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aFood Preservation 2aFood, Fortified 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aRefrigeration 2aSalmonellaxgrowth & development 2aTime Factors 0afortification 0amicrobial survival1 aBeuchat, L.R.1 aDoyle, M.P.1 aChen, J.0 tJournal of food protection.g2001 Dec., v. 64, no. 12 p.2053-2057x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01317naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010500129300001600234500001500250520024700265650002100512650001300533650002700546650002200573650003600595650000900631650001000640651001100650653002100661653002300682653002600705700001600731700001500747700001800762773007300780852000900853930003300862945001300895946001100908655001200919IND2048321620221122234731.0951019e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204832162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVivar, A.R. de10aIsocapnell-9-en-8-one and 6 alpha-hydroxyisocapnell-9-en-8-one, sesquiterpenes from Buddleia species  ap. 167-170.  a2019-12-05  aThe structures of the new sesquiterpenes, isocapnell-9-en-8-one and 6 alpha-hydroxyisocapnell-9-en-8-one, isolated from two Buddleia species have been elucidated mainly on spectral grounds.

We have successfully recapitulated these two protective functions in vivo and in vitro by incubating blunt-end DNA constructs having vertebrate telomeric ends in Xenopus eggs and egg extracts. Constructs with telomeric ends are stable as linear molecules; constructs with non-telomeric ends undergo intramolecular fusion. In extracts, 99.8% of the telomeric constructs from 78 to 700 bp in length are assembled into 'model telomeres' in <5 min and have an extra-polated half-life of >3.5 years. Non-telomeric constructs circularize with first order kinetics and a half-life of 4 h. In living eggs the telomeric constructs are protected from fusion and degradation. The stability of the telomeric constructs is not due to covalent processing. Extract can protect ~100 pM telomeric ends (equivalent to 1.7 x 10â· ends/egg) even in the presence of a 20-fold excess of double-stranded telomeric DNA, suggesting that protection requires end-specific factors. Constructs with (TTGGGG)n repeats are unstable, suggesting that short tracts of this and other telomere-like sequences found within human telomeres could lead to genome instability if exposed by partial telomere erosion during aging.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aXenopus 3achemical elements 3aeggs 3agenome 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3amodels 3arepetitive sequences 3atelomeres1 aLejnine, Serguei1 aMakarov, Vladimir1 aLangmore, John P.0 tNucleic acids research.g1998 June 15, v. 26, no. 12 p.2908-2908w43119x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/26.12.29083Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02970naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100002000166245011000186300001600296500002400312500001500336520149900351650002301850650002401873650001901897650002901916650001501945650001701960650002201977650002301999650002502022650001202047650003002059650001202089651001202101653002402113653002902137700002002166700001902186773010502205852000902310856008802319930003302407945002502440946001102465655001202476IND4416559320221122225021.0090220e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441655932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2008.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP050 0aK0011 aHillen, Jessica10aForaging site fidelity shapes the spatial organisation of a population of female western barbastelle bats  ap. 817-823.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aInformation about the spatial distribution of individual foraging habitats, which determines the space required by a population to be viable, is vitally important for the conservation of bats. Detailed knowledge of this kind is crucial for the design of nature reserves and management plans. Recent field studies that examined habitat use and home range distribution of bats largely ignored factors like traditional range use vs. intra- and interspecific competition, which may be responsible for the spatial organisation of a population home range. We investigated the home range sizes and distribution of a maternity colony of the western barbastelle bat via radio telemetry in four consecutive tracking sessions (2004-2007). Based on 19 data sets with a total of 2737 fixes obtained from 12 females, we examined (i) how colony members partition the population home range (home range overlap analysis), and (ii) if individuals tracked over several years exhibit site fidelity. Home range sizes ranged from 125 to 2551ha (median: 403ha), with a median number of 2 core areas (range: 1-5 core areas per individual per year). The core area sizes ranged from 5 to 285ha (median: 67ha). A home range and core area overlap analysis showed that site fidelity across years seems to be more important for home range distribution than competition among colony members. This allows researchers to combine information from several years to get a deeper insight into the population's spatial requirements. 3aendangered species 3ahabitat preferences 3abreeding sites 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aChiroptera 3aspatial data 3awildlife habitats 3apopulation density 3apopulation structure 3afemales 3aintraspecific competition 3aforests 3aGermany 0awildlife management 0aBarbastella barbastellus1 aKiefer, Andreas1 aVeith, Michael0 tBiological conservation.g2009 Apr., v. 142, no. 4 p.817-823dElsevier Science Ltd.x0006-32077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2008.12.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20090826b20091002c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/08/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02411naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100003500166245010500201300001600306500002400322520103100346650002101377650001101398650001201409650002601421650002101447650001701468650001301485650002901498650001401527650001001541651001201551700002601563700001901589700002001608700001801628700002401646773010501670852000901775856008801784930003301872945002501905946001101930655001201941IND4416559520221122224928.0090220e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441655952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2008.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aP0501 aHarrington, L.

Under international legislation, the UK has an obligation to eradicate or to control the alien, invasive American mink. Using a large-scale field experiment, we tested the effectiveness of a specified mink removal strategy, identified through earlier modelling work, in reducing the relative abundance of mink. We found that mink removal could be effective in reducing mink populations with four months or less of trapping per year, over only 2-3 years, but that for small sites (c. 20km) a flexible, reactive approach, coupled with continual monitoring for mink presence is necessary. Survival of reintroduced water voles at four sub-sites within our mink removal sites suggest that the reactive mink removal strategy adopted in this study was sufficient for water vole protection. We discuss the use of an adaptive management approach in local mink management, and consider the wider implications of our results for invasive species control on mainlands. 3ainvasive species 3arivers 3aMustela 3afield experimentation 3avertebrate pests 3apest control 3atrapping 3aenvironmental monitoring 3amortality 3avoles 3aEngland1 aHarrington, Andrew L.1 aMoorhouse, Tom1 aGelling, Merryl1 aBonesi, Laura1 aMacdonald, David W.0 tBiological conservation.g2009 Apr., v. 142, no. 4 p.839-849dElsevier Science Ltd.x0006-32077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2008.12.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20090826b20091002c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/08/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02212naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245005600144300001600200500001500216520052300231650001900754650002600773650002600799650002200825650001500847650003600862650002700898650001100925650006300936650001400999650005201013650001101065650001901076650003601095650002201131650002401153650002101177650001701198650002201215650003601237650002601273653002401299653002301323700001301346700001601359700002101375700001801396700001801414700002001432700001901452773007301471852000901544930003301553945001301586946001101599655001201610IND2048308420221118202614.0951018e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204830842DNAL7 a75465472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, G.L.10aCytotoxic biflavonoids from Selaginella willdenowii  ap. 129-134.  a2019-12-05  aBioactivity-guided fractionation of the leaves of Selaginella willdenowii afforded three known biflavones, 4,7"-di-O-methylamentoflavone, isocryptomerin and 7"-O-methylrobustaflavone, that were significantly cytotoxic against a panel of human cancer cell lines.

Such studies unequivocally establish that two strands of each oligomer combine to form a triple-stranded DNA structure with a palindromic symmetry and with six T.A:T and six Câº.G:C hydrogen-bonded base triads. The two purine strands are placed head to head, with their 3' ends facing each other in the center of the structure. One-half of each pyrimidine strand contains protonated and the other half contains non-protonated cytosines. The two half segments containing protonated cytosines are hydrogen bonded to each of the two purine hexamers through Hoogsteen T.A and Câº.G base pairing. The segments containing non-protonated cytosines are involved in Watson-Crick (A:T and G:C) base pairing. This leads to a palindromic triplex with a C2-dyad symmetry with respect to the center of the structure. The complex is less stable at neutral pH, but the cytosines involved in Hoogsteen base pairing remain protonated even under these conditions. Molecular mechanics calculations using NMR constraints have provided a detailed three-dimensional structure of the complex. The entire stretches of purine, and the pyrimidine nucleotides have a conformation close to B-DNA.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-DNA 3aaqueous solutions 3ahydrogen bonding 3amechanics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apyrimidine nucleotides1 aChary, Kandala V.R.1 aGovil, Girjesh1 aLiu, Keliang1 aTodd Miles, H.0 tNucleic acids research.g1998 June 15, v. 26, no. 12 p.2981-2988w43119x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/26.12.29813Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02569naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245004000175300001400215520121000229650001301439650001301452650002501465650001701490650001601507650001101523650001101534650001201545650000901557650001101566650002101577650001901598650002101617650001701638650001001655650001701665650001101682650001401693653001901707653001501726653001101741700002601752700001801778773012201796852000901918856009201927930003302019946001102052655001202063IND4397726920221118202056.0071111e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439772692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2028.2007.00853.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStangeland, Torunn10aAntioxidants in some Ugandan fruits  ap. 29-30.  aSeveral studies indicate that a plant-based diet protects against the development of some serious diseases. It is assumed that the antioxidant content in food is an important reason for this protection. Dietary plants contain several hundred antioxidants, many of which are believed to act in a synergistic way to protect the body against oxidative stress. Berries, fruits, spices and some nuts have proved to be excellent sources of antioxidants. In this preliminary study, many fruits and some seeds from Ugandan plants have been analysed for total antioxidant activity using the FRAP (Ferric reducing ability of plasma) assay. Our results demonstrate that there is a large variation in antioxidant activity between the samples analysed. The plants with highest activity in decreasing order were found to be: African black olive (Canarium sweinfurthii), pomegranate, guava, java plum (Syzygium cuminii), sweet banana, tamarind, mango, orange and passion fruits, with antioxidant values in the range of 47.25 to 0.77 mmol per 100 g fresh weight. We believe that increased awareness of antioxidant activity in food and resulting change in food intake can be of importance for an improved health situation. 3aCanarium 3aSyzygium 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3afood intake 3afruits 3aguavas 3amangoes 3anuts 3aolives 3aoxidative stress 3apassion fruits 3aplant-based diet 3apomegranates 3aseeds 3asmall fruits 3aspices 3atamarinds 0adietary plants 0aFRAP assay 0afruits1 aRemberg, Siv Fagertun1 aLye, KÃ¥re A.0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2007 Dec., v. 45, no. s3 p.29-30dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0141-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2007.00853.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071111b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03011naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160100002100169245010300190300001600293500002400309500001500333520138200348650002501730650002001755650002001775650001801795650002301813650002601836650001401862650001701876650002401893650002901917650001701946650002101963650002501984650001802009650001602027650001002043650001802053650001702071650003102088653001102119700002102130700002402151773011302175852000902288856009102297930003302388945002502421946001102446655001202457IND4437318120221118202008.0100522e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443731812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2010.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aMoriwaki, Teppei10aTranscriptome analysis of gene expression during the hydrotropic response in Arabidopsis seedlings  ap. 148-157.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBecause of their sessile nature, plants require appropriate strategies to adapt to the surrounding environment. Tropism is a directional growth in response to environmental stimulus that allows plants to adapt to changes in sunlight, nutrients and water. Plant roots display hydrotropism in response to a moisture gradient, and this phenomenon is believed to play an important role in the ability of the plant to obtain water. However, the molecular mechanism underlying hydrotropism has yet to be fully elucidated. To investigate the transcriptional changes associated with root hydrotropism, we performed a whole-genome microarray analysis of Arabidopsis to monitor the transcription levels of 22,810 genes during the early phase of the hydrotropic response. The transcript levels of 793 genes were significantly changed 1 or 2hours (h) after hydrotropic stimulation. A large number of genes responsive to abscisic acid (ABA) or water-stress were among the hydrostimulation-responsive genes. In contrast, there appeared to be little overlap in transcript abundance between hydrostimulation-responsive and gravistimulation-responsive genes. Our results suggest that ABA and water-stress responses are important signal transduction mechanisms involved in the root hydrotropic response, and that the signaling pathways involved in hydrotropism differ from those of gravitropism. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscriptomics 3aseedling growth 3amessenger RNA 3asoil water content 3amicroarray technology 3aseedlings 3agravitropism 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3awater stress 3aplant adaptation 3abiochemical pathways 3atranscriptome 3aroot growth 3agenes 3aabscisic acid 3ahydrotropism 3agene expression regulation 0agenome1 aMiyazawa, Yutaka1 aTakahashi, Hideyuki0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2010 Nov., v. 69, no. 2 p.148-157dElsevier Sciencex0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2010.03.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/02  aNon-US 7aarticle01755naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002000157245006700177300001600244500001500260520053900275650002100814650002400835650002700859650003400886650001800920650002000938650001000958653001200968653001700980700001700997700002001014700001701034700001801051700001901069700001701088773006001105852000901165856007801174930003301252945001301285946001101298655001201309IND2033783520221118202033.0931005s1992    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203378352DNAL7 a241781502pmid7 a10.1007/BF001999752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChattaway, J.A.13aAn inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-6-kinase activity in pea roots  ap. 542-545.  a2019-12-04  aA soluble extract from pea (Pisum sativum L.) roots, when incubated with ATP and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, produced an inositol tetrakisphosphate.

Changes of E(pl) are correlated with auxin- and abscisic-acid-dependent growth responses and have therefore been causally related to hormone-controlled cell-wall loosening. Auxin induces an increase of E(pl) specifically in the outer epidermal wall of maize coleoptiles which is considered as the growth-limiting wall of the organ. However, detailed kinetic measurements of load-induced extension of frozen-thawed coleoptile segments necessitates a revision of the view that E(pl) represents a true plastic (irreversible) wall deformation. Segments demonstrate no significant irreversible extension when completely unloaded between loading cycles. Moreover, E(pl) can be demonstrated repeatedly if the same segment is subjected to repeated loading cycles in the extensiometer. It is shown that these phenomena result from the hysteresis behaviour of the cell wall. Stress-strain curves for loading and unloading form a closed hysteresis loop, the width of which represents E(pl) at a particular load. Auxin-treatment of segments leads to a deformation of the hysteresis loop, thereby giving rise to an increase of E(pl). These results show that the creep test estimates the viscoelastic (retarded elastic) properties rather than the plastic properties of the wall. 3aZea mays 3aauxins 3acoleoptiles 3acell growth 3acell walls 3ahysteresis 0aplasticity1 aSchopfer, P.0 tPlanta.g1992, v. 187, no. 4 p.498-504x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001999683Available from publisher's Web site  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02065naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001400157245011900171300001600290520109000306650002301396650001401419650002101433650001201454650002201466650001601488650001901504773006001523852000901583856007801592930003301670945001301703946001101716655001201727IND2033782820221118200840.0931005s1992    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203378282DNAL7 a241781472pmid7 a10.1007/BF001999712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRikin, A.10aTemporal organization of chilling resistance in cotton seedlings: effects of low temperature and relative humidity  ap. 517-522.  aThe effect of temperature and relative humidity (RH) on the time course of the rhythmic endogenous changes of chilling resistance was studied in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. Deltapine 50) seedlings grown under light-dark cycles of 12:12 h. The resistant phase to 5 degrees C, 85% RH lasted during most of the dark period while to 5 degrees C, 100% RH it was longer and extended into the last half of the light period because a transient phase advance occurred when chilling started at the middle of the light period. Seedlings acclimated by low temperature were resistant throughout the light-dark cycle. A treatment with 100% RH before chilling to acclimated seedlings introduced a sensitive phase that corresponded to that of non-acclimated seedlings. In non-acclimated seedlings, this treatment decreased the resistance but the basic pattern of the rhythm was sustained. Changes in chilling resistance were analyzed under fluctuating temperatures and RHs, and explained taking into consideration the functioning of the circadian clock and environmental induction of resistance. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aseedlings 3acircadian rhythm 3acooling 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3acold tolerance0 tPlanta.g1992, v. 187, no. 4 p.517-522x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001999713Available from publisher's Web site  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01697naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245010300174300001600277520067400293650001700967650001400984650001600998650001801014650001601032650001401048650001501062653003601077700001801113773006001131852000901191856007801200930003301278945001301311946001101324655001201335IND2033783220221118200911.0931005s1992    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203378322DNAL7 a241781482pmid7 a10.1007/BF001999732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeeley, K.A.10aDistribution of phytochrome and chlorophyll-a/b-binding-protein mRNAs in etiolated Avena seedlings  ap. 532-536.  aIn 4-d-old dark-grown oat (Avena sativa L.) seedlings, the majority of the type-I-phytochrome (phyA) mRNA was found within 10 mm of the tip of the coleoptile sheath and in the mesocotyl node; almost none was detected in the enclosed primary leaf.

Hexane extracts of treated milks were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide and assayed for antimutagenicity using the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA 100) against N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitrosoguanidine. Anti-N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitrosoguanidine activity increased significantly as the amount of added lipase increased. At the highest lipase concentration tested, activity increased 5-fold, suggesting that liberated fatty acids contributed to the increased antimutagenicity. The activities of mixtures of pure fatty acids on antimutagenesis were examined using the Ames test. At the lowest concentrations tested, mixtures of palmitic and stearic acids and mixtures of palmitic and isopalmitic acids exhibited greater activity than did the individual acids. At all doses tested, mixtures of the monoacylglycerides of palmitic and stearic acids exhibited the same activity as the individual components. Quantification of fatty acids in milk and yogurt by gas chromatography indicated a 2 to 20-fold greater content of free fatty acids in yogurt. The increase in free fatty acids may contribute to the increase in antimutagenicity of yogurt relative to that of milk. 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3areconstituted milk 3adosage 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aN-methyl-N-nitrosoguanidine 3adried skim milk 3ayogurt 3aextracts 3apalmitic acid 2aAnimals 2aAntimutagenic Agents 2aDimethyl Sulfoxide 2aFatty Acidsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxanalysis 2aFermentation 2aGlyceridesxmetabolism 2aHexanes 2aHydrolysis 2aLipasexmetabolism 2aLipolysis 2aMethylnitronitrosoguanidinexpharmacology 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMutagenicity Tests 2aPalmitic Acidxpharmacology 2aYogurtxanalysis 0afatty acids1 aZhou, L.1 aLowry, R.R.1 aBakalinsky, A.T.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Mar., v. 81, no. 3 p.664-671x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02152naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010000127300001800227520101200245650001301257650001601270650001901286650001501305650001101320650001301331650002101344650002201365650002001387651001001407653002401417653001701441653002401458653006301482653003101545700001801576773008001594852000901674930003301683945001301716946001301729655001201742IND2080035420221118201603.0980507e199709  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND208003542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakka, K.B.10aModeling macropore transport of agricultural chemicals on a river floodplain: model formulation  ap. 1355-1362.  aModeling methods were developed to simulate groundwater flow and atrazine transport at a research site on the Brazos River floodplain. Conceptualized macropores were utilized to simulate preferential flow through a highly structured clay soil. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) model, Variably Saturated Two Dimensional Transport (VS2DT), was used to simulate macropore transport of agricultural chemicals through the soil to a sand and gravel aquifer. The clay soil flow domain was decoupled from the sand and gravel aquifer. Transport simulation in the aquifer used inputs from the simulation of transport through the clay soil. The model simulated variably saturated flow in the macropores, clay soil matrix and floodplain aquifer using the Richards equation and chemical transport using the advection-dispersion equation. The flow domains for the clay soil and aquifer were detailed. Model inputs for groundwater flow and atrazine transport and the associated boundary conditions are presented. 3aatrazine 3afloodplains 3amacropore flow 3aclay soils 3arivers 3aaquifers 3agroundwater flow 3asimulation models 3awater pollution 3aTexas 0acomputer simulation 0ainfiltration 0atransport processes 0avariably saturated two-dimensional transport model (vs2dt) 0amacropore transport models1 aMunster, C.L.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1997 , v. 40, no. 5 p.1355-1362x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US 7aarticle01963naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002300157245008100180300001600261520087000277650002501147650001601172650001801188650001501206650002101221650002101242650001901263650001201282653001701294653002001311700001601331700001401347773006001361852000901421856007801430930003301508945001301541946001101554655001201565IND2033781820221118201337.0931005s1992    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203378182DNAL7 a241781392pmid7 a10.1007/BF001999632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchiefelbein, J.W.10aCalcium influx at the tip of growing root-hair cells of Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 455-459.  aThe role of extracellular Ca2+ in root-hair tip growth has been investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Root-hair length was found to be dependent on the concentration of Ca2+ in the growth medium, with maximum length achieved at [Ca2+] of 0.3-3.0 mM. Using a non-intrusive calcium-specific vibrating microelectrode, an extracellular Ca2+ gradient was detected at the tips of individual growing root-hair cells. The direction of the gradient indicated a net influx of Ca2+ into root-hair cells. No gradient was detected near the sides of the root hairs or at the tips of non-growing root hairs. When root hairs were exposed to the Ca2+-channel blocker nifedipine, tip growth stopped and the extracellular Ca2+ gradient was abolished. These results indicate that Ca2+ influx through plasma-membrane Ca2+ channels is required for normal root-hair tip growth. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acell growth 3aion transport 3aroot hairs 3aplant morphology 3aplant physiology 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 0aion activity 0acalcium channel1 aShipley, A.1 aRowse, P.0 tPlanta.g1992, v. 187, no. 4 p.455-459x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001999633Available from publisher's Web site  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03140naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245013500174300001600309520181500325650000902140650001302149650001402162650001102176650001802187650002302205650001202228650001102240650001402251650001202265650001902277650002502296650001802321650003202339650001902371650001002390651001102400653001402411773012402425852000902549856009202558930003302650946001102683655001202694IND4397726120221118201413.0071111e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439772612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2028.2007.00866.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasenene, John M.10aPostlogging structural changes and regeneration of Olea welwitschii (Knobl) Gilg. & Schellemb. in the Kibale National Park, Uganda  ap. 109-115.  aThe study was conducted in the Kibale National Park forest where both light and heavy logging was conducted during 1969-1970. The forest areas which had high stocking densities of Olea suffered the heaviest logging impacts. Research on the autecology of Olea welwitschii (Knobl) Gilg. & Schellemb., an excellent timber species, was undertaken to examine the effects of differential logging intensities on its residual population structure, tree morphology and regeneration. A series of quadrats were placed in the lightly and heavily logged forests, unlogged mature forest and in ecotonal forest tracts. All Olea trees, irrespective of size within the plots, were identified, marked, mapped and their diameter at breast height, height, branching height and multiple stemming measured. Results indicate that the distribution and abundance of Olea tree species was influenced by variations in human disturbances. Heavy forest disturbances created conditions similar to those in ecotonal sites which encouraged successful Olea tree colonization, regeneration and fast growth. However, the closed and semi-closed canopy conditions following logging suppressed Olea regeneration. These observations qualify Olea to be a colonizer and light demander in the juvenile seral stages. It exhibits high tree mortality across all size classes and low survival under natural forest conditions compared with other typical forest climax species. Heavy logging also led to shorter multiple stemmed Olea trees which retained multiple branches on the trunks below the main canopy. Consequently, low-level timber harvesting seems compatible with sustainable Olea utilization. The characteristics of Olea as a colonizing as well as canopy tree species makes it ideal for domestication, forest restoration and plantation management. 3aOlea 3abranches 3abranching 3acanopy 3adomestication 3aforest restoration 3aforests 3ahumans 3ajuveniles 3alogging 3anational parks 3apopulation structure 3astocking rate 3atree and stand measurements 3atree mortality 3atrees 3aUganda 0astructure0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2007 Dec., v. 45, no. s3 p.109-115dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0141-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2007.00866.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071111b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01787naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009500128300001600223500001500239520065500254650002500909650001100934650002600945650001900971650001200990650001501002650002201017650003601039650002701075653001101102653001601113653001901129653002201148653002301170700001701193700001601210773007301226852000901299930003301308945001301341946001101354655001201365IND2048327520221118201929.0951019e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204832752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshikawa, K.10aPhenylpropanoids and other secondary metabolites from fresh fruits of Picrasma quassioides  ap. 253-256.  a2019-12-05  aFour new constituents; two benzofuran glucosides (picraquassiosides A and B), a neolignan (picraquassioside C) and a phenol (picraquassioside D) were isolated from fresh fruits of Picrasma quassioides, together with seven known compounds.

II. The role of the epidermis in ion compartmentation  ap. 431-437.  aThe cation and anion distribution between the epidermis and mesophyll of primary leaves of 10-d-old barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seedlings was studied in relation to growth conditions. A new method was employed to isolate epidermal protoplasts. The following observations were made: (i) Under standard hydroponic growth conditions, K+ was the dominant cation and NO3(-1) the predominant anion, both in epidermal and mesophyll protoplasts. (ii) Levels of Cl- and particularly of Ca2+ were specifically increased in the epidermis when growth conditions stimulated uptake of these ions into the plants. (iii) Epidermal PO4(3-) was maintained at a very low level even in the presence of 50 mM phosphate in the rooting medium, whereas the phosphate concentration in the mesophyll was high, with phosphate being accumulated in the mesophyll vacuoles. (iv) Sulphate and NO3(-1) accumulated to a similar degree in the mesophyll and the epidermis when K2SO4 or KNO3 in the rooting medium caused salt stress to the plants. (v) Epidermal protoplasts took up (35)SO4(2-) and (36)Cl- from the surrounding medium. A comparison of the uptake rates indicates that specific ion deposition into the epidermis may partially be the consequence of differential uptake of ions from the transpiration stream. The results indicate an important function of the epidermis for ion compartmentation in barley leaves. 3aHordeum vulgare 3aleaves 3aprotoplasts 3aseedlings 3aanions 3acations 3agrowing media 3aion transport 3aplant physiology 3asalt tolerance 0aion activity 0aepidermis1 aSchramm, M.1 aLang, B.1 aLanzl-Schramm, A.1 aDurr, C.1 aMartinoia, E.0 tPlanta.g1992, v. 187, no. 4 p.431-437x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001999603Available from publisher's Web site  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02488naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245008300174300001600257520127500273650002101548650001401569650001101583650002401594650001601618650001001634650002201644650001801666650001201684650001301696651001301709653002701722653001801749700001601767700002701783773012301810852000901933856009201942930003302034946001102067655001202078IND4397165020221118201840.0071028e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439716502DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2028.2007.00793.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonnington, Colin10aLivestock and large wild mammals in the Kilombero Valley, in southern Tanzania  ap. 658-663.  aLivestock encroachment is threatening the populations of large wild mammals in Tanzania. Competition for quality grazing land by domestic stocks is one of the main factors impacting wild species during this encroachment. In the Kilombero Game Controlled Area (KGCA), extensive livestock husbandry is negatively associated with wildlife populations, especially outside the hunting season. This study assessed the relationship between livestock number and the abundance of three wild species: puku, buffalo and elephant. Spoor transects during the hunting season found the three wild species to be negatively correlated with livestock number. Direct point count surveys, both during and outside the hunting season found cattle and goat to be negatively associated with puku. The results from this study indicate that areas heavily grazed by livestock will be used to a lesser extent by wild populations, and that those areas previously used by wild species will be avoided following livestock encroachment. The protection offered by the KGCA is an ineffective tool for conserving wild large mammal populations, and an alternative conservation status whereby extensive livestock encroachment is prohibited, particularly for the more important grazing sites, is recommended. 3aanimal husbandry 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3aconservation status 3acorrelation 3agoats 3agrazing intensity 3agrazing lands 3asurveys 3awildlife 3aTanzania 0alivestock encroachment 0aout-competing1 aWeaver, Dan1 aFanning, E.q(Eibleis)0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2007 Dec., v. 45, no. 4 p.658-663dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0141-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2007.00793.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071028b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02948naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153100002100162245007500183300001400258500002400272500001500296520146800311650002801779650001701807650001601824650001501840650000901855650001401864650001301878650001801891650001101909650001601920650001801936650002101954650001201975651001301987653002502000653002102025653002702046653002502073700002202098700002402120773010702144852000902251856007502260930003302335945002502368946001302393655001202406IND4416556520221118201035.0090220s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441655652DNAL7 a10.1071/WF070452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK810 0aB200 0aX1001 aHoinka, Klaus P.10aRegional-scale weather patterns and wildland fires in central Portugal  ap. 36-49.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe characteristic evolution of the synoptic- and meso-scale wind, temperature and humidity pattern during wildland fire events in Portugal was determined by lagged covariances for the period 1980 to 2001. The daily burnt area was chosen as the parameter to be correlated with atmospheric fields provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis (ERA40) data. The related time series consisted of wildland fires with a daily burnt area of more than 500 ha in central Portugal. Five days in advance of a fire event, a strong positive anomaly existed in the surface pressure and in the 500-hPa geopotential field, both appearing to the west of the Iberian Peninsula and moving towards Brittany until lag zero. In advance of the fire event, the flow above Portugal came from the north, turning to easterlies at lag time zero and finally coming from the south-east during the post-event phase. Surface wind statistics taken at Castelo Branco supported these results. Smoke plumes from wildland fires detected by satellites indicated a similar flow structure, which was quite different to the averaged summertime flow above Portugal. Cross-covariance regression between the Iberian thermal low and burnt area showed that the peak amount of burnt area occurred up to 3 days after the appearance of a thermal low. This suggested that in the pre-phase of a wildland fire, heated air is transported from the peninsula's centre towards Portugal. 3aatmospheric circulation 3afire weather 3acorrelation 3ashrublands 3awind 3awildfires 3ahumidity 3adata analysis 3asummer 3atemperature 3afire behavior 3aclimatic factors 3aforests 3aPortugal 0alow pressure systems 0across-covariance 0athermal low occurrence 0astatistical analysis1 aCarvalho, Anabela1 aMiranda, Ana Isabel0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2009, v. 18, no. 1 p.36-49dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF070453Available from publisher's Web site  a20090303b00000000c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/03/03  aOther US 7aarticle03442naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245015000146300001400296500001500310520183100325650001702156650002302173650002102196650001902217650002502236650002002261650001002281650002002291650001402311650002402325650002002349650006802369650002102437650004002458650009202498650005402590650003302644650002802677650002202705653001702727653001502744653002802759700001302787773005802800852000902858930003302867945001302900946001102913655001202924IND2033776720221118201055.0931005s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203377672DNAL7 a77633572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogelsang, R.10aPurification, characterization and differential hormonal regulation of a beta-1,3-glucanase and two chitinases from chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)  ap. 60-69.  a2019-12-04  aChickpea (Cicer arietinuim L.) cell-suspension cultures were used to isolate one beta 1.3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.29) and two chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14). The beta 1,3-glucanase (Mr = 36 kDa) and one of the chitinases (Mr = 32 kDa) belong to class I hydrolases with basic isoelectric points (10.5 and 8.5, respectively) and were located intracellularly. The basic chitinase (BC) was also found in the culture medium. The second chitinase (Mr = 28 kDa), with an acidic isoelectric point of 5.7, showed homology to N-terminal sequences of class III chitinases and represented the main protein accumulating in the culture medium. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the basic beta-1,3-glucanase (BG) and the acidic chitinase (AC) were shown to be monospecific. The anti-AC antiserum failed to recognize the BC on immune blots. confirming the structural diversity between class I and class III chitinases. Neither chitinase exhibited lysozyme activity. All hydrolases were endo in action on appropriate substrates. The BC inhibited the hyphal growth of several test fungi, whereas the AC failed to show any inhibitory activity. Expression of BG activity appeared to be regulated by auxin in the cell culture and in the intact plant. In contrast, the expression of neither chitinase was apparently influenced by auxin, indicating a differential hormonal regulation of beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinase activities in chickpea. After elicitation of cell cultures or infection of chickpea plants with Ascochyta rabiei, both system were found to have hydrolase patterns which were qualitatively and quantitatively comparable. Finally, resitant (ILC 3279) and susceptible (ILC 1929) cultivars of chickpea showed no appreciable differences with regard to the time and amount of hydrolase accumulation after inoculation with spores of A. rabiei. 3abiosynthesis 3adefense mechanisms 3aAscochyta rabiei 3abeta-glucanase 3aamino acid sequences 3aCicer arietinum 3a2,4-D 3aenzyme activity 3achitinase 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCells, Cultured 2aChitinasesxbiosynthesisxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme Induction 2aFabaceaexenzymologyxmicrobiology. 2aGlucan Endo-1,3-beta-D-Glucosidasexbiosynthesisxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aIsoenzymesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMitosporic Fungixphysiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlants, Medicinal 0apurification 0aregulation 0amolecular sequence data1 aBarz, W.0 tPlanta.g1993, v. 189, no. 1 p.60-69x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01955naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245015400127300001400281520097800295650001801273650002501291650001001316650003301326650002701359650002301386650002201409650002301431653002301454700001601477773005801493852000901551930003301560945001301593946001101606655001201617IND2033776320221118201159.0931005s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203377632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaerer, S.10aQuantification of indole-3-acetic acid in untransformed and Agrobacterium rhizogenes-transformed pea roots using gas chromatography mass spectrometry  ap. 55-59.  aRoot segments of Pisum sativum L. were transformed by several strains of Agrobacterium rhizogenes. The resulting hairy roots, as well as apical segments from untransformed pea roots, were used to initiate root lines cultured in vitro. Levels of free IAA were quantified in the sub-cultured lines by gas-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, using selected ion monitoring. For most of the cultured untransformed and transformed root lines the IAA content was very small, compared with levels in untransformed intact primary roots. However, an agropine-type hairy root line (incited by strain 15834) contained significantly higher amounts of IAA. The peculiar phenotype of this root line (abundant production of calli) appears to be associated with an increased IAA level, as opposed to most of the hairy root lines, where the extensive secondary root proliferation associated with the hairy-root disease cannot be merely attributed to a markedly enhanced IAA content. 3aPisum sativum 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3aroots 3aplant diseases and disorders 3agenetic transformation 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aindole acetic acid 0ahairy root disease1 aPilet, P.E.0 tPlanta.g1993, v. 189, no. 1 p.55-59x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01660naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245006200132300001600194500002400210520089200234650004101126650001301167650001201180650000901192650001501201650001001216700002301226773012401249852000901373655001201382IND4464471120221118201222.0121115s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446447112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurnblom, Eric C.10aGrowth of Residual Branches on Pruned Coastal Douglas-Fir  ap. 185-188.  aIncludes references  aAnecdotal evidence gathered from pruning crew observations indicates that there may be enhanced branch growth at the new crown base in young pruned coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) trees compared to unpruned trees. This has the potential to reduce the quality and value of the stem above the pruned portion of the bole. An analysis of the size of branches in the remaining crown on pruned trees and matched unpruned trees of the same size at the time of pruning indicates that residual branches do not increase in diameter or length in response to light and moderate pruning. However, with a severe pruning there was a modest increase in branch length. Residual branch size in response to pruning 4 yr after treatment appears to offer no real risk in degrading quality of the unpruned portion of the stem as a cost for increasing the quality of the pruned stem. 3aPseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii 3abranches 3apruning 3arisk 3atree trunk 3atrees1 aCollier, Randol L.0 tWestern journal of applied forestry.g2003 July, v. 18, no. 3 p.185-188dSociety of American Forestersx0885-60957nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010600127300001400233520264000247650001802887650001902905650001202924650001802936650001102954650001102965650001002976650001402986650001803000650001603018650001403034650001603048650001603064650001303080650001403093700001503107773005803122852000903180930003303189945001303222946001103235655001203246IND2033773720221118201232.0931005s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203377372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeller, J.L.10aPhotoperiodism and photocontrol of stem elongation in two photomorphogenic mutants of Pisum sativum L  ap. 15-23.  aThe photomorphogenic mutation lv in the garden pea (Pisum sativum L.), which appears to reduce the response to light-stable phytochrome, has been isolated on a tall, late photoperiodic genetic background and its effects further characterised. Plants possessing lv have a reduced flowering response to photoperiod relative to wild-type plants, indicating that light-stable phytochrome may have a flower-inhibitory role in the flowering response of long-day plants to photoperiod. In general, lv plants are longer and have reduced leaf development relative to Lv plants. These differences are maximised under continuous light from fluorescent lamps (containing negligible far-red (FR) light), and decrease with addition of FR to the incident light. Enrichment of white light from fluorescent lamps with FR promotes stem elongation in the wild type but causes a reduction in elongation in the lv mutant. This "negative" shade-avoidance response appears to be the consequence of a strong inhibitory effect of light rich in FR, revealed in Iv plants in the absence of a normal response to red (R) light. These results indicate that the wild-type response to the R:FR ratio may be comprised of two distinct photoresponses, one in which FR supplementation promotes elongation by reducing the inhibitory effect of R, and the other in which light rich in FR actively inhibits elongation. This hypothesis is discussed in relation to functional differentiation of phytochrome types in the light-grown plant. Gene lw has been reported previously to reduce internode length and the response to gibberellin A1, and to delay flowering. The present study shows that the lw Mutation confers an increased response to photoperiod. In all these responses the lw phenotype is superficially "opposite" to the lv phenotype. The possibility that the mutation might primarily affect light perception was therefore considered. The degree of dwarfing of lw plants was found to depend upon light quality and quantity. Dwarfing is more extreme in plants grown under continuous R light than in those grown in continuous FR or blue light or in darkness. Studies of the fluence-rate response show that the lw mutation imparts a lower fluence requirement for inhibition of elongation by white light from fluorescent lamps. Dark-grown lw plants are more strongly inhibited by a R pulse than are wild-type plants but, as in the wild type, this inhibition remains reversible by FR. Light-grown lw plants show an exaggerated elongation response to end-of-day FR light. Taken together, these findings indicate that the lw mutant may be hypersensitive to phytochrome action. 3aPisum sativum 3aphotoperiodism 3amutants 3amorphogenesis 3ashoots 3alength 3astems 3ared light 3afar-red light 3aphytochrome 3aflowering 3aphotoperiod 3awhite light 3adwarfing 3aphenotype1 aReid, J.B.0 tPlanta.g1993, v. 189, no. 1 p.15-23x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03629naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245008700142300001600229500001500245520142000260650001301680650002201693650001201715650001601727650002201743650002401765650001401789650001301803650001801816650002501834650002001859650002901879650001201908650001001920650001101930650001201941650002401953650001801977650002301995650002302018650001602041650003002057650002302087650005402110650004602164650003102210650002802241650001402269650004402283650003002327650002402357650002502381650002702406650003602433653002702469653001602496653002502512653002802537653001902565700001702584700001602601700001802617700001402635700001602649700001702665700001702682773007002699852000902769930003302778945001302811946001102824655001202835IND2058135920221118201159.0970701e199512  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205813592DNAL7 a85809612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTacke, E.10aTransposon tagging of the maize Glossy2 locus with the transposable element En/Spm  ap. 907-917.  a2019-12-05  aThe Glossy2 (Gl2) locus of maize is required for the formation of the epicuticular wax layer of young plants. gl2 mutant seedlings can be visually identified because of their glossy leaf surface which is different from the dull surface of wild-type seedlings. The Gl2 locus was isolated by transposon tagging. Seven unstable mutations, gl2-m2 to gl2-m8, were induced in a parental strain carrying an active transposable Activator (Ac) element in the unstable wx-m7 allele. Genetic tests on the gl2-m2 allele indicated that it was not caused by the Ac element but by the insertion of the transposable element Enhancer/Suppressor-Mutator (En/Spm). A Sal1 restriction fragment segregating with the mutant phenotype was identified, by Southern analysis, using sequences from the En/Spm element as a probe. Part of the fragment was cloned and was shown to carry part of the unstable gl2-m2 allele. These gl2 sequences were used to identify a genomic fragment carrying the wild-type allele and to isolate its corresponding cDNA sequence. The predicted Glossy2 protein consists of 426 amino acids. No similar amino acid sequence was found in protein data banks and the biochemical function of the Gl2 gene product is still unknown. The wild-type Gl2 transcript is found predominantly in juvenile leaves. The transcript level in the leaves of seedlings homozygous for a stable recessive gl2-ref allele is hardly detectable. 3aZea mays 3aplant development 3aalleles 3atransposons 3acomplementary DNA 3arestriction mapping 3aphenotype 3acrossing 3aplant cuticle 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3amutants 3awaxes 3aleaves 2aAlleles 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDNA, Plantxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aDeoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific 2aEnhancer Elements, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSuppression, Genetic 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aZea maysxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0abiochemical techniques 0asegregation 0anucleotide sequences 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x887791 aKorfhage, C.1 aD., Michel.1 aMaddalomi, M.1 aMotto, M.1 aLanzini, S.1 aSalamini, F.1 aDoring, H.P.0 tplant journal.g1995 Dec., v. 8, no. 6 p.907-917x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01409naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245006400134300001600198500002400214520059400238650002300832650002000855650002000875650002600895650001300921650002100934650002100955650001000976773012400986852000901110655001201119IND4464470820221118201217.0121115s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446447082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumroese, R.

An examination of the literature provides no historical or mathematical reason why additivity should be required in the original index. Reineke's stand density index, and the additive or area-based stand density index, should be considered as separate indices with different properties. The sensitivity of the area-based index to stand diameter distribution is illustrated with the Weibull distribution. Its sensitivity provides testable hypotheses that could be used in empirical studies to determine the better index. 3aprobability distribution 3astand density 3atree and stand measurements1 aLarson, Bruce C.0 tWestern journal of applied forestry.g2003 July, v. 18, no. 3 p.179-184dSociety of American Forestersx0885-60957nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03893naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001500163245010600178300001600284500002400300520238900324650002402713650002102737650001402758650002102772650001402793650001102807650002802818650002502846650002102871650002302892650001702915650002002932650001102952650001402963650001802977651001102995653003703006700001503043700001603058700001803074700002103092773010303113852000903216856006903225930003303294945002503327946001103352655001203363IND4386719120221118201203.0070111e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438671912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2006.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aF6001 aFlenet, F.14aThe critical N dilution curve for linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) is different from other C3 species  ap. 367-373.  aIncludes references  aThe objective was to determine the critical N dilution curve of linseed, which is the minimal total N concentration in shoots necessary to produce the maximal shoot dry matter, and to explain possible differences with other C3 species. One main experiment was carried out in 1998/1999 on winter linseed with four levels of fertilizer N. Two plant densities were also studied, the recommended one (600 seeds m-2) and the minimum for canopy closure (150 seeds m-2), in order to investigate the stability with plant density of the critical N dilution curve. Shoot dry weights (W(S)) and shoot N contents expressed in percentage (N(S)) were measured for the determination of the critical dilution curve, along with organ N percentages and relative weights. The results of four other experiments were used to validate the critical N dilution curve. Three of these four trials were conducted on winter linseed (one in 1996/1997 and two in 1997/1998) with five levels of fertilizer N, and one on spring linseed in 1999 with six levels of fertilizer N. The critical N dilution curve of linseed was different from those of other C3 species. The curve was steeper, indicating a greater decrease in the critical shoot N concentration (N(SC)) as the critical shoot dry weight (W(SC)) increased. This linseed curve determined with the data of the main experiment was relevant when compared to the data of the four other experiments. Organ weight ratios and N concentration of organs were investigated in a fertilizer N treatment resulting in N(S) close to the critical N values, N(SC). In this treatment, the decrease in N(S) was the result of both a decrease in the N percentage of all organs and a decrease in the leaf weight ratio. The difference between linseed and other C3 species was mainly due to an acceleration of the dilution of N when leaf emission stopped and the flower bud emission began. At this stage of development, the leaf weight ratio of linseed was less than that of wheat, resulting in lower N(S). For a given W(S), no significant differences in N(S), organ N percentages nor organ weight ratios were observed between the two plant densities. This indicates that the difference between linseed and other C3 species could not result from very high plant densities in linseed. Hence, it is concluded that the linseed N accumulation in shoot is different from other C3 species. 3aLinum usitatissimum 3alinseed products 3aoil crops 3anitrogen content 3aC3 plants 3ashoots 3adry matter accumulation 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer rates 3aseasonal variation 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3aleaves 3aflowering 3aplant density 3aFrance 0acritical nitrogen dilution curve1 aGuerif, M.1 aBoiffin, J.1 aDorvillez, D.1 aChampolivier, L.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2006 May, v. 24, no. 4 p.367-373dGauthier-Villarsx1161-03017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2006.01.0023electronic resource  a20070416b20070502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/03/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03201naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001700176245011800193300001600311500002400327520189900351650002002250650001102270650001502281650001102296650001102307650001202318650001302330650001502343650002002358651001102378700002102389700002402410700002202434700002302456773009702479852000902576856008902585930003302674945002502707946001102732655001202743IND4437320020221118200955.0100522e20100610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443732002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aH000 0aM3001 aTlili, Ahmed10aPOâ Â³â» dependence of the tolerance of autotrophic and heterotrophic biofilm communities to copper and diuron  ap. 165-177.  aIncludes references  aPollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) concept is based on the assumption that the toxicant exerts selection pressure on the biological communities when exposure reaches a critical level for a sufficient period of time and therefore sensitive species are eliminated. However, induced tolerance of microbial biofilm communities cannot be attributed solely to the presence of toxicants in rivers but also to various environmental factors, such as amount of nutrients. An experimental study was undertaken to highlight the potential impact of a phosphorus gradient on the sensitivity of periphytic microbial community to Cu and diuron. Biofilms were exposed to real-world levels of chronic environmental contamination of toxicants with a phosphorus gradient. Biofilm sensitivity to Cu and diuron was assessed by performing short-term inhibition tests based on photosynthetic efficiency to target photoautotrophs, extracellular enzyme activity (Î²-glucosidase and leucine-aminopeptidase) and substrate-induced respiration activity to target heterotrophs. The impact of P-gradient associated to pollution was evaluated by measuring pesticide concentrations in biofilms, biomass parameters (chla, AFDW), bacterial cell density, photosynthetic efficiency and community structure (using 18S and 16S rDNA gene analysis to target eukaryotes and DGGE and HPLC pigment analysis to target bacteria and photoautotrophs). The obtained results show that depending on the studied toxicant and the used structural or functional parameter, the effect of the phosphorus gradient was variable. This highlights the importance of using a range of parameters that target all the biological communities in the biofilm. The PICT method can be regarded as a good tool for assessing anthropogenic environmental contamination, but it is necessary to dissociate the real impact of toxicants from environmental factors. 3awater pollution 3arivers 3aphosphorus 3acopper 3adiuron 3abiofilm 3abacteria 3aperiphyton 3ametal tolerance 3aFrance1 aBÃ©rard, Annette1 aRoulier, Jean-Louis1 aVolat, Bernadette1 aMontuelle, Bernard0 tAquatic toxicology.g2010 June 10, v. 98, no. 2 p.165-177dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.02.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100602b20100703c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/06/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03660naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245013200147300001600279500001500295520160000310650001501910650002301925650002401948650001701972650002001989650002002009650002802029650001402057650002502071650001202096650001602108650000902124650001902133650002402152650001802176650002202194650004702216650001202263650002302275650001802298650001902316650000902335650005902344650001402403650001102417650001802428650002002446650001402466650002002480650002202500650001302522650004902535650000902584653002002593653002202613653000802635653001502643700001602658700001802674700001802692700001602710700001502726700001102741773008202752852000902834930003302843945001302876946001302889655001202902IND2164422720221118201006.0981002e199801  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216442272DNAL7 a94930962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, F.A.P.10aMilk yield and composition of lactating cows fed steam-flaked sorghum and graded concentrations of ruminally degradable protein  ap. 215-220.  a2019-12-05  aTo determine the effect of various amounts of ruminally undegradable protein in the diets of lactating cows fed steam-flaked sorghum, 24 Holstein cows (90 +/- 50 d in milk) were assigned to three treatments: 0.8% urea, 6% soybean meal, or 5% fish meal. Respective percentages of ruminally undegradable protein in the diets (as a percentage of crude protein) were 30, 35, and 39%. All diets contained 37% alfalfa hay; 3 to 5% cottonseed hulls; 10 to 13% whole cottonseed; 39% steam-flaked sorghum (360 g/L); 5% of a molasses, mineral, and vitamin supplement; and the different protein supplements. Intake of dry matter was higher for cows fed urea than for cows fed soybean meal or fish meal diets. In cows that yielded more than 40 kg/d of milk (4 cows per treatment), the soybean meal and fish meal diets resulted in higher yields of milk and 3.5% fat-corrected milk and a greater efficiency of conversion of feed to milk than did the urea diet. Cows that yielded less than 40 kg/d of milk (4 cows per treatment) at the beginning of treatment tended to yield more milk when fed urea than when fed the protein supplements. Nutrient digestibilities were not greatly affected by source of N, suggesting a beneficial effect of urea supplementation on nutrient digestibilities because replacement of protein supplements with cottonseed products caused the neutral detergent fiber content of the urea diet to be about 7% higher than that of the other diets. These data show that response to ruminally undegradable protein in diets of lactating cows fed steam-flaked sorghum was related to milk yield. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3aprotein supplements 3asoybean meal 3aprotein sources 3afeed conversion 3amilk protein percentage 3afish meal 3adietary carbohydrate 3aalfalfa 3aalfalfa hay 3aurea 3amilk fat yield 3amilk fat percentage 3adigestibility 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aEdible Grain. 2aCottonseed Oil 2aDiet 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDigestion 2aFemale 2aFish Products 2aHot Temperature 2aLactation 2aMilkxchemistry 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSoybeans 2aStarchxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aUrea 0adietary protein 0aprotected protein 0ahay 0amilk yield1 aHuber, J.T.1 aTheurer, C.B.1 aSwingle, R.S.1 aSimas, J.M.1 aChen, K.H.1 aYu, P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Jan., v. 81, no. 1 p.215-220x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02053naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005900125300001600184520114500200650001501345650001801360650001201378650001201390650001901402650002001421650001601441650001301457650001401470653002701484653001601511700001801527773007801545852000901623930003301632945001301665946001301678655001201691IND2060985220221118201017.0971220e199705  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206098522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElzing, A.10aAmmonia emission in a scale model of a dairy-cow house  ap. 713-720.  aA scale model of a dairy-cow house was developed for studying factors involved with ammonia emission. The ammonia emission from two different floor fouling methods was measured In the first case, a urine/feces mixture applied daily to the floor surface. In the second case, a thin flayer of feces was applied daily and urine was sprinkled over it. In both cases, the ammonia emission increased after fouling each day. After seven days the situation stabilized. An ammonia emission peak was always observed within two hours after application of the urine/feces mixture or the urine, while afterwards the ammonia emission rate gradually declined in about 24 h to the level prevailing before the fouling. The second method, which is more comparable to the fouling in a practical cow house, revealed a linear relationship between the height of the ammonia emission peak and the urea concentration of the urine. Measurements at different temperatures and with different air velocities over the floor surface showed that the height of the ammonia emission peak depends on temperature to the power of 0.89 and on the velocity to the power of 0.26. 3adairy cows 3aair pollution 3aexcreta 3aammonia 3avolatilization 3aphysical models 3atemperature 3avelocity 3aemissions 0aartificial ventilation 0acow housing1 aMonteny, G.J.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1997 , v. 40, no. 3 p.713-720x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US 7aarticle03403naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245016500147300001800312500001500330520174300345650000902088650002602097650001402123650003002137650001002167650001902177650002802196650001002224650001202234650003202246650002802278650002902306650001702335650002402352650002102376650003202397650003002429650003202459650001002491650001902501650006502520653001802585653001602603653001502619700001702634700001502651700001602666773008702682852000902769930003302778945001302811946001302824655001202837IND2326314620221118201438.0020402e200109  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232631462DNAL7 a115635122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyapalle, S.10aComparison of culture, multiplex, and 5' nuclease polymerase chain reaction assays for the rapid detection of Yersinia enterocolitica in swine and pork products  ap. 1352-1361.  a2019-12-05  aBacteriological culture was compared with multiplex and fluorogenic (TaqMan) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the detection of attachment invasion locus (ail)-bearing Yersinia enterocolitica in market weight swine, chitterlings, and ground pork. The TaqMan assay detected 1 pg of purified Y. enterocolitica DNA, whereas conventional gel-based PCR detected 1 ng of the same. The presence of ail-bearing Y. enterocolitica was tested in pork and feces artificially inoculated with Y. enterocolitica strain NADC 5561. The sensitivity limits of culture, multiplex, and TaqMan PCR assays were 4 x 10(3), 4 x 10(2), and 0.4 CFU/g, respectively, for the artificially inoculated pork. The sensitivity limits were 4 x 10(2), 4 x 10(2), and 0.4 CFU/g, respectively, for feces after a 48-h enrichment in a Yersinia selective broth. By the culture method, Y. enterocolitica was not detected in any of the swine specimens (n = 2,403) examined. By contrast, it was detected in 48 (2%) of the swine samples screened using the multiplex PCR and in 656 (27.2%) of these samples using the TaqMan assay. Using the culture method, Y. enterocolitica was detected in 8% of chitterling samples (n = 350) and in none of the ground pork samples (n = 350). It was identified in 27% of the chitterling samples using multiplex PCR and in 79% of these samples using the TaqMan assay. Ten percent of the ground pork samples contained Y. enterocolitica, as determined by the multiplex PCR, and 38% based on the TaqMan assay. The results suggest that pork products harbor more ail-bearing Y. enterocolitica than selected organs of freshly slaughtered hogs and that the TaqMan assay is more sensitive than either the multiplex PCR or traditional culture methods. 3apork 3aquantitative analysis 3adetection 3apolymerase chain reaction 3afeces 3acultured cells 3aYersinia enterocolitica 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aEnterotoxins 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFluorescent Dyes 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSwine 2aTaq Polymerase 2aYersinia enterocoliticaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 0ameat products 0amethodology 0aevaluation1 aWesley, I.V.1 aHurd, H.S.1 aReddy, P.G.0 tJournal of food protection.g2001 Sept., v. 64, no. 9 p.1352-1361x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02958naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245006400143300001600207520157500223650001501798650001501813650002501828650002101853650002001874650001301894650001701907650002401924650002701948650002101975650001201996650001302008650003402021650001102055650002202066650002402088650002402112650001102136650001402147651001502161651001502176653002002191653002702211700001402238700002602252773008202278852000902360930003302369945001302402946001302415655001202428IND2164423620221118201748.0981002e199801  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216442362DNAL7 a94931022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVargas, B.10aAnalysis of test day yield data of Costa Rican dairy cattle  ap. 255-263.  aEstimates of variance components for test day records in an animal model that considered multiple traits over multiple lactations were calculated using REML methodology. Test day records were classified into 11 periods within first and later lactations. Missing ancestors in the relationship matrix were classified in genetic groups. Data were collected from Costa Rican dairy farms. Estimates of components for total and additive genetic variance were clearly heterogeneous during the lactation. Heritabilities for traits in later parities were slightly higher than those for traits in first parity. Heritabilities were highest for records of midlactation. Phenotypic and genetic correlations for adjacent test days were close to 1. Phenotypic correlations were lower than genetic correlations. Heterogeneity of variances during the lactation suggests the adequacy of the multiple-trait test day model to describe milk yield during the lactation. When missing ancestors were allocated to a single base population instead of genetic groups, the estimates of residual variance were lower, and the estimates of genetic variance and genetic correlations were higher. When standardized records were used instead of actual test day records, the estimates of residual and total variance were lower, and the estimates of genetic variance were higher. Consequently, estimates of heritability and genetic correlations were also higher. Use of standardized data obtained by interpolation procedures is not advised for estimation of genetic variance components in a test day model. 3adairy cows 3amilk yield 3astatistical analysis 3alactation number 3alactation stage 3apedigree 3aheritability 3agenetic correlation 3aphenotypic correlation 3agenetic variance 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aLactationxgenetics 2aModels, Statistical 2aParity 2aPhenotype 3aCosta Rica 0aCosta Rica 0agenetic effects 0amilk recording results1 aPerez, E.1 aArendonk, J.A.M. van.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Jan., v. 81, no. 1 p.255-263x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03916naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176100001300185245012200198300001600320500002400336500001500360520220300375650002902578650001802607650002202625650001902647650001202666650002402678650002702702650002002729650002802749650002002777650001702797650001402814650002702828650002602855650001202881650002402893650002202917651001002939653002902949700001402978700001502992700001603007700001403023700001403037773009503051852000903146856009003155930003303245945002503278946001103303655001203314IND4386719420221118202008.0070111e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438671942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aJ100 0aJ500 0aJ2001 aNiwa, R.10aIncrease in soil pH due to Ca-rich organic matter application causes suppression of the clubroot disease of crucifers  ap. 778-785.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aClubroot disease of cruciferous plants caused by the soil-borne pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae is difficult to control because the pathogen survives for a long time in soil as resting spores. Disease-suppressive and conducive soils were found during the long-term experiment on the impact of organic matter application to arable fields and have been studied to clarify the biotic and abiotic factors involved in the disease suppression. The fact that a large amount of organic matter, 400 t ha-1 yr-1 farmyard manure (FYM) or 100 t ha-1 yr-1 food factory sludge compost (FSC), had been incorporated for more than 15 yr in the suppressive soils and these soils showed higher pH and Ca concentration than the disease conducive soil led us to hypothesize that an increase in soil pH due to the long-term incorporation of Ca-rich organic matter might be the primary cause of the disease suppression. We have designed a highly reproducible bioassay system to examine this hypothesis. The suppressive and conducive soils were mixed with the resting spores of P. brassicae at a rate of 10â¶ spore g-1 soil, and Brassica campestris was grown in a growth chamber for 8 d. The number of root hair infections was assessed on a microscope. It was found that the incorporation of FYM and FSC at 2.5% (w/w) to the conducive soil suppressed the infection and that the finer particles (<or= 5 mm) of FSC inhibited the infection and increased soil pH more effectively. Neutralization of the conducive soil by Ca(OH)2, CaCO3 and KOH suppressed the infection, but the effectiveness of KOH was less than those of Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3. Acidification of the suppressive soils by H2SO4, promoted the infection. The involvement of soil biota in the disease suppression was investigated using the sterilized (Î³-ray irradiation) suppressive soils with respect to soil pH. The Î³-ray irradiation promoted the infection at pH 5.5, but no infection was observed at pH 7.4 irrespective of the sterilization status. All these observations suggest that soil pH is a major factor in disease suppression by organic matter application and that Ca and soil biota play certain roles in the suppression under the influence of soil pH. 3aPlasmodiophora brassicae 3aroot diseases 3asuppressive soils 3aanimal manures 3acalcium 3asoil organic matter 3afood processing wastes 3adisease control 3afood residuals composts 3asoil amendments 3aarable soils 3abioassays 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afield experimentation 3asoil pH 3asoil-borne diseases 3adisease incidence 3aJapan 0asoil chemical properties1 aKumei, T.1 aNomura, Y.1 aYoshida, S.1 aOsaki, M.1 aEzawa, T.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2007 Mar., v. 39, no. 3 p.778-785dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.09.0273Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070511b20070602c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/05/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01898naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245005500157300001600212520090800228650002901136650000801165650001201173650002601185650001401211650001401225650001801239650001201257650002301269700002301292700001801315700001501333773014901348856004201497852000901539655001201548IND60588616220221118201950.0180126e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058861622DNAL7 a10.13031/2013.265102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGariepy, Y.10aCost-Benefit Analysis of Long-Term Cabbage Storage  ap. 255-258.  aThe costs of storing locally grown cabbage for off-season marketing were investigated. Building and equipment costs as well as annual costs associated with the operation of six different hypothetical storage layouts, all with same holding capacity of 600 t, were reviewed. Long term storage of cabbage for marketing during the non-producing seasons on the Montreal market was found to be economically sound since the internal rates of return (IRR) computed were positive and ranged from 17% to 27%. The best time to market the cabbage greatly depended on the storage conditions. The best marketing time for cabbage stored in a room ventilated with outside air (VA), in a room equipped with mechanical refrigeration (RA) and in a room operated under controlled atmosphere (CA) were, respectively, January, March and May. It was also shown that the upgrading of an RA storage room to CA increased the IRR. 3aagricultural engineering 3aair 3acabbage 3acost benefit analysis 3aequipment 3amarketing 3arefrigeration 3astorage 3astorage conditions1 aRaghavan, G.

The entire proteins or the Myb domains encoded by the genes were expressed as fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. The DNA-binding domain of the murine c-Myb was also expressed in the same way for use in comparative studies. The fusion proteins were examined for their DNA-binding activity using the animal c-Myb DNA-binding site (MBS) and the binding site of the maize P gene product (PBS). The Myb domain of Atmyb6 bound to PBS more efficiently than to MBS. Complete Atmyb6 and Atmyb7 proteins preferentially bound to PBS but not MBS. This suggests that the in vitro binding consensus sequences for both Atmyb6 and Atmyb7 are similar to PBS. The binding of the Myb domain of Atmyb6 to both PBS and MBS raises the possibility that the protein recognizes multiple sequences in vivo. The third alpha-helix and three adjacent amino acids in the third repeat (R3) of c-Myb were replaced with the analogous sequence of Atmyb6 to create a chimeric Myb protein. This chimeric protein bound to PBS with a low affinity but failed to bind to MBS. Thus the binding pattern of the chimeric Myb protein is similar to that of the Atmyb6. This result suggests that the last 20 amino acids in the R3 repeat of Atmyb6 play a major role in DNA-binding. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3agene transfer 3acomplementary DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3abinding sites 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aDNA-binding domains 3amolecular conformation 3arepetitive sequences 3aEscherichia coli 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aEscherichia coli 2aGenes, Plant 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aOncogenes 2aProto-Oncogene Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aZea maysxgenetics 0agenbank/u26937 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/u269361 aParish, R.W.0 tplant journal.g1995 Dec., v. 8, no. 6 p.963-972x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02352naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008900127300001600216520146100232650001301693650001301706650002301719650003001742650001601772650002101788651000901809700001701818700001601835700001701851773007801868852000901946930003301955945001301988946001302001655001202014IND2060983920221118201540.0971220e199705  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206098392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalita, P.K.10aGroundwater residues of atrazine and alachlor under water-table management practices  ap. 605-614.  aThis study was conducted to investigate the effects of various water-table management (WTM) practices the concentrations of two surface-applied herbicides, atrazine and alachlor, in a shallow groundwater system. Groundwater samples were collected by installing piezometers and suction tubes at Iowa State University's research centers near Ames and Ankeny during three corn-growing seasons, 1989-1991. At the Ames site, experiments we conducted by maintaining constant water-table depths (WTD) of 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 m in nine field-type lysimeters, and groundwater samples were collected from various depths during the corn-growing seasons. At the Ankeny site, a dual-pipe subirrigation system was installed on a 0.85 ha field, and variable water-table depths were maintained. Analysis water samples collected in 1989, 1990, and 1991 clearly indicates that atrazine and alachlor concentrations groundwater could be substantially reduced by maintaining shallow WTD during the growing season. It was also observed that atrazine concentrations were higher than those of alachlor. Alachlor was not detected in many samples; however, atrazine was detected in all samples, with high concentrations at the Ames site at the 0.9 m WTD, and at Ankeny site at deeper WTD. Pesticide concentrations in groundwater decreased with soil depth and time. Results of this study suggest a positive influence of WTM practices in reducing pesticide concentrations in groundwater. 3aalachlor 3aatrazine 3aherbicide residues 3agroundwater contamination 3awater table 3awater management 3aIowa1 aKanwar, R.S.1 aBaker, J.L.1 aMelvin, S.W.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1997 , v. 40, no. 3 p.605-614x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US 7aarticle02880naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169100001900178245006400197300001500261500002400276500001500300520115000315650002301465650002001488650001001508650001601518650002201534650002601556650001601582650001601598650001501614650002301629650002001652650005201672650002101724650002801745650001801773650001601791650001901807650003101826650001901857653002801876653001401904700002101918700001901939700002101958700001801979773011201997852000902109856009102118930003302209945002502242946001102267655001202278IND4437319120221118201559.0100522e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443731912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2010.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF841 0aF200 0aF6001 aWoronuk, Grant10aTranscriptomic analysis of chilling stress in Phaseolus spp  ap. 95-104.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe wild bean species Phaseolus angustissimus has shown a greater ability to survive chilling temperatures than the cultivated bean Phaseolus vulgaris. Arrays of cDNA clones from cold acclimated crowns of Medicago sativa were used to measure low temperature-induced changes in the expression profiles of both bean species and compare them to each other. Macroarray hybridization results indicate that P. vulgaris failed to sustain homeostatic expression levels of more genes than did P. angustissimus after 3 days of chilling temperature exposure. Expression patterns of selected genes were further characterized with RT-PCR using plants exposed to various durations of chilling. The most notable difference between the two species in these gene expression experiments was that P. angustissimus was able to recover the expression of a cytochrome P450 species under chilling temperature exposure whereas P. vulgaris failed to sustain levels of cytochrome P450 gene expression levels. Results of these experiments suggest that a key to chilling tolerance in Phaseolus is maintenance of homeostatic gene expression levels under chilling conditions. 3atemporal variation 3atranscriptomics 3abeans 3awild plants 3acomplementary DNA 3amicroarray technology 3afield crops 3acold stress 3aroot crown 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3agene expression 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3acytochrome P-450 3aplant genetic resources 3atranscriptome 3ahomeostasis 3awild relatives 3agene expression regulation 3acold tolerance 0aPhaseolus angustissimus 0aPhaseolus1 aVijayan, Permual1 aLaberge, Serge1 aVandenberg, Bert1 aBett, Kirstin0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2010 Nov., v. 69, no. 2 p.95-104dElsevier Sciencex0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2010.03.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02197naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245004900129300001600178500001500194520130500209650001901514650002401533650001301557650001401570650001601584650001701600650001301617650001301630650001301643653002401656653000901680773007801689852000901767930003301776945001301809946001301822655001201835IND2060983320221118201126.0971220e199705  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206098332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSidahmed, M.M.12aA transport model for near nozzle fan sprays  ap. 547-554.  a2019-12-05  aPrevious spray transport models employed mathematical equations to represent the velocity (Va) of the air entrained in a spray, while employing the drag coefficients (Cd) defined for isolated solid spheres to calculate drop velocity. The resulting models were either inadequate or required unrealistic air velocity fields. This article presents an alternative approach, in which Va is replaced with its effect on Cd. This was achieved by maintaining Va = 0 and modeling the effective-drag coefficient (Cde). The results indicated that, in general, droplets move under the influence of constant, but not necessarily equal, CdeS. An empirical equation for Cd, was developed, and examined with experimental data from three fan nozzles (XR8002, 650067, and 8004) operated at three levels of pressure (103, 200, and 276 kPa). While there was reasonably good agreement with the measured data, there were discrepancies (at sizes <50 micrometer in the region >10-20 cm from nozzle), attributed to the assumption of immediate break-up of a liquid-jet. The proposed mode was compared to the model of Goering et al. (1972) The two models were almost equivalent at larger sizes, but the effective-drag model was superior for smaller droplets (<200 micrometer) at greater distances (>20 cm) from a nozzle orifice. 3aturbulent flow 3amathematical models 3adroplets 3aequations 3afan nozzles 3aaerodynamics 3avelocity 3aair flow 3aspraying 0atransport processes 0adrag0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1997 , v. 40, no. 3 p.547-554x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US 7aarticle04345naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195072000900204072000900213100002200222245013700244300001600381500002400397520196500421650002002386650001402406650003502420650002002455650002602475650002402501650002402525650002002549650001202569650002402581650005502605650004502660650004802705650003402753650003202787650001102819650004502830650003802875650004402913650003402957650003702991650000903028650002703037650003803064650002703102650003703129650001703166650003803183650004103221700002003262700001903282700002003301700002603321773009703347852000903444856008903453930003303542945002503575946001103600655001203611IND4437319820221118201147.0100522e20100610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443731982DNAL7 a202114982pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL810 0aL210 0aL200 0aM001 0aL4001 aHogan, Natacha S.10aModulation of steroidogenesis and estrogen signalling in the estuarine killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) exposed to ethinylestradiol  ap. 148-156.  aIncludes references  aPrevious studies have shown that mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus; a lunar, asynchronous-spawning killifish of the western Atlantic) exposed to 17Î±-ethynylestradiol (EE2) exhibit decreased plasma reproductive steroid levels, decreased gonadal steroid production, increased plasma vitellogenin, decreased fecundity and impaired fertilization. The objective of this study was to determine the potential mechanisms by which EE2 depresses gonadal steroidogenesis and influences estrogen signalling in the mummichog. Adult recrudesced fish were exposed to the potent synthetic estrogen, ethinylestradiol (EE2; 0-270ng/L) for 14 days. Following exposure, gonadal tissue was removed and incubated for 24h with stimulators of steroidogenesis, including forskolin; 25-OH cholesterol; or pregnenolone. Testosterone production was decreased in basal, forskolin-stimulated and pregnenolone-stimulated EE2-exposed males, indicating effects on the steroidogenic pathway both at and downstream of cholesterol mobilization to P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc) and/or P450scc conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. Hepatic transcript levels of estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±) and vitellogenin were increased in EE2-treated males compared to control recrudescing males and females confirming an estrogenic response. Hepatic heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a chaperoning molecule involved in estrogen signalling, was not affected by EE2 exposure at either the transcript or protein level. However, higher levels of Hsp90 observed in the membrane fractions of female fish raise interesting questions regarding the influence of gender on Hsp90's role in estrogen signalling. These results demonstrate that EE2 can alter steroid production at specific sites within the steroidogenic pathway and can stimulate hepatic estrogen signalling, providing important information regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the endocrine response of the mummichog to exogenous estrogen. 3awater pollution 3aestradiol 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3asteroidogenesis 3aFundulus heteroclitus 3asignal transduction 3aheat shock proteins 3agene expression 2aAnimals 2aColforsinxtoxicity 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxbloodxmetabolism. 2aEndocrine Disruptorsxbloodxmetabolism. 2aEstrogen Receptor alphaxbloodxmetabolism. 2aEstrogensxbloodxmetabolism. 2aEthinyl Estradiolxtoxicity 2aFemale 2aFertilizationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFundulidaexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxbloodxmetabolism. 2aHydroxycholesterolsxtoxicity 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aPregnenolonextoxicity 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 2aSteroidsxbiosynthesis 2aTestosteronexbloodxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 2aVitellogeninsxbloodxmetabolism. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aCurrie, Suzanne1 aLeBlanc, Sacha1 aHewitt, L.

Stiffness is dramatically lower for negatively compared to positively strained myosins, consistent with buckling of myosin's subfragment 2 rod domain. Low stiffness minimizes drag of negatively strained myosins during contraction at loaded conditions. Myosin's elastic portion is stretched during active force generation, reducing apparent step size with increasing load, even though the working stroke is approximately constant at about 8 nanometers. Taking account of the nonlinear nature of myosin elasticity is essential to relate myosin's internal structural changes to physiological force generation and filament sliding. 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3amechanics 3amicrofilaments 3amuscle contraction 3amyosin1 aHiguchi, Hideo0 tScience.g2010 Aug. 6, v. 329, no. 5992 p.686-689dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11914843Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02758naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245013100144300001800275520108200293650002201375650002701397650002501424650001001449650001901459650002901478650001401507650001601521650002701537650001201564650002601576650003301602650001901635650003001654650006201684650001901746650002201765650003101787650002301818650002401841650006401865650002601929653002301955700001801978700001701996700001902013700001702032773008702049852000902136930003302145945001302178946001302191655001202204IND2327829320221118201810.0020702e200112  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232782932DNAL7 a117706212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabo, M.L.10aJoint effect of nisin, CO2, and EDTA on the survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium in a food model system  ap. 1943-1948.  aA study on the joint effect of either nisin or Nisaplin, headspace CO2 levels, and EDTA on the survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium was carried out in a water-soluble fish muscle extract at 3 degrees C using a second-order rotatable factorial design. E. faecium was completely deactivated by all processing after 2 days of storage. In contrast, P. aeruginosa was much less susceptible to treatments, and cell death was satisfactorily described by two models. Nisin increased cell death, whereas Nisaplin (commercial form of nisin) was not suitable, as it caused undesirable interference, presumably due to its co-compounds. Interactions between Nisaplin or nisin and either EDTA or CO2 were found to be nonstatistically significant. Factors that could account for this unexpected lack of synergism are discussed. However, a statistically significant positive interaction was found between CO2 and EDTA. This finding could allow CO2 levels to be decreased and hence to reduce the main disadvantages of CO2 application, namely, exudation and acidification. 3afood preservation 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aEnterococcus faecium 3anisin 3acarbon dioxide 3aantibacterial properties 3amortality 3afood safety 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agents 2aCarbon Dioxidexpharmacology 2aDrug Synergism 2aEdetic Acidxpharmacology 2aEnterococcus faeciumxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aFood Additives 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aModels, Biological 2aNisinxpharmacology 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSeafoodxmicrobiology 0amicrobial survival1 aPastoriza, L.1 aSampedro, G.1 aGonzalez, M.P.1 aMurado, M.A.0 tJournal of food protection.g2001 Dec., v. 64, no. 12 p.1943-1948x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02877naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100002400176245012600200300001600326500002400342500001500366520109900381650002301480650002501503650002101528650001901549650002501568650002201593650001001615650002301625650001701648650001401665650001701679650002001696650001301716650002301729650002401752650002101776650001301797650001601810650002301826650002801849653001701877653001901894700001901913700002701932700001701959700001801976773010201994852000902096856008902105930003302194945002502227946001102252655001202263IND4438415320221118201435.0100611e20100628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443841532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2010.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aQ505 0aF2001 aD'Aquino, Salvatore10aPreharvest aminoethoxyvinylglycine treatments reduce internal browning and prolong the shelf-life of early ripening pears  ap. 353-360.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) on internal browning (IB) and keeping quality of early maturing European pears cv 'Camusina di Genova' and 'Camusina di Bonarcado' was examined over 10 days of storage at 18Â°C.

At harvest fruit treated with AVG was less ripe than control fruit, being significantly firmer and experiencing lower values of maturity stage (based on ground color), maturity index (calculated value) and IB, depending on the AVG dose and cultivar. During storage, there was no treatment-dependent difference in titratable acidity and total soluble solids of juice, while both treatments reduced ethylene and respiration rates, delayed the ripening process and lowered the incidence of IB and the loss of firmness, especially when applied at 250mg/L. In addition, AVG treatment significantly reduced decay development in both cultivars, mainly when it was applied at 250mg/L. This effect was related to the delay of ripen and to possible inhibition of ethylene production by the pathogens and/or infected tissues. 3aapplication timing 3atotal soluble solids 3aapplication rate 3aPyrus communis 3apostharvest diseases 3aearly development 3apears 3atitratable acidity 3aharvest date 3acultivars 3astorage time 3astorage quality 3afirmness 3afoliar application 3aethylene production 3acell respiration 3aripening 3afruit crops 3aenzymatic browning 3aaminoethoxyvinylglycine 0afood quality 0asoluble solids1 aSchirra, Mario1 aMolinu, Maria Giovanna1 aTedde, Marco1 aPalma, Amedeo0 tScientia horticulturae.g2010 June 28, v. 125, no. 3 p.353-360dElsevier Sciencex0304-42387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2010.04.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20100911b20101001c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/08/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03179naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245014000190300001800330520137700348592002801725650001801753650001201771650001201783650001901795650001601814650001501830650001001845650001101855650001301866650003401879650001801913650001901931650001501950650002601965650002201991650001602013650001202029650003102041650001202072650001902084650005302103650001902156650004202175650001102217650002402228650002802252650002702280650002302307650002402330650002202354650001802376773009002394856008402484852000902568655001202577IND60088257420221116184248.0141102e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008825742DNAL7 a222449682pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2011.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElliott, J.

A review of the current model predictions of how climate change could affect pelagic freshwater cyanobacteria  ap. 1364-1371.  aThere is increasing evidence that recent changes in climate have had an effect on lake phytoplankton communities and it has been suggested that it is likely that Cyanobacteria will increase in relative abundance under the predicted future climate. However, testing such a qualitative prediction is challenging and usually requires some form of numerical computer model. Therefore, the lake modelling literature was reviewed for studies that examined the impact of climate change upon Cyanobacteria. These studies, taken collectively, generally show an increase in relative Cyanobacteria abundance with increasing water temperature, decreased flushing rate and increased nutrient loads. Furthermore, they suggest that whilst the direct effects of climate change on the lakes can change the timing of bloom events and Cyanobacteria abundance, the amount of phytoplankton biomass produced over a year is not enhanced directly by these changes. Also, warmer waters in the spring increased nutrient consumption by the phytoplankton community which in some lakes caused nitrogen limitation later in the year to the advantage of some nitrogen-fixing Cyanobacteria. Finally, it is also possible that an increase in Cyanobacteria dominance of the phytoplankton biomass will lead to poorer energy flow to higher trophic levels due to their relatively poor edibility for zooplankton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3abiomass 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy flow 3afreshwater 3alakes 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria 3aphytoplankton 3apollution load 3aprediction 3atrophic relationships 3awater temperature 3azooplankton 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Toxinsxtoxicity 2aBiomass 2aClimate Change 2aCyanobacteriaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aEutrophication 2aFresh Waterxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aHumans 2aLakesxmicrobiology 2aMarine Toxinsxtoxicity 2aMicrocystinsxtoxicity 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Theoretical 2aNitrogen Fixation 2aPhytoplankton0 tWater research.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 46, no. 5 p.1364-1371dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2011.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010600163300001600269520159700285592002801882650002501910650001201935650002601947650001701973650000901990650001001999650001502009650002102024650002202045650001202067650001502079650001602094700002002110773011102130856008102241852000902322655001202331IND60440097520221119174433.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044009752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11273-014-9391-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBart, David14aThe influence of legacy impacted seed banks on vegetation recovery in a post-agricultural fen complex  ap. 405-418.  aAgricultural legacies shape soil seed banks, which in turn alter subsequent vegetation recovery. However, the role of legacy-impacted seed banks in shaping wetland-vegetation recovery is not well studied, and hydrologic context may alter impacts of seed bank legacies on extant vegetation. Here we compare seed banks and extant vegetation of four plowed fens to an on-site reference fen to determine (i) if plowing legacies have altered seed banks, (ii) if 13-year post-abandonment vegetation differs from the reference fen, and (iii) whether extant vegetation composition is different than that of seed banks in both reference and plowed fens. The relative abundance of key native graminoid and fen specialist species was greatly reduced in plowed-fen seed banks compared to the reference fen, while weedy/invasive species present in the post-agricultural fensâ seed banks were absent from the reference fen. The depletion of normally dominant native graminoids from seed banks was reflected in extant vegetation. However, shallow water tables predicted shifts in extant vegetation from weedy-mesic annuals to areas dominated by either native clonal forbs or Phalaris arundinacea. In general, plowed plant communities had decreases relative abundance of weedy-mesic species and increased relative abundance clonal forbs or clonal-invasive graminoids compared to seed banks. Our results suggest that while depletion of native graminoids from seed banks plays a part in vegetation recovery, the abundance of weedy-mesic species was not reflected in the recovering vegetation in wetter areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3aannuals 3abotanical composition 3aburied seeds 3afens 3aforbs 3agraminoids 3ainvasive species 3aplant communities 3aplowing 3avegetation 3awater table1 aDavenport, Tara0 tWetlands ecology and management.g2015 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.405-418dSpringer Netherlandsx0923-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-014-9391-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01769naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245009200158300001600250500001400266520080500280592002801085650001701113650001001130650001601140651001001156653002001166653000801186700001801194700001601212700001701228773009601245856008101341852000901422655001201431IND60698854720221120042943.0210116e20150129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069885472DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.479.83642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Xin10aTwo new species of Stenochironomus Kieffer (Diptera, Chironomidae) from Zhejiang, China  ap. 109-119.  aNAL-light  aTwo new species of Stenochironomus Kieffer (Diptera: Chironomidae: Chironominae), Stenochironomus brevissimus sp. n. and Stenochironomus linanensis sp. n., are described from China and the male imagines are illustrated.

Uniform nano-sized HZSM-5 (ca. â¼0.1Î¼m) was found to be a very attractive catalyst, showing a selective formation of propylene and light olefin (about 83% at weight hourly space velocity (WHSV)=3hâ»Â¹) and a high resistance to the deactivation. Under similar conditions micro-size HZSM-5 (ca. â¼2.0Î¼m) produced higher amount of other hydrocarbons i.e., Câ âº) and coke. This is because nano-size crystals have a larger external surface area, which offers a higher number of pore entrances and enhances the reaction occurring inside the pore channels compared with large micro-sized crystals. In addition, it is found that the selectivity to light olefin increases by decreasing the number of acid sites on the external surface. This leads to the conclusion that in n-hexane cracking to light olefin, the activity and selectivity are related to the crystal size and the ratio of surface acid sites to total acid sites. As shown, reducing crystal size and decreasing acid sites on the external surface are remarkable ways to enhance catalytic activity and selectivity, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acatalytic cracking 3achemical engineering 3acracking 3acrystals 3aolefin 3apropylene 3asurface area 3atexture1 aRezaei, Fateme1 aHedlund, Jonas0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 May 15, v. 191 p.528-533dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.03.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010200160300001800262520126000280592002801540650001801568650001901586650002801605650001301633650002301646650002201669650000901691650002101700650001101721700002301732700002101755700002201776700002101798773009901819856007501918852000901993655001202002IND60577220620221120110954.0170807e20150324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057722062DNAL7 a10.1021/la504993p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDestino, Joel F.10aProbing Nanoscale Chemical Segregation and Surface Properties of Antifouling Hybrid Xerogel Films  ap. 3510-3517.  aOver the past decade there has been significant development in hybrid polymer coatings exhibiting tunable surface morphology, surface charge, and chemical segregationî¸all believed to be key properties in antifouling (AF) coating performance. While a large body of research exists on these materials, there have yet to be studies on all the aforementioned properties in a colocalized manner with nanoscale spatial resolution. Here, we report colocalized atomic force microscopy, scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, and confocal Raman microscopy on a model AF xerogel film composed of 1:9:9 (mol:mol:mol) 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), n-octyltriethoxysilane (C8), and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) formed on AlâOâ. This AF film is found to consist of three regions that are chemically and physically unique in 2D and 3D across multiple length scales: (i) a 1.5 Î¼m thick base layer derived from all three precursors; (ii) 2â4 Î¼m diameter mesa-like features that are enriched in free amine (from APTES), depleted in the other species and that extend 150â400 nm above the base layer; and (iii) 1â2 Î¼m diameter subsurface inclusions within the base layer that are enriched in hydrogen-bonded amine (from APTES) and depleted in the other species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman imaging 3aaluminum oxide 3aatomic force microscopy 3acoatings 3acomposite polymers 3afilms (materials) 3agels 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels1 aGatley, Caitlyn

In this work, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with a high efficiency was achieved using CdS nanocrystal decorated CdLaâSâ microspheres (CdS/CdLaâSâ) successfully prepared by a two-step hydrothermal process. The obtained CdS/CdLaâSâ composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microscopy (EM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectroscopy (DRS), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). XRD demonstrated that highly crystalline hexagonal CdS was obtained in CdS/CdLaâSâ. EM results revealed that CdLaâSâ microspheres assembled from a large number of nanoprisms, were intimately enwrapped by the surrounding CdS nanocrystals with a particle size below 20 nm. This unique architecture resulted in the appropriate dispersion of CdS nanocrystals and intimate multipoint contacts between the CdS nanocrystals and CdLaâSâ, which led to significant enhancement of charge separation in CdS/CdLaâSâ. Especially, the CdLaâSâ microspheres decorated with 3 wt% CdS nanocrystals containing 0.4 wt% of Pt showed a high rate of Hâ-production at 2.25 mmol hâ»Â¹ with an apparent quantum efficiency of 54% under 420 nm monochromatic light. The rate of hydrogen evolution from water splitting was 9 times faster in comparison with the rate observed on pure CdLaâSâ, which is ascribed to the presence of CdS nanocrystals that alter the energy levels of the conduction and valence bands in the coupled semiconductor system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acadmium sulfide 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy 3afuels 3ahydrogen production 3amicroparticles 3ananocrystals 3ananoprisms 3aparticle size 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotoluminescence 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asemiconductors 3asolar energy1 aYang, Chao1 aWang, Zheng1 aJiao, Shuqiang1 aZhu, Hongmin0 tRSC advances.g2012 Oct. 8, v. 2, no. 27 p.10330-10336dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra21641h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012600165300001600291500001900307520150100326592002801827650002601855650001201881650001901893650000901912650002601921650002801947650002201975650001101997650001302008650002402021650001102045650001902056650001902075650001702094650001302111650002002124651001002144653002102154653002602175653003002201700001502231700001502246700001802261700001302279700001602292700002002308773013602328856008102464852000902545655001202554IND60650515720221118230157.0190710e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065051572DNAL7 a10.1017/S002185961800062X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltobelli, F.10aIrrigated farming systems: using the water footprint as an indicator of environmental, social and economic sustainability  ap. 711-722.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the current study, for the main crops cultivated in the Campania region (South of Italy), three indicators were proposed and analysed. The blue water footprint (WFb), which gives an indication of the impact of irrigation on the water resource; the gross margin WFb (GMWFb), describing the economic productivity of irrigation; and the job WFb (JWFb) that expresses the social value of blue water in terms of job opportunities. Results confirmed that water applied through irrigation is much higher compared with crop requirements. In terms of GMWFb, silage maize, maize and alfalfa had the highest values, while olive, potato and tomato had the lowest. Concerning JWFb, silage maize was the crop with the highest value. Even though a deeper analysis should be done in terms of added value in the entire supply chain, the results indicated a clear difference between the crops related to animal feeding (alfalfa, maize) and the other crops taken into consideration. In fact, for the former, both the GMWFb and the JWFb achieved their highest values. Results showed that for certain irrigation volumes and for certain crops, the economic and social impacts are very different and the choice of an irrigated crop rather than another has different repercussions in terms of environmental and socio-economic sustainability.

Here we examine Thymax's ability to induce apoptosis in animals bearing Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC). Thymax was administered six days/week orally to mice (5.45 mg/kg body weight) beginning either 14 days prior to EAC inoculation or 9 days post inoculation; treatment continued for 30 days post inoculation. Pretreatment of mice with Thymax markedly delayed tumor growth and reduced tumor incidence by 38.9%, and tumor volumes relative to untreated controls were suppressed by 90.5% and 55.0% for pre- and post-inoculation groups, respectively. Treatment with Thymax inhibited cellular proliferation by decreasing the expression of tumor markers Ki-67, PCNA, and Cyclin D1 in cancer cells and increasing the expression of p21 and p27. This was associated with the ability of Thymax to arrest the cell cycle of EAC cells in the G0/G1 phase and to induce apoptosis, as indicated by a significant increase in the sub-G1 phase's percentage of hypodiploid cells and further affirmed by DNA fragmentation and Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. In addition, Thymax exerted its apoptotic effect in EAC cancer cells through a mitochondrial-dependent pathway, as evidenced by an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, up-regulation of p53 expression, and activation of caspase-3. We conclude that Thymax supplementation enhances tumor cell demise by arresting the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. These data suggest that Thymax could be a new adjuvant for breast cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA fragmentation 3aadjuvants 3aapoptosis 3aascites 3abody weight 3abreast neoplasms 3acancer therapy 3acarcinoma 3acaspase-3 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell proliferation 3acyclins 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells 3apropidium 0aThymax 0aCell cycle 0aApoptosis 0aEhrlich carcinoma 0ain vivo1 aOthman, Azza I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8624-12591 aAmer, Maggie E.1 aGhoneum, Mamdooh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1087-71270 tHeliyon.g2022 Mar., v. 8, no. 3 p.e09047-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e090473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245014200183300001800325520133600343592002801679650002201707650002301729650002601752650001901778650002101797650002401818650001301842650002701855650002101882650000901903650005001912650005001962650003602012650002502048650003202073650002302105650002702128650001802155700002002173700002402193700002802217773011602245856008102361852000902442655001202451IND50073526720221121230623.0150503e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007352672DNAL7 a242932552pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-013-0616-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBispo, Paulo10aPreparation of Triacylglycerols Rich in Omega-3 Fatty Acids from Sardine Oil Using a Rhizomucor miehei Lipase: Focus in the EPA/DHA Ratio  ap. 1866-1881.  aThe increasing evidence on the differential biochemical effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) raises the need of n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acid concentrates with different amounts of these fatty acids. In the present work, physicochemical and enzymatic techniques were combined to obtain acylglycerols, mainly triacylglycerols (TAG), rich in n-3 fatty acids. Sardine oil was obtained by washing sardine (Sardina pilchardus) mince with a NaHCOâsolution, hydrolyzed in a KOHâethanol solution, and concentrated with urea. The esterification reaction was performed in the stoichiometric proportion of substrates for re-esterification to TAG, with 10Â % level of Rhizomucor miehei lipase based on the weight of substrates, without any solvent, during 48Â h. This procedure led to approximately 88Â % of acylglycerols, where more than 66Â % were TAG and the concentration of n-3 fatty acids was higher than 60Â %, the EPA and DHA ratio (EPA/DHA) was 4:1. The content of DHA in the unesterifed fraction (free fatty acids) increased from 20 to 54Â %, while the EPA level in the same fraction decreased from 33 to 12.5Â % (EPA/DHA ratio â1:4). Computational methods (density functional theory calculations) have been carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to explain some of the experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizomucor miehei 3aSardina pilchardus 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aesterification 3afree fatty acids 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3asardines 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3atriacylglycerols 3aurea 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEicosapentaenoic Acidxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xchemistry 2aFish Oilsxchemistry 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aLipasexmetabolism 2aRhizomucorxenzymology 2aTriglycerides1 aBatista, Irineu1 aBernardino, Raul J.1 aBandarra, Narcisa Maria0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2014 Feb., v. 172, no. 4 p.1866-1881dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-013-0616-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01397naa a2200217 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130245005600148300001600204520068200220592002800902650001800930651001800948773011000966856008201076852000901158655001201167IND60620199020221119154301.0181106e196405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062019902DNAL7 a10.1177/0002764264007009042doi  aAGLbengcAGL10aNew Studies in Behavioral Science and Public Policy  ap. 26B-26H.  aThese items are selected, annotated, and coded by the ABS staff in a periodic search of issues of 360 Journals and reviews, including about 100 that are published outside the United States, and from announcements and review copies of books and fugitive materials recently published.

During the last decade, more than a dozen species have been added to the inventory but, unfortunately, these new taxa were not always well characterised. As a consequence, the taxonomy of the genus has become more intricate and species identifica- tion more difficult. Baqri and Bohra (2001) described T. nagauriensis from India and characterised it as having, among other features, the perioral area of the lip region differentiated into a disc-like structure. The study of a population recently collected from Pakistan, as well as the re-examination of one paratype, revealed that such differ- entiation does not exist and further studies have been un- dertaken to clarify the status of the species in the light of new evidence. One female paratype of T. nagauriensis deposited in the University of JaÃ©n nematode collection, as well as 18 fe- males collected from the rhizosphere of wheat in Pakistan, have been studied. Moreover, several specimens of other similar species were also examined for comparative pur- poses, viz ., one female paratype of T. notrus Khan, Jaira- jpuri & Ahmad, 1990, one female of T. dorae Kruger, 1965 (syn. of T. obscurus Jairajpuri, 1965), and type mate- rial of T. terrestris PeÃ±a-Santiago & Coomans, 1996. All of these specimens were from the University of JaÃ©n ne- matode collection. Nematodes were photographed with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope and a Nikon DS digital camera. SEM studies were made on specimens dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, critical point dried, coated with gold and observed with a Jeol JSM-5800 microscope. 1 National Nematological Research Centre, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan 2 Departamento de BiologÃ­a Animal, BiologÃ­a Vegetal y EcologÃ­a, Universidad de JaÃ©n, Campus âLas Lagunillasâ s/n, Edificio B3, 23071-JaÃ©n, Spain * Corresponding author, e-mail: rpena@ujaen.es Received: 8 September 2008; revised: 26 September 2008 Accepted for publication: 1 October 2008 Keywords: diagnosis, morphology, Pakistan, taxonomy.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the possible effects of two SBA nano-structured silica materials differing in morphology; SBA-15, with porous structure in parallel and with a highly ordered hexagonal array and SBA-16, with spheric nano-cages located in cubic arrays, as plant growth promoters/eustressors on chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) during cultivation under greenhouse conditions. The study was carried out at three foliarly applied concentrations (20, 50 and 100 ppm) of either SBA materials to determine effects on seed germination, seedling growth, plant performance and cold tolerance under greenhouse. Phytotoxicity tests were carried out using higher concentrations (100, 1000 and 200 ppm) applied by dipping or spraying onto chili pepper plants. Deionized water controls were included. The results showed that the SBA materials did not affect seed germination; however, SBA-15 at 50 ppm and 100 ppm applied by imbibition significantly increased seedling height (up to 8-fold) and provided enhanced growth performance in comparison with controls under select treatment regimes. Weekly application of SBA-15 at 20 ppm significantly increased stem diameter and cold tolerance; however, SBA-16 showed significant decreases in plant height (20 ppm biweekly applied) and stem diameter (20, 50 and 100 ppm biweekly applied). The results demonstrate that both SBA materials provided hormetic effects in a dose dependent manner on chili pepper production and protection to cold stress. No phytotoxic response was evident. These findings suggested the nanostructured mesoporous silica have potential as a sustainable amendment strategy to increase crop production under stress-inducing cultivation conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCapsicum annuum 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3acrops 3agreenhouses 3agrowth performance 3agrowth promotion 3ahormesis 3ahot peppers 3aimbibition 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant height 3aporous media 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3asilica 3avegetable growing 0aAgronanotechnology 0aBiostimulation 0aElicitation 0aSilica 0aChili pepper1 aPalos-Barba, Viviana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4331-26801 aZuverza-Mena, Nubia1 aVÃ¡zquez-HernÃ¡ndez, Ma.

However, little information is available on the biogeochemical cycling and biological activities after sealing of soils in urban areas. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of soil sealing on N transformation and associated microbial properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Soil samples were collected at four depths (0Ã¢ÂÂ10, 10Ã¢ÂÂ20, 20Ã¢ÂÂ30, 30Ã¢ÂÂ40ÃÂ cm) from three land cover types: impervious land (sealing of soil), forest (vegetation) and bare land (no sealing and no vegetation) in Beijing, China. Soil inorganic N, net potential N-mineralization and nitrification rates, physicochemical properties, microbial biomass and activities of urease, protease and nitrate reductase were analyzed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Sealing of soils affected soil physicochemical properties, nutrient availability and microbial characterizations, which resulted in the reduction of soil net potential mineralization and nitrification. Soil pH and C/N ratio were increased while soil organic matter and total N were decreased after sealing of soils, especially in the 0Ã¢ÂÂ10ÃÂ cm layer. Impervious sites had the lowest soil microbial biomass C (10.52Ã¢ÂÂ26.26ÃÂ mgÃÂ kgÃ¢ÂÂ1) and N (10.52Ã¢ÂÂ26.26ÃÂ mgÃÂ kgÃ¢ÂÂ1) among the three types of soils. In addition, microbial biomass increased along the depth gradient. Soil enzyme activities were also significantly affected by sealing of soils. Canonical correlation analysis suggested that reduction of soil net potential mineralization and nitrification in impervious sites was mainly caused by the variation of soil total N, soil organic matter and soil microbial biomass. CONCLUSIONS: Sealing of soils remarkably influenced the soil N transformation process and soil microbial activities in urban areas. Thus, our results suggested that reducing the negative effects of soil sealing on paved and unpaved areas could be useful measures to improve urban soil functions, and hence facilitate the remediation of the adverse impacts caused by urban N deposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aedaphic factors 3aenzyme activity 3aforests 3agas exchange 3aland cover 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3anitrate reductase 3anitrification 3anitrogen content 3anutrient availability 3aremediation 3asoil depth 3asoil enzymes 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3asoil sampling 3asoil surface sealing 3aurban areas 3aurban soils 3aChina1 aLi, Feng1 aWang, Rusong1 aYang, Qingrui1 aNi, Hongshan0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2012 Apr., v. 12, no. 4 p.519-530dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-012-0472-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245006700175300001600242520143500258592002801693650001501721650001901736650001601755650001201771650001701783650001401800650001001814650001201824650001801836651001101854653001801865653001201883653001301895653001601908653001301924653002401937773011901961856008402080852000902164655001202173IND60544923920221116191146.0160901e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054492392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.09.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoetzel, Emmanuelle10aLate Cenozoic micromammal biochronology of northwestern Africa  ap. 359-381.  aThis synthesis aims to integrate former, recent and unpublished data on fossil micromammals (Rodentia, Erinaceomorpha, Soricomorpha, Chiroptera) from Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian archeological and paleontological sites. An updated biochronology of these taxa is established from the middle Miocene to the Holocene. Ten main biozones are defined: they are characterized by specific faunal assemblages, whose evolution and migrations were influenced by geologic and climatic events throughout the studied period. During the Miocene, Myocricetodontinae were dominant. This period was followed by a progressive diversification among Murinae, Gerbillinae, and Crocidurinae from the Plio-Pleistocene onwards, along with sporadic occurrences of European, Asian and sub-Saharan taxa, before a decrease in small mammal diversity at the beginning of the late Pleistocene, while modern faunas stabilized. Overall, the new biochronology matches well with the former ones. However, some slight discrepancies emerge, notably because the former biochronologies were based on more sporadic data and often did not consider the whole small mammal faunas. The present work represents the first complete biochronological synthesis of North African small faunas for the whole late Cenozoic, which should be useful for paleontologists and archeologists in providing an up-to-date framework into which future discoveries will easily find their place.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aErinaceomorpha 3aGerbillinae 3aMurinae 3aSoricomorpha 3aevolution 3afauna 3afossils 3asmall mammals 3aAfrica 0aSmall mammals 0aMiocene 0aPliocene 0aPleistocene 0aHolocene 0aNorthwestern Africa0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 392 p.359-381dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.09.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245011600178520142200294592002801716650001201744650001101756650001801767650001801785650001101803650001101814650002201825650002401847650001301871650002901884650003201913653001901945653006801964653001302032653001902045653002002064700002402084700002402108700002102132700002002153700001902173700002002192700002002212773012002232856008802352852000902440655001202449IND60741878220221118053748.0220205e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074187822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.1023112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorninger, Christian14aThe effect of industrialization and globalization on domestic land-use: A global resource footprint perspective  aLand-use activities are increasingly globalized and industrialized. While this contributes to a reduction of pressure on domestic ecosystems in some regions, spillover effects from these processes represent potential obstacles for global sustainable land-use. This contribution scrutinizes the complex global resource nexus of national land-use intensity, international trade of biomass goods, and resource footprints in land-use systems. Via a systematic account of the global human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) and inputâoutput modelling, we demonstrate that with growing income countries reduce their reliance on local renewable resources, while simultaneously consuming more biomass goods produced in other countries requiring higher energy and material inputs. The characteristic 'outsourcing' country appropriates 43% of its domestic net primary production, but net-imports a similar amount (64 gigajoules per capita and year) from other countries and requires energy (11 GJ/cap/yr) and material (~400Â kg/cap/yr) inputs four to five times higher as the majority of the global population to sustain domestic land-use intensification. This growing societal disconnect from domestic ecological productivity enables a domestic conservation of ecosystems while satisfying growing demand. However, it does not imply a global decoupling of biomass consumption from resource and land requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aenergy 3aglobal change 3aglobalization 3ahumans 3aincome 3aindustrialization 3ainternational trade 3aland use 3anet primary productivity 3asustainable land management 0aembodied HANPP 0aEnvironmentally-extended multi-regional inputâoutput analysis 0aLand-use 0aResource nexus 0aTeleconnections1 avon Wehrden, Henrik1 aKrausmann, Fridolin1 aBruckner, Martin1 aFeng, Kuishuang1 aHubacek, Klaus1 aErb, Karl-Heinz1 aAbson, David J.0 tGlobal environmental change.g2021 July, v. 69 p.102311-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:2063x0959-37807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.1023113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01989naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007300164300001600237520085000253592002801103650001101131650001201142650001901154650002001173650001701193650001201210650001001222650001901232650001801251650001301269650002301282650002201305650001801327650001601345700002001361700002701381773011401408856004801522852000901570655001201579IND50071453120221118022511.0131227e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007145312DNAL7 a10.3103/S01476874130400302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMamai, A.

To evaluate the effect of a wheat germ-enriched formula in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).Â This randomized controlled clinical trial study was conducted on 100 patients admitted to the ICU. Patients randomly received a wheat germ-enriched formula or a standard formula from the first day of admission until weaning from the ventilator. Then, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of ICU, hospital admission, body composition and mortality rate were compared between the two groups.Â Based on the results, wheat germ-enriched formula caused a significant reduction in the length of mechanical ventilation (29.80Â Â±Â 21.99 days vs. 36.48Â Â±Â 8.78 days, PÂ <Â 0.001), the ICU length of stay (32.92Â Â±Â 21.04 days vs. 37.70Â Â±Â 8.76, PÂ <Â 0.001), and the SOFA score (4.60Â Â±Â 1.28 vs. 5.68Â Â±Â 1.25, PÂ <Â 0.001) compared to the control group. However, the intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in the basal metabolic rate, mid upper arm circumference, skeletal muscle mass, body cell mass, and GCS score compared to the control group (PÂ <Â 0.05). Finally, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of the hospital length of stay, ICU mortality, and body fat percentage (PÂ >Â 0.05).Â In general, wheat germ enriched formula may exert beneficial effect on clinical and anthropomorphic variables in patients admitted to the ICU.Â The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Urmia University of Medical Sciences under number IR.umsu.rec.1396.88 and registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials Website as IRCT20171221037983N3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarm circumference 3abasal metabolic rate 3abody fat 3aclinical nutrition 3aclinical trials 3ahospitals 3amortality 3anutritional support 3askeletal muscle 3awheat 3awheat germ 0aEnteral formula 0aMechanical ventilation 0aICU 0aClinical trial1 aRahimlou, Mehran1 aShojaa, Hamed1 aMorshedzadeh, Nava1 aTavasolian, Ronia1 aHashemi, Reza0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2021 Dec., v. 46 p.40-46dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002400190245010400214300001600318520152400334592002801858653001101886653001401897653000901911653001701920653000701937653001001944653001401954700002201968700001801990700001902008773009702027856008302124852000902207655001202216IND60592200120221120113957.0180331e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059220012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.neuro.2017.07.0032doi7 aPMC56302032pmcid7 a286874482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Caroline M.10aEffects of low-level prenatal lead exposure on child IQ at 4 and 8 years in a UK birth cohort study  ap. 162-169.  aThe association between childhood exposure to lead (Pb) and deficits in cognitive function is well established. The association with prenatal exposure, however, is not well understood, even though the potential adverse effects are equally important.To evaluate the association between low prenatal exposure to lead and IQ in children, to determine whether there were sex differences in the associations, and to evaluate the moderation effect of prenatal Pb exposure on child IQ.Whole blood samples from pregnant women enrolled in ALSPAC (n=4285) and from offspring at age 30 months (n=235) were analysed for Pb. Associations between prenatal blood lead concentrations (B-Pb) and child IQ at age 4 and 8 years (WPPSI and WISC-III, respectively) were examined in adjusted regression models.There was no association of prenatal lead exposure with child IQ at 4 or 8 years old in adjusted regression models, and no moderation of the association between child B-Pb and IQ. However, there was a positive association for IQ at age 8 years in girls with a predicted increase in IQ (points) per 1Î¼g/dl of: verbal 0.71, performance 0.57, total 0.73. In boys, the coefficients tended to be negative (â0.15, â0.42 and â0.29 points, respectively).Prenatal lead exposure was not associated with adverse effects on child IQ at age 4 or 8 years in this study. There was, however, some evidence to suggest that boys are more susceptible than girls to prenatal exposure to lead. Further investigation in other cohorts is required.  aPublisher supplied data 0aALSPAC 0aPregnancy 0aLead 0aHeavy metals 0aIQ 0aChild 0aCognition1 aKordas, Katarzyna1 aGolding, Jean1 aEmond, Alan M.0 tNeurotoxicology.g2017 Sept., v. 62 p.162-169dElsevier B.V.wJournal:19553x0161-813X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2017.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245009200174300001600266500001900282500002000301520111400321592002801435650002601463650001801489650001201507650001901519650003001538650001201568650002201580650001701602700002001619773011801639856009001757852000901847655001201856IND60734304720221120203927.0210417e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073430472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1989.tb00680.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarks, Susan,10aEffects of drought and CO2 enrichment on competition between two oldâfield perennials  ap. 181-186.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe studied the effects of drought stress and COâ enrichment on the competition between Aster pilosus Willd.

Although broomsedge is the more droughtâtolerant species, this did not increase its competitive ability against aster under drought conditions. With COâ enrichment, aster was a stronger competitor than broomsedge and comprised 75% of aboveâground pot biomass in both water treatments. COâ enrichment also increased aster survival when competing with broomsedge under extreme drought conditions. Although drought stress and COâ enrichment interacted to affect the two species in different ways, there was no interaction of drought stress and competition; aster was a stronger competitor than broomsedge under COâ enrichment in both wellâwatered and waterâlimited conditions. With future increases in the atmospheric COâ concentration, aster may delay broomsedge dominance in oldâfield communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndropogon virginicus 3aAster pilosus 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3awater stress1 aSTRAIN, BOYD R.0 tnew phytologist.g1989 Feb., v. 111, no. 2 p.181-186dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1989.tb00680.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245008800210520159900298592002801897650001301925650001701938650001801955650001101973650001901984653002302003653002402026653002802050653003102078653002502109700002002134700005602154700002302210700005902233700003202292700006102324773010602385856008802491852000902579655001202588IND60741878320221118053651.0220205e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074187832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.1023122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtto, Siegmar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9645-258614aThe prosocial origin of sustainable behavior: A case study in the ecological domain  aPrior research has focused on individual difference variables that predict various prosocial behaviors. This work, however, has neglected to consider the underlying commonalities between the different domains behavior can be performed. In line with other authors we propose that individual difference factors can indicate oneâs propensity toward acting prosocially across domains, and that prosocial behaviors also include behaviors that support behavior for the common good. We argue that in order for oneâs prosocial propensity to be actualized in a particular domain, a motivator in the form of connectedness to the domain is necessary. This paper examines such a model exemplified in the ecological domain by explaining pro-environmental actions. Through two studies (total NÂ =Â 760) we provide evidence for a mediation model whereby connectedness to nature mediates the positive relation between prosocial propensity and pro-environmental behavior. Prosocial propensity was operationalized as altruism (studies 1 and 2) and honesty-humility (study 2). Further, study 1 also showed a comparison between participants indicating membership in environmental and humanitarian organizations and non-members. This indicated that prosocial propensity was higher in environmentalists and humanitarians compared to non-members, while connectedness to nature and pro-environmental behaviors were higher only in environmental organization members. These studies provide evidence for the premise of a prosocial propensity being actualized in the ecological domain via connectedness to that domain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltruism 3acase studies 3aglobal change 3amodels 3atotal nitrogen 0aProsocial behavior 0aEcological behavior 0aConnectedness to nature 0aPro-environmental behavior 0aSustainable behavior1 aPensini, Pamela1 aZabel, Sarah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7056-73771 aDiaz-Siefer, Pablo1 aBurnham, Elliot1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1059-70261 aNavarro-Villarroel, Claudia1 aNeaman, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1819-08720 tGlobal environmental change.g2021 July, v. 69 p.102312-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2063x0959-37807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.1023123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245018800174300001600362520162600378592002802004650001402032650001302046650001302059650002902072650002702101650001202128650001602140650001102156650003502167650004302202650001902245650001402264650001202278650002302290650001102313650001102324650001602335653001702351653001602368653001602384653001902400653002002419700001702439700002902456773008902485856008402574852000902658655001202667IND60565138120221119142726.0170320e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056513812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaniszewska, Marta10aChanges of concentrations and possibility of accumulation of bisphenol A and alkylphenols, depending on biomass and composition, in zooplankton of the Southern Baltic (Gulf of Gdansk)  ap. 489-501.  aThe focus of the present study was to find the relationship between concentrations of bisphenol A (BPA), 4-tert-octylphenol (OP) and 4-nonylphenol (NP) in zooplankton and seasonal changes in the composition and biomass of particular zooplankton taxa in the Gulf of Gdansk (Southern Baltic) in the years 2011â2012. Assays of BPA, OP and NP in water and zooplankton samples were performed using the HPLC/FL system. High mean concentrations of the studied compounds, determined in spring (405.9 (BPA); 25.7 (OP); 111.2 (NP) ngÂ gâ1 dw), can be linked to the high proportion of meroplankton in that season. Rotifera also had an influence on the rise in concentrations of the studied compounds but to a lesser degree, while the lowest concentrations (determined in summer) can be associated with the high participation of Copepoda and Cladocera in zooplankton biomass. It was also observed that juvenile forms can be more susceptible to accumulating endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). This is indicated by the positive correlation between BPA concentration in zooplankton and the proportion of Copepoda nauplii biomass in spring (rÂ =Â 0.90; pÂ <Â 0.05). In most cases, greater zooplankton biomass accumulated higher concentrations and loads of the studied compounds. With biomass growth (to 123.32Â Î¼gÂ mâ3), the bioconcentration factor also rose (to max 46.1Â·103), demonstrating that unlike typical hydrophobic compounds the studied EDCs do not become âdilutedâ in zooplankton biomass. The highest BPA concentrations from all compounds may be connected with anthropogenic sources located in the coastal zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladocera 3aCopepoda 3aRotifera 3aanthropogenic activities 3abioaccumulation factor 3abiomass 3abisphenol A 3acoasts 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3ajuveniles 3anauplii 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3azooplankton 0aAlkylphenols 0aBisphenol A 0aZooplankton 0aGulf of Gdansk 0aSouthern Baltic1 aNehring, Iga1 aMudrak-CegioÅka, Stella0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 June, v. 213 p.489-501dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001500171245015900186300001600345520095700361592002801318650004401346650001401390650001401404650002201418650001301440650002401453650001401477650001101491650001601502650002401518650001301542650001401555650001901569650001501588650002701603650002501630650002501655653002401680653001801704653001401722653002401736700001201760700001801772700001501790700001601805700001601821700001301837700001701850700001801867773010601885856008701991852000902078655001202087IND50066080020221120040632.0190409e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006608002DNAL7 a235878232pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.03.1262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yihuai10aOptimization of biodiesel production process from soybean oil using the sodium potassium tartrate doped zirconia catalyst under Microwave Chemical Reactor  ap. 220-225.  aA solid base catalyst was prepared by the sodium potassium tartrate doped zirconia and microwave assisted transesterification of soybean oil was carried out for the production of biodiesel.

The base strength of the catalysts was tested by the Hammett indicator method, and the results showed that the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield was related to their total basicity. The catalyst was also characterized by FTIR, TGA, XRD and TEM. The experimental results showed that a 2.0:1 volume ratio of methanol to oil, 65Â°C reaction temperature, 30min reaction time and 10wt.% catalyst amount gave the highest the yield of biodiesel. Compared to conventional method, the reaction time of the way of microwave assisted transesterification was shorter.

To correctly extract the propagation length from the measured photobleach intensity, it is necessary to understand the mechanism by which dye photobleaching occurs. In particular, 1- vs 2-photon bleaching reactions yield different propagation lengths based on a kinetic model for BlIPP. Because a number of studies have reported on the importance of 2-photon processes for dye photobleaching, we investigate here the nature of the photobleaching step in BlIPP. We are able to demonstrate that only 1-photon absorption is relevant for typical BlIPP conditions as tested here for a thin film of indocyanine green fluorescent dye molecules coated over gold nanowires and excited at a wavelength of 785 nm. These results are obtained by directly measuring the excitation intensity dependence of the photobleaching rate constant of the dye in the presence of the metallic waveguide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ableaching 3afluorescent dyes 3agold 3akinetics 3amicroscopy 3ananowires 3aphotobleaching 3awavelengths1 aPaul, Aniruddha1 aChang, Wei-Shun1 aLink, Stephan0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Apr. 25, v. 117, no. 16 p.4611-4617dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp308790m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01061naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007300166300001600239520023400255592002800489650002000517650001600537650002300553700001500576773011200591856008300703852000900786655001200795IND60623890220221122211016.0181203e196710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062389022DNAL7 a10.1258/0023677677810355032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwen, Dawn G.14aThe Establishment of a Colony of Specified-Pathogen-Free Guinea-Pigs  ap. 151-156.  aA method for the establishment of a colony of specified-pathogen-free guinea-pigs is described.

Virulent or pathogenicity-associated sRNAs have been increasingly elucidated in animal pathogens but little is known about similar category of sRNAs in plant-pathogenic bacteria. This is particularly true regarding rice bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae (Xoo) as studies on the virulent role of Xoo sRNAs is very limited at present. RESULTS: The number and genomic distribution of sRNAs in Xoo were determined by bioinformatics analysis based on high throughput sequencing (sRNA-Seq) of the bacterial cultures from virulence-inducing and standard growth media, respectively. A total of 601 sRNAs were identified in the Xoo genome and ten virulent sRNA candidates were screened out based on significant differences of their expression levels between the culture conditions. In addition, trans3287 and trans3288 were also selected as candidates due to high expression levels in both media. The differential expression of 12 sRNAs evidenced by the sRNA-Seq data was confirmed by a convincing quantitative method. Based on genetic analysis of Xoo ÎsRNA mutants generated by deletion of the 12 single sRNAs, trans217 and trans3287 were characterized as virulent sRNAs. They are essential not only for the formation of bacterial blight in a susceptible rice variety Nipponbare but also for the induction of hypersensitive response (HR) in nonhost plant tobacco. Xoo Îtrans217 and Îtrans3287 mutants fail to induce bacterial blight in Nipponbare and also fail to induce the HR in tobacco, whereas, genetic complementation restores both mutants to the wild type in the virulent performance and HR induction. Similar effects of gene knockout and complementation were found in the expression of hrpG and hrpX genes, which encode regulatory proteins of the type III secretion system. Consistently, secretion of a type III effector, PthXo1, is blocked in Îtrans217 or Îtrans3287 bacterial cultures but retrieved by genetic complementation to both mutants. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic analysis characterizes trans217 and trans3287 as pathogenicity-associated sRNAs essential for the bacterial virulence on the susceptible rice variety and for the HR elicitation in the nonhost plant. The molecular evidence suggests that both virulent sRNAs regulate the bacterial virulence by targeting the type III secretion system.  aPublisher supplied data  a31772247cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFD0200901cnational key research and development plan  aBK20150668cthe Jiangsu Provincial Scientific Plan Program0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 3aanimal pathogens 3aanimals 3abacteria 3abioinformatics 3ablight 3aculture media 3agene expression regulation 3agene targeting 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic complementation 3agenomics 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahypersensitive response 3amutants 3anon-coding RNA 3apathovars 3aplant pathogens 3aquantitative analysis 3aregulatory proteins 3arice 3asecretion 3atobacco 3atype III secretion system 3avirulence1 aZhang, Liyuan1 aWang, Xuan1 aSun, Fengli1 aKong, Xiangxin1 aDong, Hansong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2820-91591 aXu, Heng0 tBMC plant biology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.237-237dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1470-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001800192245010200210300001600312506007600328520170000404592002802104506003702132650000802169650002402177650001502201650001402216650001302230650001202243650001102255650001102266650002002277653001502297653001602312653002002328653001202348653001502360653001202375653001802387653001602405653003502421653001002456700002202466773009902488856008502587852000902672655001202681IND60690206620221207115253.0200426e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069020662DNAL7 a10.1080/19491034.2015.10260222doi7 aPMC46157922pmcid7 a258919922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTauber, Maria10aConserved linker regions and their regulation determine multiple chromatin-binding modes of UHRF1  ap. 123-132.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUbiquitin-like with PHD and RING Finger domains 1 (UHRF1) is an important nuclear protein that is mutated and aberrantly expressed in many tumors. The protein integrates different chromatin modifications and is essential for their maintenance throughout the cell cycle. Separate chromatin-binding modules of UHRF1 have been studied on a functional and structural level. The unmodified N-terminus of histone H3 is recognized by a PHD domain, while a TTD domain specifically interacts with histone H3 Lysine 9 trimethylation. A SRA region binds hemimethylatd DNA. Emerging evidence indicates that the modules of UHRF1 do not act independently of each other but establish complex modes of interaction with patterns of chromatin modifications. This multivalent readout is regulated by allosteric binding of phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate to a region outside the PHD, TTD and SRA domains as well as by phosphorylation of one of the linker regions connecting these modules. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on UHRF1 chromatin interaction and introduce a novel model of conformational transitions of the protein that are directed by the flexible and highly charged linker regions. We propose that these are essential in setting up defined structural states of the protein where different domains or combinations thereof are available for binding chromatin modifications or are prevented from doing so. Lastly, we suggest that controlled tuning of intramolecular linker interactions by ligands and posttranslational modifications establishes a rational framework for comprehending UHRF1 regulation and putatively the working mode of other chromatin factors in different physiological contexts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aRING finger domains 3acell cycle 3achromatin 3ahistones 3aligands 3alysine 3amodels 3aphosphorylation 0aallosteric 0acooperative 0aDNA methylation 0adomains 0aepigenetic 0ahistone 0amodifications 0amultivalent 0amultiple protein conformations 0aUHRF11 aFischle, Wolfgang0 tNucleus.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 6, no. 2 p.123-132dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27386x1949-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19491034.2015.10260223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02062naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002100167245006600188300001400254520094000268592002801208650002101236650002901257650001101286650001301297650003001310650001401340650001101354650001801365650003201383650001601415650002001431650001301451650003901464773008201503856008201585852000901667655001201676IND60098912920221117212456.0141105e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009891292DNAL7 a217227152pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2011.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitazono, Ana A.10aOptimized protocols and plasmids for in vivo cloning in yeast  ap. 86-89.  aSaccharomyces cerevisiae has proven a valuable system for the construction of plasmids via gap repair or in vivo cloning. The method allows cloning with superior accuracy and without the need to use restriction enzymes. However, despite its remarkable efficiency, the process may occasionally require the screening of large number of candidates. We have previously reported that by simply using shuttle plasmids that allow blue/white selection in Escherichia coli, it is possible to pre-select for positive clones. Here, we demonstrate that the same strategy can be used to assemble plasmids from several ectopic DNA fragments, which are all introduced in yeast cells by a simple transformation step. Further, to facilitate the subcloning of the fragment cloned into other targeting or expression vectors, the multi-cloning sites of three shuttle plasmids have been extended to include fifteen new restriction enzyme recognition sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aclones 3aplasmids 3arestriction endonucleases 3ascreening 3ayeasts 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecularxmethods 2aDNA, Fungal 2aGenetic Vectors 2aPlasmids 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics0 tGene.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 484, no. 1-2 p.86-89dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2011.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245006500200300001800265506007600283520138900359592002801748506003701776650002101813650002201834650003601856650001401892650001001906650003101916650001801947650001801965650000701983700001801990700002102008773012102029856007502150852000902225655001202234IND60558817420221207094255.0161117e20130425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055881742DNAL7 a10.1021/jp30879782doi7 aPMC35867672pmcid7 a231459592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoyer, Tyson
J.10aTuning Nanostructure Dimensions with Supramolecular Twisting  ap. 4604-4610.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPeptide amphiphiles are molecules containing a peptide segment covalently bonded to a hydrophobic tail and are known to self-assemble in water into supramolecular nanostructures with shape diversity ranging from spheres to cylinders, twisted ribbons, belts, and tubes. Understanding the self-assembly mechanisms to control dimensions and shapes of the nanostructures remains a grand challenge. We report here on a systematic study of peptide amphiphiles containing valineâglutamic acid dimeric repeats known to promote self-assembly into belt-like flat assemblies. We find that the lateral growth of the assemblies can be controlled in the range of 100 nm down to 10 nm as the number of dimeric repeats is increased from two to six. Using circular dichroism, the degree of Î²-sheet twisting within the supramolecular assemblies was found to be directly proportional to the number of dimeric repeats in the PA molecule. Interestingly, as twisting increased, a threshold is reached where cylinders rather than flat assemblies become the dominant morphology. We also show that in the belt regime, the width of the nanostructures can be decreased by raising the pH to increase charge density and therefore electrostatic repulsion among glutamic acid residues. The control of size and shape of these nanostructures should affect their functions in biological signaling and drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical bonding 3achemical elements 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acylinders 3adrugs 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aglutamic acid 3ananomaterials 3apH1 aCui, Honggang1 aStupp, Samuel I.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Apr. 25, v. 117, no. 16 p.4604-4610dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp30879783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04040naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100003400169245010500203300001600308520186700324592002802191650002202219650002202241650001502263650002202278650001302300650001102313650002002324650001902344650003802363650001402401650001002415650001302425650002502438650002202463650001502485650001402500650002502514650002002539650001802559650002402577650001202601650004602613650001102659650004602670650002302716650001502739650005002754650002302804650002202827650002802849650001402877650002502891650005702916650005802973700002603031700002903057700002403086700002103110700001603131773010203147856008403249852000903333655001203342IND50059527920221120054801.0141111e20121221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005952792DNAL7 a227851272pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade la Torre-Escudero, Eduardo10aMolecular cloning, characterization and diagnostic performance of the Schistosoma bovis 22.6 antigen  ap. 530-540.  aAnimal schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma bovis is a veterinary problem in many areas of the world. It affects a large number of animals and causes important economic losses in livestock production. The 22.6kDa antigen is a tegumental protein of unknown function, restricted to schistosomes. In S. bovis it has been identified in the tegument and in an excretionâsecretion extract, consisting of several, non-glycosylated isoforms that are recognised by the sera of animals infected with S. bovis. The aims of the present work were to clone, sequence, express and characterize at molecular level the S. bovis 22.6 antigen (Sb22.6), as well as to assess the usefulness of the corresponding recombinant protein as a diagnostic antigen in ELISA tests for the detection of free-range cattle farms infested with S. bovis. Immunolocalization studies revealed that Sb22.6 is expressed in the tegument and some internal tissues of the adult worms, but it is not exposed on the surface of the adult worms and schistosomula. The reactivity of the recombinant Sb22.6 (rSb22.6) in ELISA against antibodies in sera from S. bovis experimentally infected hamsters and sera from free-range cattle from a S. bovis endemic area showed that the recombinant protein and the soluble extract of adult worms (SbC) exhibited a similar diagnostic performance. In addition, rSb22.6 did not show cross-reactions with antibodies against Fasciola hepatica, also a frequent trematode parasite in cattle. The rSb22.6 antigen can be readily produced in large amounts and in a highly reproducible fashion, avoiding the types of problem that arise upon using crude extracts such as the SbC. In conclusion, this protein represents a promising epidemiological tool for the surveillance of S. bovis and may help to implement control measures in the areas and farms were the parasite is present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFasciola hepatica 3aSchistosoma bovis 3aantibodies 3aantigen detection 3aantigens 3acattle 3acontrol methods 3across reaction 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarm area 3afarms 3ahamsters 3alivestock production 3amolecular cloning 3amonitoring 3aparasites 3arecombinant proteins 3aschistosomiasis 3aschistosomula 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Helminthxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosisxparasitology. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCricetinae 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aLungxparasitology 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aProtein Conformation 2aSchistosomaxclassificationximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aSchistosomiasisxdiagnosisxparasitologyxveterinary.1 aManzano-RomÃ¡n, RaÃºl1 aPÃ©rez-SÃ¡nchez, Ricardo1 aBarrera, Inmaculada1 aSiles-Lucas, Mar1 aOleaga, Ana0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2012 Dec. 21, v. 190, no. 3-4 p.530-540dElsevier B.V.x0304-40177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04353naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245007800174300001600252500001900268500002000287520301000307592002803317650001703345650001903362650001503381650001403396650001703410650001203427650001503439650001303454650001503467650001803482650001203500650001203512650001603524650002203540650001503562650002003577650001903597650001503616650000903631650001403640773011803654856009003772852000903862655001203871IND60734305020221121144103.0210417e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073430502DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1989.tb00675.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSPRENT, J. I.10aWhich steps are essential for the formation of functional legume nodules?  ap. 129-153.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNodulation is reviewed in terms of the phenotypes proposed by Vincent (1980). Individual legumes may be infectible by one or more of the three bacterial genera (collectively known as rhizobia) Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, or Azorhizobium. The type of infection process by which rhizobia gain entry is largely governed by the host genotype. In addition to the widely studied rootâhair pathway, infections may be associated with lateral root emergence or occur between root epidermal cells. The exact chemical and physical nature of the root hair/epidermal cell wall is likely to be a critical factor in determining whether infections can proceed. In addition to differing with species, wall composition may be influenced by soil chemical (e.g. CaÂ²âº) and biotic factors (e.g. bacteria). Rhizobial features essential for infection include particular surface polysaccharides and the induction of nodulation genes by plant root exudates. Neither of these is likely to be a major barrier to the extension of nodulation to new hosts. Dissemination of rhizobia within developing nodules may be intercellular, via infection threads or by division of a small number of infected cells. All functional symbioses eventually have âintracellularâ bacteria, in the sense that rhizobia are geographically located within the boundary of the host cell walls. However, they remain extracellular in the sense that they are always confined by a membrane which is largely of host cell origin. In some genera they are also surrounded by infection thread walls, probably modified forms of âinvasiveâ infection thread walls, which allow differentiation of rhizobia into the nitrogenâfixing form. Thus, natural, functional, symbioses may (a) never involve a stage in which bacteria are confined within tubular infection threads or (b) never release bacteria from infection threads. These features are determined by host genotype. The one feature of legume nodules so far found never to vary is the stemâlike character of a peripheral vascular system. This contrasts with the central vascular system of actinorhizas and the rhizobialâinduced nodules on the Ulmaceous genus Parasponia. Although of great intrinsic interest, this character is unlikely to present an insurmountable barrier to the extension of nodulation to new species. Other features, such as the ability to produce haemoglobin are now known to the in the genetic makeup of many higher plants. The discovery of the wide range of nodule structures occurring in nature, together with work on mutant rhizobia which may bypass critical stages in the nodulation process, suggest various ways in which the extension of nodulation to nonânodulated legumes and to other (initially at least, dicotyledonous) plants may be engineered.

The pharmacokinetics and potential toxicological effects of DRO were investigated in juvenile sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) exposed through the diet (0.01â10Â Î¼g DRO/g) for up to 31 days. DRO was detected in the blood (4â27Â ng/mL) of fish exposed to the highest concentration, with no significant bioaccumulation over time and no alteration of hepatic metabolizing enzymes, namely, CYP1A and CYP3A-catalysed activities and UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UGT). Pregnenolone (P5), progesterone (P4), 17Î±-hydroxyprogesterone (17P4), 17Î±-hydroxypregnenolone (17P5), androstenedione (AD) and testosterone (T) were determined in plasma and gene expression of cyp17a1, cyp19a1a and cyp11Î² analysed by qRT-PCR in gonads. The significant increase in plasmatic levels of 17P5, 17P4 and AD detected after 31 days exposure to 10Â ng DRO/g together with the increased expression of cyp17a1 in females evidence the ability of DRO to alter steroid synthesis at low intake concentrations (7Â ng DRO/day). However, the potential consequences of this steroid shift for female reproduction remain to be investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aandrostenedione 3abass 3abioaccumulation 3ablood 3adiet 3aenzymes 3afemales 3agene expression 3agonads 3ahormone replacement therapy 3ajuveniles 3apharmacokinetics 3apregnenolone 3aprogesterone 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areproduction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atestosterone 0aProgestins 0aSea bass 0aSex steroids 0aMetabolism 0acyp17a11 aFernandes, Denise1 aMedina, Paula1 aBlÃ¡zquez, Mercedes,1 aPorte, Cinta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3940-64090 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 June, v. 213 p.541-548dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03816naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001700167245013700184300001400321520183200335592002802167650002102195650001402216650002502230650001502255650001602270650002602286650002002312650000902332650001602341650005202357650002602409650001702435650003702452650005302489650001202542650002402554650002702578650003802605650001602643650003802659650000902697650002602706650002802732650004002760650002602800650001702826700001502843700001402858700001502872700001802887700001802905700001702923700001802940700001902958700001602977773008202993856008203075852000903157655001203166IND60098913120221117212521.0141105e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009891312DNAL7 a216797522pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2011.05.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Fangfang10aRegulation of CD2-associated protein influences podocyte endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis induced by albumin overload  ap. 18-25.  aProteinuria is an exacerbating factor of chronic kidney diseases, leading to glomerulosclerosis. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating protein overload-induced podocyte injury are poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that apoptosis mediated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress participated in the progression of a variety of kidney diseases. In the present study, we investigated the role of CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) in protein overload-induced ER stress and subsequent podocyte apoptosis. Conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes were cultured in vitro and treated with different concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA). In addition, CD2AP eukaryotic expression vector or siRNA was transfected into podocytes before exposed to BSA. Albumin endocytosis and podocyte apoptosis were visualized by confocal microscopy. The subcellular organelles were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The expressions of GRP78, caspase-12 and CD2AP were detected by RT-PCR or Western blot analysis. It was found that albumin was endocytosed by podocytes in a time-dependent manner. Accumulation of albumin in podocytes induced ER stress and apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner as indicated by upregulation of GRP78 and caspase-12. Meanwhile, the subcellular organelles were disrupted and the expression of CD2AP was downregulated by high concentration of albumin. Transfection of CD2AP eukaryotic expression vector into podocytes increased CD2AP expression, depressed GRP78 and caspase-12 expressions, and inhibited podocyte apoptosis. In contrast, transfection of CD2AP siRNA deteriorated the above changes induced by BSA. It is concluded protein overload induces podocyte apoptosis via ER stress and CD2AP may play a crucial role in albumin overload-induced ER stress and apoptosis in podocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3abovine serum albumin 3acaspase-12 3aendocytosis 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3akidney diseases 3amice 3aproteinuria 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asmall interfering RNA 3atransfection 3atransmission electron microscopy 2aAdaptor Proteins, Signal Transducingxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxgenetics 2aCell Line, Transformed 2aCytoskeletal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aEndocytosis 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxmetabolism 2aMice 2aPodocytesxmetabolism 2aProteinuriaxmetabolism 2aSerum Albumin, Bovinexpharmacology 2aStress, Physiological 2aTransfection1 aChen, Shan1 aWang, Hui1 aShao, Ning1 aTian, Xiujuan1 aJiang, Huajun1 aLiu, Jianshe1 aZhu, Zhonghua1 aMeng, Xianfang1 aZhang, Chun0 tGene.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 484, no. 1-2 p.18-25dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2011.05.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245002800170300001600198520132500214592002801539650001601567650001301583650001301596650001101609650001001620650001601630650001501646651001801661651001201679651001601691653001101707653002301718653001201741653001501753653002501768700003001793700001701823700002401840773011901864856008401983852000902067655001202076IND60544924320221116190836.0160901e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054492432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.09.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilg, H. Albert10aCool kaolins in Finland  ap. 454-462.  aWe use D/H and 18O/16O ratios to explore the age of kaolins on the Fennoscandian Shield. Sub-Cretaceous kaolins in southern Scandinavia have isotopic compositions indicative of weathering under warm mean annual temperatures (MATs) of >15Â°C. Deep kaolins on the shield surface in Finland previously also have been regarded as products of humid tropical weathering of Mesoproterozoic to Eocene age. New oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios indicate, however, weathering by cool groundwater under MATs of 13â15Â°C. Isotope ratios are also not consistent with deep (>1km) burial by cover rocks, indicating that a very old age for the weathering is unlikely. Palaeotemperatures are below Cretaceous MATs, yet substantially above Plio-Pleistocene MATs. Comparisons with palaeotemperatures in N Europe and around the Arctic Ocean indicate that the Finnish kaolins developed on the shield surface in the Palaeogene or, alternatively, Miocene. Deep weathering was selectively developed in highly fractured shield rocks and took place in response to latest Cretaceous and Palaeogene uplift and after stripping of Palaeozoic cover rocks. The cool kaolins in Finland indicate that previous routine attributions of kaolinitic weathering products in the geological record to humid tropical environments should be closely scrutinised.  aPublisher supplied data 3agroundwater 3ahydrogen 3aisotopes 3aoxygen 3arocks 3atemperature 3aweathering 3aArctic region 3aFinland 3aScandinavia 0aKaolin 0aPalaeotemperatures 0aFinland 0aWeathering 0aFennoscandian Shield1 aHall, A.

Terrapene carolina (Eastern box turtle) and its sister taxon T. ornata (Ornate box turtle) are especially popular subjects of HR studies because they are relatively easily tracked. Terrapene HR studies have revealed a wide variation in HR sizes within and between populations, due to factors such as differences in ecoregion and analytical approach (e.g., minimum convex polygons, kernel analysis, bivariate normal, multivariate Ornstein&ndash;Uhlenbeck stochastic process, harmonic means). We performed a meta-analysis of the available literature, including unpublished work to avoid bias due to under-publication, to explore the causes for variation in HR size. We found 19 studies reporting T. carolina HR sizes and seven studies reporting T. ornata HR sizes; the resulting meta-analysis revealed patterns that are not visible in the individual studies. We found important differences between the species: female T. ornata had smaller HRs than males, whereas the opposite is true for T. carolina, and T. ornata HRs were influenced by ecoregion, while T. carolina HRs were not similarly influenced. Not surprisingly, we found that choice of analysis technique affected HR estimate; analyses using ellipses resulted in larger HR estimates than all the other techniques, while kernels were smaller than minimum convex polygons. Although not indicated by individual studies, our meta-analysis showed that the HRs of relocated T. carolina females were significantly larger than those of non-relocated females. Although the number of individual turtles in studies varied from three to 25, the sample size did not significantly affect HR size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTerrapene carolina 3aanalytical methods 3aecoregions 3afemales 3ahome range 3amales 3ameta-analysis 3astochastic processes 3aturtles1 aFigueras, Miranda  P.1 aDeo, Jean  E.1 aBurke, Russell L.,0 tDiversity.g2019 Apr. 28, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d110500683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100003100167245009300198300001400291520120800305592002801513650001601541650001301557650001801570650001201588650002701600650001001627650001501637650001301652650002201665650003601687650003501723650003301758650003601791650001401827650003401841650003201875650002301907700002601930700002201956700002601978700002502004700002302029773008202052856008202134852000902216655001202225IND60098913220221117212519.0141105e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009891322DNAL7 a216797512pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2011.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmÃ©ciga-DÃ­az, Carlos J.10aComputational analysis of the fructosyltransferase enzymes in plants, fungi and bacteria  ap. 26-34.  aFructosyltransferases (FTases) are enzymes produced by plants, fungi, and bacteria, which are responsible for the synthesis of fructooligosaccharides. In this study, we conducted a computational analysis of reported sequences for FTase from a diverse source of organisms, such as plants, fungi, and bacteria. Ninety-one proteins sequences were obtained; all belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 32 (GH32) and 68 (GH68) families. The sequences were grouped in seven clades, five for plants, one for fungi, and one for bacteria. Our findings suggest that FTases from fungi and bacteria likely evolved from dicotyledonous FTases. The analysis of catalytic domains A, D and E, which contain the amino acids involved in the catalytic binding site, allowed the identification of clade-specific conserved characteristics. The analysis of sequence motifs involved in donor/acceptor molecule affinity showed that additional sequences could be responsible for donor/acceptor molecule affinity. The correlation of this large set of FTases allowed to identify additional features that might be used for the identification and classification of new FTases, and to improve the understanding of these valuable enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3abinding sites 3aenzymes 3afructooligosaccharides 3afungi 3aglycosides 3aproteins 3asequence analysis 2aBacteriaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aComputational Biologyxmethods 2aFungixenzymologyxgenetics. 2aHexosyltransferasesxmetabolism 2aPhylogeny 2aPlantsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSequence Alignment1 aGutierrez, Ãngela M.1 aBahamon, Isabella1 aRodriguez, Alexander,1 aRodrÃ­guez, Mauro A.1 aSÃ¡nchez, Oscar F.0 tGene.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 484, no. 1-2 p.26-34dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2011.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015400169300001600323520161000339592002801949650001101977650001401988650003002002651001102032653004002043653001702083653003002100653002402130653003402154653003702188700001602225773011902241856008402360852000902444655001202453IND60544924420221116190750.0160901e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054492442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.09.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMourtzas, N.D.10aHistorical coastal evolution of the ancient harbor of Aegina in relation to the Upper Holocene relative sea level changes in the Saronic Gulf, Greece  ap. 411-425.  aThe extensive ancient harbor installations â today submerged â on the seafront of Kolona in Aegina are associated with the great trading and maritime development of the island from the Middle Bronze Age to the Middle Classical period.Based on geomorphological and archeological indications, three distinct relative sea levels can be defined at depths of 3.17Â±0.05m, 0.97Â±0.05m and 0.52Â±0.05m. The dating of the sea level changes based on archeological evidence and historical sources shows that the initial sea level change in Aegina occurred certainly after AD170 and most likely after AD250. The intermediate change is dated between AD1586 and AD1839, and the most recent change occurred between 1839 and 1999. A transgression followed a long period of sea level stability that lasted at least 2200years, from the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 3900yr BP) to the Late Roman period (ca. 1700yr BP).According to the paleogeographical reconstruction of the coast, the ancient harbor installations stretch along 1600m of coastline. The north harbor is bounded by the north breakwater, the riprap on the once wide sandy coast, the detached west breakwater, and the uplift morphology of the west end of Kolona Hill. On the south coast, the harbor installations comprise the fortified âclosed harborâ with the shipsheds, the commercial harbor, which is entirely destroyed by the modern port, the anchorage area that is bounded by the west breakwater and built of cone-shaped piles of stones, the tops of which once projected above the sea level, and the south curved breakwater at its southernmost boundary.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3asea level 3atransgressive segregation 3aGreece 0aAegina ancient harbor installations 0aSaronic Gulf 0aRelative sea level change 0aSea level stability 0aMarine notches and beachrocks 0aPaleogeographical reconstruction1 aKolaiti, E.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 392 p.411-425dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.09.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01345naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245004500174300001400219520047200233592002800705650001700733650001400750650003100764650002400795650001300819650001400832773011800846856008200964852000901046655001201055IND60620202020221120180524.0181106e196409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062020202DNAL7 a10.1177/0002764264008001052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlafson, Frederick A.10aSome Observations on Area Study Programs  ap. 11-14.  aA philosopher asserts that area specialization is related to the generalizing approach of economics, political science, and sociology, and to the more traditional analyses of history and anthropology.

Hypoxia reduced the uptake of N by the plants, however both at 0.28â0.31 mol Oâ mâ»Â³ (aerated solutions) and 0.003 mol Oâ mâ»Â³, rates of N uptake from solutions containing NOââ» plus NHââº were 34% higher than from solutions containing NOââ» only.

By contrast, at 0.003 mol Oâ mâ»Â³ both N treatments had the same low growth rate (expressed on a dry weight basis) despite considerably higher internal N concentrations in the plants supplied with NOââ» plus NHââº.

It has been shown that when strains are maintained on a modification of the single line breeding system there is an overall frequency of only two per cent of graft rejections with at least six generations between donor and recipient mice. Successful grafts are usually obtained even when donor and recipient mice are separated by as many as fourteen generations. It is suggested that mice not more than two generations from their common ancestor should be used for large scale skin grafting experiments because of the unsuccessful skin transfer between some mice more distantly related. With some mouse strains difficulty of graft healing is apparent, and it has been shown that these results point to a valid difference between the C57 and A strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aancestry 3alaboratory animals 3amice 3askin grafting1 aDinsley, Marjorie0 tLaboratory animals.g1967 Oct., v. 1, no. 2 p.81-90dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1258/0023677677810355853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167300001600267500001900283520157700302592002801879650002601907650001601933650002301949650001601972650002401988650002102012650001402033650001402047650000902061650002102070653001902091653002102110653002102131700001502152700001902167700001702186700001402203773013602217856008102353852000902434655001202443IND60650516820221118225934.0190710e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065051682DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596180007712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeltrÃ¡n, M.

The first experiment took place, in triplicate, on an experimental farm. For each replicate, a crossover design (62 goats, two treatments, ML and LL, in two periods each lasting 4 days) was used. Milk samples were taken daily at 0 and 24 h after milking. In the first experimental replicate, some enzymatic coagulation cheeses were made, which were assessed by a panel of tasters at 50 and 100 days of maturation. In the second experiment, the lipolysis level and composition of tank milk from 55 commercial dairy goat farms (25 ML and 30 LL) were analysed, in milk samples taken in three different weeks. The results of the first experiment showed that ML milking increased free fatty acid (FFA) concentration in raw goat's milk significantly (0.71 v. 0.40 mmol/l, respectively). However, in the milk samples taken from commercial farms the FFA concentration remained unaffected by the milking pipeline height (0.59 v. 0.58 mmol/l for ML and LL, respectively). No significant differences were found in the milk composition, nor in the sensory characteristics in the cured cheeses, which suggests that factors other than the milkline height are able to influence the level of lipolysis under commercial conditions. Therefore, ML milking should not be discouraged, provided that the correct functioning and management of the milking operation and milk storage on the farm is guaranteed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural sciences 3acoagulation 3across-over studies 3adairy goats 3ademonstration farms 3afree fatty acids 3agoat milk 3alipolysis 3amilk 3amilk composition 0amilking system 0amid-line milking 0alow-line milking1 aManzur, A.1 aRodriguez, M.,1 aDÃ­az, J.

The interplay between formality and informality is examined in this article from labor and capital perspectives on formalization approaches. Data was collected by questionnaire survey and semi-structured interview methods and analyzed. Results revealed significant overlap and informality concealed within formality, as well as stakeholder illegal practice in occupational registration and social assistance programs as well as factors affecting short-term cash transfer programs during the Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These findings suggest that 1) The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) should be held accountable for responses caused by its urban transportation network; and 2) government agencies should address institutionalized corruption in the motorcycle taxi trade as an underlying cause of unproductive means-testing in providing social assistance during a pandemic.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aOrthocoronavirinae 3acapital 3alabor 3amotorcycles 3apandemic 3aquestionnaires 3aself-employment 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3atrade 3atransportation 0aMotorcycle taxi drivers 0aFormalization 0aInformality 0aILO recommendation no. 204 0aCOVID-191 aAmornsiriphong, Somsak0 tHeliyon.g2022 Mar., v. 8, no. 3 p.e09061-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e090613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01187naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245006100169300001600230520029700246592002800543650001300571650001200584650002300596650002300619650000900642650000900651700002100660773011200681856008300793852000900876655001200885IND60623890920221122211020.0181203e196710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062389092DNAL7 a10.1258/0023677677810356022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, A.

The kinetics consist of an initial exponential decay (Ï = 2.26 ns) followed by a weak power-law decay (I(t) â tâÂ¹) up to at least 1 ms, both of which depend weakly on temperature. From fluence-dependent PL and ultrafast transient absorption (TA) measurements, we confirm that this emission arises from the recombination of geminate charge-pairs generated through singletâsinglet annihilation. This behavior is a consequence of the donorâacceptor nature of this polymer, which enhances singletâsinglet annihilation and facilitates the formation of long-lived geminate-pairs from energetic singlet states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aambient temperature 3aphotoluminescence 3apolymers1 aKirkpatrick, James1 aHoward, Ian A.1 aJohnson, Kerr1 aWilson, Mark W.

A total of 9456 wild bees were collected and dissected to detect nematodes and 173 female and 22 male bees were positive for an overall association level of 2.1%. Halictus resurgens was the most commonly collected bee found with nematodes with 82 and 19 nematode-infested female and male bees, respectively. Sixty-four of the nematode isolates were recovered from the Black Sea region (32.8%), 59 from Central Anatolia (30.3%), 35 from the Mediterranean (17.9%), 24 from the Aegean (12.3%), six from Eastern Anatolia (3.1%) and seven from Southeast Anatolia (3.6%). In 3.9% of all bees of the family Halictidae (173/4417), nematodes were observed in the Dufour's gland, poison sac, oviduct, bursa copulatrix and abdominal cavity of dissected female bees and from the genital capsule of male bees. Only abdominal glands of 0.6% (21/3279) of female bees from the family Andrenidae were observed with nematodes. Nematodes were isolated from the genital capsule of one male bee from the family Melittidae. The poison sac was the organ where nematodes were most often observed but the highest number of nematodes occurred in the abdominal cavity. Most nematodes were in the dauer juvenile stage making identification difficult. Sequence analysis using LSU D2/D3 domains and a fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) allowed for putative identification of nematode isolates. Two or three species of Bursaphelenchus (B. anatolius, B. debrae, and potentially one or more cryptic species closest in morphology to B. anatolius) were isolated from six different halictid species (two genera; Halictus and Lasioglossum) from different geographical regions in Turkey. An additional four species of diplogastrid were recovered from the abdominal glands of andrenids; a new species of Koerneria from Andrena limata and a separate sister clade to Mononchoides composed of three other possible species from four Andrena species. An additional unknown species in the order Tylenchida (near Allantonematinae) was recovered from three species of Lasioglossum. No molecular data were obtained from three mermithid juveniles from two Andrena and one Halictus species because samples were lost in transit. The associations of most nematode isolates with bees of the families Halictidae and Andrenidae were hypothesised to be phoretic, whereas the tylenchid and mermithids were parasites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrena 3aBursaphelenchus 3aDufour's gland 3aHalictus 3aLasioglossum 3aMelittidae 3aTurkey (country) 3aabdominal cavity 3abees 3acryptic species 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afemales 3ajuveniles 3amales 3amitochondria 3anematology 3anew species 3aoviducts 3asequence analysis 3aBlack Sea 0aHALICTIDAE 0aPARASITIC NEMATODES 0aMTCOI 0aPHORESIS 0aD2/D3 LSU 0aDIPLOGASTRIDAE 0aANDRENIDAE1 aGiblin-Davis, Robin1 aKeskin, Nevin1 aYe, Weimin1 aHazir, Canan1 aScheuhl, Erwin1 aThomas, W.

Specifically, we study photovoltaic devices made from 1:1 blends of the polyfluorene copolymers poly(9,9â²-dioctylfluorene-co-bis-N,Nâ²-(4-butylphenyl)-bis-N,Nâ²-phenyl-1,4-phenylene-diamine) (PFB) and poly(9,9â²-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT). We photooxidize these films in situ using 365, 405, and 455 nm illumination under ambient conditions, with the wavelengths chosen to preferentially excite the different components. During photooxidation, we observe a faster loss of photocurrent generation from F8BT-rich domains, leaving the PFB-rich phases to show higher photoresponse even at wavelengths absorbed predominantly by F8BT. We propose that this effect is due to the more rapid degradation of PFB hole-transport pathways in the F8BT-rich regions, resulting in a loss of percolation pathways for hole transport in the F8BT-rich phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrostatic interactions 3alighting 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3aphotooxidation 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aphysical chemistry 3awavelengths1 aRayermann, Glennis E.1 aSmith, Eric M.1 aGinger, David S.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Apr. 25, v. 117, no. 16 p.4654-4660dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp30908433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04230naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245019700174300001600371500001900387500002000406520229100426592002802717650003302745650001602778650002402794650002002818650001102838650001902849650001702868650001502885650001802900650001402918650001302932650001202945650001502957650001102972650001302983650000802996650001503004650001203019650002303031650001403054650001503068650001803083650001703101650002503118650001503143650001003158651001403168700002103182700001603203700001303219700001703232700001503249700001903264700001603283700001903299700002103318773011803339856009003457852000903547655001203556IND60734305820221121144156.0210417e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073430582DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1989.tb00691.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGRIFFITHS, H.10aEcophysiology of xerophytic and halophytic vegetation of a coastal alluvial plain in northern Venezuela: IV.

The epiphytic bromeliad, Tillandsia flexuosa has waterâretaining tanks and leaf trichomes, and propagates mainly vegetatively to produce large populations in the shrubby island vegetation. The epiphytic orchid, Schomburgkia humboldtiana formed smaller populations, and had large succulent leaves with uniform chlorenchyma and no distinct waterâstorage parenchyma, unlike T. flexuosa. Both epiphytes were myrmecophilous. Leaf succulence (kg mâ»Â²) declined by â¼ 10% in the dry season for both plants. Both epiphytes showed reduced COâ uptake during Phase I (dark period) and (dawnâdusk) titratable acidity (ÎHâº) in the dry season. Waterâuse efficiency (WUE) was higher for S. humboldtiana (16.0 Ã 10â»Â³ mol COÂ² per mol HÂ²O compared with 5.0 Ã 10 â»Â³ for T. flexuosa) although WUE remained constant during rainy and dry season for each species. Sixty to seventy per cent of the dawn dusk titratable acidity was derived internally from respiratory COâ (recycling) for both species, and in absolute terms, recycling decreased in the dry season, in contrast to the expected progression under drought stress. Recycling is an important facet of carbon balance for both species in both rainy and dry seasons. Leaf Naâº concentration was higher than values quoted for terrestrial salt stressed CAM plants. Fructose and glucose declined in leaf bases of T. flexuosa during the dark period, but not in the more distal regions of the leaf. S. humboldtiana showed a decrease in sucrose at night, and mannitol was also an important constituent of the leaves. Xylem sap tension maxima increased from 0.38 Â± 0.09 MPa (rainy season) to only 0.55 Â± 0.06 MPa (dry season) for T. flexuosa, these values being much lower than those found for terrestrial shrubs and herbs at the same site, the two epiphytes use CAM in conjunction with differing morphological adaptations to maintain growth throughout the year at the CiÃ©nega el Ostional, but it would seem that T. flexuosa has better physiological characteristics for maintenance of carbon acquisition during the dry season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassulacean acid metabolism 3aOrchidaceae 3aTillandsia flexuosa 3aalluvial plains 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorenchyma 3adry season 3aecophysiology 3aepiphytes 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahalophytes 3aleaves 3amannitol 3asap 3ascotophase 3asucrose 3atitratable acidity 3atrichomes 3avegetation 3awater storage 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3awet season 3axylem 3aVenezuela1 aSmith, J.

In addition, cultures are susceptible to productivity loss, or crash, through grazing by contaminating zooplankton such as protozoa, rotifers and copepods. Productivity loss and product contamination are also caused by otherwise innocuous invading phytoplankton that consume resources in competition with the species being cultured.

Therefore, it is imperative to explore new and high effective fungicides. Constructing nanoscale fungicides using nanomaterial and nanotechnology has attracted wide attention in recent years. RESULTS: In this research, a pyraclostrobin solid nanodispersion (PSND) was prepared using the selfâemulsifying method. The solid nanodispersion had a mean particle size of 20ânm and a zeta potential of â29.3Â mV. The solubility and dissolution rate of the PSND increased owing to the decrease in particle size and the actions of the surfactants. The contact angle and retention volumes of the PSND on cucumber and cabbage leaf surfaces were greater than those of the commercial water dispersible granule. In addition, the median lethal concentration against Fusarium oxysporum was 0.7Â 43âÂµgâmLâ»Â¹. The toxicity of the nanoparticles was 4.5 times that of the water dispersible granule (WDG). The high fungicidal activity of PSND promoted the production of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). The activity levels of the antioxidant enzymes containing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) decreased in F. oxysporum. CONCLUSION: The research introduced a new method for preparing insoluble pyraclostrobin solid nanoformulation for fungicides to enhance the fungicidal activity and reduce environmental pollution.

Mn oxides are among major candidates to be used as water-oxidizing catalysts. Herein, we used two straightforward and promising methods to form Escherichia coli bacteria/Mn oxide compounds. In one of the methods, the bacteria template was intact after the reaction. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction spectrometry. Electrochemical properties of the catalysts were studied, and attributed redox potentials were assigned. The water oxidation of the compounds was examined under electrochemical condition. Linear sweep voltammetry showed that the onsets of water oxidation in our experimental condition for bacteria and Escherichia coli bacteria/Mn oxide were 1.68 and 1.56Â V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively. Thus, the presence of Mn oxide in the catalyst significantly decreased (~â120Â mV) the overpotential needed for water oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalgae 3abacteria 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen 3amanganese 3amanganese oxides 3aoxidation 3aredox potential 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aMoghaddam, NavidJameei1 aHassani, Leila1 aBagheri, Robabeh1 aSong, Zhenlun1 aAllakhverdiev, SuleymanI.0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2018 May, v. 136, no. 2 p.257-267dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32702x0166-85957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-018-0499-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245012900163500001900292520207100311592002802382650001002410650002402420650001302444650001102457650000902468650002402477650000902501650001702510650001202527653000702539653000702546653001202553653001502565653003102580653001402611653002302625700001402648700001802662700001602680700001602696700001502712773010802727856008402835852000902919655001202928IND60700075420221119161634.0200819e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070007542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2020.1047142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuan, Xin10aSoil erosion and deposition characteristics of slope surfaces for two loess soils using indoor simulated rainfall experiment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSediment deposition is an important part of the erosion process. Slope and soil type affect the spatial distribution of erosionâdeposition; however, little is known about where erosion and deposition occur specifically and how they interact with influencing factors. To address this issue, four rainfall simulation experiments were conducted in a 1âmâÃâ5âm plot with varying slopes (i.e., 5Â°, 10Â°, 15Â°, and 20Â°) and simulated rainfall for 1âh at a rate of 60âmm hâ»Â¹. For the two soils, the runoff rate and sediment concentration were correlated with a similar temporal pattern. Runoff increased gradually and ultimately approached a steady state, and the sediment concentration decreased gradually and ultimately approached a steady state, which indicated that the erosion processes of the two soils were controlled by the detachment-limited condition. The sediment concentration and erosion rate were positively correlated with slope. However, the onset of runoff was delayed for AS soil, which also had a relatively high sediment concentration. The distribution range and area of deposition for the two soils were negatively correlated with the slope gradient, and the main deposition area occurred at the bottom of the plots. In contrast, the SD soil was more susceptible to deposition, and the deposition thickness was mainly concentrated within a 0â4âmm depth; this concentration was not observed for AS soil because of its high erosion intensity. Overall, this similarity also existed in the spatial variations of silt and fine sand contents in the soil surface. The silt and fine sand-sized particles were the primary eroded particle sizes; however, selective mechanisms of these two particle sizes were obviously different in the two soils. The results indicated that the erosionâdeposition characteristics and the main eroded materials differed with varying erosion intensities and soil types. These findings are essential for a more comprehensive understanding of soil erosion mechanisms under conditions without rill formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aloess 3arainfall simulation 3aresearch 3arunoff 3asand 3asediment deposition 3asilt 3asoil erosion 3atillage 0aAS 0aSD 0aErosion 0aDeposition 0aTerrestrial laser scanning 0aRoughness 0aSediment particles1 aHe, Jijun1 aCai, Qiangguo1 aSun, Liying1 aLi, Xueqing1 aWang, Shuo0 tSoil & tillage research.g2020 Oct., v. 204 p.104714-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.1047143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009700164500001900261520132000280592002801600650001401628650001301642650001801655650001201673650001401685650001801699653002301717653002901740653002401769653002001793653002901813700001801842700001701860700001701877700001601894700001801910700002101928773010201949856008602051852000902137655001202146IND60720568620221120090925.0210124e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072056862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1065412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Di10aEffect of sucrose ester S370 on interfacial layers and fat crystals network of whipped cream  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effect of sucrose ester S370 on the interfacial layers and fat crystals network of whipped cream has been studied in this work. The addition of S370 showed a little effect on the droplets size, interfacial protein concentration and viscosity of emulsion samples before whipping. However, the addition of S370, as a heterogeneous nucleating agent, could induce nucleation and lead to the formation of more small crystals in the bulk mixture and emulsions. These small crystals, which were not able to pierce the interface of fat droplets effectively, would retard fat coalescence during whipping process. The addition of S370 resulted in lower degree of fat coalescence, lower interfacial protein concentration, shorter optimum whipping time (tââ) and lower overrun of whipped cream. At lower S370 concentration (<0.05Â wt%), large-size crystals and inhomogeneous fat crystals network led to lower firmness and less bubbles stability of whipped cream samples. At 0.05Â wt% S370 concentration, homogeneous crystals network, resulted in whipped cream with high firmness and bubbles stability. However, lower interfacial protein concentration and small-size crystals were observed at higher concentration of S370 (>0.05Â wt%). As a result, the aerated structure was not strong enough to stabilize whipped cream.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemulsions 3afirmness 3ahydrocolloids 3asucrose 3aviscosity 3awhipped cream 0aSucrose ester S370 0aEmulsion characteristics 0aFat crystallization 0aFat coalescence 0aWhipped cream properties1 aCai, Yongjian1 aLiu, Tongxun1 aHuang, Lihua1 aLiu, Pingli1 aZhao, Mouming1 aZhao, Qiangzhong0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2021 Apr., v. 113 p.106541-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1065413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011300167300001600280520130200296592002801598650001501626650001101641650001101652650001201663650001401675650001901689650002601708650001101734650001301745650002301758650001901781650001501800650002301815650002401838651001001862700001701872700001301889700001801902700001701920700001801937773009901955856008402054852000902138655001202147IND60123179320221121191206.0150325e20140703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012317932DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2014.9606102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiuzhi10aRetrieving Chinaâs surface soil moisture and land surface temperature using AMSR-E brightness temperatures  ap. 662-671.  aBased on the passive microwave radiative transfer equation, we developed a single-band model for retrieving surface soil moisture () and land surface temperature () using Aqua satellite advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR-E) C-band brightness temperatures () without any ancillary data.

In particular, most and estimation errors are under 0.37Â gÂ cm â»Â³ and 2.00K, respectively, for regions with the microwave polarization difference index (MPDI) between 0.01 and 0.05, but increased clearly larger for those with MPDI smaller than 0.01 or larger than 0.05, which are mostly dense-vegetated regions in Southwestern China or plateaus and dry deserts such as Inner Mongolia plateau, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Taklimakan Desert and Turpan basin. In summary, the proposed retrieval algorithm might provide a new way to monitor and conditions for penetrable vegetation canopy regions, but further investigations are still needed, especially for specific plateau, desert and frozen regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abasins 3acanopy 3adeserts 3aequations 3aimage analysis 3amicrowave radiometers 3amodels 3aplateaus 3aradiative transfer 3aremote sensing 3asoil water 3aspectroradiometers 3asurface temperature 3aChina1 aSu, Yongxian1 aLi, Yong1 aHan, Liusheng1 aLiao, Jishan1 aYang, Shenbin0 tRemote sensing letters.g2014 July 3, v. 5, no. 7 p.662-671dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2014.9606103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03952naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008700167520271100254592002802965650001902993650001003012650002203022650001003044650001003054650001703064650001003081650001103091650000803102650001303110650001503123650002003138650001303158650002403171650001403195700001603209700001603225700002103241700001603262700001603278773012003294856008303414852000903497655001203506IND60738556620221120075707.0220326e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073855662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1034702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacNicol, J.L.10a7 The use of in vitro fermentation methods to simulate an equine cecal environment  aThe equine gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is intimately related to the health and well-being of the horse. However, access to more proximal portions of the GIT, such as the cecum, are challenging in live horses. Surgical techniques which enable in vivo cecal sampling, such as cannulation, are difficult to perform and maintenance can be problematic. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in the microbiome of cecal inoculum maintained in an anaerobe chamber or a chemostat, and of a fecal slurry maintained in an anaerobe chamber over 48h. Cecal and fecal samples were collected immediately upon death from an abattoir in QC CAN. Cecal and fecal material were transported on ice, anaerobically to the University of Guelph where 500mL of cecal fluid was used to inoculate a chemostat vessel (ch_c, nâ¯=â¯11) or 100mL was transferred to a vessel in an anaerobe chamber (an_c, nâ¯=â¯15). One hundred ml of 5% fecal slurry in sterile PBS was also maintained in an anaerobe chamber (an_f, nâ¯=â¯6). Sampling was performed at the time of vessel establishment (0h), after 24h and 48h of fermentation. Sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed on an Illumina MiSeq. Bioinformatics analysis was run using mothur software. Measures of population richness (Chao1), evenness (Shannon Evenness), and diversity (Inverse Simpson) were analyzed between methods and over time using a repeated measures ANOVA in SAS 9.4. Measures of community membership (Jaccard) and structure (Bray-Curtis) were visualized using PCoA. No overall differences were noted between the systems with regards to measures of Î± diversity (P > 0.05). However, richness changed in an_c over time (0h vs 24h and 48h, P < 0.05), and diversity as well as evenness changed in an_f over time (0h vs 24h and 48h, P < 0.05). Visual assessment of PCoA revealed a clustering of an_f samples. No clustering of an_c or ch_c samples was evident. The microbiome of cecal inoculum maintained in a chemostat vessel remains consistent over 48h based on measurements of Î± diversity. The microbiome of cecal inoculum maintained in an anaerobe chamber is also reasonably consistent over this time period. The microbiome of fecal inoculum maintained anaerobically shifts over 48h and fecal inoculum creates an inconsistent environment over time for in vitro use. It appears that the use of cecal inoculum in either a chemostat vessel, or if unavailable, an anaerobe chamber, will provide a stable community over 48h with respect to the composition of the microbiome for in vitro applications. Additional measures of microbe viability, as well as activity are required to accurately judge the stability of these environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3acecum 3acomputer software 3adeath 3afeces 3afermentation 3agenes 3ahorses 3aice 3ainoculum 3amicrobiome 3aslaughterhouses 3aslurries 3aveterinary medicine 3aviability1 aRenwick, S.1 aGanobis, C.1 aAllen-Vercoe, E.1 aWeese, J.S.1 aPearson, W.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2021 May, v. 100 p.103470-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1034703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010000166300002000266500001900286520194700305592002802252596010702280596005902387596004202446650001302488650000802501650002502509650002102534650002202555650001802577650001302595650001102608650001302619700001702632700001602649700001502665700001602680700001702696700001502713700005202728773015502780856008302935852000903018655001203027IND60700708220221119015925.0210716e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070070822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-06315-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xinshan10aMicro-aeration with hollow fiber membrane enhanced the nitrogen removal in constructed wetlands  ap. 25877-25885.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe nitrogen removal efficiency in constructed wetlands (CWs) was largely affected by the dissolved oxygen (DO). In this study, micro-aeration with different numbers of hollow fiber membrane modules (HFMEs) was adopted to increase the oxygen availability and improve the nitrogen removal efficiency in CWs under different air temperatures and different hydraulic retention time (HRT). Compared to the plant oxygen release (ROL) of wetland plants and traditional mechanical aeration, HFME increased the oxygen availability and enhanced the nitrogen removal efficiency in CWs. The COD and NHââºâN removal efficiencies increased with the increase of the HMFE. TN removal efficiency was increased by 8~16% after the application of HFME in CWs in the high-temperature stage. However, less HFME in CW-M1 realized the highest TN removal efficiency in low- and medium-temperature stages. At low temperature after 4-day HRT, the DO concentration respectively reached 6.25 mg Lâ»Â¹ and 3.25 mg Lâ»Â¹ in the upper zone and the bottom of CW-M1. The TN removal efficiencies in the upper zone of CW-M1 (60.69%) and the bottom of CW-M1 (64.98%) were all significantly higher than those in the upper zone of CK (35.98%) and the bottom of CK (39.9%). In addition, the microbial biomass and community analyses revealed that CW-M1 showed the most nitrifying bacteria and the best metabolic activity of bacteria. HEMF in CW-M1 also increased the nitrifying capacity from 0.12 to 0.46 mg kgâ»Â¹ hâ»Â¹. The application of HFME in CWs accelerated the nitrification process by enhancing nitrifying bacteria and less HFME realized the highest TN removal efficiency through nitrification-denitrification processes. Graphical abstract The application of hollow fiber membrane modules in CWs enhanced the pollutantsÂ (TN and COD)Â removal efficiencyÂ inÂ the process of biologicalÂ nitrification-denitrification andÂ increased the number of nitrifying bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data  a2232019D3-21, 2232018D3-22, 2232015DZ1-01cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a2018M641894cthe China Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a19YF1401900cShanghai Sailing Program 3aaeration 3aair 3abiochemical pathways 3adissolved oxygen 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aresearch1 aZhao, Yufeng1 aWang, Yuhui1 aSi, Zhihao1 aGe, Xiaoyan1 aGong, Zhijie1 aZhou, Juan1 aCao, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9516-82220 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2020 July, v. 27, no. 21 p.25877-25885dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06315-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245015900175300001600334520098200350592002801332650002401360650001901384650003001403650001301433650001601446650002101462650001301483650001401496650001301510650001801523650001701541650001101558650000901569650001201578650001101590650001301601650000901614650001101623653002701634653001301661653001001674653001401684653003001698700002101728700002001749700002601769700001701795773010601812856008701918852000902005655001202014IND60566530420221121130144.0190409e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056653042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsakas, Leonidas10aAcetate-detoxification of wood hydrolysates with alkali tolerant Bacillus sp. as a strategy to enhance the lipid production from Rhodosporidium toruloides  ap. 287-294.  aThe aim of the current work was to convert an acetate-rich hemicellulose liquid fraction (LF) from hot-water extraction of Betula pendula to oils for biodiesel, with Rhodosporidium toruloides. The toxicity of acetate was circumvented by biological detoxification with an isolated alkali-tolerant and acetate-resistant Bacillus sp. strain. Removal of other lignocellulose-derived inhibitors, such as furfural and phenols, was evaluated by two strategies; an activated carbon (AC) treatment of the undiluted LF, and dilution of the LF by 25% (0.75LF) and 50%. (0.50LF). The bacterium consumed most of the acetic acid in 6â8days in the treated or diluted media, which were subsequently used for cultivation of the yeast, for conversion of sugars to oils. The oil concentration reached 2.8 and 1.8g/L, in the AC LF and 0.75LF medium, respectively. In comparison, the oil accumulation in the same media without prior cultivation of Bacillus sp. was 0.86 and 0.03g/L, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aBetula pendula 3aRhodosporidium toruloides 3aacetates 3aacetic acid 3aactivated carbon 3abacteria 3abiodiesel 3afurfural 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysates 3alipids 3aoils 3aphenols 3asugars 3atoxicity 3awood 3ayeasts 0aAcetate detoxification 0aBacillus 0aBirch 0aBiodiesel 0aRhodosporidium toruloides1 aNovak, Katharina1 aEnman, Josefine1 aChristakopoulos, Paul1 aRova, Ulrika0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Oct., v. 242 p.287-294dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015500163300001400318520121800332592002801550650002901578650002301607650002501630650001201655650002301667650002501690650002301715650000701738650002601745650002101771700001601792700001701808773009501825856008101920990002302001852000902024655001202033IND60093117020221120110851.0141103e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009311702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.09.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yunqin10aEthanol production from pulp & paper sludge and monosodium glutamate waste liquor by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation in batch condition  ap. 31-37.  aThis work examined the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process for the biological conversion of pulp & paper sludge (PPS) and monosodium glutamate waste liquor (MGWL) into ethanol using Saccharomyces cerevisiae CICC 1001 in batch condition.

To address this, we developed acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) inhibitor herbicide tolerance in faba bean using mutagenesis techniques. Doseâresponse experiments, agronomic field evaluation and DNA sequencing of the AHAS gene were used to quantify and validate tolerance traits. RESULTS: Four Mâ faba bean singleâplant biotypes (IMIâ1, IMIâ2, IMIâ3 and IMIâ4) at a frequency of 3.63âÃâ10â»â¶ were successfully recovered. Molecular characterisation of the AHAS gene identified two known target site mutations (resulting in protein substitutions Ala205Val and Ser653Asn) conferring tolerance. Phenotypic characterisation found that both mutations conferred high levels of tolerance to the imidazolinone herbicide imazapyr. However, although the Ala205Val substitution showed improved levels of crossâtolerance to a range of sulfonylurea chemistries, the Ser653Asn substitution did not. In the field, IMIâ3 showed the highest level of agronomic tolerance across a range of imidazolinone herbicides. CONCLUSIONS: Mutagenesis techniques were successful in the development of tolerance to AHAS inhibitor herbicides in faba bean, and could facilitate the first safe inâcrop broadleaf herbicide control option in Australian faba bean production.

The coreâshell nanoparticles are excited with single wavelength 280 nm UV light, in which the energy transfer from [VOâ]Â³â» groups to LnÂ³âº ions occurs to produce bright white light. The absolute quantum yields of LaVOâ:TmÂ³âº/TbÂ³âº/EuÂ³âº (Type 1) and LaVOâ:TmÂ³âº/DyÂ³âº (Type 2) coreâshell nanoparticles have been estimated as 5% and 7% respectively. The control core nanoparticles doped with all the lanthanide ions did not produce white light which proves the need of a coreâshell structure.

Fem1b and FEM-1 proteins each contain a VHL-box motif that mediates their interaction with certain E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. In C. elegans, FEM-1 negatively regulates the transcription factor TRA-1, and functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate recognition subunit to target TRA-1 for ubiquitylation. TRA-1 is homologous to the mammalian Gli1 protein, a transcription factor that mediates Hedgehog signaling as well as having Hedgehog-independent functions. Whether the interaction between nematode FEM-1 and TRA-1 proteins is conserved, between corresponding mammalian homologs, has not been reported. Herein, we show that Fem1b interacts with Gli1 within cells, and directly binds Gli1. Fem1b also promotes ubiquitylation of Gli1, suppresses transcriptional activation by Gli1, and attenuates an oncogenic Gli1 autoregulatory loop in cancer cells, all dependent on the VHL-box of Fem1b. These findings have implications for understanding the cellular functions of Fem1b, and the regulation of Gli1 oncoprotein activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3agenes 3amammals 3aneoplasm cells 3aoncogene proteins 3asex determination 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 0aFem1b 0aFEM-1 0aGli1 0aTRA-1 0aTranscription 0aUbiquitin1 aChen, Yong-Bin1 aJackson, Ramon J.1 aJiang, Jin1 aMaher, Joseph F.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Oct. 25, v. 440 p.431-436dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008700164300001600251520211500267592002802382650001502410650001602425650001502441650001002456650001102466650001802477650001202495650001902507650002002526650001102546650004302557650001902600650001502619650001602634650001902650650001702669651001002686700001802696773009902714856008402813852000902897655001202906IND60123179920221121144817.0150325e20140803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012317992DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2014.9637342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Su14aThe potential of the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index for crop yield prediction  ap. 733-742.  aRegional and global prediction of crop yield by remote sensing is of vital importance for food security in China. Vegetation indices (VIs) sensitive to leaf area index (LAI), such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), have been widely used for crop yield prediction. However, chlorophyll content is the key component for crops to convert light energy to organics in the process of photosynthesis, and crop yield may be more accurately predicted by remote sensing models based on a spectral index sensitive to chlorophyll content, such as the medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI). In this study, we investigated the potential of MTCI for crop yield prediction. Firstly, the MTCI and the NDVI products in Henan Province, China, from 2003 to 2011 with a temporal resolution of half a month were calculated from the daily level-2 reduced resolution ENVISAT MERIS reflectance product (MER_RR_2P) using a Maximum Value Composite algorithm. Secondly, we established winter wheat prediction models based on MTCI and NDVI. Then, the accuracy of MTCI for winter wheat yield prediction was examined and compared to the NDVI through a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. The results show that (1) the correlation coefficient between yield and MTCI is significantly higher than that of models based on NDVI and the errors of models based on MTCI are lower than those of models based on NDVI except for milking stages. Moreover, the crop yield prediction model based on accumulated MTCI through the reviving stage to milking is most significantly correlated to crop yield with a coefficient of determination of 0.849 for MTCI; (2) the optimum phase for crop yield prediction based on MTCI is the heading stage, about 30Â days earlier than that of NDVI (milking stage), which is another advantage of MTCI in crop yield prediction; and (3) the validation error of the crop yield model based on the accumulated MTCI is half of that based on the accumulated NDVI. The study indicates that MTCI is potentially a better VI for crop yield prediction compared to NDVI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achlorophyll 3acrop yield 3acrops 3aenergy 3afood security 3aheading 3aimage analysis 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphotosynthesis 3aprediction 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3awinter wheat 3aChina1 aLiu, Liangyun0 tRemote sensing letters.g2014 Aug. 3, v. 5, no. 8 p.733-742dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2014.9637343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245008900190300001800279520113500297592002801432650001901460650001601479650002301495650001501518650001701533650001901550650002101569650001901590650001901609650001401628650003001642650001201672650001201684650001701696650002101713650002401734650002201758650002301780650001001803700003001813773009101843856008401934852000902018655001202027IND60088255520221116184601.0141102e20120315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008825552DNAL7 a221969522pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2011.11.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHjorth, Maibritt10aPolymer flocculation mechanism in animal slurry established by charge neutralization  ap. 1045-1051.  aFlocculation and filtration of animal manure is practically and environmentally beneficial. However, the flocculation mechanism in manure need to be clarified to use the technique efficiently rather than relying on trial-and-error. Manures were flocculated with polyacrylamides. Floc size, dewaterability, dry matter and turbidity were measured. At optimal polymer volume, the charge neutralization was determined, i.e. amount of negative manure particle charge neutralized by positive polymer charge. The optimal cationic polymer properties were linear and very high molecular weight, which caused efficient particle catching. And it had medium charge density, which caused efficient particle attachment. The required charge neutralization was 5â23% (15% for the optimal polymer). Polymer bridging proved the dominant flocculation mechanism; patch flocculation may be slightly significant for some polymers, while coagulation proved insignificant. Manureâs high ionic strength, high dry matter content and highly charged small molecules caused bridging to be more dominant in manure than in other typically flocculated media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3acoagulation 3adry matter content 3afiltration 3aflocculation 3aionic strength 3amolecular weight 3aneutralization 3apolyacrylamide 3aturbidity 2aAcrylic Resinsxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aCations 2aFlocculation 2aManurexanalysis 2aPolymersxchemistry 2aSewagexchemistry 2aSurface Properties 2aWater1 aJÃ¸rgensen, Bodil Ulbjerg0 tWater research.g2012 Mar. 15, v. 46, no. 4 p.1045-1051dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2011.11.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100006300137245009600200300001800296500002000314520144500334592002801779650001901807650001901826650002201845650001501867650003101882650001501913650001601928650000901944650002001953650001401973650002101987700002202008773012602030856007102156852000902227655001202236IND60666239820221119153600.0190916e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066623982DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.54942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Helen M.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5137-521410aAre honeybees suitable surrogates for use in pesticide risk assessment for nonâApis bees?  ap. 2549-2557.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHistorically, bee regulatory risk assessment for pesticides has centred on the European honeybee (Apis mellifera), primarily due to its availability and adaptability to laboratory conditions. Recently, there have been efforts to develop a battery of laboratory toxicity tests for a range of nonâApis bee species to directly assess the risk to them. However, it is not clear whether the substantial investment associated with the development and implementation of such routine screening will actually improve the level of protection of nonâApis bees. We argue, using published acute toxicity data from a range of bee species and standard regulatory exposure scenarios, that current firstâtier honeybee acute risk assessment schemes utilised by regulatory authorities are protective of other bee species and further tests should be conducted only in cases of concern. We propose similar analysis of alternative exposure scenarios (chronic and developmental) once reliable data for nonâApis bees are available to expand our approach to these scenarios. In addition, we propose that in silico (simulation) approaches can then be used to address populationâlevel effects in more fieldârealistic scenarios. Such an approach could lead to a protective, but also workable, risk assessment for nonâApis species while contributing to pollination security in agricultural landscapes around the globe.

The cellulase was immobilized on two nanomatrices i.e. magnetic and silica nanoparticles with immobilization efficiency of 85% and 76% respectively. The nanobioconjugates exhibited increase in Vmax, temperature optimum, pH and thermal stability as compared with free enzyme. These could be efficiently reused for five repeated cycles and were stable in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazoliumacetate [EMIM][Ac], an ionic liquid. Ionic liquids (IL) are used as green solvents to dissolve lignocellulosic biomass and facilitate better saccharification. The cellulase immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles was used for in situ saccharification of [EMIM][Ac] pretreated sugarcane bagasse and wheat straw for two cycles. The structural deconstruction and decrease in biomass crystallinity was confirmed by SEM, XRD and FTIR. The high hydrolysis yields (â¼89%) obtained in this one-pot process coupled with IL stability and recycled use of immobilized cellulase, potentiates its usefulness in biorefineries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aTrichoderma reesei 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3ahydrolysis 3aionic liquids 3alignocellulose 3ananoparticles 3apH 3asaccharification 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asugarcane bagasse 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3awheat straw 0aCellulase 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aSilica nanoparticles 0aBiomass pretreatment 0aIonic liquids 0aSaccharification1 aAá¸¥mad, RazÌ¤Ä«,1 aKhare, S.K.0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Oct., v. 242 p.236-243dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01879naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245011100172300001300283500001400296520068900310592002800999650001701027650001601044650001701060650001601077653002001093653001101113653001501124653001101139653001601150653001801166653001901184700002701203700002501230700001801255773009301273856008101366961001301447852000901460655001201469IND60698852520221121224756.0210116e20150122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069885252DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.475.88272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezende, JosÃ© Marcos10aNew species of Daidalotarsonemus and Excelsotarsonemus (Acari, Tarsonemidae) from the Brazilian rainforest  ap. 1-36.  aNAL-light  aThree new species of Tarsonemidae, Daidalotarsonemus oliveirai Rezende, Lofego & Ochoa, sp. n., Excelsotarsonemus caravelis Rezende, Lofego & Ochoa, sp. n. and Excelsotarsonemus tupi Rezende, Lofego & Ochoa, sp. n. are described and illustrated.

In practice, many veterinarians recommend a direct fed microbial (DFM) along with AB as DFM have been shown to mitigate some of the effects of AB on fecal microbiota. However, many commercially available DFM supplements also contain prebiotics, and there is little research on these microbial support supplements during AB administration. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of Biome Fix (NutraWorks Equine) during AB treatment on fecal microbiome. Biome Fix is a blend of prebiotics (MOS, FOS, and Asperigullus niger extract), DigestaWellÂ® Buffer (Probiotech International, Inc.), and DigestaWellÂ® Fiber (Probiotech International, Inc.). Both DigestaWellÂ® Buffer and Fiber have been previously shown to buffer fecal pH through reduced lactate production, and improve fiber digestibility in horses, respectively. Horses (nâ¯=â¯16) were assigned (blocked by age, sex, and BCS) to either Control (C:no supplement) or Biome Fix (BF:480g/d) for the 27d trial period. At d 0, all horses received AB (trimethoprim plus sulfadizine tablets (Uniprim) at 30mg/kg/d) for 7d. Fecal samples were collected at d 0, 7, 21, and 27. After DNA extraction from samples, the V3âV4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and amplicons were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Sequence analysis was conducted in QIIME 2, taxonomy was assigned against the SILVA database, and pair-wise t-tests were used to determine differences. Between d 0 and 27 in BF, there was an increase in Clostridium butyricum, a butyrate producer (Pâ¯=â¯0.037), Anaerovibrio sp., a lipid degrader (Pâ¯=â¯0.02), and 3 groups of Ruminococcaceae involved in fiber digestion (P < 0.02), and a decrease in Treponema (Pâ¯=â¯0.02). Four groups associated with obesity in human and animal gut microbiomes were significantly lower in BF than C at d 27: Rikenellaceae RC9 (Pâ¯=â¯0.009), Eubacterium spp. (Pâ¯=â¯0.044), Clostridiales Family XIII AD3011 (Pâ¯=â¯0.04), and Lachnospiraceae UCG-009 (Pâ¯=â¯0.04). No common pathogens (Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, or Clostridium perfringens) were detected in either group or time point. Due to the role of butyrate in intestinal health, an increase in butyrate producers may strengthen intestinal integrity during AB challenge. The increase in strains involved in fiber and lipid digestion may indicate improved digestibility and a greater capacity for resilience in the face of AB challenge; however, more research is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaerovibrio 3aClostridium butyricum 3aClostridium perfringens 3aEscherichia coli 3aLachnospiraceae 3aRuminococcaceae 3aSalmonella 3aTreponema 3aantibiotics 3abutyrates 3adatabases 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3aecosystems 3agenes 3ahindgut 3ahorses 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3alactic acid 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3amicrobiome 3aobesity 3apH 3aprebiotics 3asequence analysis 3at-test 3ataxonomy 3atrimethoprim 3aveterinary medicine1 aSplan, R.K.1 aBiddle, A.S.1 aGirard, I.D.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2021 May, v. 100 p.103476-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1034763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008100167300001600248520173700264592002802001650001202029650001402041650001402055650002502069650001502094650001002109650001402119650001402133650001102147650001602158650002202174700002002196700001602216700001902232700001902251773009702270856008102367990002302448852000902471655001202480IND60093117420221117180528.0141103e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009311742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Choong-Kil10aEffect of ZrOâ addition on de-NOx performance of Cu-ZSM-5 for SCR catalyst  ap. 331-340.  aThe aim of the present study is to investigate the de-NOx performance of a Cu-ZSM-5 catalyst to which ZrOâ additives are added to improve the low-temperature activity and durability of the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst for diesel vehicles. The main experimental parameters are the amount of ZrOâ added, hydrothermal aging temperature, type of hydrocarbon (HC) and concentration of sulfur (S). The results showed that the NOx conversion of the Cu-ZSM-5-ZrOâ (2wt%) catalyst was improved by 10â20% compared to that of the Cu-ZSM-5 or Fe-zeolite catalyst in the temperature range of 200â300Â°C, because the addition of an appropriate amount of ZrOâ additive can improve the activation of the Cu-ZSM-5-ZrOâ (2wt%) catalyst by enhancing the acidity of the SCR catalyst. The Cu-ZSM-5-ZrOâ (2wt%) catalyst was the (most?) resistant against hydrothermal aging, (because the?) ZrOâ additives can advance the activation of the Cu-ZSM-5 catalyst by promoting its thermal stability. Alkenes such as propylene (CâHâ) containing a double bond in the reaction gases had a more negative effect on the de-NOx performance of the Cu-ZSM-5 catalysts than other hydrocarbons. The curve of the de-NOx performance of the Cu-ZSM-5 catalysts in the presence of CâHâ decreased rapidly in the range of 200â350Â°C and then increased again to form an M-shaped curve due to the blocking of the SCR reaction. Although the recovery rate of the de-NOx performance for Cu-ZSM-5-ZrOâ (2wt%) from sulfur poisoning was not reversible, it was higher than those of the Cu-ZSM-5-ZrOâ (0 and 4wt%) catalysts, because it contained the proper amount of ZrOâ. The proper amount of ZrOâ for the Cu-ZSM-5 SCR catalyst was 2wt%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aadditives 3acatalysts 3achemical engineering 3adurability 3agases 3apoisoning 3apropylene 3asulfur 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aChoi, Byungchul1 aKim, Hwanam1 aLee, Chun-Hwan1 aLee, Chun-Beom0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 May 15, v. 191 p.331-340dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.03.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245007800169520097300247592002801220650002001248650001101268650002001279650001901299650001401318650002401332650002501356651001901381653001101400653002301411653001001434653002301444653001101467653001701478700002801495700001701523700002201540700001601562700001401578700002001592700002201612700001601634700001501650700002601665773011501691856008801806852000901894655001201903IND60700076120221119160343.0200824e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070007612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.1050622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCallaby, R.10aReflections on IDEAL: What we have learnt from a unique calf cohort study  aThe year 2020 marks a decade since the final visit was made in the âInfectious Diseases of East African Livestockâ (IDEAL) project.

Culture media was analyzed for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), prostaglandin eâ (PGE2), nitric oxide (NO), proteoglycan content, interleukin-6 and 8 (IL-6, 8), and growth-related oncogene (GRO). Data were analyzed utilizing a one-way ANOVA in SAS 9.4. Data are presented in the table below. There were no treatment differences for any parameter in any of the culture groups with the exception of the positive and negative control groups. Differences by time existed with increases in inflammation over time in the positive control group and no changes in the negative control group. Significant time x treatment interactions existed only in the positive control group. No combination of nutraceuticals was able to mitigate the inflammatory challenge. At the high level, the combination appeared to have cytotoxic effects. Taken together, these data shed light on the challenges associated with developing an efficacious joint supplement for horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopsy 3acartilage 3acoculture 3acollagen 3acranberries 3acytotoxicity 3adietary supplements 3agreen tea 3ahorses 3ahydrolysis 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3ajoints (animal) 3ametalloproteinases 3anitric oxide 3aoncogenes 3aprostaglandins 3aproteoglycans 3aveterinary medicine1 aGordon, M.E.1 aStoker, A.M.1 aCook, J.L.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2021 May, v. 100 p.103478-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1034783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03408naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001500137245009500152300001800247500001100265520160400276592002801880596005901908596009601967596007202063596009102135650001602226650001702242650001202259650002302271650001502294650002302309650002302332650001502355650001402370650002702384650001902411650001802430650002002448650001002468650001902478650002102497650000902518650002602527650001202553650002602565700001202591700005702603773012602660856007102786852000902857655001202866IND60666240120221119121314.0190916e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066624012DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.54872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, Yang10aCurrent understanding of the molecular players involved in resistance to rice planthoppers  ap. 2566-2574.  aREVIEW  aRice planthoppers are the most widespread and destructive pest of rice. Planthopper control depends greatly on the understanding of molecular players involved in resistance to planthoppers. This paper summarizes the recent progress in the understanding of some molecular players involved in resistance to planthoppers and the mechanisms involved. Recent researches showed that hostâplant resistance is the most promising sustainable approach for controlling planthoppers. Planthopperâresistant varieties with a hostâplant resistance gene have been released for rice products. Integrated planthopper management is a proposed strategy to prolong the durability of hostâplant resistance. Bacillus spp. and their gene products or insect pathogenic fungi have great potential for application in the biological control of planthoppers. Enhancement of the activity of the natural enemies of planthoppers would be more costâeffective and environmentally friendly. Various molecular processes regulate riceâplanthopper interactions. Rice encounters planthopper attacks via transcription factors, secondary metabolites, and signaling networks in which phytohormones have central roles. Maintenance of cell wall integrity and lignification act as physical barriers. Indirect defenses of rice are regulated via chemical elicitors, honeydewâassociated elicitor, amendment with silicon and biochar, and salivary protein of BPH as elicitor or effector. Further research directions on planthopper control and rice defense against planthoppers are also put forward.

In this context, the search for new antigenic candidates presenting higher sensitivity and specificity is urgently required. In the present study, the amino acid sequences of the LiHyT, LiHyD, LiHyV, and LiHyP proteins, which were previously showed to be antigenic in the visceral leishmaniasis (VL), were evaluated and eight B-cell epitopes were predicted and used for construction of gene codifying a chimeric protein called ChimLeish. The protein was expressed, purified and evaluated as a recombinant antigen in ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) for the diagnosis of TL. The own B cell epitopes used to construct the chimera were synthetized and also evaluated as antigens, as well as a soluble Leishmania braziliensis antigenic extract (SLA). Results showed that ChimLeish presented 100% sensitivity and specificity to diagnose TL, while synthetic peptides showed sensitivity varying from 9.1% to 90.9%, while specificity reached from 98.3% to 99.1%. SLA showed sensitivity and specificity of 18.2% and 98.3%, respectively. A preliminary prognostic evaluation showed that anti-ChimLeish IgG antibodies declined in significant levels, when serological reactivity was compared before and six months after treatment, suggesting also a possible prognostic role of this antigen for TL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aLeishmania braziliensis 3aamino acids 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepitopes 3agenes 3apathogenesis 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3aserodiagnosis 3asynthetic peptides 3avisceral leishmaniasis 0aTegumentary leishmaniasis 0aB-cell epitopes 0aChimera 0aDiagnosis 0aELISA 0aPrognosis1 aMachado, Amanda S.1 aLage, Daniela P.1 aMartins, VÃ­vian T.1 ade Oliveira, Daysiane1 aFreitas, Camila S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7882-215X1 aVale, Danniele L.1 aFernandes, Bruna B.1 aOliveira-da-Silva, JoÃ£o A.1 aReis, Thiago A.R.1 aSantos, ThaÃ­s T.O.1 aRamos, Fernanda F.1 aBandeira, Raquel S.1 aLudolf, Fernanda1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3357-98161 aTavares, Grasiele S.V.1 aGuimarÃ£es, Nathalia S.1 aTupinambÃ¡s, UnaÃ­1 aChÃ¡vez-Fumagalli, Miguel A.1 aHumbert, Maria V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5728-69811 aGonÃ§alves, Denise U.1 aChristodoulides, Myron1 aMachado-de-Ãvila, Ricardo A.1 aCoelho, Eduardo A.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6681-90140 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2022 Jan., v. 162 p.105341-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2021.1053413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04399naa a2200973 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245016100168300001600329520185300345592002802198650002102226650001802247650001502265650001602280650001902296650001402315650002502329650001002354650003802364650001002402650003502412650000902447650001102456650002502467650002202492650000902514650001302523650001702536650001302553650001502566650004302581650001402624650002402638653001902662653001702681653000802698653001302706653001002719653000902729653000802738653000902746653000802755653000802763653000802771653001002779653001002789653000802799653000902807653000802816653001002824653001302834653000902847653000802856653000802864653000802872653000802880653000902888653000802897653000902905653000902914653000802923653000702931653003102938653001502969653002202984653001503006700001403021700001903035700002503054700002303079700002603102700002303128700002903151700002103180773012103201856008203322852000903404655001203413IND60089813320221118141935.0160728e20131025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008981332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammoudi, Abeer10aProteomic profiling of a mouse model of acute intestinal Apc deletion leads to identification of potential novel biomarkers of human colorectal cancer (CRC)  ap. 364-370.  aColorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Accurate non-invasive screening for CRC would greatly enhance a populationâs health. Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) gene mutations commonly occur in human colorectal adenomas and carcinomas, leading to Wnt signalling pathway activation. Acute conditional transgenic deletion of Apc in murine intestinal epithelium (AhCre+Apcfl/fl) causes phenotypic changes similar to those found during colorectal tumourigenesis. This study comprised a proteomic analysis of murine small intestinal epithelial cells following acute Apc deletion to identify proteins that show altered expression during human colorectal carcinogenesis, thus identifying proteins that may prove clinically useful as blood/serum biomarkers of colorectal neoplasia. Eighty-one proteins showed significantly increased expression following iTRAQ analysis, and validation of nine of these by Ingenuity Pathaway Analysis showed they could be detected in blood or serum. Expression was assessed in AhCre+Apcfl/fl small intestinal epithelium by immunohistochemistry, western blot and quantitative real-time PCR; increased nucelolin concentrations were also detected in the serum of AhCre+Apcfl/fl and ApcMin/+ mice by ELISA. Six proteins; heat shock 60kDa protein 1, Nucleolin, Prohibitin, Cytokeratin 18, Ribosomal protein L6 and DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 5,were selected for further investigation. Increased expression of 4 of these was confirmed in human CRC by qPCR. In conclusion, several novel candidate biomarkers have been identified from analysis of transgenic mice in which the Apc gene was deleted in the intestinal epithelium that also showed increased expression in human CRC. Some of these warrant further investigation as potential serum-based biomarkers of human CRC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinoma 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adeath 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aheat 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aintestinal mucosa 3amice 3amutation 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3asignal transduction 0aAhCre+Apcfl/fl 0aAhCre+Apc+/+ 0aApc 0aApcMin/+ 0aCTBRC 0aCK18 0aCRC 0aDDX5 0aECE 0aFAP 0aFDR 0agFOBt 0aHSPD1 0aIHC 0ai.p. 0aIPA 0aiTRAQ 0aLC MS/MS 0aMMTS 0aNCL 0aPCR 0aPHB 0aROC 0aRPL6 0aSEM 0aTCEP 0aTEAB 0aTFA 0aWB 0aAdenomatous polyposis coli 0aBiomarkers 0aColorectal cancer 0aProteomics1 aSong, Fei1 aReed, Karen R.1 aJenkins, Rosalind E.1 aMeniel, Valerie S.1 aWatson, Alastair J.M.1 aPritchard, D.

Two density model surfaces presenting the HCIC ligand (mercapto-ethyl-pyridine, MEP) were prepared on Au using a self-assembly technique. The surface chemistry and structure, ionization, and protein binding of such model surfaces were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS), contact-angle titration, and SPR, respectively. The influences of the surface and solution factors, e.g., ligand density, salt concentration, and solution pH, on protein adsorption were determined by SPR. Our results showed that ligand density affects both equilibrium and dynamic aspects of the interactions. Specifically, a dense ligand leads to an increase in binding strength, rapid adsorption, slow desorption, and low specificity. In addition, both hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding contribute significantly to the protein adsorption at neutral pH, while the electrostatic repulsion is overwhelmed under acidic conditions. The hydrophobic interaction at a high concentration of lyotropic salt would cause drastic conformational changes in the adsorbed protein. Combined with the self-assembly technique, SPR proves to be a powerful tool for studying the interactions between an antibody and a chromatographic ligand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3aantibodies 3achromatography 3acontact angle 3adesorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agold 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aionization 3aligands 3amodels 3apH 3aprotein binding 3asalt concentration 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atitration1 aLi, Ming-Yang1 aWang, Han-Qi1 aLin, Dong-Qiang1 aQu, Jing-Ping0 tLangmuir.g2015 Mar. 24, v. 31, no. 11 p.3422-3430dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla50449873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03810naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011500163520267100278592002802949650001502977650001002992650001003002650001303012650003803025650001003063650001503073650002503088650001103113650001003124650000903134650002203143650001003165650002403175700001303199773012003212856008303332852000903415655001203424IND60738557620221120031644.0220326e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073855762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1034802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWerner, J.10a17 Use of hair cortisol analysis to evaluate the influence of housing conditions on long-term stress in horses  aHorses are kept in a variety of housing systems which often reflect the needs of both horses and their owners as well as available resources. Housing management practices not only impact horse health and performance but may also influence a horse's physiological and psychological stress. Traditional sampling methods using blood, saliva, urine, and feces are often utilized to evaluate stress in animals by measuring acute cortisol levels. Hair cortisol analysis allows for the quantification of long-term cortisol which may be a better indicator of prolonged periods of elevated stress. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the influence of transitioning horses from outdoor group housing to individual box stalls on hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) and determine the relationship between physiological and behavioral stress responses. Hair samples were collected approximately every 30 d from the same location on 11 Quarter Horses (5 mares, 6 geldings; 3.5 Â± 1.3 yr) over a period of 180 d (90d group housing/90d box stalls). Hair cortisol production was measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and horse heart rate (HR) and behavior were recorded throughout a series of novel object and sensory sensitivity tests. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED and Pearson correlations in SAS v. 9.4. HCC ranged from 0.6 pg/mg to 3.0 pg/mg throughout the study with an average concentration of 1.3 Â± 0.4 pg/mg. Overall, there was no difference in HCC due to the type of housing system. However, HCC increased during the 30-d period immediately following the transition from group housing to individual housing and then decreased during the next 30 d period (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the horses in this study experienced an increase in physiological stress due to the change in housing system but were able to adapt to their new environment. Interestingly, HCC were influenced by the color of the horse's mane and tail (P < 0.01). Analysis of the relationship between physiological and behavioral responses during the novel object and sensory sensitivity tests revealed mixed results. Horse HR and reactivity were positively correlated during both sound sensitivity tests (P < 0.05). However, behavioral observations and reactivity during the novel object, smell, and taste sensitivity tests were influenced by the stimulus (P < 0.05). As behavioral responses may not always reflect physiological responses and only provide short-term measures of stress, hair cortisol has the potential to serve as a biomarker of long-term stress in horses and provides a tool to monitor the effects of management practices such as housing systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3acolor 3acortisol 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3aheart rate 3apsychological stress 3asaliva 3asmell 3atail 3ataste sensitivity 3aurine 3aveterinary medicine1 aCole, K.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2021 May, v. 100 p.103480-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1034803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245013600168300001600304520138900320592002801709650002801737650001201765650001301777650002001790650002101810653007201831653001101903653002901914700003001943700002201973773015401995856008002149852000902229655001202238IND60522893720221120051626.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052289372DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1995-11-12172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSola-Penna, Mauro10aGlycerol Inhibits or Uncouples the Plasma Membrane (Ca2++Mg2+)ATPase of Kidney Proximal Tubules Depending on the Ca2+ Concentration  ap. 845-853.  aIn this report it is shown that glycerol (0.5-10% v/v) stimulate the Cââ-Eâ-solubilized renal (CaÂ²âº+MgÂ²âº)ATPase in the presence of low concentrations of free CaÂ²âº (< 10â»â¶á´). At 4% (v/v), the polyol decreases the Kâ.â for CaÂ²âº from 1.15 to 0.22 Î¼á´ at the high-affinity site, and a very-high-affinity CaÂ²âº component appears. This component has a Kâ.â â¤10â»â¹ á´ and its maximal velocity is about one-third that of the fully activated enzyme (at 10-20 Î¼á´ CaÂ²âº), which is not affected by glycerol (21.1 and 20.2 nmolÂ·mgâ»Â¹ Â·minâ»Â¹ in the absence and presence of the polyol, respectively). The low-affinity, inhibitory component of the CaÂ²âº curve (50-1000 Î¼á´) is also unaffected by glycerol. With 0.07 Î¼á´ free CaÂ²âº and soluble enzyme, the stimulatory effect of glycerol saturates at â10% (v/v). In contrast, with 17 Î¼á´ free CaÂ²âº, glycerol has little effect up to 10% (v/v), and then progressively inhibits ATPase activity. These data indicate that the effect of the polyol is modulated by the occupancy of the high-affinity CaÂ²âº sites. In native vesicles, the stimulation promoted by low concentrations of glycerol at low concentrations of CaÂ²âº is accompanied by inhibition of active CaÂ²âº transport, indicating that, in these conditions, the polyol uncouples ATPase activity and ATP-driven CaÂ²âº influx.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acalcium 3aglycerol 3aplasma membrane 3aproximal tubules 0aPlasma Membrane (Ca2++Mg2+)ATPase Glycerol Uncoupling of Ionic Pump 0aPolyol 0aHydrophobic Interactions1 ados Passos Lemos, Adriana1 aVieyra, Adalberto0 tZeitschrift fÃ¼r Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 50, no. 11-12 p.845-853dVerlag der Zeitschrift fÃ¼r NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1995-11-12173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245010200211520144600313592002801759650001001787650001501797650001801812650001601830650001101846650001701857650001101874650002301885650001001908650001001918650001701928653001901945653001501964653003101979653002002010653001702030700003002047700006702077700006302144700002802207700003002235700006402265700007002329773010302399856008602502852000902588655001202597IND60759666820221117061633.0220118e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075966682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2021.1053512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Carli, Silvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3440-213410aCowsâ reproductive performances and parity order influences the cervicovaginal fungal community  aFungi have already been described as etiological agents of reproductive diseases such as endometritis and infertility in cows. However, few studies have been developed to elucidate the entire cervicovaginal fungal communities in cows. Therefore, our study aimed to characterize the fungal community present in the cervix of cows with different reproductive performances. Cervicovaginal mucus was collected from 36 Angus breed cows (1.5â12 years old) on a commercial beef cattle ranch. Twenty-one cows had a history of infertility in the year prior to the collection, showing early return to estrus. Ten cows were sampled at 60â70 days postpartum being considered fertile cows. Additionally, five non-sexually active heifers were employed as control group. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the predominant fungal phyla in the analyzed animals. Diversity metrics of the cervicovaginal fungal community revealed statistical differences in the composition of the fungal community among infertile cows, fertile cows and non-sexually active heifers. In addition, the cervicovaginal fungal microbiota had significative increased richness and evenness in nulliparous cows and non-sexually active heifers, while in multiparous cows a decreased richness and evenness of the fungal microbiota were identified. These results provide an unprecedented understanding of the cervicovaginal fungal structure associated with infertility and parity order.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngus 3aAscomycota 3aBasidiomycota 3abeef cattle 3acervix 3aendometritis 3aestrus 3afungal communities 3afungi 3amucus 3apathogenesis 0aInfertile cows 0aMicrobiota 0aHigh-throughput sequencing 0aFungi community 0aParity order1 aLopes, Cassiane Elisabete1 aBreyer, Gabriela Merker1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0246-45571 aDias, Maria Eduarda1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2018-95281 aSaggin, Bianca Fagundes1 aMuterle Varela, Ana Paula1 aMayer, Fabiana Quoos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9324-85361 aSiqueira, Franciele Maboni1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7282-61170 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2022 Jan., v. 162 p.105351-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2021.1053513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04002naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245006800170520268300238592002802921650001502949650002002964650001602984650000903000650001603009650001203025650001603037650001003053650000903063650001203072650001103084650002303095650001003118650000903128653001703137653002103154653002903175653001903204653001903223653003003242700002203272700002503294773011703319856008703436852000903523655001203532IND60700076620221119160437.0201025e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070007662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2020.1050702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOcepek, Marko10aWhich types of rooting material give weaner pigs most pleasure?  aProvision of rooting material as enrichment for pigs has been primarily oriented towards reducing negative affect (suffering). Information is also needed on the impact of different types of rooting materials in promoting positive affect (pleasure). We hypothesised that repeated addition of fresh rooting material, especially different types provided in combination, would stimulate positive affect in weaned pigs. We offered pigs (n = 10 weaned litters) rooting material twice daily (10 L of silage, straw or peat, or a combination (âcomboâ) of all three), or no added rooting material (control condition, sawdust bedding only, present in all pens). Over five weeks, each litter was exposed to all five conditions for one week each (order balanced across litters), and the behaviour of two male and two female focal pigs per litter was assessed during the 30 min before and 30 min after delivery of rooting material on Days 1 and 4 each week. Behaviours indicative of positive affective states in this context (exploration, play, tail curled, tail wagging), as well as behaviours associated with harm (ear/tail manipulation, aggression, tail down), were quantified from video recordings by 1â0 sampling. The effect of condition (control, silage, straw, peat or comb) on positive and negative behavioural expressions was analysed using a generalised linear mixed model that also accounted for period (before vs after adding rooting material), time of day (morning vs afternoon), day of week, condition by period, condition by time of day, sex, bodyweight, litter size, and week. The peat and combo conditions resulted in higher levels of exploration, play, tail curled and tail wagging, and lower levels of ear/tail manipulation, aggression and tail down, compared to control, with the silage and straw conditions mainly giving intermediate results. Pigs showed more exploration, tail curled and tail wagging after than before adding silage, straw, peat and combo, whereas play increased only after adding peat or combo. Exploration occurred at similar levels on Day 1 and 4 of exposure to peat and combo whereas it declined across days in the other conditions, and ear/tail manipulation and aggression increased in the silage condition. Exploration, play and tail wagging declined with increasing age. Sex, bodyweight and litter size were not consistently associated with positive or negative behavioural expressions. Our results suggest that peat, and peat in combination with straw and silage, were the most consistently effective rooting materials for inducing positive (i.e. pleasurable) affective states, and reducing behaviours associated with harm, in weaned pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3aanimal behavior 3abody weight 3aears 3afeeder pigs 3afemales 3alitter size 3amales 3apeat 3asawdust 3asilage 3astatistical models 3astraw 3atail 0aDomestic pig 0aRooting material 0aEnvironmental enrichment 0aPlay behaviour 0aAnimal welfare 0aPositive affective states1 aNewberry, Ruth C.1 aAndersen, Inger Lise0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2020 Oct., v. 231 p.105070-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2020.1050703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01651naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245011200152300001800264520037500282592002800657650001900685650001400704650002300718650001300741650002300754650001500777650001900792650002900811650001300840650002300853650001100876650001600887700002000903700002100923700001500944700001300959700002200972700001700994773012301011856007401134852000901208655001201217IND60664159320221121093618.0190910e20120924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066415932DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra21597g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xun10aProduction of value-added chemicals from bio-oil via acid catalysis coupled with liquidâliquid extraction  ap. 9366-9370.  aSugar/sugar derivatives in bio-oil can be effectively separated from aromatics via water/chloroform extraction.

Light horse, diestrous mares and geldings, weighing approximately 500 kg and aged 6 to 24 years, were randomly assigned to treatment with 1 mg equine kisspeptin-10 (Kp10; nâ¯=â¯10) or 1 mL saline (nâ¯=â¯9), i.v. Blood samples were collected via jugular venipuncture â10, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min relative to treatment. Plasma concentrations of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) were determined by RIA and means compared using ANOVA with repeated sampling. Neither GH nor PRL were stimulated by Kp10. In a second experiment, 30 mares and geldings were used to determine if pre-treatment with estradiol or progesterone would elicit a GH or PRL response to Kp10. Five mares and 5 geldings each were assigned to pre-treatment with 50 mg estradiol cypionate in oil (ECP), 600 mg long-acting progesterone, or oil only, i.m. Two days later, all horses received 1 mg Kp10 in saline, i.v., and blood sampling occurred 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 min relative to Kp10 administration. Mean GH and PRL concentrations and area under the curve were compared by ANOVA. No stimulation of GH or PRL was observed. In a third experiment, 12 diestrous mares, confirmed by plasma progesterone and ultrasound findings, were randomly assigned to treatment with 1 mg Kp10 (nâ¯=â¯6) or 1 mL saline (nâ¯=â¯6) followed by the dopamine antagonist, sulpiride (0.01 mg/kg body weight), 5 min later. Blood sampling occurred 0, 5, 10 and 15 min relative to sulpiride administration. Sulpiride stimulated PRL (P < 0.0001) in both groups of mares; however, PRL concentrations were lower (P â¤ 0.01) in Kp10-treated mares compared with saline-treated mares. To determine if estrogen altered the PRL response to sulpiride, 12 seasonally anovulatory mares, confirmed by plasma progesterone and ultrasound findings, were used in a fourth experiment and randomly assigned to receive 50 mg ECP (nâ¯=â¯6) or oil (nâ¯=â¯6), i.m. The next day, mares were challenged with sulpiride. Treatment and blood sampling occurred as described in experiment 3. Plasma PRL was stimulated (P < 0.001) in both groups of mares and responses were similar between treatments. In the described experiments, 1 mg Kp10 given as a bolus failed to stimulate circulating GH or PRL within 30 min in mares or geldings regardless of steroid milieu. This is in contrast to reports of GH stimulation in ruminants. Kp10 did alter the PRL response to sulpiride in diestrous mares, perhaps suggesting an interaction between Kp10 and dopaminergic input to the pituitary in a progesterone dominant environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanovulation 3aantagonists 3abody weight 3adopamine 3aestradiol 3akisspeptin 3aoils 3aprogesterone 3aprolactin 3asomatotropin 3aultrasonics 3aveterinary medicine1 aCamp, C.M.1 aOberhaus, E.L.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2021 May, v. 100 p.103482-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1034823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245008000163300001600243520155300259592002801812650002301840650003301863650002401896650001401920650001001934650001801944650002801962650001101990650001702001650002002018650000902038650000902047650001402056650001102070650001102081650001102092650002102103651001202124651001802136653002302154653002402177653000802201653002502209653002702234653002902261653002102290700002102311700002702332773011002359856008202469852000902551655001202560IND60480056020221120065522.0160125e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048005602DNAL7 a10.1556/CRC.40.2012.3.122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalÃ¡gyi, A.10aDifferent species of legumes grown in combination with oats as green forage  ap. 436-447.  aGreen fodder mixture trials were carried out with <i>GK Impala</i>, a winter hardy, fall sown oat variety registered in 2005 intercropped either with winter vetch or winter pea in a crop year when the spring was dry (2003) and in another one (2004) when the precipitation was optimal in spring. The two components of mixtures were sown 50% each. A four-replicate randomised complete block design was used with 50 m<sup>2</sup> plots. The results were compared to the mixtures of spring oats and vetch; and spring oats and pea, respectively. The green matter of fall sown crops was cut by scythe late May, whereas that of spring crops early June.Data demonstrate that the green forage yield and protein production of fall sown oats as a monocrop and intercropped with vetch was higher than those of spring types. Green matter and dry matter yield varied with season, and were more advantageous in the year 2004, when there was more precipitation. The crude protein content of winter vetch and the crude protein production of the mixture fall sown oats + winter vetch were the highest. The mixtures with winter or spring pea yielded less green matter and, as a matter of fact, less crude protein. The fodder mixtures cereals â legumes are conventionally and widely used as feed for livestock in North-America, and the results of our two-year experiment suggest that their use should be intensified in Hungary as well, mainly in the provisional feeding of ruminants. To date, oat varieties with reliable winter hardiness are offered for fall sowing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAepyceros melampus 3aVicia villosa subsp. villosa 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop year 3acrops 3acrude protein 3adry matter accumulation 3aforage 3aforage yield 3alivestock feeds 3aoats 3apeas 3aruminants 3asowing 3aspring 3awinter 3awinter hardiness 3aHungary 3aNorth America 0awinter/spring oats 0awinter/spring vetch 0apea 0agreen forage mixture 0agreen/dry matter yield 0acrude protein production 0awinter hardiness1 aPalÃ¡gyi, Andrea1 aMÃ³rocznÃ© Salamon, K.0 tCereal research communications.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 40, no. 3 p.436-447dAkadÃ©miai KiadÃ³x0133-37207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FCRC.40.2012.3.123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01875naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245008200165300001800247520082000265592002801085650001501113650001801128650001901146650001101165650000901176650003701185700002701222700001901249700001401268700002101282700001601303773012301319856007401442852000901516655001201525IND60664159420221121093621.0190910e20120924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066415942DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra21602g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeitner, Nicholas K.10aUnderstanding dendritic polymerâhydrocarbon interactions for oil dispersion  ap. 9371-9375.  aThis study examines the interactions of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers and hyperbranched poly(ethyleneimine) polymers with model linear and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Large-scale complexations were formed for both types of dendritic polymers hosting the linear but not the polyaromatic hydrocarbon. Furthermore, both types of dendritic polymers exhibited a strong and comparable hosting/dispersion capacity for the polyaromatic hydrocarbon, while the hyperbranched polymers at concentrations below 30 Î¼M showed a consistently higher hosting capacity than the dendrimers for the linear hydrocarbon. Such complexity in hosting capacity of the two types of dendritic polymers is attributed to the more hydrophobic interior and less steric hindrance of the hyperbranched polymers for the partitioning of the hydrocarbons.  aPublisher supplied data 3adendrimers 3aethyleneimine 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3aoils 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons1 aBhattacharya, Priyanka1 aSteele, Muriel1 aChen, Ran1 aLadner, David A.1 aKe, Pu Chun0 tRSC advances.g2012 Sept. 24, v. 2, no. 25 p.9371-9375dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra21602g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01791naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003100146245011700177300001300294500001400307520070000321592002801021650001401049650001201063650001001075650001001085650001601095650001601111651001201127653002201139653001701161653001301178653001501191700002801206773009301234856008101327852000901408655001201417IND60698853220221121224734.0210116e20150126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069885322DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.477.87062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiupponi, Alessandro P.

This is the fourth species described for the genus and the second from Ecuador. A simple terminology is proposed for the microtrichiae of the spermatopositor and genital characters in the family are discussed. The genus Brasiliogovea Martens, 1969 is consistently misspelled in the literature as Brasilogovea.

The dietary treatments were as follows: NF = no dietary additional fat (46.0 g ether extract (EE)/kg diet), SO = soybean oil (62.0 g EE/kg diet), SB = soy beans (without any processing; 62.0 g EE/kg diet) and RPF = rumen-protected fat based on soybean oil (62.0 g EE/kg diet). The intake of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) was greater in the SO diet than those fed with NF. The SO diet decreased digestibility of NDF when compared with the NF and RPF diets. The diets did not affect digestibility of DM, OM, CP or emission of enteric methane. Animals fed with SO had greater average daily gain and feed efficiency in relation to the other diets tested. The SO diet increased hot and cold carcass weights and subcutaneous fat thickness of carcasses when compared with the NF diet. The proportions of saturated and unsaturated, mono and polyunsaturated, and n-3 and n-6 fatty acids were not affected significantly by treatments. The SO diets were demonstrated to be more beneficial for animal performance compared with diets without supplemental fat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNellore 3aagricultural sciences 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3acold 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afat thickness 3afeed conversion 3afeedlots 3ameat quality 3amethane 3amethane production 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aorganic matter 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 3asubcutaneous fat 0aBeef cattle 0aglycerol 0arumen-protected fat 0asoy bean1 aFiorentini, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6162-16151 aMessana, J.

Data measured in different laboratories, occasionally by different methods, were compared. Excluding the rate coefficients with values above the diffusion controlled limit and adjusting rate coefficients determined by competition kinetics, the data were averaged and the most probable values were selected. Rate coefficients for compounds with aromatic rings (e.g., amoxicillin) or conjugated double bonds (e.g., tylosin) are in the (6 â 8) Ã 10â¹ molâ»Â¹ dmÂ³ sâ»Â¹ range. The basic reaction is radical addition. The value may be smaller when strong electron withdrawing substituent, like âNOâ is attached to the ring, and N-atoms in the aromatic ring also reduce the rate coefficient. The rate coefficients for molecules without aromatic rings are smaller with values in the (3 â 6) Ã 10â¹ molâ»Â¹ dmÂ³ sâ»Â¹ range, where hydrogen abstraction reactions dominate. Carefully executed pulse radiolysis and steady-state experiments (with correct reference values) give similar rate coefficients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamoxicillin 3achemical bonding 3ahydrogen 3ahydroxyl radicals 3anormal values 3aradiolysis 3atylosin 0arate coefficient 0ahydroxyl radical 0adegradation 0aantibiotics 0astructure dependence1 aTÃ³th, TÃ¼nde,1 aTakÃ¡cs, ErzsÃ©bet0 tCritical reviews in environmental science and technology.g2018 Mar. 19, v. 48, no. 6 p.575-613dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12197x1547-65377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2018.14630663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006800146245009800214300001800312520177600330536012002106592002802226650001902254650000902273650001102282650002502293650001202318650001402330650001402344650001302358650001302371650001302384650001202397650001102409700002002420700002302440773012702463856008002590852000902670655001202679IND60623888320221122064221.0181129e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062388832DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X177525812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoursier, Jean-FranÃ§ois1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5217-669510aEffectiveness of a bipolar vessel sealant device for ovariohysterectomy in cats with pyometra  ap. 1119-1123.  aThe objective was to describe the use of a bipolar vessel sealant device for complete ovariohysterectomy in cats (ie, removal of both the ovarian pedicle and the uterine body and vessels) and to report on the feasibility of ovariohysterectomy in cats with pyometra. Cats with confirmed pyometra and whose owners agreed to the surgical procedure were prospectively included in the study. Ovaries were visualised and the vessel sealant device was used to coagulate and cut the suspensory ligament, the ovarian pedicle and the broad ligament up to the level of the uterine body. Once the uterine body was measured, it was grasped, coagulated and transected just proximal to the cervix using the vessel sealant device when its diameter was <0.9 cm. Immediate postoperative and short-term follow-up were evaluated by clinical examination. Thirteen cases were initially included between November 2015 and February 2017. Three cases were subsequently excluded because of a uterine body diameter >0.9 cm. Of the 10 cats finally included, all were intact females, with a median age of 2.7 years (range 0.9â9 years). Median weight was 3.7 kg (range 2.6â6.7 kg). The median surgery time was 10.9 mins (range 9.8â15.2 mins). Median uterus diameter was 0.51 cm (range 0.45â0.64 cm) and median skin incision was 4.1 cm (range 3.6â5.1 cm). No complications during the procedures occurred in any patient. All cases were discharged from the hospital 1 day after surgery, without any abnormality. No complications were noted during the postoperative period. The findings suggest that the bipolar vessel sealant device used in this study is safe in performing ovariohysterectomy for pyometra in cats, when the uterine body is <0.9 cm in diameter, without short-term complications.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3acats 3acervix 3aclinical examination 3afemales 3ahospitals 3aligaments 3apatients 3apyometra 3asealants 3aspaying 3auterus1 aBassanino, Jean1 aLeperlier, Dimitri0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 20, no. 12 p.1119-1123dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X177525813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245018600169300001300355520184800368592002802216653002002244653001302264653001702277653002602294653002502320653002202345700001902367700001902386700001802405700001302423700001702436700002002453773009402473856008302567852000902650655001202659IND60592198220221120232257.0180331e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059219822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.neuro.2017.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkomolafe, S.F.10aEffect of caffeine, caffeic acid and their various combinations on enzymes of cholinergic, monoaminergic and purinergic systems critical to neurodegeneration in rat brainâIn vitro  ap. 6-13.  aCaffeine and caffeic acid are two bioactive compounds that are present in plant foods and are major constituent of coffee, cocoa, tea, cola drinks and chocolate. Although not structurally related, caffeine and caffeic acid has been reported to elicit neuroprotective properties. However, their different proportional distribution in food sources and possible effect of such interactions are not often taken into consideration. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effect of caffeine, caffeic acid and their various combinations on activities of some enzymes [acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase (MAO) ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (E-NTPase), ecto-5Â¹-nucleotidase (E-NTDase) and Naâº/Kâº ATPase relevant to neurodegeneration in vitro in rat brain. The stock concentration of caffeine and caffiec acid and their various proportional combinations were prepared and their interactions with the activities of these enzymes were assessed (in vitro) in different brain structures. The FeÂ²âº and CuÂ²âº chelating abilities of the samples were also investigated. The results revealed that caffeine, caffeic acid and their various combinations exhibited inhibitory effect on activities of AChE, MAO, E-NTPase and E-NTDase, but stimulatory effect on Naâº/Kâº ATPase activity. The combinations also exhibited FeÂ²âº and CuÂ²âº chelating abilities. Considering the various combinations, a higher caffeine to caffeic acid ratio produced significantly highest enzyme modulatory effects; these were significantly lower to the effect of caffeine alone but significantly higher than the effect of caffeic acid alone. These findings may provide new insight into the effect of proportional combination of these bioactive compounds as obtained in many foods especially with respect to their neuroprotective effects.  aPublisher supplied data 0aNeuromodulation 0aCaffeine 0aCaffeic acid 0aPurinergic signalling 0aAcetylcholinesterase 0aMonoamine oxidase1 aAkinyemi, A.J.1 aOgunsuyi, O.B.1 aOyeleye, S.I.1 aOboh, G.1 aAdeoyo, O.O.1 aAllismith, Y.R.0 tNeurotoxicology.g2017 Sept., v. 62 p.6-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:19553x0161-813X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2017.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001500167245013700182300001400319520134100333592002801674650000901702650001401711650001201725650001001737650001701747650001501764650001901779650000901798650002101807650005301828650004901881650002001930650003101950650005201981650002702033650004102060650004202101650002202143650004702165650001402212650005202226650003302278650002802311650005002339700001702389700001802406700001602424700001702440700001802457700001502475700001602490773008102506856008202587852000902669655001202678IND60098911220221117212631.0141105e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009891122DNAL7 a216401702pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2011.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jian10aGenome-wide identification of gibberellins metabolic enzyme genes and expression profiling analysis during seed germination in maize  ap. 34-42.  aGibberellin (GA) is an essential phytohormone that controls many aspects of plant development. To enhance our understanding of GA metabolism in maize, we intensively screened and identified 27 candidate genes encoding the seven GA metabolic enzymes including ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), ent-kaurene synthase (KS), ent-kaurene oxidase (KO), ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO), GA 20-oxidase (GA20ox), GA 3-oxidase (GA3ox), and GA 2-oxidase (GA2ox), using all available public maize databases. The results indicate that maize genome contains three CPS, four KS, two KO and one KAO genes, and most of them are arranged separately on the maize genome, which differs from that in rice. In addition, the enzymes catalyzing the later steps (ZmGA20ox, ZmGA3ox and ZmGA2ox) are also encoded by gene families in maize, but GA3ox enzyme is likely to be encoded by single gene. Expression profiling analysis exhibited that transcripts of 15 GA metabolic genes could be detected during maize seed germination, which provides further evidence for the notion that increased synthesis of active GA in the embryo is required for triggering germination events. Moreover, a variety of temporal genes expression patterns of GA metabolic genes were detected, which revealed the complexity of underlying mechanism for GA regulated seed germination.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3adatabases 3aenzymes 3agenes 3agibberellins 3ametabolism 3aplant hormones 3arice 3aseed germination 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Bacterialxgenetics 2aExonsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGerminationxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aGibberellinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aOryzaxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSeedsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aTriazolesxpharmacology 2aZea maysxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgenetics.1 aGuo, Baojian1 aSong, Fangwei1 aPeng, Huiru1 aYao, Yingyin1 aZhang, Yirong1 aSun, Qixin1 aNi, Zhongfu0 tGene.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 482, no. 1-2 p.34-42dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2011.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245011200185300001600297520092100313592002801234650001501262650002201277650001501299650001301314650002201327650001301349650003501362650002401397650001501421650001201436650001601448650004301464650002501507650002401532650002501556650003901581650002401620650004901644650002301693700002701716700002201743700002001765773010001785856008101885852000901966655001201975IND4402878320221122211729.0151024e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440287832DNAL7 a182171962pmid7 a10.1007/s10265-007-0137-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatayama, Hisato10aUltrastructural and immunochemical features of the cell wall sac formed in mulberry (Morus alba) idioblasts  ap. 201-205.  aA peculiar inward growth, named a âcell wall sacâ, formed in mulberry (Morus alba) idioblasts, is a subcellular site for production of calcium carbonate crystals. On the basis of ultrastructural observations, a fully expanded cell wall sac could be divided into two partsâan amorphous complex consisting of multi-layered compartments with multiple fibers originating from the innermost cell wall layer, and a peripheral plain matrix with fiber aggregates. Immunofluorescent localization showed that low and highly esterified pectin epitopes were detected at the early stages of development of the cell wall sac, followed by complete disappearance from the both parts of fully enlarged mature sac. In contrast, the xyloglucan epitope remained in the compartment complex; this was supported by the observation that the xyloglucan epitope labeled with immuno-gold particles is found on fibers in the complex part.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorus alba 3acalcium carbonate 3acell walls 3acrystals 3aearly development 3aepitopes 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aimmunocytochemistry 3amulberries 3apectins 3axyloglucans 2aCell Wallxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aEpitopesxmetabolism 2aGlucansxmetabolism 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMorusxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPectinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Epidermisxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aXylansxmetabolism1 aFujibayashi, Yoshinari1 aNagaoka, Sumiharu1 aSugimura, Yukio0 tJournal of plant research.g2008 Mar., v. 121, no. 2 p.201-205dSpringer Japanx0918-94407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-007-0137-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245011800209300001800327500001900345520137900364592002801743596005701771650001401828650002201842650001801864651001601882773011001898856008202008852000902090655001202099IND60711266520221120023048.0200920e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071126652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10708-019-10020-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGress, Douglas R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2210-353210aExamining Korea's international science and business belt project through an evolutionary economic geography lens  ap. 1241-1255.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn February of 2008, South Korea began planning a massive, multi-regional project, the International Science and Business Belt (ISBB) and Institute for Basic Science (IBS) that formally opened in mid-2018. This article examines the genesis of the ISBB/IBS vis-Ã -vis contemporary advances in Evolutionary Economic Geography (EEG) theory. Facets of EEG such as scale, government, and policy; the potential for non-firm organizations to contribute to innovation; and the importance of related and non-related variety help to assess current progress and future areas of potential as well as concern. Possible limitations to EEG theorizing along with corresponding suggestions for future inclusion are ventured. It is shown that Korea has a resiliency agenda spurred on by anticipatory need motivated by a steady deterioration of the countryâs technology trade balance. In terms of policy, Korea is pursuing a devolution of power from the state to the regional level while deploying a revolutionary type policy with evolutionary characteristics. Spinoffs are envisioned from basic science research institutes. EEG should more firmly embrace this possibility, along with the fact that innovation policy potential may be bifurcated or multi-faceted depending on place-based realities. Possible applications for other NICs seeking to reposition their own economies are forwarded.  aPublisher supplied data  aN/AcCollege of Education, Seoul National University 3ageography 3aissues and policy 3atrade balance 3aSouth Korea0 tGeoJournal.g2020 Oct., v. 85, no. 5 p.1241-1255dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl10001x0343-25217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-019-10020-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03645naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245014000166300001800306520211900324536012002443592002802563650002002591650001902611650000902630650001602639650001802655650001702673650002002690650001902710650002002729650002002749650001302769650000902782650001402791650002802805650001702833650001402850650001102864650001502875700001902890700001902909700001902928773012702947856008003074852000903154655001203163IND60623888520221122120100.0181129e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062388852DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X187559252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, Natalie10aClinicopathological features and comorbidities of cats with mild, moderate or severe hyperthyroidism: a radioiodine referral population  ap. 1130-1137.  aThis study sought to explore the clinicopathological features and comorbidities of cats with mild, moderate and severe hyperthyroidism in a radioiodine referral population. Medical records were reviewed, along with results of serum biochemistry, urinalysis, systolic blood pressure and diagnostic imaging performed at the time of radioiodine referral. Cats were grouped by total thyroxine (TT4) levels as mildly (TT4 60.1â124.9 nmol/l), moderately (TT4 125â250 nmol/l) or severely (TT4 >250 nmol/l) hyperthyroid at the time of diagnosis and referral. Thirty percent (42/140) of the cats were <10 years old at diagnosis. In 24.3% (34/140), hyperthyroidism was diagnosed incidentally. The time between diagnosis and referral for radioiodine was significantly longer in cats with severe hyperthyroidism at the time of referral (P = 0.004). An increase in severity group between the time of diagnosis and referral occurred in 38.6% (54/140) of cats. At referral, 54.3% (25/46) of cats with mild, 66.7% (42/63) with moderate and 80.6% (25/31) with severe hyperthyroidism were unstable despite ongoing medical or dietary management. The prevalence of cardiac abnormalities was significantly increased in cats with severe hyperthyroidism (P = 0.014) compared with those with mild or moderate hyperthyroidism. There was no significant difference in the likelihood of renal disease (P = 0.708) or hypertension (P = 0.328) between the groups. Incidental diagnosis of hyperthyroidism occurs commonly, potentially owing to increased disease screening. Cats with severe hyperthyroidism at referral were more likely to be chronically hyperthyroid with a history of poor stabilisation. This subset of patients was significantly more likely to have cardiac abnormalities. Thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy may ultimately affect patient suitability for curative treatments (radioiodine or thyroidectomy) owing to higher anaesthetic risks and potential for decompensation into congestive heart failure with the stress of travel and hospitalisation. Curative therapy should be considered before the development of severe hyperthyroidism.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood chemistry 3acardiomyopathy 3acats 3acomorbidity 3aheart failure 3ahypertension 3ahyperthyroidism 3aimage analysis 3akidney diseases 3amedical records 3apatients 3arisk 3ascreening 3asystolic blood pressure 3atherapeutics 3athyroxine 3atravel 3aurinalysis1 aMurray, Jane K1 aFonfara, Sonja1 aHibbert, Angie0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 20, no. 12 p.1130-1137dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X187559253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04197naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245014700177300001600324520212200340592002802462650000802490650001802498650001402516650001202530650001102542650002102553650000902574650001102583650001502594650002902609650002202638650001702660650001902677650001102696650002502707650001402732650001102746650001502757650000902772650001902781650003702800650003302837650000902870650002002879650001102899650001402910650000902924650001002933650002502943651001002968653003702978653002003015653002603035653003303061653003403094653003003128700006103158700002203219700002003241700002403261700002003285773008903305856008403394852000903478655001203487IND60565136620221119143120.0170320e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056513662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.02.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDudhagara, Dushyant R.10aDistribution, sources and ecological risk assessment of PAHs in historically contaminated surface sediments at Bhavnagar coast, Gujarat, India  ap. 338-346.  aThe concentration, distribution and ecological risk of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been investigated in surface sediments near Bhavnagar coast. The concentration of âPAHs ranged from 5.02 to 981.18Â Î¼gÂ gâ1 dry weight, indicating heavy pollution compared to other historically polluted study sites. It was found to be introduced via mixed origins such as burning of gas, oil, coal, production of petrochemicals, cement, and rubber tires. Domestic fuel burning and motor vehicles are also culprits for air pollution. Industrial effluents and accidental oil spillage can also be considered. PAHs can be exposed through air, water, soil and food sources including ingestion, inhalation, and dermal content in both occupational and non-occupational levels by single or sometimes multiple exposures routes concomitantly. Furthermore, diagnostic ratios, statistical principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) models have confirmed that the sources of PAHs were both - petrogenic and pyrogenic. For both the sites, assessment of ecological risk of the elevated levels of these pollutants has been exercised based on toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) and risk quotient (RQ) methods. The composite results indicated accurately that both the sites, bears potentially acute and chronic health hazards such as decreased immune functionality, genotoxicity, malignancy and developmental malfunctions in humans. The sites studied here and the workers have been exposed to hazardous pollutants for a longer period of time. Evidences indicate that mixtures of PAHs are carcinogenic to humans, based on occupational studies on workers, exposed to these pollutants. Hence, the present study and statistical approaches applied herein clearly indicate the historic mix routes of PAHs that resulted in magnified concentrations leading to high ecosystem risk. Thus, the scientific communities are urged to develop strategies to minimize the concentrations of PAHs from the historically impacted coastlines, thereby concerning for the future investigations and restoration of these sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3abreathing 3aburning 3acement 3acluster analysis 3acoal 3acoasts 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental assessment 3aexposure pathways 3agenotoxicity 3ahealth hazards 3ahumans 3aindustrial effluents 3aingestion 3amodels 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apetrochemicals 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arubber 3asediments 3asoil 3atires 3avehicles (equipment) 3aIndia 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aEcological risk 0aSource identification 0aPrincipal component analysis 0aHierarchical cluster analysis 0aToxic equivalency factors1 aRajpara, Rahul K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7941-19181 aBhatt, Jwalant K.1 aGosai, Haren B.1 aSachaniya, Bhumi K.1 aDave, Bharti P.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 June, v. 213 p.338-346dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.02.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245013400171300001400305520160500319592002801924653001601952653001601968653002401984653002002008653001002028653002302038700002002061700001402081700002102095700001702116700002402133773009502157856008302252852000902335655001202344IND60592198620221120232123.0180331e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059219862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.neuro.2017.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKantar-Gok, Deniz10aChanges of auditory event-related potentials in ovariectomized rats injected with d-galactose: Protective role of rosmarinic acid  ap. 64-74.  aRosmarinic acid (RA), which has multiple bioactive properties, might be a useful agent for protecting central nervous system against age related alterations.

An amplitude reduction of some components of AERPs was observed due to ovariectomy with or without d-galactose administiration and these reduction patterns were diverse for different electrode locations. MMN amplitudes were significantly lower over temporal and right frontal locations in the O and OD groups versus the S and R groups, which was accompanied by increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) levels. RA treatment significantly increased AERP/MMN amplitudes and lowered the TBARS/4-HNE levels in the OR and ODR groups versus the O and OD groups, respectively. Our findings support the potential benefit of RA in the prevention of auditory distortion related to the estrogen deficiency and d-galactose administration at least partly by antioxidant actions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aOvariectomy 0ad-Galactose 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aRosmarinic acid 0aAERPs 0aLipid peroxidation1 aHidisoglu, Enis1 aEr, Hakan1 aAcun, Alev Duygu1 aOlgar, Yusuf1 aYargÄ±coglu, Piraye0 tNeurotoxicology.g2017 Sept., v. 62 p.64-74dElsevier B.V.wJournal:19553x0161-813X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2017.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02124naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009200159300001800251520098200269592002801251650001601279650001001295650002401305650001101329650002001340650001101360650000701371650001501378650003101393650001601424650001201440650001401452700001901466700001801485700001601503773012401519856007401643852000901717655001201726IND60662128720221118060006.0190904e20130625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066212872DNAL7 a10.1039/c3fo60080g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidek, Tomas12aA holistic approach towards defined product attributes by Maillard-type food processing  ap. 1105-1110.  aA fractional factorial experimental design was used to quantify the impact of process and recipe parameters on selected product attributes of extruded products (colour, viscosity, acrylamide, and the flavour marker 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone, HDMF). The study has shown that recipe parameters (lysine, phosphate) can be used to modulate the HDMF level without changing the specific mechanical energy (SME) and consequently the texture of the product, while processing parameters (temperature, moisture) impact both HDMF and SME in parallel. Similarly, several parameters, including phosphate level, temperature and moisture, simultaneously impact both HDMF and acrylamide formation, while pH and addition of lysine showed different trends. Therefore, the latter two options can be used to mitigate acrylamide without a negative impact on flavour. Such a holistic approach has been shown as a powerful tool to optimize various product attributes upon food processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3acolor 3aexperimental design 3aflavor 3afood processing 3alysine 3apH 3aphosphates 3aspecific mechanical energy 3atemperature 3atexture 3aviscosity1 aIllmann, Silke1 aRytz, Andreas1 aBlank, Imre0 tFood & function.g2013 June 25, v. 4, no. 7 p.1105-1110dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3fo60080g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245015300169500001900322520098700341592002801328650002201356650001101378650001901389650001401408650001601422650002101438650001801459650002501477650001401502650001101516650001201527650001901539650002501558653002601583653002801609653001801637653002101655700001801676700001601694700001701710700001601727700001301743700001601756700001301772773010601785856008801891852000901979655001201988IND60727471720221121143559.0210405e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072747172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1121092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yueqi10aHistorical reconstructions of sedimentary organic matter sources and phytoplankton evolution in the Jiaozhou Bay based on sterols and carbon isotope  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBulk organic matter proxies including total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N ratio and carbon stable isotopic composition (Î´Â¹Â³C) combined with sterols in a sediment core were studied to reconstruct both organic matter (OM) sources and phytoplankton evolutions of the Jiaozhou Bay (JZB) during the past ~ 80Â years. The OM source allocations were calculated based on Î´Â¹Â³C and sterol. The results showed that the marine OM (MOM) input was the dominant OM sources, with the marine organic carbon (OCM) proportion of 54.2â78.4% and marine sterol proportion of 63.9â72.7%. The Terrestrial OM (TOM) contribution increased especially since the 1960s, mainly attributed to the increased sewage discharge and usage of fertilizer. Elevated marine primary productivity since the 1980s was mainly attributed to the increased nutrient inputs. Evolution of diatom compared with dinoflagellate in the JZB was closely related to the anthropogenic forcing and climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aMiozoa 3aclimate change 3aevolution 3afertilizers 3amarine pollution 3aphytoplankton 3aprimary productivity 3asediments 3asewage 3asterols 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 0aOrganic matter source 0aPhytoplankton evolution 0aSediment core 0aThe Jiaozhou Bay1 aSong, Jinming1 aDuan, Liqin1 aYuan, Huamao1 aLi, Xuegang1 aLi, Ning1 aZhang, Qian1 aLiu, Jin0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Apr., v. 165 p.112109-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1121093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002900141245015600170500001400326520159600340592002801936650001401964650001501978650001301993650001702006650001302023650000802036650001402044650000902058650000902067700002902076700001802105700002702123700002202150700002102172773012102193856007502314852000902389655001202398IND60715213520221121035415.0201026e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071521352DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101017782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirschberger, Valentina 10aFentanyl Plasma Concentrations after Application of a Transdermal Patch in Three Different Locations to Refine Postoperative Pain Management in Rabbits  aNAL-light  aTransdermal patches allow a noninvasive and âstress freeâ analgesia in rabbits. As fentanyl uptake is dependent on exogenous and endogenous factors of the area where the patch is applied, this study investigated three different locations (neck, inner and outer surfaces of the ear) for fentanyl patch application to provide adequate and reliable fentanyl plasma concentrations above those previously shown to be analgesic. Fentanyl plasma concentration was measured at different time points (3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120 h) and rabbits were assessed for their general conditions and treatment-related side effects. Practicability of the proposed methods was evaluated. Following patch application on the neck, fentanyl plasma concentrations equal to or above the analgesic value were measured in all rabbits between 6 and 72 h. Comparable concentrations were reached between 9 and 48 h in all animals for the outer ear surface. However, for the inner ear surface, analgesic concentrations were not reached, even if practicability was considered the best for this location. Preparation of the neck skin was judged as the most cumbersome due to the clipping of the dense fur and patch removal resulted in erythema. In summary, the application of the fentanyl patch on the neck and outer ear surface allowed the reach of reliable plasma concentrations above the analgesic threshold in rabbits. When applied on the neck, fentanyl patches provided the longest duration of analgesic plasma concentrations, whereas patch application and removal were easier on the outer ear surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesia 3aanalgesics 3aerythema 3aexternal ear 3afentanyl 3afur 3ainner ear 3aneck 3apain1 avon Deimling, Christian 1 aHeider, Anja 1 aSpadavecchia, Claudia 1 aRohrbach, Helene 1 aZeiter, Stephan 0 tAnimals.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101017783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003400152245011200186500002200298500002200320520123500342592002801577650004401605650001401649650002801663650002101691650002101712650001901733650001701752650001301769650001001782650001601792650001301808650001501821650001301836650001501849650003301864650003701897650003701934653002501971653002301996653002402019700002302043700001902066700002602085700006002111773011102171856008602282852000902368655001202377IND60610078720221122100658.0180825s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061007872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmarnath Praphakar, Rajendran10aSilver nanoparticle functionalized CS-g-(CA-MA-PZA) carrier for sustainable anti-tuberculosis drug delivery  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aRecently, drug functionalized biodegradable polymers have been appreciated to be imperative to fabricate multi-drug delivery nanosystems for sustainable drug release. In this work, amphiphilic chitosanâgrafted-(cetyl alcohol-maleic anhydride-pyrazinamide) (CS-g-(CA-MA-PZA)) was synthesized by multi-step reactions. The incorporation of rifampicin (RF) and entrapment of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) on CS-g-(CA-MA-PZA) polymer was carried out by dialysis technique. From the FT-IR experiment, the polymer modification, incorporation of drugs and the entrapment of Ag NPs on micelles were confirmed. The surface morphology of Ag NPs, polymeric system and drug loaded micelles was described by SEM, TEM and AFM techniques. In addition, the controlled release behaviour of CS-g-(CA-MA-PZA) micelles was studied by UVâVis spectroscopy. In vitro cell viability, cell apoptosis and cellular uptake experiments shows that multi-drug delivery system could enhance the biocompatibility and higher the cytotoxicity effect on the cells. Since the prepared amphiphilic polymeric micelles exhibit spotty features and the system is a promising strategy for a novel candidate for immediate therapeutically effects for alveolar macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aapoptosis 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3adialysis 3adrugs 3amacrophages 3amicelles 3ananosilver 3apolymers 3arifampicin 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aAlveolar macrophages 0aPolymeric micelles 0aSilver nanoparticle1 aJeyaraj, Murugaraj1 aAhmed, Mukhtar1 aSuresh Kumar, Subbiah1 aRajan, Mariappan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9569-87440 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007500169300001300244520167200257536012001929592002802049650001402077650001502091650001502106650000902121650001302130650001502143650001402158650000902172650002002181650001302201650002002214650001202234653001002246653002802256653001402284653001102298653002302309653001102332653002302343700002302366700001902389700001802408700002602426700002102452773013002473856008202603852000902685655001202694IND60761361020221120230738.0211228e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076136102DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X2110662682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteagall, Paulo V10a2022 ISFM Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Acute Pain in Cats  ap. 4-30.  aIncreases in cat ownership worldwide mean more cats are requiring veterinary care. Illness, trauma and surgery can result in acute pain, and effective management of pain is required for optimal feline welfare (ie, physical health and mental wellbeing). Validated pain assessment tools are available and pain management plans for the individual patient should incorporate pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy. Preventive and multimodal analgesia, including local anaesthesia, are important principles of pain management, and the choice of analgesic drugs should take into account the type, severity and duration of pain, presence of comorbidities and avoidance of adverse effects. Nursing care, environmental modifications and cat friendly handling are likewise pivotal to the pain management plan, as is a team approach, involving the cat carer. Pain has traditionally been under-recognised in cats. Pain assessment tools are not widely implemented, and signs of pain in this species may be subtle. The unique challenges of feline metabolism and comorbidities may lead to undertreatment of pain and the development of peripheral and central sensitisation. Lack of availability or experience with various analgesic drugs may compromise effective pain management. These Guidelines have been created by a panel of experts and the International Society of Feline Medicine (ISFM) based on the available literature and the authorsâ experience. They are aimed at general practitioners to assist in the assessment, prevention and management of acute pain in feline patients, and to provide a practical guide to selection and dosing of effective analgesic agents.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesia 3aanalgesics 3aanesthesia 3acats 3amedicine 3ametabolism 3aownership 3apain 3apain assessment 3apatients 3aphysical health 3asurgery 0aAcute 0aanti-inflammatory drugs 0abehaviour 0adental 0afacial expressions 0aopioid 0aovariohysterectomy1 aRobertson, Sheilah1 aSimon, Bradley1 aWarne, Leon N1 aShilo-Benjamini, Yael1 aTaylor, Samantha0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g2022 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.4-30dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X2110662683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01978naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245012900173500001900302520077500321592002801096650002001124650001101144650001401155650000901169650002101178650001301199651000901212653002401221653001201245653001501257653002501272653001801297653001901315700002001334700002301354773010601377856008801483852000901571655001201580IND60727471820221121143619.0210405e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072747182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1121102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJawad, Laith A.10aBilateral asymmetry in size of otolith of Otolithes ruber (Bloch & Schneider, 1801) collected from the marine waters of Iraq  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe otolith length and width of adult teleost Otolithes ruber (Bloch & Schneider, 1801) were used to calculate the fluctuating asymmetry in these two characters.

Here, we found larger bodies and larger size at maturity in a northward, lower latitude population of the crab Goniopsis cruentata, which inhabits a hotter, drier environment in comparison with a southward, higher latitude population. Furthermore, the juvenile male gonopods grow more relative to body size in the population characterized by maturation at a smaller size. In contrast, the female abdomen widens at a higher rate among the late maturing population. These results provide further evidence that local environmental conditions play a role in phenotypic variation between populations inhabiting different latitudes. Moreover, they also show that variation in size at maturity and body size can lead to divergent allometric patterns of sexual characteristics that can have a sex-specific response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdomen 3aallometry 3abody size 3acrabs 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3ageographical variation 3ajuveniles 3alatitude 3amales 3aphenotypic variation 3apopulation size 3asexual maturity1 aCalado, Tereza Cristina dos Santos1 aRezende, Carla Ferreira1 aSilva, JosÃ© Roberto Feitosa0 tHelgoland marine research.g2015 Dec., v. 69, no. 4 p.335-342dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1438-387X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10152-015-0441-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245018300172300001800355520156000373592002801933650002001961650002001981650001802001650002602019650002502045650001702070650002402087650001202111650001602123650001802139650001302157650002802170650002002198650002302218650000902241650001302250650001202263650001902275650002102294700003202315700002502347700003002372700002302402700002302425700003002448773012402478856007402602852000902676655001202685IND60662128920221118060048.0190904e20130724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066212892DNAL7 a10.1039/c3fo60083a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMÃ¡rquez-Aguirre, Ana Laura10aEffects of Agave tequilana fructans with different degree of polymerization profiles on the body weight, blood lipids and count of fecal Lactobacilli/Bifidobacteria in obese mice  ap. 1237-1244.  aFructans are dietary fibers with beneficial effects on the gastrointestinal physiology and offer a promising approach for the treatment of some metabolic disorders associated with obesity. In vitro and in vivo studies were developed to test the safety of fructans obtained from Agave tequilana Weber var. azul. Additionally, an in vivo experiment using a diet-induced obesity model was performed to compare the effect of agave fructans with different degree of polymerization (DP) profiles: agave fructans with DP > 10 (LcF), agave FOS with DP < 10 (ScF), and agave fructans with and without demineralization (dTF, TF) versus commercial chicory fructans (OraftiSynergy1â¢) on the body weight change, fat, total cholesterol, triglycerides and count of fecal Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. Results showed that A. tequilana fructans were not mutagenic and were safe even at a dose of 5 g per kg b.w. Obese mice that received ScF showed a significant decrease in body weight gain, fat tissue and total cholesterol without increasing the count of fecal Bifidobacteria. Whereas, obese mice that received LcF and TF showed decreased triglycerides and an increased count of fecal Bifidobacteria. Interestingly, although obese mice that received dTF did not show changes in body weight gain, fat tissue, total cholesterol or triglycerides, they showed an increase in the count of Bifidobacteria. These results demonstrate that both the degree of polymerization and the demineralization process can influence the biological activity of agave fructans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgave tequilana 3aBifidobacterium 3aLactobacillus 3aanimal disease models 3abioactive properties 3ablood lipids 3abody weight changes 3achicory 3acholesterol 3adietary fiber 3afructans 3agastrointestinal system 3ain vivo studies 3ametabolic diseases 3amice 3amutagens 3aobesity 3apolymerization 3atriacylglycerols1 aCamacho RuÃ­z, Rosa MarÃ­a,1 aArriaga-Alba, Myriam1 aPadilla-Camberos, Eduardo1 aKirchmayr, Manuel,1 aBlasco, JosÃ© Luis1 aGonzÃ¡lez-Avila, Marisela0 tFood & function.g2013 July 24, v. 4, no. 8 p.1237-1244dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3fo60083a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01499naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003800141245006700179500002900246520064500275592002800920650002700948650001100975650001400986700002801000773012101028856007501149852000901224655001201233IND60715213720221121035333.0201026e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071521372DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101017802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValcuende del RÃ­o, JosÃ©  MarÃ­a10aSocial Scientific Analysis of Human-Animal Sexual Interactions  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aAn ontological shift has led to a revitalisation of the research area that, within the social sciences, deals with the interactions between humans and animals.

The magnetic nanocomposite was examined using several characterization techniques. The results of XRD and FESEM, analysis showed HA/FeâOâNPs have a crystalline phase and irregular spherical particles respectively. EDAX and FTIR confirmed the presence of specific elements and functional groups of both iron oxide and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles respectively. The surface area and superparamagnetic property of the composite were determined by BET and VSM analysis. Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to optimize the adsorption process to remove of AB113 from aqueous solutions. The optimal adsorption efficiency was found out to be 94.38% at pH 8, AB113 dye concentration 54Â ppm, HA/FeâOâNPs dose 84Â mg, and an agitation speed of 174Â rpm. The monolayer Langmuir isotherm was the best model with a sorption capacity of 109.98Â mg/g which was higher than the reported values. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model displayed a good fit with an RÂ²Â =Â 0.99. Thermodynamic parameters were assessed which confirmed the exothermic adsorption process. Therefore, the synthesized magnetic nanocomposite can be employed as a novel nanoadsorbent for the removal of anionic dyes from waste effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aThunbergia 3aadsorption 3aagitation 3adyes 3aheat production 3ahydroxyapatite 3akinetics 3aleaf extracts 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3apH 3aresearch 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 0aAdsorption 0aResponse surface methodology 0aCentral composite design 0aAcid Blue-113 0aMagnetic nanocomposite 0aHydroxyapatite1 aKini, M.

This study is based on geochemical analyses of 340 surface sediment samples collected in the Green Coast region (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), including Mangaratiba, Angra dos Reis and Ribeira coves and Ilha Grande and Sepetiba bays. This region is influenced by industrial, harbor, urban and tourist activities and was affected by a dam rupture episode that released contaminated material. The results show heterogeneity in the distribution and range of metal concentrations in the study area depending on the supply of metals from natural and anthropogenic sources. Environmental characteristics such as coastal and tidal currents, water temperature and salinity, local depth, sediment grain size, sedimentary dynamics and biogeochemical processes influence the dispersion or retention of metals. The pollution load index (PLI) suggests that Sepetiba Bay is the region with the most environmental degradation due to anthropogenic contamination. In this context, we propose the establishment of new levels of contamination according to the Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, V and Zn concentrations in sediments of salt and brackish waters, considering I) background level; II) level 1 - with anthropogenic influence; and III) level 2 - contaminated. The results of this work also suggest that, except for zinc, the range of metal concentrations admitted by Brazilian legislation are quite permissive and not adequate for Brazilian coastal environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acoasts 3alaws and regulations 3amarine pollution 3apollution load 3asalinity 3asediment contamination 3atourists 3awater temperature 3azinc 3aBrazil 0aMetals 0aPollution 0aEnvironmental geochemistry 0aMarine sediment 0aEnvironmental legislation1 aRocha, David Silva1 aGuerra, Josefa Varela1 aCunha, Bruno AlcÃ¢ntara1 aMartins, Maria VirgÃ­nia Alves1 aGeraldes, Mauro CÃ©sar0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Apr., v. 165 p.112113-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1121133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012300175300001400298520110500312592002801417650001801445650001601463650002201479650002201501650001601523650004401539700001601583700001701599773009301616856008401709852000901793655001201802IND60113077820221122220529.0141111e20130531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011307782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotilva, Maria-JosÃ©10aAnalysis of food polyphenols by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry: An overview  ap. 66-82.  aPhenolic compounds, which are widely distributed in plant-derived foods, recently attracted much attention due to their health benefits, so their determination in food samples is a topic of increasing interest. In the last few years, the development of chromatographic columns packed with sub-2Î¼m particles and the modern high resolution mass spectrometry (MS) have opened up new possibilities for improving the analytical methods for complex sample matrices, such as ingredients, foods and biological samples. In addition, they have emerged as an ideal tool for profiling complex samples due to its speed, efficiency, sensitivity and selectivity. The present review addresses the use of the improved liquid chromatography (LC), ultra-high performance LC (UHPLC), coupled to MS or tandem MS (MS/MS) as the detector system for the determination of phenolic compounds in food samples. Additionally, the different strategies to extract, quantify the phenolic compounds and to reduce the matrix effect (%ME) are also reviewed. Finally, a briefly outline future trends of UHPLCâMS methods is commented.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood analysis 3aingredients 3amass spectrometry 3aplant-based foods 3apolyphenols 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aSerra, Aida1 aMaciÃ , Alba0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 May 31, v. 1292 p.66-82dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008700170300001800257520118600275592002801461650001601489650001501505650001901520650001301539650002001552650002301572700002201595700002001617700002501637773010501662856008601767852000901853655001201862IND60578301620221120183504.0170812e20170613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057830162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b004502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei-Liang10a50th Anniversary Perspective: Polymer Brushes: Novel Surfaces for Future Materials  ap. 4089-4113.  aPolymer brushes have become a significant focus of polymer research with the need for straightforward and versatile surface modification. With the development of controlled radical polymerization from surfaces, new theoretical models, and sophisticated characterization tools, the resulting ability to control brush density and brush thickness gives unparalleled control over surface properties and functionality. By increasing brush density, a stretched brush conformation is formed as a result of constraining the cross-sectional area of that brush strand which thereby influences the interactions of molecules with the brush surface. The associated residual stress also gives polymer brushes properties distinct from an equivalent layer of coated polymer chains. Examples of uncharged and charged âgrown fromâ polymer brushes, the effect of architecture on physical behavior, and the influence of nanoscale patterning will be described. The use of brush surfaces in biology relevant applications will be discussed and include resistance to nonspecific binding, cell bioadhesion, their use as platforms for biosensors, thermoresponsive surfaces, and targeted protein binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioadhesion 3abiosensors 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aprotein binding 3atheoretical models1 aCordero, Roselynn1 aTrÃ Ìn, Háº£i,1 aOber, Christopher K.0 tMacromolecules.g2017 June 13, v. 50, no. 11 p.4089-4113dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b004503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245008600174500001900260520097800279592002801257650002101285650001101306650001101317650001101328650001101339650001101350653001801361653001801379653002401397653002701421653002201448653002301470700001801493700002101511700001901532700001801551773010601569856008801675852000901763655001201772IND60727472220221120172619.0210405e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072747222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1121162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChenillat, Fanny10aFate of floating plastic debris released along the coasts in a global ocean model  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMarine plastic pollution is a global issue, from the shores to the open ocean. Understanding the pathway and fate of plastic debris is fundamental to manage and reduce plastic pollution. Here, the fate of floating plastic pollution discharged along the coasts is studied by comparing two sources, one based on river discharges and the other on mismanaged waste from coastal populations, using a Lagrangian numerical analysis in a global ocean circulation model. About 1/3 of the particles end up in the open ocean and 2/3 on beaches. The input scenario largely influences the accumulation of particles toward the main subtropical convergence zones, with the South Pacific and North Atlantic being mostly fed by the coastal population inputs. The input scenario influences the number of beached particles that end up in several coastal areas. Beaching occurs mainly locally, although a significant number of particles travel long distances, allowing for global connectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3amarine pollution 3amodels 3aoceans 3arivers 3atravel 3awastes 0aMarine debris 0aMicroplastics 0aLagrangian analysis 0aOcean surface pathways 0aCoastal pollution 0aOcean connectivity1 aHuck, Thierry1 aMaes, Christophe1 aGrima, Nicolas1 aBlanke, Bruno0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Apr., v. 165 p.112116-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1121163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245013600158300001600294500002000310520064400330592002800974596005801002596005801060596005801118596005801176596005801234596007901292650002601371650001501397650001501412650001001427650002201437650003801459650002001497650001301517650001901530650002601549700001601575700001701591700005001608773011301658856008001771852000901851655001201860IND60786921120221118033020.0220806e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078692112DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.136572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Hui12aA newly identified photolyase from ArthrospiraÂ platensis possesses a unique methenyltetrahydrofolate chromophoreâbinding pattern  ap. 740-750.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), as a common DNA damage caused by UV radiation, often lead to skin cancer.

Consequently, there has been a steady rise in the number of bariatric operations done worldwide in recent years with the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (gastric bypass) being the most commonly performed operation3. Against this background, it is important to understand the physiological mechanisms by which gastric bypass induces and maintains body weight loss. These mechanisms are yet not fully understood, but may include reduced hunger and increased satiation4,5, increased energy expenditure6,7, altered preference for food high in fat and sugar8,9, altered salt and water handling of the kidney10 as well as alterations in gut microbiota11. Such changes seen after gastric bypass may at least partly stem from how the surgery alters the hormonal milieu because gastric bypass increases the postprandial release of peptide-YY (PYY) and glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1), hormones that are released by the gut in the presence of nutrients and that reduce eating12. During the last two decades numerous studies using rats have been carried out to further investigate physiological changes after gastric bypass. The gastric bypass rat model has proven to be a valuable experimental tool not least as it closely mimics the time profile and magnitude of human weight loss, but also allows researchers to control and manipulate critical anatomic and physiologic factors including the use of appropriate controls. Consequently, there is a wide array of rat gastric bypass models available in the literature reviewed elsewhere in more detail 13-15. The description of the exact surgical technique of these models varies widely and differs e.g. in terms of pouch size, limb lengths, and the preservation of the vagal nerve. If reported, mortality rates seem to range from 0 to 35%15. Furthermore, surgery has been carried out almost exclusively in male rats of different strains and ages. Pre- and postoperative diets also varied significantly. Technical and experimental variations in published gastric bypass rat models complicate the comparison and identification of potential physiological mechanisms involved in gastric bypass. There is no clear evidence that any of these models is superior, but there is an emerging need for standardization of the procedure to achieve consistent and comparable data. This article therefore aims to summarize and discuss technical and experimental details of our previously validated and published gastric bypass rat model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abariatric surgery 3abody weight changes 3adiet 3adigestive system 3aenergy 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3ahunger 3amales 3amortality 3anerve tissue 3anutrients 3aobesity 3apeptide YY 3arats 3aweight loss1 aAbegg, Kathrin1 aSeyfried, Florian1 aLutz, Thomas A.1 ale Roux, Carel W.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 June 11, , no. 64 p.e3940-e3940dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/39403Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/3940/roux-en-y-gastric-bypass-operation-in-rats  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245008400198300001800282500002000300520212400320592002802444650001502472650002002487650002602507650003002533650001102563650001102574650001502585700002102600773011602621856007402737852000902811655001202820IND60719251320221118011437.0201201e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071925132DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.053172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Adam B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6420-165910aTesting the ability of species distribution models to infer variable importance  ap. 1801-1813.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aModels of speciesâ distributions and niches are frequently used to infer the importance of rangeâ and nicheâdefining variables. However, the degree to which these models can reliably identify important variables and quantify their influence remains unknown. Here we use a series of simulations to explore how well models can 1) discriminate between variables with different influence and 2) calibrate the magnitude of influence relative to an âomniscientâ model. To quantify variable importance, we trained generalized additive models (GAMs), Maxent and boosted regression trees (BRTs) on simulated data and tested their sensitivity to permutations in each predictor. Importance was inferred by calculating the correlation between permuted and unpermuted predictions, and by comparing predictive accuracy of permuted and unpermuted predictions using AUC and the continuous Boyce index. In scenarios with one influential and one uninfluential variable, models failed to discriminate reliably between variables when training occurrences were < 8â64, prevalence was > 0.5, spatial extent was small, environmental data had coarse resolution and spatial autocorrelation was low, or when pairwise correlation between environmental variables was |r| > 0.7. When two variables influenced the distribution equally, importance was underestimated when species had narrow or intermediate niche breadth. Interactions between variables in how they shaped the niche did not affect inferences about their importance. When variables acted unequally, the effect of the stronger variable was overestimated. GAMs and Maxent discriminated between variables more reliably than BRTs, but no algorithm was consistently wellâcalibrated visâÃ âvis the omniscient model. Algorithmâspecific measures of importance like Maxent's changeâinâgain metric were less robust than the permutation test. Overall, high predictive accuracy did not connote robust inferential capacity. As a result, requirements for reliably measuring variable importance are likely more stringent than for creating models with high predictive accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aautocorrelation 3aenvironmental factors 3ageographical distribution 3amodels 3aniches 3aprediction1 aSantos, Maria J.0 tEcography.g2020 Dec., v. 43, no. 12 p.1801-1813dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3867072x0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.053173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008600165520150600251592002801757650002101785650001501806650001701821650002201838650001301860650001101873650001401884650001301898653002501911653001901936653001601955653001801971653003201989653001802021700001402039700001702053700001602070700001602086700002002102700001502122700001802137700001602155773010402171856008502275852000902360655001202369IND60767725220221123045343.0220523e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076772522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1129552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenjie10aEffects of Cu doping on electrochemical NOx removal by La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 perovskites  aElectrochemical removal of nitrogen oxides (NOâ) by perovskite electrodes is a promising method due to its low cost, simple operation and no secondary pollution. In this study, a series of Laâ.âSrâ.âMnâââCuâOâ (xÂ =Â 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15) perovskites are fabricated as the improved electrodes of solid electrolyte cells (SECs) for NOâ removal and the effects of Cu doping are investigated systematacially. Multiple characterization methods are carried out to analyze the physicochemical properties of perovskites firstly. Then the performances of cells based on various perovskites are evaluated by the measurements of electrochemical properties and NOâ conversions. The results show that the Cu-doped electrode has more surface oxygen vacancies and a better redox property, thus having a higher NOâ conversion and smaller polarization resistance. The electrode based on Laâ.âSrâ.âMnâ.âCuâ.âOâ has the maximum 70.8% NOâ conversion and the lowest 36.3Â Î©Â cmÂ² Râ value in the atmosphere of 1000Â ppm NO at 700Â Â°C. First-principle calculation reveals that the Cu-doped electrode is easier to form surface oxygen vacancy, while the surface oxygen vacancy plays an important role on electron transfer between electrode and NOâ molecule. This study not only provides a new strategy to enhance the electrode performance for NOâ removal in SECs but reveals the fundamental effect of Cu doping on the properties of Laâ.âSrâ.âMnOâ perovskites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apollution 3aresearch 0aPerovskite electrode 0aLa0.8Sr0.2MnO3 0aNOx removal 0aNano catalyst 0aElectrochemical performance 0aAir pollutant1 aLiang, Ke1 aWang, Jiabin1 aWen, Junhui1 aShi, Jingyi1 aZhang, Zhenzong1 aJiang, Wei1 aZhang, Ruiqin1 aYu, Honbing0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 July, v. 210 p.112955-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1129553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245010100178300001600279520174400295592002802039650002802067650002002095650002702115650001102142653002902153653001802182653003002200653001302230653002302243700006002266700003202326773012502358856008502483852000902568655001202577IND60614431520221121004227.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061443152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2018.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerraciolli, Matheus A.10aNeglecting spatial autocorrelation causes underestimation of the error of sugarcane yield models  ap. 233-240.  aWith the increased application of information technology in agriculture, data is being produced and used in an unprecedented scale. While these advances, combined with machine learning techniques, benefited yield modeling, most of the current literature about data-driven yield modeling has not yet accounted for potential sources of correlation in data, assuming independence between samples. In this scenario, random sampling can lead to correlated samples across sets being used for model evaluation. We implemented a spatially-aware protocol and compared it with the naive approach of assuming independence between samples. The protocols were applied through all the model development pipeline: data splitting for hold-out sets, feature selection, cross-validation for model adjustment and model evaluation. Three different machine learning techniques were used to create models in each protocol. The resulting models were evaluated both in the validation set created by each protocol and in a manually created independent set. This independent set ensured there was no auto-correlation between the samples used for modeling. We showed that assuming independence when modeling yield leads to underestimating model errors and overfit during model adjustment. Despite better error tracking, the model with the smallest error in the test set was not the model with the smallest validation error, suggesting overfit for the model selection. While this effect was small for the spatially-aware protocol, the effect was a lot stronger in the naive protocol. Future efforts in yield modeling should address the effect of spatial auto-correlation and other potential sources of correlation to improve correctness and robustness of the results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aautocorrelation 3ainformation technology 3amodels 0aBoosted regression trees 0aRandom forest 0aSupport vector regression 0aRReliefF 0aSpatial clustering1 aBocca, Felipe F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2956-52861 aRodrigues, Luiz Henrique A.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2019 June, v. 161 p.233-240dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245011700161500001400278520157300292592002801865650001601893650001401909650001501923650001501938650003101953650001801984650001402002650000902016650001302025650001002038650004002048650000902088700001702097700001402114700002002128773012102148856007502269852000902344655001202353IND60715214120221121023535.0201026e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071521412DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101017842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xueying 14aThe Differential Composition of Whey Proteomes in Hu Sheep Colostrum and Milk during Different Lactation Periods  aNAL-light  aColostrum and milk proteins are essential resources for the growth and development of the newborns, while their kinds and amounts vary greatly during the lactation period. This study was conducted to better understand whey proteome and its changes at six lactation time points (0 d, 3 d, 7 d, 14 d, 28 d, and 56 d after lambing) in Hu sheep. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF MS) technologies, a total of 52 differentially expressed protein spots (DEPS), corresponding to 25 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), were obtained. The protein spots abundance analysis revealed that the proteins are the most abundant at 0 d after lambing. Gene ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were used to explore the biological functions of the DEPs. The biological process was mainly involved in localization, the single-organism process, the cellular process, and a series of immune processes. The cellular components engaged in the extracellular region were the cell, organelle, and membrane. The most prevalent molecular function was binding activity. In addition, the DEPs were involved in nine significant pathways, including the Hippo signaling pathway and Complement and coagulation cascades. These results intuitively presented the changes in Hu sheep whey proteins during a 56-d lactation period, and revealed potential biological functions of the DEPs, providing a scientific basis for early weaning.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoagulation 3acolostrum 3acomplement 3adesorption 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3alactation 3amilk 3aproteome 3asheep 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3awhey1 aLiu, Xinxin 1 aLi, Fadi 1 aYue, Xiangpeng 0 tAnimals.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101017843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245009700165300001800262520077600280592002801056650002201084650002201106650001601128650001001144650001501154650001901169650001601188650001401204650002101218650001801239650001101257650002201268650002301290650002101313650002201334650000901356700001701365700002301382773012401405856007401529852000901603655001201612IND60662129320221118060004.0190904e20130724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066212932DNAL7 a10.1039/c3fo60094g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeixeira, Antoinette10aFuran fatty acids efficiently rescue brain cells from cell death induced by oxidative stress  ap. 1209-1215.  aTreatment of rat brain C6 astroglioma cells with furan fatty acid F6 prior to exposure to hydrogen peroxide shows a strong protective effect of F6 against cell death resulting from oxidative stress. This protective effect is obtained only for F6 administered as a free fatty acid and with an intact furan ring. It is proposed that brain cells are rescued by F6 scavenging radicals elicited by lipid peroxidation within the cell membrane. Oxidative processes outside the cell membrane, such as protein carbonylation, are not affected by F6. Furan fatty acids such as those present in fish oils and marine organisms are likely beneficial for consumption in reducing the risk of diseases that have been implicated to arise from oxidative stress, such as Alzheimer's disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aaquatic organisms 3aastrocytoma 3abrain 3acell death 3acell membranes 3afatty acids 3afish oils 3afree fatty acids 3afree radicals 3afurans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3arats1 aCox, Ruud C.1 aEgmond, Maarten R.0 tFood & function.g2013 July 24, v. 4, no. 8 p.1209-1215dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3fo60094g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245006500196300001800261500002000279520106600299592002801365650002001393650002601413650001701439650001201456700006101468773011601529856007401645852000901719655001201728IND60719251520221118011524.0201201e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071925152DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.052812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Youhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6780-642610aUnifying conspecificâencounter index v and Moran's I index  ap. 1902-1904.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSingleâspecies distributional patterns have been well studied and quantified using a negative binomial model. However, it is still unclear how to quantify multiâspecies distribution patterns. A previous study (Chen et al. 2019) developed a simple conspecificâencounter index for quantifying multiâspecies distributional aggregation patterns when biodiversity data are collected in a consecutive scheme along line transects. Here, through simple derivation, we reported that the previously proposed conspecificâencounter index had a close association with Moran's I index, which has been widely applied in spatial ecology for describing spatial autocorrelation of ecological data. Our proof unified the conspecificâencounter index that is applied under the context of lineâtransect sampling and Moran's I index that is applied under the context of spatial ecology. The unification sheds light on the development of new statistical metrics for quantifying biological diversity and distribution patterns when line transects are used in field surveys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3abinomial distribution 3abiodiversity 3asurveys1 aShen, TsungâJen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1742-97300 tEcography.g2020 Dec., v. 43, no. 12 p.1902-1904dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3867072x0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.052813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245016700159300001600326520162800342592002801970650002701998650002802025650001002053650002002063650002602083650002002109650002002129650002302149650001502172650001902187650001802206650001102224650000702235650001402242650001302256650001102269650003902280653005902319653001902378653001702397653001202414653002402426653000902450653002602459700002102485700002602506773011502532856007702647852000902724655001202733IND60644528020221119025046.0190516s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064452802DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2017-01282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMÃ©ndez, E.10aTwo sodium pumps in the hepatopancreas of the intertidal euryhaline crab Neohelicegranulata: biochemical characteristics and differential modulation after feeding  ap. 576-584.  aNo study has been done on the existence, biochemical characteristics, and modulation of Kâº-independent ouabain-insensitive Naâº ATPase activity (the second sodium pump) in the digestive tract of intertidal euryhaline crabs and moreover on the coexistence and modulation under distinct physiological and (or) environmental conditions of different sodium pumps. We determined the occurrence, characteristics, and responses at different times (0, 1, 24, 48, and 120 h) after feeding upon distinct salinities of Naâº ATPase activity and Naâº/Kâº ATPase in the hepatopancreas of Neohelice granulata (Dana, 1851), which is a model species. The stimulation by Naâº under total inhibition of Naâº/Kâº ATPase activity revealed the occurrence of Naâº ATPase activity that was totally inhibited by 2 mmolÂ·LâÂ¹ furosemide, exhibits MichaelisâMenten kinetics for ATP (apparent Kâ = 0.52 Â± 0.16 mmolÂ·LâÂ¹), and highest activity at around pH 7.4. In crabs acclimated to 35 psu (osmoconforming conditions), Naâº ATPase activity was highly increased (about 15-fold) (532 Â± 58 nmol PiÂ·mg proteinâ»Â¹Â·minâ»Â¹) in the hepatopancreas 48 h after feeding. In 10 psu (hyper-regulating conditions), Naâº ATPase activity decreased in the hepatopancreas 24 h after feeding (7 Â± 9 nmol PiÂ·mg proteinâ»Â¹Â·minâ»Â¹) and recovered initial values after 48 h (24 Â± 35 nmol PiÂ·mg proteinâ»Â¹Â·minâ»Â¹). Unlike Naâº ATPase, Naâº/Kâº ATPase activity did not change after feeding at any salinity, suggesting the specific modulation of the second sodium pump and its role in postprandial adjustments in the hepatopancreas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acrabs 3adigestive tract 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme kinetics 3aeuryhaline species 3afurosemide 3ahepatopancreas 3alittoral zone 3amodels 3apH 3apotassium 3asalinity 3asodium 3asodium-potassium-exchanging ATPase 0aK+-independent ouabain-insensitive Na+ ATPase activity 0ahepatopancreas 0asodium pumps 0afeeding 0aNeohelice granulata 0acrab 0asouthwestern Atlantic1 aCaruso Neves, C.1 aLÃ³pez MaÃ±anes, A.A.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2018, v. 96, no. 6 p.576-584dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2017-01283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009100171300001600262520108100278592002801359650001501387650001801402650002301420700001401443700001601457700001901473773011701492856008601609990002301695852000901718655001201727IND60093741520221122215447.0141103e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009374152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemolab.2012.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yingwei10aDynamical process monitoring using dynamical hierarchical kernel partial least squares  ap. 150-158.  aIn the paper, dynamical hierarchical kernel partial least squares (DHKPLS) algorithm is proposed and a new monitoring approach is proposed based on DHKPLS. The original multiway partial least squares (MPLS) process monitoring method has the following disadvantages: 1) MPLS is a linear projection method, which can't effectively capture the nonlinear features existing in most batch processes. 2) It is limited that complete batch process data is indispensable. Hierarchical kernel partial least squares (HKPLS) can solve these problems. However, HKPLS is a fixed-model monitoring technique, which gives false alarms when it is used to monitor real processes whose normal operation involves dynamical changes. In this paper, a DHKPLS algorithm is proposed to solve dynamical problems. DHKPLS diagnoses faults without need of estimating the uncompleted portion of the testing batch. It reduces false alarms and provides reliability when applied it to monitor complex processes. Then the online monitoring system is set up, which can track different types of variations closely.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aleast squares 3aprocess monitoring1 aLi, Shuai1 aHu, Zhiyong1 aSong, Chonghui0 tChemometrics and intelligent laboratory systems.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 118 p.150-158dElsevier B.V.x0169-74397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2012.07.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011900169520149400288592002801782650001301810650001001823650001001833650001101843650002201854650001401876650001301890650001901903650001701922650002101939650002201960650002001982650001402002653002202016653002502038653001902063653001502082653001902097653002102116700001302137700001202150700001502162700001902177700001702196700001302213700001602226700001502242700001302257700001702270773011402287856008602401852000902487655001202496IND60786166820221118064634.0220914e20221005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078616682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1296812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Weixia10aImmunotoxicity of pentachlorophenol to a marine bivalve species and potential toxification mechanisms underpinning  aThe ubiquitous presence of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in ocean environments threatens marine organisms. However, its effects on immunity of marine invertebrates at environmentally realistic levels are still largely unknown. In this study, the immunotoxicity of PCP to a representative bivalve species was evaluated. In addition, its impacts on metabolism, energy supply, detoxification, and oxidative stress status were also analysed by physiological examination as well as comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to reveal potential mechanisms underpinning. Results illustrated that the immunity of blood clams was evidently hampered upon PCP exposure. Additionally, significant alterations in energy metabolism were detected in PCP-exposed clams. Meanwhile, the expressions of key detoxification genes and the in vivo contents (or activity) of key detoxification enzymes were markedly altered. Exposure to PCP also triggered significant elevations in intracellular ROS and MDA whereas evident suppression of haemocyte viability. The abovementioned findings were further supported by transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. Our results suggest that PCP may hamper the immunity of the blood clam by (i) constraining the cellular energy supply through disrupting metabolism; and (ii) damaging haemocytes through inducing oxidative stress. Considering the high similarity of immunity among species, many marine invertebrates may be threatened by PCP, which deserves more attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3ablood 3aclams 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3ahemocytes 3aimmunity 3aimmunotoxicity 3ametabolomics 3aoxidative stress 3apentachlorophenol 3atranscriptomics 3aviability 0aPentachlorophenol 0aMarine invertebrates 0aImmunotoxicity 0aMetabolism 0aDetoxification 0aOxidative damage1 aTang, Yu1 aHan, Yu1 aHuang, Lin1 aZhou, Weishang1 aZhou, Lisan,1 aHu, Yuan1 aLu, Rongmao1 aWang, Fang1 aShi, Wei1 aLiu, Guangxu0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Oct. 05, v. 439 p.129681-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1296813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245009300163300002000256500001900276520147400295592002801769650002101797650002401818650002501842650002201867650002601889650001301915650002201928650002601950650001501976651001001991700005202001700001202053700002202065700005802087700002102145773014202166856007902308852000902387655001202396IND60671564920221119030206.0191003e20190828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067156492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b029732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Shitong10aEnvironmental Benefits of Engine Remanufacture in Chinaâs Circular Economy Development  ap. 11294-11301.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChina has recently implemented broad strategies aimed at achieving a circular economy by providing subsidies for the remanufacture industry and setting a target of 15% increase in energy efficiency in industrial production across sectors, among other strategies. Here, we examine the environmental implications of these policies in the context of engine remanufacture, using an environmental computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Results indicate that both the subsidy policy and energy efficiency improvement target can contribute to economic growth and emission reductions, but the subsidy policy is estimated to have far greater impacts. The implementation of both can reinforce each other, generating higher economic and environmental benefits than the sum of each occurrence alone. Another major finding from our model is that an additional remanufactured engine only displaces 0.42 (90% confidence interval from 0.32 to 0.47) of a new engine (comprised of new parts), mainly because the lower prices of remanufactured engines lead to greater consumption. This ratio is much lower than the 1:1 perfect displacement commonly assumed in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. Overall, our study suggests that the subsidizing of engine remanufacture in China can help promote the industry, improve overall economic welfare, and contribute to environmental targets. Our study also contributes to the estimation of more realistic product displacement ratios in LCA.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3aconfidence interval 3aeconomic development 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental science 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3alife cycle assessment 3atechnology 3aChina1 aYang, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1131-61961 aLi, Tao1 aSmith, Timothy M.1 aTan, George Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2415-113X1 aZhang, Hong-Chao0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Aug. 28, v. 53, no. 19 p.11294-11301dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b029733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002300175245007000198300001400268520105500282592002801337650001201365650002001377650001601397650002001413650001001433650001101443650001501454700001701469700001501486773014801501856006801649856010101717990002301818852000901841655001201850IND60643363120221121233002.0190510e20120508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064336312DNAL7 a10.3791/39452doi7 aPMC34681932pmcid7 a225883532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinert, Brian D.10aMonitoring the wall mechanics during stent deployment in a vessel  ap. e3945.  aClinical trials have reported different restenosis rates for various stent designs1. It is speculated that stent-induced strain concentrations on the arterial wall lead to tissue injury, which initiates restenosis2-7. This hypothesis needs further investigations including better quantifications of non-uniform strain distribution on the artery following stent implantation. A non-contact surface strain measurement method for the stented artery is presented in this work. ARAMIS stereo optical surface strain measurement system uses two optical high speed cameras to capture the motion of each reference point, and resolve three dimensional strains over the deforming surface8,9. As a mesh stent is deployed into a latex vessel with a random contrasting pattern sprayed or drawn on its outer surface, the surface strain is recorded at every instant of the deformation. The calculated strain distributions can then be used to understand the local lesion response, validate the computational models, and formulate hypotheses for further in vivo study.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3aclinical trials 3adeformation 3ain vivo studies 3alatex 3amodels 3amonitoring1 aZhao, Shijia1 aGu, Linxia0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 May 08, , no. 63 p.e3945-e3945dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/39453Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/3945/monitoring-the-wall-mechanics-during-stent-deployment-in-a-vessel  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011000163500002200273520143700295592002801732650001701760650002901777650001201806650001701818650002601835650001401861650003501875650003401910650000901944650002001953650001901973650001301992650001502005651001002020653001202030653001202042653001002054653000802064653002702072700001302099700001902112700001802131700001402149700001702163700001402180700002002194700001802214700001502232700001702247773008402264856008402348852000902432655001202441IND60561092920221122061313.0170606s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056109292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jie10aPCDD/Fs distribution characteristics and health risk assessment in fly ash discharged from MSWIs in China  aPre-press version  aThis study provided distribution and health risk information of PCDD/Fs in fly ash from 4 municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWIs) in four seasons from four sites, including Zhengzhou City in Henan Province, Chuzhou City in Anhui Province, Jilin City in Jilin Province and Zibo City in Shandong Province. The I-TEQ values of PCDD/Fs ranged from 0.0707 to 0.7742 ng I-TEQ/g, and no identical sequence occurred during four seasons in different sampling sites. The stabilization process might efficiently reduce the content and toxicology of PCDD/Fs in fly ash. The value of PCDD/PCDF in fly ash ranged from 0.145 to 0.787 after solidification. The characteristic index (DCI) of 2,3,4,7,8-P5CDF was 0.803 with 6.6% under 95% probability for fly ash samples discharged from MSWIs. The 95th percentile carcinogenic risks (CRs) for onsite workers were lower than the threshold value (10-5), suggesting that the cancer risk levels of PCDD/Fs in fly ash for onsite workers were acceptable. The 95th percentile non-carcinogenic risks (non-CRs) for onsite workers were lower than 1, suggesting obvious non-carcinogenic effect was developed for onsite workers. This paper provide an overview information on the distribution of PCDD/Fs in fly ash during four seasons, and it could be used as an important fingerprint to distinguish the fly ash sources. Thus, the research could provide basic information for fly ash management in environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3adibenzofuran 3aenvironmental management 3afly ash 3aincinerators 3amunicipal solid waste 3aneoplasms 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asolidification 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3aChina 0aPCDD/Fs 0aFly ash 0aMSWIs 0aDCI 0aHealth risk assessment1 aHu, Juan1 aZhu, Gengzheng1 aZhang, Dadang1 aZhu, Yuyi1 aChen, Zhihai1 aLi, Jiafu1 aZhang, Hongjian1 aTang, Jinshun1 aNie, Jihua1 aZhang, Shuyu0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013900163520131800302592002801620650001701648650002001665650001101685650001501696650001301711650002001724650002101744650001701765650000901782650001101791653003001802653001001832653002001842653002601862653002501888653001901913700001601932700002201948700003001970773013302000856008502133852000902218655001202227IND60727472720221120172508.0211219e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072747272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.1102502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Juan10aClimate-driven hydrological change and carbonate platform demise induced by the PaleoceneâEocene Thermal Maximum (southern Pyrenees)  aThe Campo section in the Spanish Pyrenees is classical for shallow-water Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) studies. Despite extensive work in the last decades, the stratigraphic location of the onset of the negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE), and hence the Paleocene/Eocene (P/E) boundary, remains a matter of considerable debate in the Campo section. Here we present new biostratigraphic, sedimentological and carbon-isotopic data across the late Paleocene to Eocene strata to constrain the precise stratigraphic position of the P/E boundary and investigate environmental changes across the PETM. Foraminiferal assemblages of biozone SBZ4 found below the Claret Formation are replaced by SBZ6 assemblages above. Detailed microfacies analysis indicated that the pre-PETM upper Navarri Formation represents transgressive inner-ramp deposits, overlain unconformably by mixed carbonate-siliciclastic deposits of the syn-PETM Claret Formation, overlain unconformably in turn by renewed carbonate-ramp deposition in the post-PETM lower Serraduy Formation. The temporary demise of the carbonate ramp during the PETM is ascribed to increased siliciclastic supply associated with a significant change in regional hydrology driven by an increase in magnitude and frequency of extreme rainfall and runoff events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEocene epoch 3aPaleocene epoch 3acarbon 3acarbonates 3aisotopes 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3arain 3arunoff 0aPaleocene-Eocene boundary 0aCampo 0aCarbon isotopes 0aCarbonate microfacies 0aSiliciclastic supply 0aClimate change1 aHu, Xiumian1 aGarzanti, Eduardo1 aBouDagher-Fadel, Marcelle0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 567 p.110250-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.1102503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245017100167300002000338520184100358592002802199650002502227650002202252650002202274650001602296650002002312650001102332650001702343650001202360650001502372650001902387650001302406650002002419650000702439650001702446650001502463650001102478700001202489700001702501700001602518700001302534700005802547773013102605856008502736852000902821655001202830IND60761361820221120230653.0211228e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076136182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c037982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Wentong10aAggregation-Induced Emission Effect within Peroxyoxalate-Loaded Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles for Efficient Harvest of Chemiluminescence Energy in Aqueous Solutions  ap. 17043-17050.  aAggregation-induced emission (AIE) molecules that can avoid the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect and break the concentration limit have been widely used for biosensing. Similar to fluorescence dyes, AIE molecules can be chemiexcited simply by a peroxyoxalate-based chemiluminescence (CL) reaction, but the hydrolysis of peroxyoxalate is often a problem in an aqueous solution. Herein, we report an AIE effect within peroxyoxalate-loaded silica nanoparticles (PMSNs) for an efficient harvest of CL energy as well as alleviation of bis(2,4,5-trichloro-6-carbopentoxyphenyl) oxalate (CPPO) hydrolysis. Peroxyoxalate (i.e., CPPO) and AIE molecules (i.e., 1,2-benzothiazol-2-triphenylamino acrylonitrile, BTPA) were loaded together within the mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) to synthesize the BTPA-PMSN nanocomposite. The BTPA-PMSNs not only allowed CPPO to be dispersed well in an aqueous solution but also avoided the hydrolysis of CPPO. Meanwhile, the proximity between BTPA and CPPO molecules in the mesopores of MSNs facilitated the BTPA aggregate to harvest the energy from CL intermediates. Hence, the CL system of BTPA-PMSNs can work efficiently in aqueous solutions at a physiological pH. The CL quantum yield of the BTPA-PMSN system was measured to be 9.91 Ã 10ââµ, about 20â¯000-fold higher than that obtained in the rhodamine B (RhB, a typical ACQ dye)-PMSN system. Using BTPA-PMSNs for HâOâ sensing, a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 5 nM can be achieved, 1000-fold lower than that achieved in the RhB-PMSNs system. Due to the feasibility of working at a physiological pH, this CL system is also quite suitable for the detection of oxidase substrates such as glucose and cholesterol. This BTPA-PMSN CL system with the merits of high CL quantum yield at a physiological pH is appealing for biosensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aaqueous solutions 3achemiluminescence 3acholesterol 3adetection limit 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3ananocomposites 3aoxalates 3aoxidoreductases 3apH 3aporous media 3arhodamines 3asilica1 aLi, Lin1 aYuan, Jiajia1 aMa, Xuejuan1 aJia, Jia1 aZhang, Xinfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0865-70610 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 93, no. 51 p.17043-17050dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c037983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013400167520132200301592002801623650001301651650002801664650001501692650001201707650001301719650001901732650000901751650001701760650001701777650001601794650001601810650001301826650002001839653001201859653002801871653001401899653000801913700001301921700001601934700001501950700001401965773011401979856008602093852000902179655001202188IND60786167020221118064645.0220914e20221005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078616702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1296832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTu, Jia-Wei10aConstruction of CdS-Tetrahymena thermophila hybrid system by efficient cadmium adsorption for dye removal under light irradiation  aThe water pollution caused by heavy metals and dyes emitted by industries has become a worldwide problem. These pollutants are difficult to be biodegraded. Even at low concentrations, they are toxic and at last threaten human health. Herein, while using Tetrahymena thermophila, a single-celled ciliate protozoa, to enrich and remove the heavy metal CdÂ²âº from water, CdS nanoparticle-Tetrahymena thermophila hybrid system (CdS-T. thermophila) for dye pollution remediation under light irradiation was developed. The conditions of CdÂ²âº enrichment and removal by T. thermophila, construction of efficient CdS-T. thermophila, and decolorization of Congo red using CdS-T. thermophila were investigated. In the presence of cysteine ethyl ester, the removal rate of CdÂ²âº by T. thermophila was 94% at low CdÂ²âº concentration of 1Â mgÂ Lâ»Â¹. The adsorption capacity of T. thermophila to CdÂ²âº reached 43Â mgÂ gâ»Â¹ at CdÂ²âº concentration of 80Â mgÂ Lâ»Â¹. Using 0.1Â gÂ Lâ»Â¹ constructed CdS-T. thermophila, the decolorization rate of 50Â mgÂ Lâ»Â¹ Congo red solution reached 95% in 60Â min under light irradiation. This study provides a new insight to effective removing CdÂ²âº from water by T. thermophila to construct the CdS-T. thermophila and using it to remediate dye pollution in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3aTetrahymena thermophila 3aadsorption 3acadmium 3acysteine 3adecolorization 3adyes 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3airradiation 3aremediation 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 0aCadmium 0aTetrahymena thermophila 0aCongo red 0aCdS1 aLi, Tian1 aGao, Zi-Han1 aXiong, Jie1 aMiao, Wei0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Oct. 05, v. 439 p.129683-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1296833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245008900162300001600251520133400267592002801601650001601629650001301645650001201658650001201670650001301682650000901695650001801704650001401722650001801736650002101754650001001775650001101785650001401796650002501810650001201835650001501847650001101862650001301873650001001886653001101896653001801907653001901925653001501944653002401959653001001983653001601993653001402009653002602023700002002049700001802069773011502087856007702202852000902279655001202288IND60644528220221119025124.0190516s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064452822DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2017-01312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarnahan, A.M.10an-Alkane and long-chain alcohol recovery in moose (Alcesalces), a browsing herbivore  ap. 559-565.  aHabitat management for herbivores often depends on an understanding of the food habits of animals. Plant cuticular waxes containing nearly indigestible complex mixture of n-alkanes and long-chain alcohols (LCOHs) have recently shown promise for diet analyses, but the accuracy of the technique depends strongly on the efficiency of recovery of the markers in feces. Fecal recovery of n-alkanes and LCOHs from 10 browse stems or leaves and two ensiled grass hays fed to moose (Alces alces (Linnaeus, 1758)) during in vivo digestion trials was investigated. n-Alkanes and LCOHs were extracted using a single-step accelerated solvent extraction technique and the recovery of these cuticular components was calculated from the feces of the animals. n-Alkane recoveries from feces averaged 0.82, ranging from a low of 0.58 (haylage) to a high of 0.95 (browse stems). LCOH recoveries averaged 0.92 across all forages, ranging from 0.80 (haylage) to a high of 1.13 (browse stems). n-Alkane and LCOH fecal recovery increased with increasing chain length, similar to findings in other studies. Although fecal recovery of n-alkanes and LCOHs were variable, we conclude that they are inversely related to forage digestibility, are consistent within forage classes, and are therefore predictable markers for use in assessing herbivore diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlces alces 3aalcohols 3aalkanes 3aanimals 3abrowsing 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3aeating habits 3aepicuticular wax 3afeces 3aforage 3agrass hay 3ahabitat conservation 3ahaylage 3aherbivores 3aleaves 3asolvents 3astems 0aAlaska 0adiet analysis 0afecal recovery 0aherbivores 0along-chain alcohols 0amoose 0aAlces alces 0an-alkanes 0aplant cuticular waxes1 aSpalinger, D.E.1 aCollins, W.B.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2018, v. 96, no. 6 p.559-565dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2017-01313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010000167300002000267520135700287592002801644650002501672650001901697650001601716650001801732650002101750650001601771700001901787700001601806700001501822700005301837700001801890700005501908773013101963856008502094852000902179655001202188IND60761361920221120230619.0211228e20211213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076136192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c038222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Zhengjiu10aLight-Driven Polarity Switching of the Chromatographic Stationary Phase with Photoreversibility  ap. 17051-17059.  aRegrettably, conventional chromatographic columns have immutable polarity, resulting in requirements of at least two columns with polarity difference and sophisticated mechanical switching valves, which hinders the development of âmicro-smartâ multidimensional tandem chromatography. In this work, light-driven polarity switching was realized in a single capillary column based on the reversible transâcis isomerization of 4-[3-(triethoxysilyl)propoxy]azobenzene as the stationary phase under light irradiation, with the change in dipole moment. As a result, the stationary phase offers precise and dynamic control of polarity based on the cisâtrans azobenzene ratio, which depends on irradiation wavelength and time. Thus, the continuous adjustment of polarity enables diversified chromatographic separation modes, for example, step-polarity gradient and polarity-conversion separation modes, taking advantage of the superior freedom of polarity switching in time and spatial dimensions. The photosensitive column also shows good reproducibility of polarity photoreversibility and high separation efficiency. The present study might offer brand new insight into developing miniaturization and intellectualization of multidimensional chromatography via designing smart responsive switching valves or stationary phases, besides mechanical means.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3achromatography 3airradiation 3aisomerization 3aphotosensitivity 3awavelengths1 aZhang, Jie-Min1 aLv, Ming-Yu1 aLi, Xin-Qi1 aWu, Lixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4735-85581 aShang, Hai-Bo1 aLi, Donghao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7033-66720 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Dec. 13, v. 93, no. 51 p.17051-17059dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c038223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04160naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245017600165506010400341506007600445520214100521592002802662506003702690650002102727650002202748650002502770650002102795650001002816650001902826650002002845650000802865650001102873650001502884650002202899650001502921650001202936650001802948650002202966650001302988650001203001650002603013650001603039653002203055653002003077653002103097653002203118653003903140653002203179700005503201700001603256700001903272700001603291700005303307773010403360856008503464852000903549655001203558IND60767725620221207073025.0220523e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076772562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1129612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmedes, S.10aB-esterases characterisation in the digestive tract of the common octopus and the European cuttlefish and their in vitro responses to contaminants of environmental concern  aCreative Commons AttributionÂ 4.0Â Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCephalopods are a group of marine invertebrates that have received little attention as sentinel species in comparison to other molluscs, such as bivalves. Consequently, their physiological and biochemical xenobiotic metabolism responses are poorly understood. Here we undertake a comparative analysis of the enzymatic activities involved in detoxification reactions and neural transmission in the digestive tract of two commercial cephalopods: the Common octopus, Octopus vulgaris, and the European cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis. For methodological purposes, several common B-esterases (five carboxylesterase (CE) substrates and three cholinesterase (ChE) determinations) were assayed as a proxy of metabolic and neuronal activities, respectively. Four components of the digestive tract in each species were considered: salivary glands, the stomach, the digestive gland and the caecum. The in vitro responses of digestive gland homogenates to model chemicals and contaminants of environmental concern were contrasted between both cephalopod species. The baseline biochemical activities in the four digestive tract components were also determined. Moreover, in order to validate the protocol, purified proteins, recombinant human CE (CE1 and CE2) and purified eel acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were included in the analysis. Overall, carboxylesterase activities were higher in octopus than in cuttlefish, with the activity quantified in the digestive tract components in the following order: digestive glandÂ âÂ caecumÂ >Â stomachÂ âÂ salivary glands, with higher hydrolysis rates reached with naphthyl-derived substrates. In contrast, cuttlefish hydrolysis rates with ChE substrates were higher than in octopus. This trend was also reflected in a higher sensitivity to CE inhibitors in octopus and to AChE inhibitors in cuttlefish. Given the detoxification character of CEs and its protective role preventing AChE inhibition, octopus could be regarded as more efficiently protected than cuttlefish from neurotoxic exposures. A full characterisation of B-esterases in the digestive tract of the two common cephalopods is also provided.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOctopus vulgaris 3aSepia officinalis 3aacetylcholinesterase 3acarboxylesterase 3acecum 3acholinesterase 3adigestive tract 3aeel 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3aindicator species 3ametabolism 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity 3aprotective effect 3aresearch 3astomach 3asynaptic transmission 3axenobiotics 0aCarboxylesterases 0aCholinesterases 0aOctopus vulgaris 0aSepia officinalis 0aChemicals of environmental concern 0aPlastic additives1 aAndrade, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5704-86681 aEscolar, O.1 aVillanueva, R.1 aFreitas, R.1 aSolÃ©, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9920-50510 tEnvironmental research.g2022 July, v. 210 p.112961-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1129613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002400191245005100215300001600266506007600282520100200358592002801360506003701388650001401425650001701439650001701456650002401473650001701497650001101514650001701525700002001542700002501562700002901587700002701616700002901643773008301672856008401755852000901839655001201848IND60553968920221207091135.0161023e20141120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055396892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2014.09.0222doi7 aPMC48698532pmcid7 a254588442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBleicken, Stephanie10aStructural Model of Active Bax at the Membrane  ap. 496-505.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBax plays a central role in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Upon activation, cytosolic Bax monomers oligomerize on the surface of mitochondria and change conformation concertedly to punch holes into the outer membrane. The subsequent release of cytochrome c initiates cell death. However, the structure of membrane-inserted Bax and its mechanism of action remain largely unknown. Here, we propose a 3D model of active Bax at the membrane based on double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy in liposomes and isolated mitochondria. We show that active Bax is organized at the membrane as assemblies of dimers. In addition to a stable dimerization domain, each monomer contains a more flexible piercing domain involved in interdimer interactions and pore formation. The most important structural change during Bax activation is the opening of the hairpin formed by helices 5 and 6, which adopts a clamp-like conformation central to the mechanism of mitochondrial permeabilization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3acytochrome c 3adimerization 3amechanism of action 3amitochondria 3amodels 3aspectroscopy1 aJeschke, Gunnar1 aStegmueller, Carolin1 aSalvador-Gallego, Raquel1 aGarcÃ­a-SÃ¡ez, AnaÂ J.1 aBordignon, E.q(Enrica),0 tMolecular cell.g2014 Nov. 20, v. 56 p.496-505dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2014.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245013700178300001400315506002800329520113800357592002801495506003701523650002201560650001201582650002201594650001101616650002301627650001401650650001301664650001101677650001001688650002501698650000901723650002201732653001201754653002501766653002501791700001301816700001201829773010301841856008901944852000902033655001202042IND60739559320221207123018.0210401e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073955932DNAL7 a10.21776/ub.habitat.2021.032.1.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiskiyah, Suaibatul10aTechnical Efficiency of Cabbage Farming (Brassica oleracea) With Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) Approach in Purwodadi - Pasuruan  ap. 26-36.  aResource is Open Access  aThis study was aimed to analyze the factors affecting the cabbage production, the level of technical efficiency of cabbage farming, the factors affecting technical inefficiency, and the profits of cabbage farming. The location was determined purposively on the basis that it is the center of vegetable cultivation. The respondents were 67 farmers chosen using the Yamane formula sampling technique. This research used frontier software 4.1 data analysis method with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach and Tobit regression. The results showed that land, labor, seeds, organic fertilizers, urea fertilizers, za fertilizers and npk fertilizers were real influential factors. Meanwhile, pesticides were insignificantly influenced. The mean technical efficiency in the research site was 0.903 for the distribution of technical efficiency, so that the cabbage production was rated as high efficiency. Age, education and credit access dummy contributed a major impact on technological inefficiency. The income from cabbage farming per planting season per hectare was Rp35,524,300 from cash costs and Rp31,051,800 from total costs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica oleracea 3acabbage 3acomputer software 3acredit 3aeconometric models 3aeducation 3ahabitats 3aincome 3alabor 3astatistical analysis 3aurea 3avegetable growing 0acabbage 0atechnical efficiency 0astochastic frontiers1 aSyafrial1 aSujarwo0 tHabitat.g2021 Mar., v. 32, no. 1 p.26-36dUniversity of BrawijayawJournal:27740x2338-20077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21776/ub.habitat.2021.032.1.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03941naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001800169245011700187300001600304520225500320592002802575650002302603650001102626650001102637650001302648650001302661650001202674650001202686650001202698650001802710650001002728650001402738650001402752650001602766650001702782650001602799651001302815653002702828653001802855653002102873653001602894653002102910653002502931653002502956653001902981653001903000653001503019653001903034653001603053700002203069700002003091773014003111856010303251852000903354655001203363IND60127422320221119023928.0151124e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012742232DNAL7 a10.1648/0273-8570(2004)075[0317:NSAHSO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRounds, R. A.10aNest-site selection and hatching success of waterbirds in coastal Virginia: some results of habitat manipulation  ap. 317-329.  aRising sea levels in the mid-Atlantic region pose a long-term threat to marshes and their avian inhabitants. The Gull-billed Tern (Sterna nilotica), Common Tern (S. hirundo), Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger), and American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus), species of concern in Virginia, nest on low shelly perimeters of salt marsh islands on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Marsh shellpiles are free of mammalian predators, but subject to frequent floods that reduce reproductive success. In an attempt to examine nest-site selection, enhance habitat, and improve hatching success, small (2 Ã 2 m) plots on five island shellpiles were experimentally elevated, and nest-site selection and hatching success were monitored from 1 May to 1 August, 2002. In addition, location, elevation, and nesting performance of all other nests in the colonies were also monitored. No species selected the elevated experimental plots preferentially over adjacent control plots at any of the sites. When all nests were considered, Common Tern nests were located significantly lower than were random point elevations at two sites, as they tended to concentrate on low-lying wrack. At two other sites, however, Common Tern nests were significantly higher than were random points. Gull-billed Terns and American Oystercatchers showed a weak preference for higher elevations on bare shell at most sites. Hatching success was not improved on elevated plots, despite the protection they provided from flooding. Because of a 7 June flood, when 47% of all nests flooded, hatching success for all species was low. Nest elevation had the strongest impact on a nest's probability of hatching, followed by nest-initiation date. Predation rates were high at small colonies, and Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) depredated 90% of early Gull-billed Tern nests at one shellpile. The importance of nest elevation and flooding on hatching success demonstrates the potential for management of certain waterbird nesting sites. Facing threats from predators on barrier islands and rising sea levels especially in the mid-Atlantic region, several species of nesting waterbirds may benefit dramatically with modest manipulation of even small habitat patches on isolated marsh islands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArenaria interpres 3aSterna 3afloods 3ahabitats 3ahatching 3aislands 3amammals 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anests 3apredation 3apredators 3aprobability 3asalt marshes 3awater birds 3aVirginia 0aAmerican Oystercatcher 0aBlack Skimmer 0acoastal Virginia 0aCommon Tern 0aGull-billed Tern 0ahabitat manipulation 0aHaematopus palliatus 0aRynchops niger 0asea-level rise 0ashellpiles 0aSterna hirundo 0aS. nilotica1 aErwin, R.

The results showed that during the co-cultivation biomass growth was promoted (2.43Â Â±Â 0.11Â g/L) compared with the algae-only culture (1.09Â Â±Â 0.03Â g/L), and the aerobic bacteria growth was initially promoted, then inhibited. The SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) observation indicated that the amount of the C. vulgaris increased while bacteria âdisappearedâ over time. After 30Â min settlement, 95.5% of the biomass in co-cultivation group precipitated, while only 40.4% of the biomass settled for the algae-only group was. It is believed that the presence of bacteria enhanced the settling rate through the formation of algal consortium flocs. Bacterial community diversity and composition were measured and the results indicated that the bacterial diversity dropped and the bacterial active classes changed in the co-cultivation group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aactivated sludge 3aalgae 3aanaerobic digestion 3abacterial communities 3abiomass 3acoculture 3apig manure 0aCo-cultivation 0aRelationship and interaction 0aWastewater treatment1 aAddy, Min1 aCobb, Kirk1 aMa, Hongpeng1 aZhang, Renchuan1 aChen, Dongjie1 aChen, Paul1 aWang, Hualing1 aLiu, Yuhuan1 aRuan, Roger0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Jan., v. 320 p.124250-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1242503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245015900203520152200362592002801884650002201912650001601934650002101950650001101971650001701982650001801999650002102017650001302038650001402051650001502065650001102080650001902091650001602110650001802126650001602144653002102160653002402181653001802205653001602223653003702239700001902276700002102295700003402316700006202350773009502412856008302507852000902590655001202599IND60792460020221120063747.0220920e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079246002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2022.1019702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolar, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0279-645510aApplicability of alginate-based composite microspheres loaded with aqueous extract of Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni leaves in food and pharmaceutical products  aTo preserve its favorable health and nutritional qualities under processing conditions and oral ingestion, Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni leaf aqueous extract was encapsulated in composite microspheres based on calcium alginate. The addition of other biopolymers to alginate (ALG) (xanthan gum (XG), casein (CA)) influenced molecular interactions (mainly hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions) between microsphere constituents causing the change in microsphere structure and thus physicochemical properties (encapsulation effectiveness and capacity, surface morphology, swelling, stability) as well as the release of total polyphenols (TPC) in distilled water, NaCl solutions and in simulated gastrointestinal fluids.Â The extent of crosslinking of calcium alginate was altered by blending with XG, CA, or XGÂ +Â CA, but this did not affect the control mechanism of TPC release detected as diffusion. Results revealed the unsuitability of calcium alginate microspheres for implementation in food products with high water content, while composite microspheres showed desired reduction in TPC release. The best performance (the slowest release and the amount released) for implementation in functional food products containing NaCl exhibited composite microspheres with ALGÂ +Â XGÂ +Â CA. The desired prevention of microsphere degradation in simulated gastro fluids was achieved with ALGÂ +Â XGÂ +Â CA microspheres, while in simulated intestinal fluids all microspheres were decomposed and completely released TPC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStevia rebaudiana 3abiopolymers 3acalcium alginate 3acasein 3acrosslinking 3aencapsulation 3afunctional foods 3ahydrogen 3aingestion 3aintestines 3aleaves 3amicroparticles 3apolyphenols 3awater content 3axanthan gum 0aCalcium alginate 0aComposite hydrogels 0aEncapsulation 0aPolyphenols 0aStevia rebaudiana Bertoni leaves1 aJuriÄ, Slaven1 aMarijan, Marijan1 aVlahoviÄek-Kahlina, Kristina1 aVincekoviÄ, Marko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6158-39140 tFood bioscience.g2022 Dec., v. 50 p.101970-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2022.1019703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011700171300001400288520112300302592002801425650001601453650001101469650001301480650001501493650001501508651001001523653002001533653003001553653003201583653002601615700005901641700001201700700001701712700001401729773009601743856008701839852000901926655001201935IND60635852520221119231200.0190529e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063585252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2019.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zheng-yuan10aBroadband-seismic analysis of a massive landslide in southwestern China: Dynamics and fragmentation implications  ap. 31-39.  aWe analyse broadband seismic records generated by the massive Xinmo landslide that occurred in southwestern China at 5:39 on 24 June 2017 (Beijing Time, UTCâ¯+â¯8). Characteristics of landslide seismic signals, including propagation velocity, duration and frequency contents, are presented and discussed by comparing them with seismic signals generated by a local earthquake of similar magnitude. We perform a long-period seismic waveform inversion in the frequency band of 0.01â0.1â¯Hz to acquire the landslide force history using 46 seismic traces from 21 seismic stations with distances from the epicentre extending to 360â¯km. Based on the inversion, we calculate the dynamic parameters of the landslide and recognize its stages and movement characteristics. Landslide basal friction coefficients are also acquired using both a constant dip and varying dips along the slope. A combined analysis of near-field short-period seismic records and dynamic inversion results indicates that the high-frequency energy of landslide signals is most likely generated by rock fragmentations during collision and scraping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearthquakes 3aenergy 3afriction 3ageophysics 3alandslides 3aChina 0aXinmo landslide 0aBroadband seismic signals 0aDynamic landslide processes 0aHigh-frequency energy1 aHuang, Xing-hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0493-13501 aYu, Dan1 aSu, Jin-rong1 aXu, Qiang0 tGeomorphology.g2019 July 01, v. 336 p.31-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2019.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009100171506011700262506007600379520132900455592002801784506003701812650002301849650002201872650001201894650002001906650002001926650001901946650001601965650000901981650002101990653001402011653001902025653003002044653002002074653002102094700001902115700006302134700002302197700002002220700002502240700002302265773012502288856008202413852000902495655001202504IND60775234320221207130543.0220523e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077523432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAenglong, Chakkapat10aSynthesis of soluble calcium compound from skipjack tuna bones using edible weak acids  aCreative Commons AttributionÂ 4.0Â Generic (CC BY-NC-NDÂ 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study aimed to enhance the water solubility of calcium from tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) bones (TB). Calcium hydroxyapatite (HA) was obtained by calcination of TB. For mineral profiles of TB and HA, Ca had the highest content followed by P with Ca/P of 3.47 and 1.94. Mg, K, and Na as macro minerals and Cr, Cu, Mn, and Zn as micro minerals were also found. Subsequently, HCl was applied to form structured HA-chloride compound (HA-Cl) then reacted with alkaline to obtain structured HA-hydroxide compound (HA-OH). In order to enhance the water solubility, citric and lactic acid were individually reacted with HA-Cl and HA-OH to obtain structured HA-citrate compounds (HA-Cl-Ci and HA-OH-Ci) and structured HA-lactate compounds (HA-Cl-Lac and HA-OH-Lac). HA-Cl-Ci had the highest water solubility (93.34Â Â±Â 0.45%) followed by HA-OH-Lac (90.35Â Â±Â 0.23%) with Ca/P ratio of 2.28 and 2.24, respectively. HA-Cl-Ci and HA-OH-Lac demonstrated the similar mineral profiles to those of HA but with different contents. The results of FT-IR indicated the carboxyl group of acid played an important role in binding CaÂ²âº. X-ray diffractograms indicated that calcined bone was HA whereas the major composition of HA-Cl-Ci and HA-OH-Lac was related to calcium citrate tetrahydrate and calcium lactate pentahydrate, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aKatsuwonus pelamis 3aX-ray diffraction 3acalcium 3acalcium citrate 3acalcium lactate 3ahydroxyapatite 3alactic acid 3atuna 3awater solubility 0aTuna bone 0aHydroxyapatite 0aStructured hydroxyapatite 0aSoluble calcium 0aCalcium compound1 aWang, Youming,1 aLimpawattana, Maruj1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8566-61721 aSukketsiri, Wanida1 aTang, Qing-Juan1 aKlaypradit, Wanwimol1 aKerdpiboon, Soraya0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 June 01, v. 162 p.113460-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012900171500001900300520165500319592002801974650001202002650001702014650001202031650002502043650002002068650000902088650002202097650001302119650002502132650001502157650001302172651001102185653002002196653001702216653001802233653002102251653003402272700001902306700001902325773010702344856008702451852000902538655001202547IND60714104520221123040948.0201111e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071410452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1057132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPettersson, M.10aRecycling of ash from co-incineration of waste wood and forest fuels: An overlooked challenge in a circular bioenergy system  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWood ash recycling to forests after logging residues harvest is important to ensure long-term sustainable forest management, however, it is not recycled in Sweden at the level required to compensate for current logging residue out-take. A problem in this context is wood ash contamination through co-incineration of waste wood with forest fuels, a practice driven by the political goal of a circular bioenergy system. We performed a case study of co-incineration at a typical Swedish district heating (DH) plant, which showed that the forest fuel ash alone could be recycled to forests due to high nutrient levels. Co-incineration with waste wood resulted however in such high levels of contaminants that the ash was landfilled as hazardous waste. Our assessment of the Swedish DH sector showed that wood ash contamination through co-incineration is common, and that only a minor proportion of the ash from forest fuels is recycled to the forest. It also revealed a lack of reliable data regarding ash production and management, making implementation and evaluation of effective countermeasures difficult. Practical measures to enable wood ash recycling, such as removal of waste wood from the fuel mix, incineration of separate fuels, and ash after-treatment, are hampered by technical and economic barriers. Furthermore, no comprehensive policy tools currently exist on either a national or EU level that facilitate wood ash recycling. Thus, we conclude that comprehensive and efficient policy tools are urgently needed to overcome current barriers, and stimulate large-scale recycling of wood ash for long-term sustainable forest fuel utilisation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acase studies 3aforests 3afuels (fire ecology) 3ahazardous waste 3aheat 3aissues and policy 3apolitics 3asustainable forestry 3awaste wood 3awood ash 3aSweden 0aCo-incineration 0aForest fuels 0aAsh recycling 0aDistrict heating 0aSustainable forest management1 aBjÃ¶rnsson, L.1 aBÃ¶rjesson, P.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 Nov., v. 142 p.105713-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1057133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010300169520147700272592002801749650002101777650001501798650002501813650002001838650001301858650001801871650001901889650001401908650001201922650001201934650001601946650002201962650001201984650001901996650001502015650001402030650001302044653002002057653001802077653002202095653001302117653001502130700002002145700002202165700002302187700002602210700002502236700002102261700002202282700002002304700002502324700002402349773011902373856008502492852000902577655001202586IND60680715920221118140710.0200210e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068071592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2020.1295132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPirro, Martina10aCharacterization of Macrophage Galactose-type Lectin (MGL) ligands in colorectal cancer cell lines  aThe CaÂ²âº-dependent C-type lectin receptor Macrophage Galactose-type Lectin (MGL) is highly expressed by tolerogenic dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages. MGL exhibits a high binding specificity for terminal alpha- and beta-linked GalNAc residues found in Tn, sTn and LacdiNAc antigens. These glycan epitopes are often overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), and, as such, MGL can be used to discriminate tumor from the corresponding healthy tissues. Moreover, the high expression of MGL ligands is associated with poor disease-free survival in stage III of CRC tumors. Nonetheless, the glycoproteins expressed by tumor cells that are recognized by MGL have hitherto remained elusive.Using a panel of three CRC cell lines (HCT116, HT29 and LS174T), recapitulating CRC diversity, we performed FACS staining and pull-down assays using a recombinant soluble form of MGL (and a mutant MGL as control) combined with mass spectrometry-based (glyco)proteomics.HCT116 and HT29, but not LS174T, are high MGL-binding CRC cell lines. On these cells, the major cell surface binding proteins are receptors (e.g. MET, PTK7, SORL1, PTPRF) and integrins (ITGB1, ITGA3). From these proteins, several N- and/or O-glycopeptides were identified, of which some carried either a LacdiNAc or Tn epitope.We have identified cell surface MGL-ligands on CRC cell lines.Advances in (glyco)proteomics have led to identification of candidate key mediators of immune-evasion and tumor growth in CRC.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3acell lines 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adendritic cells 3aepitopes 3aglycoproteins 3aimmune evasion 3aintegrins 3alectins 3aligands 3amacrophages 3amass spectrometry 3amutants 3aneoplasm cells 3aproteomics 3areceptors 3astaining 0aGlycoproteomics 0aC-type lectin 0aColorectal cancer 0aLacdiNAc 0aTn antigen1 aRombouts, Yoann1 aStella, Alexandre1 aNeyrolles, Olivier1 aBurlet-Schiltz, Odile1 avan Vliet, Sandra J.1 ade Ru, Arnoud H.1 aMohammed, Yassene1 aWuhrer, Manfred1 avan Veelen, Peter A.1 aHensbergen, Paul J.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2020 Apr., v. 1864, no. 4 p.129513-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2020.1295133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245005800166300001600224506002800240520139300268592002801661506003701689650002301726650001101749650001201760650001201772650000901784650001101793653001001804653002401814653001601838653001201854653001501866700002301881700002001904700002101924773012601945856007802071852000902149655001202158IND60739559820221207120921.0101112s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073955982DNAL7 a10.2298/ZMSPN0519149M2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatavulj, Milan N.10aConditionally pathogenic fungi in recreational waters  ap. 149-160.  aResource is Open Access  aThe improvement of health and life conditions depends on various environmental factors. The exposition to organic and inorganic pollutants, as well as to the broad spectar of microorganisms is one of these factors. Medically important fungi have been increasing their number recently especially in urban and in recreational zones. Some of them, first of all molds and yeasts, are involved by different means in causing more or less serious diseases of man and animals. Frequency of alergic symptoms and human mycotic lesions increased significantly during last decades. Such phenomena have provoked more scientific attention recently. According to the available literature data, micro-fungi, causing mycoses and "environmental" fungi too could be considered as an important factor of health risk, being neglected and underestimated so far, especially in analyses of safe use of recreational waters and surrounding areas, among them swimming pools, river and sea beaches. On the basis of such statement there arises conclusion that water and ground of recreational zones could serve as vectors in transmission pathways of potentially or conditionally pathogenic fungi, being dangerous especially for immunocompromised individuals, which suggests inclusion of qualitative and quantitative composition of fungal community into a continual monitoring of hygienic status of recreational zones.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afungal communities 3ahumans 3ahygiene 3amycoses 3arisk 3arivers 0afungi 0arecreational waters 0ahealth risk 0amycoses 0amonitoring1 aNebojÅ¡a, VulikiÄ1 aIgor, GojkoviÄ1 aKaraman, Maja A.0 tZbornik Matice srpske za prirodne nauke.g2005, v. 2005, no. 109 p.149-160dMatica srpskawJournal:27734x0352-49067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ZMSPN0519149M3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006800153245010600221300001600327520176800343592002802111650001802139650001402157650001302171650001302184650000902197650001202206650001102218650000902229650001502238651001802253651001202271651001402283651001802297653000702315653001602322653000902338653002002347653002302367653002702390700002702417700002302444700002102467700002002488700002502508700002202533700003302555773012302588856008802711852000902799655001202808IND60585351920221118063751.0201111e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058535192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPÃ©rez-RodrÃ­guez, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7139-304910aIndustrial-era lead and mercury contamination in southern Greenland implicates North American sources  ap. 919-930.  aTo study the long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants from lower latitude industrial areas to the Arctic, we analysed a peat core spanning the last ~700cal.yr (~1300â2000CE) from southern Greenland, an area sensitive to atmospheric pollution from North American and Eurasian sources. A previous investigation conducted in the same location recorded atmospheric lead (Pb) pollution after ~1845, with peak values recorded in the 1970s, and concluded that a North American source was most likely. To confirm the origin of the lead, we present new Pb isotope data from Sandhavn, together with a high-resolution record for mercury (Hg) deposition. Results demonstrate that the mercury accumulation rate has steadily increased since the beginning of the 19th century, with maximum values of 9.3Î¼gmâ»Â²yrâ»Â¹ recorded ~1940. Lead isotopic ratios show two mixing lines: one which represents inputs from local and regional geogenic sources, and another that comprises regional geogenic and pollution sources. Detrending the Pb isotopic ratio record (thereby extracting the effect of the geogenic mixing) has enabled us to reconstruct a detailed chronology of metal pollution. The first sustained decrease in Pb isotope signals is recorded as beginning ~1740â1780 with the lowest values (indicating the highest pollution signature) dated to ~1960â1970. The Â²â°â¶Pb/Â²â°â·Pb ratio of excess Pb (measuring 1.222, and reflecting pollution-generated Pb), when compared with the Pb isotopic composition of the Sandhavn peat record since the 19th century and the timing of Pb enrichments, clearly points to the dominance of pollution sources from North America, although it did not prove possible to further differentiate the emissions sources geographically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aemissions 3aisotopes 3alatitude 3alead 3amercury 3amixing 3apeat 3apollutants 3aArctic region 3aEurasia 3aGreenland 3aNorth America 0aHg 0aPb isotopes 0aPeat 0aMetal pollution 0aIsotopic residuals 0aAtmospheric deposition1 aSilva-SÃ¡nchez, NoemÃ­1 aKylander, Malin E.1 aBindler, Richard1 aMighall, Tim M.1 aSchofield, J.

A central discussion is whether pre-agricultural erosion was triggered by vegetational disturbances caused by hunter-gatherer activities (trampling, controlled forest fires) or natural processes (e.g. climatic anomalies, wildfires, wind-throws). This paper contributes to this discussion using data recently gathered during archaeological excavations of a levee, within the floodplain of the River Scheldt in NW Belgium, occupied by hunter-gatherers during the Early Holocene. These excavations revealed the presence of a ca. 40â¯cm thick slope deposit, which was radiocarbon dated to the late Preboreal and 1st half of the Boreal. A high-resolution, multi-proxy analysis of this deposit demonstrates a close correlation between the type of vegetation, forest fires and erosion intensity. It is concluded that repeated burning of pine-dominated forests was most likely the main trigger. Furthermore, this study provides strong evidence against an anthropogenic origin of these Early Holocene fires as burning and slope erosion already started long before prehistoric hunter-gatherers occupied the levee top and the Scheldt basin. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that pre-agricultural slope erosion was not limited to hilly regions with pronounced topography but also occurred in lowland regions with subtle topographical gradients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3abasins 3aburning 3afloodplains 3aforest fires 3aforests 3ahumans 3arivers 3arunoff 3asediments 3atopography 3atrampling damage 3aBelgium 3aCentral European region 0aSlope erosion 0aEarly Holocene 0aForest fires 0aPrehistoric hunter-gatherers 0aLevee1 aStorme, Annelies1 aCruz, FrÃ©dÃ©ric,1 aAllemeersch, Luc1 aVandendriessche, Hans1 aDeforce, Koen1 aMikkelsen, Jari1 aAluwÃ©, Kim1 aBoudin, Mathieu1 aSergant, Joris0 tGeomorphology.g2019 July 15, v. 337 p.79-93dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2019.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245012500201506011700326506007600443520114200519592002801661506003701689650002001726650000801746650002001754650001201774650001701786650002101803650000901824650003001833653002701863653003001890653003301920653003401953700001201987700001701999700002102016700001802037700005402055773012502109856008202234852000902316655001202325IND60775234520221207130546.0220523e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077523452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Qin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3023-083010aBlocker-tailed PCR coupled with rolling circle amplification for fluorescent detection of emetic Bacillus cereus in milk  aCreative Commons AttributionÂ 4.0Â Generic (CC BY-NC-NDÂ 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEmetic Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) is a foodborne microorganism associated with vomiting disease. Herein, we have established a blocker-tailed polymerase chain reaction (bt-PCR) coupled with rolling circle amplification (RCA) assay for the sensitive and specific detection of emetic B. cereus. In this research, the designed forward primer for bt-PCR was modified into two parts, namely, the C3 spacer blocker, and the linker DNA binding sequence, which was complementary with the linker DNA. The bt-PCR products could bind to the linker DNA and initiate the RCA assay, generating numerous repetitive G-quadruplex structures. The specific fluorescence dye of thioflavin T (ThT) could bind to the G-quadruplex structures, producing enhanced fluorescent signals for detection. Under optimized conditions, the proposed assay could improve the sensitivity of the conventional PCR detection, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 2.6Â ÃÂ 10â°Â CFU/mL in pure culture, and 2.8Â ÃÂ 10â°Â CFU/mL in spiked milk samples with good specificity. The proposed assay showed potential application for the detection of emetic B. cereus in real world.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus cereus 3aDNA 3adetection limit 3aemetics 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3amilk 3apolymerase chain reaction 0aEmetic Bacillus cereus 0aPolymerase chain reaction 0aRolling circle amplification 0aFoodborne pathogens detection1 aLiu, Ju1 aXie, Guoyang1 aZha, Liangzheng,1 aFeng, Xiaoyan1 aXu, Hengyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0457-96650 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 June 01, v. 162 p.113462-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245015700181300001400338506002800352520187900380592002802259506003702287650001002324650003502334650001102369650001802380650002302398650001702421650001102438650001602449650000902465650000702474650000902481650002002490650001302510651001002523651001102533653001702544653001302561653001402574653002302588653002302611653001902634653002202653700002502675700002602700773012602726856008802852852000902940655001202949IND60739560020221207121944.0180530e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073956002DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.2005.39.1.9072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoufleros, Evangelos H.10aDiscrimination and risk assessment due to the volatile compounds and the inorganic elements present in the Greek marc distillates Tsipouro and Tsikoudia  ap. 31-45.  aResource is Open Access  aTsipouro and Tsikoudia are two denominations with geographic indications of the traditional Greek marc distillate, which is produced in continental Greece and in the island of Crete respectively. It is produced by the Greek winegrowers as well as by the professional distillers. To provide data on the safety of domestic Tsipouro and Tsikoudia distillates for human consumption and to draw conclusions from any essential results, which might have an impact on the quality of this product, 23 samples were analysed for: (a) Volatile compounds by the use of gas chromatography, (b) Inorganic elements, using atomic absorption spectrometry and (c) the pH values through-out using standard methods. Data revealed differences between these two denominations, which have been confirmed by the application of a statistic analysis and a PCA. Thus, Tsikoudia was found to contain statistically higher amounts of acetalde-hyde. However, the levels that have been observed did not exceed the official limits. Most of the Tsipouro and Tsikoudia samples also contained low concentrations of estragol, an anise compound, lead and copper, which do not represent a risk to consumer health due to their toxicity. On the other hand, the total concentration of higher alcohols was higher than the official minimum limit (140 g.hl-1 Absolute Alcohol-AA), while the amylic alcohols rarely exceeded 300 g.hl-1 AA. The high concentrations of ethyl acetate (>300 g.hl-1 AA) and ethyl lactate in a few samples showed the necessity of limiting unwanted fermentations in the grape pomace. The analytical study showed that the quality of the marc distillate is, generally, satisfactory. However, it revealed great differences between Tsipouro and Tsikoudia even among the samples of each denomination and, con-sequently, these domestic distillates need standardization and a more systematic production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanise 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acopper 3aethyl acetate 3agas chromatography 3agrape pomace 3ahumans 3alactic acid 3alead 3apH 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atoxicity 3aCrete 3aGreece 0agrape pomace 0aTsipouro 0aTsikoudia 0avolatile compounds 0ainorganic elements 0atrace elements 0aatomic absorption1 aNatskoulis, Pantelis1 aMygdalia, Angeliki S.0 tOENO One.g2005 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.31-45dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2005.39.1.9073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01170naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245011900162300001600281520023500297592002800532653001200560653002100572653001300593653001200606700001900618700002900637773012700666856007800793852000900871655001200880IND60773999120221119160032.0220420e20220412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077399912DNAL7 a10.3897/aiep.52.794422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolani, Daniel10aï»¿First record of the batfish, Halieutaea indica (Actinopterygii: Lophiiformes: Ogcocephalidae), from the Red Sea  ap. 101-105.  aï»¿AbstractThe Indian handfish or batfish, Halieutaea indica Annandale et Jenkins, 1910, is recorded for the first time from the Red Sea.

Anaerobic digestion for biogas production is a low-cost method to reduce pathogens in agricultural wastes that provides the added benefits of energy generation. There have been claims of pathogen reduction following installation of biogas digesters in homesteads in Sub-Saharan Africa. Homestead pathogen levels following installation of the different designs of biogas digester were monitored using faecal indicator organisms within small rural farms in Ethiopia. However, different designs of digesters have registered varying levels of success. Of the three digester designs considered, fixed dome, floating drum and flexible balloon, the fixed dome design achieved the highest reductions in indicator organisms (coliforms, Escherichia coli and Enterococci) from feedstock to digestate; this is likely to be due its longer hydraulic retention time. Households with biogas digesters installed had significantly (pÂ <Â 0.05) lower levels of coliforms, E. coli and Enterococci detected in the environment inside and outside the house area. However, in the same households, there was a significant (pÂ <Â 0.05) increase in indicator organisms on the surface and handles of doors, indicating the potential for spread of pathogens on contaminated hands to door handles from handling the animal waste feedstock.

In this study, soil organic carbon (SOC) and labile organic C fractions, including microbial biomass organic C (MBC), easily oxidizable organic C (EOC) and dissolved organic C (DOC), were determined in Robinia pseudoacacia monoculture forests (reclamation periods of 0, 8, 10, 13, 15, 18 and 30years), Pinus tabuliformis forests (reclamation periods of 0, 10, 19, 23 and 25years) and Ulmus pumila forests (reclamation periods of 0, 18, 20 and 22years) situated on RMSs in the Pingshuo opencast coal mine, China. Changes in labile organic C fractions within the soil profiles (0â100cm) were also identified at the 18- or 19-year plots under the three monoculture forests. Our results showed that, SOC and labile organic C fractions, together with soil microbial quotient (SMQ) and C management index (CMI), increased with time since reclamation, indicating that the quality of RMSs improved over time after initial reclamation under the three forest types. R. pseudoacacia significantly increased the accretion of SOC and EOC in the early stage of reclamation while P. tabuliformis accelerated the accumulation of the MBC fraction. Results for U. pumila indicated that this species had a better ability to store C in RMSs 10years or more after reclamation. SOC and labile organic C fractions both had S-shaped distributions within the soil profiles (0â100cm), with the 0â20cm layer recording the highest values (P<0.05). Labile organic C fractions were closely associated and correlated with soil physicochemical properties; our results also showed that nitrogen played an important role in the development of labile organic C fractions. Overall, reclamation accelerated the accretion of both SOC and labile organic C fractions, results of which varied among the reclaimed forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus tabuliformis 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aUlmus pumila 3acoal 3aforest types 3amicrobial biomass 3amined soils 3anitrogen 3aphysicochemical properties 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil physical properties 3asoil profiles 3atemporal variation 3aChina 0aCarbon sequestration 0aSurface mining 0aReclaimed mine soils1 aZhao, Zhongqiu1 aLi, Xuezhen1 aWang, Yangyang1 aBai, Zhongke0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 613-614 p.1196-1206dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.1703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008400171300001800255520130900273592002801582650002401610650002401634650002301658650001601681650002001697650001401717650002001731650001301751650001301764650002301777650000901800653001701809653001701826653001301843653001901856653001401875700002301889700002101912700002101933700002601954700002201980773012502002856008602127852000902213655001202222IND60770643420221117232652.0220319e20220304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077064342DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2020.17884822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrathumpai, Wai10aPilot-Scale Protease Production by Bacillus sp. C4 for Silk Degumming Processes  ap. 1055-1068.  aThe serine protease of Bacillus sp. C-4 has been reported as candidate proteases in the degumming process of the silk industry. The optimization of protease production by Bacillus sp. C4 was carried out using two-level fractional factorial and central composite designs. The investigation was followed by laboratory and pilot-scale protease production using molasses in batch and fed-batch bioreactors to reduce the production cost. The highest protease activity observed (1546.5Â U/mL, equivalent to 34.4 U/mL/h) in a 5-L bioreactor was obtained under fed-batch fermentation compared with batch process. The production of protease was subsequently scaled up to a pilot-scale 300-L fed-batch bioreactor, and a maximum protease activity of 1260Â U/mL (28Â U/mL/h) was observed. The degumming efficiencies of the protease produced by Bacillus sp. C4 in the CCD and bioreactors were 88.3% and 81.6%, respectively, relative to the alkaline degumming method. Furthermore, the stability test of the protease showed that the addition of CaClâ prolonged the stability of the protease activity from 4 to 8Â weeks at room temperature. Furthermore, the protease can be conveniently preserved at room temperature for 1 month and at 4Â°C for more than 2 months without the addition of any chemicals/cryoprotectants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aambient temperature 3abatch fermentation 3abioreactors 3acryoprotectants 3adegumming 3aenzyme activity 3aindustry 3amolasses 3aserine proteinases 3asilk 0aBacillus sp. 0aoptimization 0aprotease 0asilk degumming 0astability1 aPromboon, Amornrat1 aWerapan, Borworn1 aNutaratat, Pumin1 aChim-Anek, Patoomporn1 aNinpetch, Uraiwan0 tJournal of natural fibers.g2022 Mar. 04, v. 19, no. 3 p.1055-1068dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl946540x1544-046X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15440478.2020.17884823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245007400158300001600232520130300248592002801551650003001579650001301609651001001622700001701632700001701649700001701666700002001683700001801703773011301721856004801834852000901882655001201891IND4464994120221121033316.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446499412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-011-0472-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Ye10aDetection of trends in precipitation extremes in Zhejiang, east China  ap. 201-210.  aExtreme weather exerts a huge impact on human beings and it is of vital importance to study the regular pattern of meteorological and hydrological factors. In this paper, a selection of seven extreme indices is used to analyze the trend of precipitation extremes of 18 meteorological stations located in Zhejiang Province, east China using the MannâKendall test. Then the precipitation trends in the plum season (from May to July) and typhoon season (from August to October) are studied separately. The results show that the precipitation trend varies from east to west. There is a positive trend in the east and a negative one in the west. The largest part of Zhejiang Province shows a positive trend in heavy precipitation and the most significant upward trend is detected in Dinghai with 3.4Â mm/year for precipitation on very wet days. Although the upward trend of extreme precipitation is not prevailing, the range of increase in specific areas is apparent, like Dinghai with 1.3Â mm/year. Precipitation intensity exhibits an upward trend in most areas and a typical upward trend can be found in Dachendao, Tianmushan, and Yuhuan with 0.04, 0.02, and 0.05Â mm/year respectively. Precipitation intensity in both plum and typhoon seasons has increased too, especially for the coastal stations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3atyphoons 3aChina1 aXu, Yue-Ping1 aBooij, M.

But the fluorescence coloration of natural fibers with fluorescent dyes is rare because of the inherent polymeric and optical property of natural fibers, and the dyes state on fiber. The wool fabrics can be colored with pigments emulsion or water dispersions by exhaustion process. In this paper, the wool fabrics were colored with fluorescent pigment emulsions by padding, and their dyeing properties were investigated by color measurement, spectrofluorometer, SEM, TG, and fastness testing. The color data, dominant wavelength (or complementary wavelength), and excitation purity of colored samples were measured and illustrated with chromaticity diagram. The fluorescence spectrum of colored samples was tested as well. The results showed, with the raise of amount of pigments emulsion, the K/S value, reflectivity, durability, and shrinkage of colored samples increased, whereas the softness decreased. There were FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) phenomena in the colored samples. The fluorescent pigments emulsion deposited on the fabrics as resins between the wool fibers. The migration and rubbing fastnesses of all samples were good and were at grade 4 or above, but the light fastnesses were not good, and only at grade 3 or grade 3â4.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [21406108].  aPublisher supplied data  a21406108 3aclothing 3acolor 3adurability 3aemulsions 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3ahardness 3aindustry 3apolymers 3ashrinkage 3atraffic 3awavelengths 3awool 0aColor performance 0afluorescent pigment 0apadding process1 aSun, Jie0 tJournal of natural fibers.g2022 Mar. 04, v. 19, no. 3 p.1069-1083dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl946540x1544-046X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15440478.2020.17886853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008500161300001800246500002000264520163600284592002801920650001601948650001701964650001401981650001101995650001802006650002002024650002102044650001102065650002502076650001502101650002202116650002002138650001002158650002902168650002202197650002002219650001502239650001902254650001202273650000902285650002802294650001902322700002002341700003002361700002302391700001802414700002102432773013202453856007302585852000902658655001202667IND60587591220221121050401.0180102e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058759122DNAL7 a10.1890/09-0501.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDale, Virginia H.10aInteractions among bioenergy feedstock choices, landscape dynamics, and land use  ap. 1039-1054.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLandscape implications of bioenergy feedstock choices are significant and depend on landâuse practices and their environmental impacts. Although landâuse changes and carbon emissions associated with bioenergy feedstock production are dynamic and complicated, lignocellulosic feedstocks may offer opportunities that enhance sustainability when compared to other transportation fuel alternatives. For bioenergy sustainability, major drivers and concerns revolve around energy security, food production, land productivity, soil carbon and erosion, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, air quality, and water quantity and quality. The many implications of bioenergy feedstock choices require several indicators at multiple scales to provide a more complete accounting of effects. Ultimately, the longâterm sustainability of bioenergy feedstock resources (as well as food supplies) throughout the world depends on landâuse practices and landscape dynamics. Landâmanagement decisions often invoke tradeâoffs among potential environmental effects and social and economic factors as well as future opportunities for resource use. The hypothesis being addressed in this paper is that sustainability of bioenergy feedstock production can be achieved via appropriately designed crop residue and perennial lignocellulosic systems. We find that decision makers need scientific advancements and adequate data that both provide quantitative and qualitative measures of the effects of bioenergy feedstock choices at different spatial and temporal scales and allow fair comparisons among available options for renewable liquid fuels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3abiodiversity 3abioenergy 3acarbon 3acrop residues 3adecision making 3aeconomic factors 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afeedstocks 3afood availability 3afood production 3afuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aland productivity 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3alignocellulose 3aliquids 3asoil 3asustainable development 3awater quantity1 aKline, Keith L.1 aWright, L.

This method is based on the simultaneous decomposition and reduction of copper (II) carbonate. Hydrogen was used as a reducing agent. Due to the strongly exothermic thermal effect of the reduction reaction, a mixture of inert gas and hydrogen was used to better control the parameters. Studies have shown that the carbonate method enables the synthesis of copper powders with a narrow distribution and controlled size. The size is controlled by the grinding time of the copper (II) carbonate. An life cycle assessment and circularity study evaluate the sustainability of the new process, and focus is given to the energy efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbonates 3acopper 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat production 3ahydrogen 3alife cycle assessment 3aliquids 3asolar energy 0aCopper powder 0aSynthesis 0aPyrometallurgy 0aLife cycle assessment 0aCircularity1 aWojtaszek, Konrad1 aShabbir, Hasan1 aKula, Anna1 aPÄdzich, Zbigniew1 aKornaus, Kamil1 aMaÅecki, StanisÅaw1 aKoÅczyk-Siedlecka, Karolina1 aSocha, Robert P.1 aEscribÃ -Gelonch, Marc1 aRogÃ³Å¼, Katarzyna1 aGoodsite, Michael1 aHessel, Volker1 aWojnicki, Marek0 tSustainable materials and technologies.g2022 Sept., v. 33 p.e00486-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23531x2214-99377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.susmat.2022.e004863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245014000174300001600314520088600330592002801216650001701244650001001261650001201271650001401283650001401297651001801311651001101329651001801340700002701358700002301385700002001408773009901428856005501527852000901582655001201591IND4478122520221118234251.0120418e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447812252DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7917.2010.01390.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVrÅ¡anskÃ½, Peter10aDerived, still living cockroach genus Cariblattoides (Blattida: Blattellidae) from the Eocene sediments of Green River in Colorado, USA  ap. 143-152.  aCariblattoides labandeirai sp.n. from the Eocene sediments of Green River in Colorado, USA bear only two plesiomorphies, but also several significant autapomorphies within the advanced and highly derived living cockroach genus.

Generally, the vast majority of living genera were absent during the Palaeocene, thus the diversification of most living cockroach lineages near the Palaeocene/Eocene boundary must have been extremely rapid.

However, not much is known about the intricate molecular network of adventitious root development triggered by NO and H2O2. In this study, the involvement of calcium (Ca2+) and calmodulin (CaM) in NO- and H2O2-induced adventitious rooting in marigold was investigated. Exogenous Ca2+ was capable of promoting adventitious rooting, with a maximal biological response at 50ÃÂ ÃÂ¼M CaCl2. Ca2+ chelators and CaM antagonists prevented NO- and H2O2-induced adventitious rooting, indicating that both endogenous Ca2+ and CaM may play crucial roles in the adventitious rooting induced by NO and H2O2. NO and H2O2 treatments increased the endogenous content of Ca2+ and CaM, suggesting that NO and H2O2 enhanced adventitious rooting by stimulating the endogenous Ca2+ and CaM levels. Moreover, treatment with Ca2+ enhanced the endogenous levels of NO and H2O2. Additionally, Ca2+ might be involved as an upstream signaling molecule for CaM during NO- and H2O2-induced rooting. Altogether, the results suggest that both Ca2+ and CaM are two downstream signaling molecules in adventitious rooting induced by NO and H2O2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTagetes erecta 3aantagonists 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3achelating agents 3ahydrogen peroxide 3anitric oxide 3arooting1 aTiu, Cheryl,1 aHuang, Gao-Bao1 aYu, Ji-Hua0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2012 June, v. 31, no. 2 p.253-264dSpringer-Verlagx0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-011-9235-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245010700181300001800288520134400306592002801650650001301678650002401691650002601715650001901741650001401760650001901774650001901793650001201812650001501824650001101839650001301850650001701863650002101880650002001901653002001921653001901941653001901960653003301979653003102012700002502043700002202068700002102090773012502111856008802236852000902324655001202333IND60585352520221118063937.0201111e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058535252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.2422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Neal Tugaoen, Heather10aCompact light-emitting diode optical fiber immobilized TiO2 reactor for photocatalytic water treatment  ap. 1331-1338.  aA key barrier to implementing photocatalysis is delivering light to photocatalysts that are in contact with aqueous pollutants. Slurry photocatalyst systems suffer from poor light penetration and require post-treatment to separate the catalyst. The alternative is to deposit photocatalysts on fixed films and deliver light onto the surface or the backside of the attached catalysts. In this study, TiOâ-coated quartz optical fibers were coupled to light emitting diodes (OF/LED) to improve in situ light delivery. Design factors and mechanisms studied for OF/LEDs in a flow-through reactor included: (i) the influence of number of LED sources coupled to fibers and (ii) the use of multiple optical fibers bundled to a single LED. The light delivery mechanism from the optical fibers into the TiOâ coatings is thoroughly discussed. To demonstrate influence of design variables, experiments were conducted in the reactor using the chlorinated pollutant para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA). From the degradation kinetics of pCBA, the quantum efficiencies (Î¦) of oxidation and electrical energies per order (EEO) were determined. The use of TiOâ coated optical fiber bundles reduced the energy requirements to deliver photons and increased available surface area, which improved Î¦ and enhanced oxidative pollutant removal performance (EEO).  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3aenergy requirements 3alight emitting diodes 3aoptical fibers 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotons 3apollutants 3aquartz 3aslurries 3asurface area 3atitanium dioxide 3awater treatment 0aWater treatment 0aPhotocatalysis 0aNanotechnology 0aAdvanced oxidation processes 0aTrace organics, pollutants1 aGarcia-Segura, Sergi1 aHristovski, Kiril1 aWesterhoff, Paul0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 613-614 p.1331-1338dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.2423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03589naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148242059000170245013700760300001800897500001900915520173200934592002802666650001302694650001302707650003502720650001602755650002702771650002402798650003502822650002202857650001802879650001602897651001502913700002202928700002302950773012702973856008203100852000903182655001203191IND60734197220221120171257.0210415e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073419722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-021-02322-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahinuzzaman, M.10aDÃ©limitation des zones Ã  potentiel en eaux souterraines Ã  lâaide dâun concept parcimonieux basÃ© sur la thÃ©orie des catastrophes et le processus de hiÃ©rarchisation analytique DelimitaciÃ³n de zonas potenciales de aguas subterrÃ¡neas mediante un mÃ©todo parsimonioso a partir de la teorÃ­a de las catÃ¡strofes y el proceso de jerarquÃ­a analÃ­tica åºäºçªåçè®ºåå±æ¬¡åææ³çå°ä¸æ°´æ½ååºç®ååå Delineamento de zonas potenciais de Ã¡guas subterrÃ¢neas usando um conceito parcimonioso baseado na teoria da catÃ¡strofe e no processo hierÃ¡rquico analÃ­tico10aDelineation of groundwater potential zones using a parsimonious concept based on catastrophe theory and analytical hierarchy process  ap. 1091-1116.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA cost-effective âparsimoniousâ approach to delineating groundwater potential zones is proposed, based on catastrophe theory (CT) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in a geographic information system (GIS). Eleven indicators that influence groundwater storage (slope, drainage density, surface-water body (proximity), soil permeability, aquitard thickness, aquifer thickness, hydraulic conductivity, specific yield, recharge, aquitard resistivity and aquifer resistivity) were prepared. The suitable weights of the factors and the index values of the features of the factors were normalized using AHP and CT multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques for the development of a groundwater potential index (GWPI) map. Finally, the relative sensitivity of the factors was evaluated to develop a parsimonious groundwater potential index (P-GWPI) map using the most sensitive themes. GWPI and P-GWPI maps were validated using 14-year average annual post-monsoon depth to groundwater level data of 36 monitoring wells in a study area in Bangladesh. The generated GWPI map classified the study area as moderately good, good and very good groundwater potential covering an area of 19.5, 40.3 and 40.2% respectively. Subsequently, a modified GWPI map was developed using effective weights derived from single-parameter sensitivity analysis. The P-GWPI map developed using the most sensitive factors categorized the groundwater potential zones as moderately good (13.0%), good (38.2%) and very good (48.8%). The results of this study can serve as guidelines for future groundwater exploration, planning and management of the area, and the methodology used can also be easily adopted in other similar and data-scarce areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adrainage 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amathematical theory 3amulti-criteria decision making 3asoil permeability 3asurface water 3awater table 3aBangladesh1 aHaque, M.

The plastic waste used (HDPE, PP and PS) were obtained from Kiteezi landfill site, Kampala (Uganda). In a further step, the properties of the liquid fuel obtained from pyrolysis were also compared with commercial transportation fuel to ascertain its suitability on diesel engines.The fuel qualities were analysed using ASTM standard test methods At a degradation temperature of 450â¯Â°C, thermal pyrolysis in a batch reactor resulted in the highest yield of liquid fractions. The liquid yield of HDPE, PP and PS was found to be 80%, 82.6% and 80% by mass, respectively. In contrast, silica-alumina catalyst to feedstock ratio of 1:10 was the most effective in terms of gaseous fraction production. The gaseous fractions were: 60â¯wt% for the mixture, followed by HDPE (59.63â¯wt%), PS (59.07â¯wt%) and PP (49.33â¯wt%). A catalyst/polymer ratio of 1:10 greatly reduced the degradation temperature. The degradation temperature for HDPE, PP and PS was reduced by about 33%, 23% and 17%, respectively. The liquid oils from HDPE and PP had densities of 0.796â¯g/cmÂ³ and 0.786â¯g/cmÂ³; kinematic viscosities of 2.373â¯mmÂ²/s and 2.115â¯mmÂ²/s, dynamic viscosities of 1.889 mPas and 1.856 mPas; boiling point ranges of 119â364â¯Â°C and 148â355â¯Â°C; and cetane indices of 46 and 63, respectively. The characteristics of HDPE and PP pyrolytic sample oils are similar to conventional transportation fuel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboiling point 3acatalysts 3aengineering 3afeedstocks 3afuels 3alandfills 3aliquids 3aoils 3apolyethylene 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3atransportation 3aviscosity 3awastes 3aUganda 0aPlastic waste 0aPyrolysis 0aAppropriate technology 0aSilica-alumina 0aLiquid oil1 aBanadda, Noble1 aZziwa, Ahamada1 aSeay, Jeffrey1 aKiggundu, Nicholas0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2018 Mar., v. 130 p.285-293dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2017.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01448naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011400155300001800269520045000287592002800737650001500765650002300780650000900803650001900812650001500831650001300846650001800859650001300877700001500890773013400905856007401039852000901113655001201122IND60660178620221122183558.0190823e20140424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066017862DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc01567c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHa, Ji Won10aDefocused differential interference contrast microscopy imaging of single plasmonic anisotropic nanoparticles  ap. 5500-5502.  aWe present the defocused differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging of gold nanorods.

Here we present details of a small, efficient, and inexpensive âburrowscopeâ designed for examining the nest tunnels of very small birds. The burrowscope consists of a tiny (16 mm Ã 22 mm) video camera and infrared light-emitting diodes, mounted on the end of flexible conduit (20-mm diameter) that houses a live video feed to a small, hand-held monitor display. In total, the burrowscope is only 22 mm wide at its widest point, weighs approximately 900 g, and was built for less than US $400. The burrowscope was tested in the field and could be used at 99.8% of Rainbow Bee-eater (Merops ornatus) nests and 100% of Spotted Pardalote (Pardalotus punctatus) nests (one of the world's smallest burrow-nesting birds). The accuracy of the burrowscope was evaluated by excavating a nest access hole at a sub-sample of Rainbow Bee-eater nests. The burrowscope enabled precise determination of clutch size at 30 of 30 nests, and brood size at 125 of 127 nests. The equipment could be applied to other organisms, including some invertebrates, reptiles, amphibians, and burrow-nesting mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerops 3aamphibians 3abirds 3aclutch size 3aequipment 3ainvertebrates 3amammals 3anests 3areptiles 0aBee-eaters 0aburrow-nesting 0aburrowscope 0aPardalotes 0atunnel-nesting1 aPhillips, Robert M.0 tJournal of field ornithology.g2005 Jan., v. 76, no. 1 p.21-26dNortheastern Bird-Banding AssociationwJournal:19351x0273-85707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1648/0273-8570(2005)076[0021:ASLAIB]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008600164300001800250520116100268592002801429650000801457650001701465650001301482650002501495650001701520650001201537650002301549650001601572650001201588650001301600650001301613650001401626650001601640700002001656700002401676700002101700773012201721856008101843852000901924655001201933IND60627407920221122061327.0190128e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062740792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-008-2654-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, R.

Methylsilicone resin foams were prepared by simultaneous curing and foaming, without the addition of calalysts or blowing agents. The polymer precursor was irradiated with 1.5Â MeV EB up to a dose of 7.0Â MGy and at a dose rate of 2.8Â kG/s, in air. During irradiation the polymer melted, due to rapid increase in temperature, and simultaneously crosslinked by interaction with the ionizing radiation. Crosslinking occurred mainly by poly-condensation reactions and gaseous condensation products were released. The latter acted as an intrinsic foaming agent in the molten polymer. Foams obtained with radiation doses higher than 3.5Â MGy showed a high degree of crosslinking with a ceramic yield of over 89% at 1,000Â Â°C. Pyrolysis at 1,200â1,500Â Â°C resulted in SiOC ceramic foams with dense struts and walls, with bulk density around 0.3Â g/cmÂ³ and total porosity of 84%. Foams pyrolyzed at 1,200Â Â°C revealed compression strength of 6.8Â MPa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abulk density 3aceramics 3acompression strength 3acrosslinking 3afoaming 3aionizing radiation 3airradiation 3amelting 3apolymers 3aporosity 3apyrolysis 3atemperature1 aMoura, E.

Conceptually, interfacial adsorption results in retardation of PFCA velocities in subsurface multiphase systems. However, site hydrochemical factors influencing interfacial adsorption are not yet fully elucidated. Herein, air-water and NAPL-water interfacial tension isotherms were prepared for six homologous PFCAs of environmental significance for deionized water and five synthetic groundwaters of increasing ionic strength. The isotherms were successfully modeled by the Langmuir-Szyskowski equation and parameters used to fit the measured data are provided. Concentration-dependent interfacial adsorption coefficients and retardation factors are also provided for each PFCA and ionic strength condition and are evaluated to assess their significance. Simplifying relationships for predicting interfacial adsorption based on PFCA chain length were found to be less appropriate for natural groundwaters that contain a mixture of dissolved divalent and monovalent ions. Air-water interfacial (AWI) adsorption increased in a threshold manner with ionic strength from 0 to 6â¯mM, whereafter further adsorption was marginal. PFCA retention within water-unsaturated porous media is shown to depend on a number of inter-related factors and conditions that complicate the use of retardation factors within analytical models typically used for predicting transport rates under field conditions. Numerical simulation is thus necessary to model fundamental fate and transport processes. Mathematical relationships for incorporating interfacial adsorption in future and existing unsaturated flow and transport models are described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarboxylic acids 3aequations 3agroundwater 3aionic strength 3aions 3amathematical models 3anonaqueous phase liquids 3aporous media 3aprediction 3asurface tension 3aunsaturated flow 3avadose zone 0aPFAS 0aPerfluorocarboxylic acid 0aSurface tension 0aVadose zone 0aAir-water interfacial adsorption 0aNAPL-water interfacial adsorption1 aMartin, William A.1 aJohnson, Jared L.1 aMcCray, John E.0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2019 June, v. 223 p.103472-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl42311x0169-77227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2019.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03829naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148242072900163245015500892300001801047500001901065520167701084592002802761596008402789596005902873650002502932650002902957650001102986650001102997650001603008650001703024650001603041650002003057651001303077700002003090700001503110700001403125700002003139700001803159773012703177856008203304852000903386655001203395IND60734197420221120171307.0210415e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073419742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-020-02287-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Chen10aDiagnostiquer lâeffet du tampon souterrain sur la tempÃ©rature de la surface du sol dans le cadre du pompage Ã  long terme des eaux souterraines: effets du positionnement de la condition de limite infÃ©rieure DiagnÃ³stico de la amortiguaciÃ³n del subsuelo en la temperatura de la superficie terrestre bajo el bombeo de agua subterrÃ¡nea a largo plazo: efectos de la ubicaciÃ³n de la condiciÃ³n de lÃ­mite inferior è¯æ­å°ä¸æ°´é¿ææ½æ°´æ¡ä»¶ä¸å°ä¸ç¼å²å±å¯¹å°è¡¨æ¸©åº¦çå½±å:åºé¨è¾¹çæ¡ä»¶è®¾ç½®çå½±å Diagnosticando a zona amortecimento em subsuperfÃ­cie da temperatura do solo superficial sob bombeamento de Ã¡gua subterrÃ¢nea de longo prazo: efeitos da colocaÃ§Ã£o da condiÃ§Ã£o de limite inferior10aDiagnosing the subsurface buffer on ground-surface temperature under long-term groundwater pumping: effects of the bottom boundary condition placement  ap. 1313-1327.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe terrestrial subsurface acts as a buffer in regulating land-surface water and energy processes. In integrated modeling with land-surface models, the regulating capacity of the subsurface is largely determined by the bottom boundary condition placement (BBCP). However, the sensitivity of land-surface processes to BBCP in Earth system modeling and integrated hydrologic modeling under conditions of human disturbance has not been investigated. In the research reported here, numerical experiments by integrated hydrologic modeling in the Little Washita Basin (Oklahoma, USA) were conducted to study the behavior of the subsurface buffer in regulating ground-surface temperature (GST) under long-term groundwater pumping and the role of BBCP in modeling such processes. Results reveal that long-term groundwater pumping weakens the subsurface buffer and leads to a warming trend. Under either sustainable or unsustainable pumping scenarios, the increase in GST exhibits temporal nonlinearity by rapidly increasing in the beginning and gradually achieving a dynamic equilibrium. It is also found that the subsurface buffer with deeper BBCP is more effective on damping the nonlinearity and the amplitude of the increase in GST. In addition, variations in GST are more sensitive to BBCP under pumping than in the natural state due to decreased thermal properties. In summary, this study diagnoses the subsurface buffer on variations of GST with the role of BBCP in integrated modeling under long-term groundwater pumping. These results are expected to have important implications on integrated modeling with land-surface models in areas of groundwater depletion worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data  aXDA20100104cStrategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences  a41807198cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aEarth system science 3aanthropogenic activities 3abasins 3aenergy 3agroundwater 3ahydrogeology 3atemperature 3awater shortages 3aOklahoma1 aZheng, Tingting1 aHuang, Kun1 aLu, Zheng1 aZhang, You-Kuan1 aYang, Xiaofan0 tHydrogeology journal.g2021 May, v. 29, no. 3 p.1313-1327dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-020-02287-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245014000205300002000345520136400365592002801729650002201757650001901779650001401798650001301812650001401825650002101839650002301860650001001883650001601893653001701909653002001926653002601946653003301972653001302005653004302018700002902061700005802090700005702148773014202205856007802347852000902425655001202434IND60750509920221120075437.0210915e20210831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075050992DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c119942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubbiah, Karthick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0037-434X10aConifer Cone (Pinus resinosa) as a Green Corrosion Inhibitor for Steel Rebar in Chloride-Contaminated Synthetic Concrete Pore Solutions  ap. 43676-43695.  aThe present study has been focused on the environment-friendly corrosion inhibitor. Conifer cone (Pinus resinosa) has been used as a novel corrosion inhibitor to mitigate the corrosion of steel rebars in simulated concrete pore solutions (SCPS) in the presence and absence of chloride ions. The corrosion inhibitor is extracted by simple chemical methods. The functional groups present in the extracted conifer cone (ECC) powder are characterized as well as the surface morphology of ECC has been examined. The corrosion inhibition performance has been evaluated by the electrochemical and weight loss methods. The experimental results indicate that ECC possesses a corrosion inhibition efficiency of 81.2% at a dosage of 1000 mgÂ·LâÂ¹, after 720 h of immersion in chloride-contaminated SCPS. Adsorption isotherm and their standard Gibbs free energy (ÎGâdââ°) values are calculated by Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherm methods, and the results indicate that the ECC is initially adsorbed on the steel rebar surface by physisorption and then it turns to chemisorption. The steel rebar surfaces have been characterized after exposure to the ECC containing SCPS, and the results indicate that the ECC containing cationic adsorbate molecules, which interact with steel rebar, leads to retardation of metal dissolution in corrosive chloride medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aPinus resinosa 3achlorides 3aconifers 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3asorption isotherms 3asteel 3aweight loss 0aconifer cone 0agreen inhibitor 0asteel rebar corrosion 0apotentiodynamic polarization 0aconcrete 0aelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy1 aLee, H.

The ICP-SFMS was coupled with a microflow nebulizer and a desolvation system for the sample introduction, which reduced the isobaric interferences due to oxides and the required volume of sample solutions, compared to the usual nebulization chamber methods. With its very low limit of detection, and taking into account the level of blanks, this method allowed the quantification of many metals in very low concentration. Particular attention was given to Rare Earth Elements (REEs - La to Lu). The efficiency in the extraction of REEs was proved to be acceptable, with recoveries over 83% obtained with a Certified Reference Material (AMiS 0356). The analytical method was then applied to particulate matter samples, collected at ground level in Ny Ãlesund (Svalbard Islands, Norway), during spring and summer, from 2010 to 2015, with daily resolution and using a low-volume device. Thus, for the first time, a large atmospheric concentrations dataset of metals in Arctic particulate matter at high temporal resolution is presented. On the basis of differences in LREE/HREE ratio and Ce and Eu anomalies in spring and summer samples, basic information to distinguish local and long-range transported dust were achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aatomization 3abarium 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3adata collection 3adetection limit 3adigestion 3adust 3airon 3aislands 3alead 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3aoxides 3aparticulates 3arare earth elements 3asodium 3aspectrometers 3aspring 3asummer 3atitanium 3avanadium 3azinc 3aArctic region 3aNorway 0aInductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer 0aRare earth elements 0aArctic 0aSvalbard Islands 0aAerosol 0aParticulate matter1 aTraversi, Rita1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9790-21951 aBecagli, Silvia1 aSeveri, Mirko1 aCaiazzo, Laura1 aAncillotti, Claudia1 aUdisti, Roberto0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 613-614 p.1284-1294dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.2473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01884naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245012300135300001400258500001900272520083900291592002801130650001301158650001201171650001401183650002301197650001501220650002001235650000901255653002001264653002201284653003001306700002201336700001901358773014801377852000901525655001201534IND60723759420221120144350.0210117e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072375942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevasahayam, Mercy10aComparison of Two Milking Management System between Cross Bred Sahiwal Holstein and Local Miscellaneous Cattle in U.P.  ap. 88-90.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aComparative milk yield data from 5/8 Friesian and 3/8 Sahiwal cross bred cattle and local miscellaneous cattle were analysed using 341 lactation recordings from the years 2002-2005 at the Sam Higginbottom Institute of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences livestock unit which gives a fair estimation of milk production under prevailing local condition in UP.

The local miscellaneous cattle successively upgraded by cross breeding with exotic pure breeds Holstein Friesian should have a higher lactation yield comparable to pure breed indigenous cattle benefiting the local rural economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aSahiwal 3alactation 3amanagement systems 3amilk yield 3arural economics 3azebu 0aLactation yield 0aholstein friesian 0amilking management system1 aMecarty, Samuel D1 aRathore, Ashok0 tTrends in Biosciences.g2011 June, v. 4, no. 1 p.88-90dSociety for Advancement of Science and Rural DevelopmentwJournal:2106x0976-24857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015800169520188800327592002802215650001302243650001502256650001902271650001902290650002902309650002502338650001402363650001702377650001602394650001902410650002402429650002202453650001402475653004202489653003702531653002802568653002202596653002802618700005802646700005502704700001902759700002202778773011702800856008602917852000903003655001203012IND60635853820221119231215.0201025e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063585382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconhyd.2019.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Soyoung10aEvaluation of ethoxylated nonionic surfactants for solubilization of chlorinated organic phases: Effects of partitioning loss and macroemulsion formation  aSelection of proper surfactants is critical for applying surfactant-enhanced remediation (SER) to sites contaminated with nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). Here, ethoxylated nonionic surfactants (Tween 20, Tween 40, Tween 80, and Triton X-100) were evaluated for their applicability to remedy chlorinated organic phases, chloroform (CF), trichloroethylene (TCE), and tetrachloroethylene (PCE), on the basis of solubilization capacity, partitioning behavior, and macroemulsion formation. The most hydrophilic CF was not relevant for SER applications since excessive surfactant partitioning into CF rendered only few of them available for its solubilization. In contrast, the more hydrophobic TCE and PCE, having moderate surfactant partitioning, were effectively solubilized. Among Tween surfactants, a more hydrophobic surfactant showed a larger solubilization potential for both chloroethylenes, but it suffered from a greater partitioning loss. Depending on the type and extent of NAPL contaminations, thus, a prior consideration should be given to either solubilization capacity or partitioning loss when selecting the optimal Tween surfactant. Compared to Tween surfactants, the more hydrophobic Triton X-100 showed greater partitioning losses into all three NAPLs. Of particular, its partitioning into CF and TCE was nearly complete, making impractical its application to the remediation of both organic liquids. The formation of macroemulsions, characterized by a high turbidity, may significantly deteriorate SER applicability by producing undesirable flows in aquifers. Their formation became more problematic with the increasing surfactant hydrophilicity and the increasing NAPL hydrophobicity. When these combinations are applied, it is critical to keep such surfactant concentrations as to exploit the solubilization potential but not to cause the macroemulsion formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3achloroform 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3anonaqueous phase liquids 3anonionic surfactants 3aoctoxynol 3apolysorbates 3aremediation 3asolubilization 3atetrachloroethylene 3atrichloroethylene 3aturbidity 0aSurfactant-enhanced remediation (SER) 0aNonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) 0aMicellar solubilization 0aPartitioning loss 0aMacroemulsion formation1 aLim, Hyoun Soo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2489-44701 aGao, Yongli1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9063-47921 aKang, Jungchun1 aJeong, Hoon Young0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2019 June, v. 223 p.103475-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl42311x0169-77227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2019.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03420naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245018300166506010400349506007600453520144400529592002801973506003702001650002002038650002402058650002802082650002802110650002702138650002602165650001302191650002902204650002802233650001502261650001202276650002302288650001902311650001602330650000702346650001802353650003302371650001502404653002502419653001502444653001902459653001802478653002102496700001902517700002002536700002602556700002702582700001702609773012502626856008202751852000902833655001202842IND60775235220221207115341.0220523e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077523522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghi, Mahsa10aScreening of potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria with antimicrobial properties and selection of superior bacteria for application as biocontrol using machine learning models  aCreative Commons AttributionÂ 4.0Â Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a144 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were screened to find those with the best antimicrobial activity and potential probiotic properties. Firstly, bacteria were tested for resistance to low pH and high bile salt, antimicrobial properties against the common agent of bacterial contamination in plant tissue cultures. Then, the selected strains were assayed for probiotic characteristics including autoaggregation, coaggregation, hydrophobicity, biofilm formation, and adhesion ability. Finally, ranking and selection of probiotic potential bacteria for harnessing as antibacterial agents in plant tissue cultures were performed using supervised machine learning models. The highest values of autoaggregation percentages were observed for Lactobacillus paracasei S23 (96.1%), while the highest coaggregation values with Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocytogenes were observed for strains Lactobacillus plantarum S57 (63.4%), L. plantarum S70 (57.4%), and Lactobacillus casei S81 (58.6%), respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) and machine learning algorithms allowed to select and prioritizing of 15 out of 144 LAB strains, based on their probiotic potential properties or their antimicrobial activity, of which four strains including Lb. paracasei S23, Lb. plantarum S70, Lb. casei S81, and Lb. plantarum S57 were proposed as appropriate antimicrobial candidates for harnessing in plant tissue cultures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus cereus 3aLactobacillus casei 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadhesion 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacterial contamination 3abile salts 3abiofilm 3abiological control 3ahydrophobicity 3alactic acid 3apH 3aplant tissues 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprobiotics 0aPotential probiotics 0aBiocontrol 0aTissue culture 0aAntimicrobial 0aMachine learning1 aPanahi, Bahman1 aMazlumi, Atefeh1 aHejazi, Mohammad Amin1 aKomi, Daniel Elieh Ali1 aNami, Yousef0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 June 01, v. 162 p.113471-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010500164300002000269520098700289592002801276650001301304650001501317650001501332650001201347650001201359650001201371650001301383650003101396650001701427650001301444650002001457650002301477650002201500650001801522700001601540700001601556700002001572700001401592700001701606700001701623700002101640773014901661856008101810852000901891655001201900IND60440180420221119040037.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044018042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4523-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Xiaofei10aImmobilization of Cd(II) in acid soil amended with different biochars with a long term of incubation  ap. 12597-12604.  aBiochars derived from bamboo, coconut shell, pine wood shavings, and sugarcane bagasse were applied into Ultisol to investigate their effects on Cd(II) immobilization. After 360Â days of incubation, the physical/chemical properties of the Ultisol were improved by the addition of different biochars. As a result, the maximum adsorption capacities of soil for Cd(II) were increased from 8.02 to 9.07â11.51Â mmol/kg, and bamboo biochar showed the highest effect on Cd(II) immobilization. The Langmuir model (R Â²â>â0.983) fitted the data better than the Freundlich model (R Â² were 0.902â0.937). Column leaching experiments suggested that biochar can also increase the immobilization of Cd(II) under leaching conditions. Biochar mainly increased the weak/unstable binding force of Cd(II) by soil, such as ion exchange, electrostatic attraction, physical adsorption, and carbonate precipitation. In addition, a significant enhancement of surface complexation was also observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUltisols 3aacid soils 3aadsorption 3abamboos 3abiochar 3acadmium 3acoconuts 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aion exchange 3aleaching 3asoil amendments 3asorption isotherms 3asugarcane bagasse 3awood shavings1 aLiu, Yunguo1 aKu, Yenlin,1 aZeng, Guangming1 aWang, Xin1 aHu, Xinjiang1 aSun, Zhichao1 aYang, Changnian,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Aug., v. 22, no. 16 p.12597-12604dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4523-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012400164300001800288520095000306592002801256650001301284650002501297650001301322650001301335700002001348700001501368700001801383773012201401856008101523852000901604655001201613IND60627408020221122091238.0190128e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062740802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-008-2641-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMÃ©ndez, A.,14aThe effect of graphite addition on the mechanical and tribological properties of pitch-based granular carbon composites  ap. 4541-4549.  aThe present work deals with the effect of graphite addition on selected mechanical and tribological properties of pitch-based granular carbon composites. Three pitches (a commercial impregnating coal tar pitch, an air-blown pitch and a thermally treated coal tar pitch) and anthracite particles as reinforcing material were used to prepare carbon composites to be tested as carbon brake pads. These carbon composites show good compression strength (from 25.8 to 94.2Â MPa) but unstable and high friction coefficients (>0.5). Experimental results have showed that small amounts of graphite addition (2.5 and 5.0Â wt%) lead to carbon materials with more stable and lower friction coefficient (<0.3). So, graphite addition promoted the reduction in the wear rate. Finally, compressive strength of carbon composites prepared with modified pitches significantly increases after addition of small amounts of graphite with values from 94 to 128.8Â MPa.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal tar 3acompression strength 3afriction 3agraphene1 aSantamarÃ­a, R.1 aGranda, M.1 aMenÃ©ndez, R.0 tJournal of materials science.g2008 July, v. 43, no. 13 p.4541-4549dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-008-2641-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003000141245013300171500001400304520150500318592002801823650001101851650000901862650001801871650002201889700002901911700002301940700002201963700002401985773012202009856007502131852000902206655001202215IND60715211120221120212646.0201026e20200928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071521112DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101017572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfaller-Sadovsky, Nicole 10aWhatâs in a Click? The Efficacy of Conditioned Reinforcement in Applied Animal Training: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  aNAL-light  aA conditioned reinforcer is a stimulus that acquired its effectiveness to increase and maintain a target behavior on the basis of the individualâs historyâe.g., pairings with other reinforcers. This systematic review synthesized findings on conditioned reinforcement in the applied animal training field. Thirty-four studies were included in the review and six studies were eligible for a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of behavioral interventions that implemented conditioned reinforcement (e.g., clicks, spoken word, or whistles paired with food). The majority of studies investigated conditioned reinforcement with dogs (47%, n = 16) and horses (30%, n = 10) implementing clickâfood pairings. All other species (cats, cattle, fish, goats, and monkeys) were equally distributed across types of conditioned (e.g., clicker or spoken word) and unconditioned reinforcers (e.g., food, water, or tactile). A meta-analysis on the effectiveness of conditioned reinforcement in behavioral interventions found a medium summary effect size (Tau-U 0.77; CIââ% = [0.53, 0.89]), when comparing baseline, where no training was done, and treatment levels. Moderators of conditioned reinforcement effectiveness were species (e.g., horses) and research design (e.g., multiple-baseline designs). The small number of intervention-focused studies available limits the present findings and highlights the need for more systematic research into the effectiveness of conditioned reinforcement across species.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3afish 3ameta-analysis 3asystematic review1 aHurtado-Parrado, Camilo 1 aCardillo, Daniela 1 aMedina, Lucia  G.1 aFriedman, Susan  G.0 tAnimals.g2020 Sept. 28, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101017573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007900169300001300248520153000261592002801791650001801819650001101837650003301848650002301881650002501904700001901929700001901948773011401967856008602081990002302167852000902190655001202199IND60093738120221120233521.0141103e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009373812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemolab.2012.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ya-Jun10aWeak fault monitoring method for batch process based on multi-model SDKPCA  ap. 1-12.  aIn industrial manufacturing, most batch processes have the dynamic and nonlinear features in nature. To ensure both quality consistency of the manufactured products and safe operation of this kind of batch process, a number of multivariate statistical analyses, including multiway principal component analysis (MPCA), batch dynamic kernel principal component analysis (BDKPCA), have been developed in recent years. However, these methods can't effectively detect the weak faults due to large fluctuations in the initial conditions, because the weak faults are submerged to the fluctuations in the poor initial conditions. In order to improve the performance of the weak fault detection, a new nonlinear dynamic batch process monitoring method, called multi-model single dynamic kernel principal component analysis (M-SDKPCA), is proposed in this paper. The multi-model methodology is based on BDKPCA. The method firstly integrates kernel PCA (KPCA) and auto-regressive moving average exogenous (ARMAX) time series model for each batch data at each stage to build SDKPCA. Then hierarchical clusters are obtained through load matrix similarity among SDKPCA models. At different stages, multiple model structures are constructed along with the variation of the cluster number. The monitoring method proposed in this paper was applied to fault detection for benchmark of fed-batch penicillin production. In both off-line analysis and on-line batch monitoring, the proposed approach shows better performance than MKPCA and BDKPCA.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprocess monitoring 3atime series analysis1 aJia, Ming-Xing1 aMao, Zhi-Zhong0 tChemometrics and intelligent laboratory systems.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 118 p.1-12dElsevier B.V.x0169-74397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2012.07.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01988naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245013000205300001600335500002000351520094000371592002801311650001901339650001301358650001801371650003001389650001501419650001901434700001901453773011301472856008001585852000901665655001201674IND60786918320221121053455.0220806e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078691832DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.135922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmaya, Yoshihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8307-777X10aLocalization and ER membrane insertion of parathyroid hormoneârelated protein analyzed without effects of reporter proteins  ap. 383-392.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aParathyroid hormoneârelated protein (PTHrP) is transported to both the secretory pathway and the nucleus/nucleolus by its dual targeting signals, that is, an Nâterminal signal peptide and nuclear targeting signal.

Mutational analyses including insertion of a glycosylation site for the tagged PTHrP revealed that the evolutionarily conserved regions in the signal peptide and the proâregion facilitate the redirection of ppPTHrP from the secretory pathway to the nuclear targeting pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell nucleolus 3acysteine 3aglycosylation 3agreen fluorescent protein 3amethionine 3asignal peptide1 aNakai, Toshiki0 tFEBS letters.g2020 Jan., v. 594, no. 2 p.383-392dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.135923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245015200176520165100328592002801979650001302007650001602020650001402036650001102050650001302061650002002074650001202094650002102106650001602127650001902143650001602162650001202178650002302190650002202213650001502235650001002250650001102260650000902271650002102280650001702301650002502318650002402343653002902367653002002396653002102416653002702437653001302464700001902477700002802496700002202524700002202546773009802568856008202666852000902748655001202757IND60727469520221122095320.0220830e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072746952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1191912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDharavath, Ravinder Naik10aSaroglitazar, a novel dual PPAR-Î±/Î³ agonist, reverses high fat-low protein diet-induced metabolic and cognitive aberrations in C57BL/6J male mice  aInsulin resistance (IR) has become one of the major causative factors for the pathogenesis of various metabolic and neurometabolic diseases. The sedentary lifestyle in association with the consumption of protein-deficient and high-calorie diet results in IR development. This study was aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of Saroglitazar (SGZ), a dual peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR-Î±/Î³) in a high fat-low protein diet (HFLPD) fed mouse model of MetS and associated cognitive deficits.Â Adult male C57BL/6J mice were fed with HFLPD plus 15% oral fructose solution for 16Â weeks. Starting at the 13th week, SGZ (5 & 10Â mg/kg; p.o.) was administered along with HFLPD for four weeks, i.e., the 12th to 16th week of the study groups. Various physiological, serum metabolic, neurobehavioral, neuroinflammatory, and oxidative stress parameters were assessed. The brain histopathology and mRNA expression of diverse genes in specific brain regions were also estimated.Â The treatment with SGZ at both doses have significantly reversed various HFLPD-induced metabolic and cognitive alterations by improving the glucose and lipid profile in the periphery in addition to the enhanced cerebral glucose homeostasis, BBB integrity, reduced oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, the SGZ improved locomotion and memory retention while reducing the HFLPD-induced anxiety-like behaviors in the mice.Â SGZ treatment showed significant metabo-neuroprotective effects in mice fed with HFLPD, possibly through peripherally mediated activation of PPAR-Î±/Î³ and insulin downstream signaling in the cortex and hippocampus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3ablood serum 3acognition 3acortex 3afructose 3agene expression 3aglucose 3ahigh energy diet 3ahippocampus 3ahistopathology 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alipid composition 3alocomotion 3amales 3amemory 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3aprotein deficiencies 3asedentary lifestyle 0aBrain insulin resistance 0aDietary protein 0aFructose feeding 0aHigh carbohydrate diet 0aLipaglyn1 aArora, Shiyana1 aKondepudi, Kanthi Kiran1 aBishnoi, Mahendra1 aChopra, Kanwaljit0 tLife sciences.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 271 p.119191-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1191913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245011100174300001600285520167800301592002801979650001102007650000902018650001502027650001802042650000902060650001402069650001902083650001002102650001802112650000902130700002402139700002102163700002002184700002002204700001902224700002402243700002402267700001702291773008502308856008802393852000902481655001202490IND60561090120221121215621.0170606e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056109012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2013.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchnell, Gilles10aContrasting diagenetic pathways of higher plant triterpenoids in buried wood as a function of tree species  ap. 107-124.  aTerpenoid biomarkers with high chemotaxonomic value, which can be used for the identification of an angiosperm input to sedimentary organic matter are desirable for studies devoted to the reconstitution of past environmental change. There is also a need, in the framework of archaeometric investigations, for reliable biomarkers to allow wood species determination from archaeological remains. In this context, we report the analysis of the triterpene content of buried wood and bark from oak, alder and birch, and comparison with that of the corresponding fresh material. Identification of new biomarkers led us to elucidate the diagenetic transformations undergone by triterpenoids in buried wood. A large set of triterpenoid biomarkers characterized by the presence of an oxygenated functionality in ring A at C-2 only could be exclusively evidenced in buried oak wood. An overall diagenetic pathway leading from the predominant polyfunctionalized triterpenoids in fresh oak wood (oxygenated functionalities at C-2/C-3/C-19/C-23/C-24/C-28) via numerous C-2 and C-2,C-3 functionalized intermediates to C-2 oxygenated aromatic triterpenoids is proposed. The evolution of the triterpenoid assemblage with respect to the level of diagenetic alteration could be followed. In contrast, the predominant triterpenoids in fresh alder and birch are common C-3 functionalized compounds. Their degradation follows the classical degradation/aromatization pathways reported for C-3 oxygenated triterpenes, ring A degradation appearing to represent only a minor process. In addition, the formation of phenolic triterpenoids, which have only been reported from brown coal, was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3abark 3abiomarkers 3achemotaxonomy 3acoal 3aevolution 3aorganic matter 3atrees 3atriterpenoids 3awood1 aSchaeffer, Philippe1 aTardivon, HervÃ©1 aMotsch, Estelle1 aConnan, Jacques1 aErtlen, Damien1 aSchwartz, Dominique1 aSchneider, Nathalie1 aAdam, Pierre0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2014 Jan., v. 66 p.107-124dElsevier Ltdx0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2013.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245009800160300002000258500001900278520131800297592002801615650001401643650001701657650001601674650001601690650001401706650001401720650001401734650001401748650002601762650002501788650001901813650001601832650002101848650001001869650001401879650002801893650001401921650001501935650003601950700001401986700001502000700001502015700006602030700005602096773014202152856007902294852000902373655001202382IND60671562120221119030100.0191003e20190827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067156212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b073142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Chao10aImmunotoxic Potential of Bisphenol F Mediated through Lipid Signaling Pathways on Macrophages  ap. 11420-11428.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs a bisphenol A (BPA) alternative, bisphenol F (BPF) has been detected in various products, such as paper products, personal care products, and food. More importantly, the toxicity of BPF remains underexplored. We reported an integrated method to study the immunotoxic potentials and the underlying mechanisms of BPF on cell apoptosis, macrophage polarization, reactive oxygen species generation, expression and secretion of immune-related cytokines, and reprogramming of lipid signaling. More serious to BPA, BPF induced apoptosis in macrophages. The apoptosis was induced by activating both sphingomyelin-ceramide signaling pathway and oxidative stress, which included intrinsic (bax and caspase-9) and extrinsic apoptotic pathways (tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, caspase-8, and caspase-3). BPF exposure also induced the proinflammatory phenotype of the macrophage. This alternation was shown to be closely correlated with the modulation of biosynthesis and degradation of glycerophospholipids. This study demonstrated novel evidence that BPF as a substituent of BPA induced immunotoxic effects at environmentally relevant concentrations. We also showed that the reprogramming of lipidome plays a key role in the regulation of macrophage polarization and the induction of immunotoxicity of the BPA analogue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiosynthesis 3abisphenol A 3abisphenol F 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-8 3acaspase-9 3acytokines 3aenvironmental science 3aglycerophospholipids 3aimmunotoxicity 3amacrophages 3aoxidative stress 3apaper 3aphenotype 3areactive oxygen species 3asecretion 3atechnology 3atumor necrosis factor receptors1 aTang, Zhi1 aXie, Peisi1 aLin, Kaili1 aChung, Arthur Chi Kong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1519-72241 aCai, Zongwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8724-76840 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Aug. 27, v. 53, no. 19 p.11420-11428dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b073143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002800145245014600173300001600319500002000335520079700355592002801152596003601180596005401216650001501270650002501285650001401310650001501324650001901339650001501358650004401373650001401417650003301431650001301464650003001477700002101507700001901528700002001547700002001567700001701587700002501604700002801629700005901657773011301716856008001829852000901909655001201918IND60786918420221121053624.0220806e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078691842DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.135932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanestrari, MickaÃ«l J.10aDeciphering the specific interaction between the acyl carrier protein IacP and the T3SSâmajor hydrophobic translocator SipB from Salmonella  ap. 251-265.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSalmonella is a facultative intracellular pathogen that invades epithelial cells of the intestine using the SPIâ1 Type 3 secretion System (T3SS). Insertion of the SPIâ1 T3SS translocon is facilitated by acylation of the translocator SipB, which involves a proteinâprotein interaction with the acyl carrier protein IacP. Using nuclear magnetic resonance and biological tests, we identified the residues of IacP that are involved in the interaction with SipB. Our results suggest that the 4â²âphosphopantetheine group that functionalizes IacP participates in the interaction. Its solvent exposition may rely on two residues highly conserved in acyl carrier proteins associated with T3SS. This study is the first to address the specificity of acyl carrier proteins associated with T3SS.  aPublisher supplied data  cAixâMarseille UniversitÃ© AMU  cCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique CNRS 3aSalmonella 3aacyl carrier protein 3aacylation 3aepithelium 3ahydrophobicity 3aintestines 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apathogens 3aprotein-protein interactions 3asolvents 3atype III secretion system1 aSerrano, Bastien1 aBartoli, Julia1 aPrima, ValÃ©rie1 aBornet, Olivier1 aPuppo, RÃ©my1 aBouveret, Emmanuelle1 aGuerlesquin, FranÃ§oise1 aViala, Julie P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9520-537X0 tFEBS letters.g2020 Jan., v. 594, no. 2 p.251-265dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.135933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003500147245011600182300001800298520122400316592002801540650001301568650002501581650001501606650001101621650001001632650001401642650002001656650001801676650002601694650001501720650001401735651001401749700002301763700001501786773011801801856008101919852000902000655001202009IND60465797420221122032544.0160218e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046579742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-015-4368-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThornton, J.

While these waterbodies would not be considered presently to be saline lakes, there has been a rapid increase in the chloride concentrations in most of these lakes over the last 30 years, with the lakes increasing from a mean chloride concentration of about 19 mg/L to over 100 mg/L in some cases. While ecological impacts can be expected when chloride values exceed 250 mg/L, the rate of increase presents a basis for concern, especially since the underlying geology of the region is based on limestone/dolomite which is deficient in chlorides. Thus, the origin of the chlorides is anthropogenic: human and industrial wastewaters (treatment of which has effected improvements in trophic status but has not affected other water-borne contaminants) and winter de-icing practices based upon large quantities of sodium chloride are major contributors to the increasing concentrations of chloride in the regionâs waterways. Without taking remedial measures, the rate of salinization is expected to continue to increase, resulting, ultimately, in the alteration of the freshwater systems in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3adolomite 3aenvironmental impact 3afreshwater 3ahumans 3alakes 3alimestone 3asodium chloride 3asurface water 3atrophic relationships 3awastewater 3awaterways 3aWisconsin1 aSlawski, Thomas M.1 aLin, Hebin0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2015 Nov., v. 33, no. 6 p.1461-1475dScience Pressx0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-015-4368-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011300170300001600283520149000299592002801789650001401817650000901831650004301840650001801883650001601901650002201917650001401939700002201953773009501975856008402070852000902154655001202163IND60113075920221121015123.0141111e20130524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011307592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGritti, Fabrice10aRealization and potential advantages of gradient separations performed under steady state temperature regime  ap. 104-113.  aThis paper describes a new method designed to perform gradient separations while keeping constant the distribution of temperature throughout the column during the three phases of a gradient run (the ramp up of the strong eluent concentration, the column wash, and the re-equilibration steps) in high pressure liquid chromatography (vHPLC). The method is based on the solution of the integrated heat balance equation along the column knowing the variations of the eluent specific heat, its thermal expansion coefficient, and its viscosity with the concentration of the strong eluent. This new method is called gradient under constant wall heat (cWH). Its value is demonstrated by the stability of the eluent temperature at the column outlet during a series of consecutive gradient runs. The potential advantages of cWH gradients over classical gradients execution mode at constant flow rate (cF) are illustrated in the example of two such gradients run in the same time.

Further, it is commercially developed by using the latest tools in information technology and based on the need of the laboratory it has got many varieties. Various sectors like agriculture, environmental and water, food and beverage, manufacturing, product quality and cyber forensic analysis etc. uses full-enterprise LIMS in their operations. It was found that the LIMS applications are not running properly due to its limitation such as improper installation, poor implementation, lack of technical access etc. This paper highlights the review of developmental stages of LIMS and some shortcomings for attaining the total quality management in a laboratory that ensure efficiency, enhanced productivity, better utilization of resources and security measures etc. An effective management system totally depends on the laboratory infrastructure. Hence, proper study of the laboratory functionalities is required before going ahead with the solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3acomputer software 3aequipment 3aforensic sciences 3ainformation management 3amanagement information systems 3amanufacturing 3aproduct quality 3aquality control1 aBodhe, G.L.0 tChemometrics and intelligent laboratory systems.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 118 p.187-192dElsevier B.V.x0169-74397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2012.07.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02161naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245011500206300001600321500002000337520084400357592002801201596006201229650002501291650001701316650001701333650001201350650003901362700002001401700002201421700001901443700002001462700002301482700001901505700001901524700001801543773011301561856008001674852000901754655001201763IND60786918520221121053617.0220806e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078691852DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.135942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrangulis, Kalvis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0757-746210aStructural analysis of BorreliaÂ burgdorferi periplasmic lipoprotein BB0365 involved in Lyme disease infection  ap. 317-326.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe periplasmic lipoprotein BB0365 of the Lyme disease agent BorreliaÂ burgdorferi is expressed throughout mammalian infection and is essential for all phases of Lyme disease infection; its function, however, remains unknown. In the current study, our structural analysis of BB0365 revealed the same structural fold as that found in the NqrC and RnfG subunits of the NADH:quinone and ferredoxin:NADâº sodiumâtranslocating oxidoreductase complexes, which points to a potential role for BB0365 as a component of the sodium pump. Additionally, BB0365 coordinated ZnÂ²âº by the His51, His55, His140 residues, and the ZnÂ²âºâbinding site indicates that BB0365 could act as a potential metalloenzyme; therefore, this structure narrows down the potential functions of BB0365, an essential protein for B.Â burgdorferi to cause Lyme disease.  aPublisher supplied data  a1.1.1.2/VIAA/1/16/144cEuropean Regional Development Fund 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aLyme disease 3alipoproteins 3amammals 3asodium-potassium-exchanging ATPase1 aAkopjana, Inara1 aPetrovskis, Ivars1 aKazaks, Andris1 aJekabsons, Atis1 aJaudzems, Kristaps1 aViksna, Arturs1 aBertins, Maris1 aTars, Kaspars0 tFEBS letters.g2020 Jan., v. 594, no. 2 p.317-326dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.135943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013000168520185400298592002802152650002002180650001702200650001302217650002802230650001402258650001102272650002502283650000902308650001902317650002302336650001602359650001702375650002002392650002202412650000902434650001702443653002102460653001702481653004202498653001602540653002002556653001202576700001802588700002302606700002402629700002102653700001702674700002302691773009802714856008202812852000902894655001202903IND60727469720221122093932.0220830e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072746972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1191932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrajapati, Smita10a6,7-Dihydroxycoumarin ameliorates crystal-induced necroptosis during crystal nephropathies by inhibiting MLKL phosphorylation  aMineralization of crystalline particles and the formation of renal calculi contribute to the pathogenesis of crystal nephropathies. Several recent studies on the biology of crystal handling implicated intrarenal crystal deposition-induced necroinflammation in their pathogenesis. We hypothesized that 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin (DHC) inhibit intrarenal crystal cytotoxicity and necroinflammation, and ameliorate crystal-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD).Â An unbiased high content screening coupled with fluorescence microscopy was used to identify compounds that inhibit CaOx crystal cytotoxicity. The ligand-protein interactions were identified using computational models e.g. molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, mice and rat models of oxalate-induced CKD were used for in-vivo studies. Renal injury, crystal deposition, and fibrosis were assessed by histology analysis. Western blots were used to quantify the protein expression. Data were expressed as boxplots and analyzed using one way ANOVA.Â An unbiased high-content screening in-vitro identified 6,7-DHC as a promising candidate. Further, 6,7-DHC protected human and mouse cells from calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal-induced necroptosis in-vitro as well as mice and rats from oxalate-induced CKD in either preventive or therapeutic manner. Computational modeling demonstrated that 6,7-DHC interact with MLKL, the key protein in the necroptosis machinery, and inhibit its phosphorylation by ATP, which was evident in both in-vitro and in-vivo analyses.Â Together, our results indicate that 6,7-DHC possesses a novel pharmacological property as a MLKL inhibitor and could serve as a lead molecule for further development of coumarin-based novel MLKL inhibitors. Furthermore, our data identify 6,7-DHC as a novel therapeutic strategy to combat crystal nephropathies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium oxalate 3acytotoxicity 3afibrosis 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahistology 3ahumans 3amedicinal properties 3amice 3amineralization 3amolecular dynamics 3anecroptosis 3apathogenesis 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3atherapeutics 0aCrystallopathies 0aInflammation 0aMitochondrial permeability transition 0aNecroptosis 0aNephrolithiasis 0aOxalate1 aTomar, Bhawna1 aSrivastava, Anjali1 aNarkhede, Yogesh B.1 aGaikwad, Anil N.1 aLahiri, Amit1 aMulay, Shrikant R.0 tLife sciences.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 271 p.119193-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1191933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245012500162500001400287520160900301592002801910650001901938650001201957650002201969650001901991650001702010650001002027651001202037700002902049700001902078773012202097856007502219852000902294655001202303IND60715211420221120202653.0201026e20200928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071521142DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101017602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinkel, Carolin 10aUnderstanding German Pig Farmersâ Intentions to Design and Construct Pig Housing for the Improvement of Animal Welfare  aNAL-light  aImproving farm animal welfare requires modifications to the behavior of many stakeholders. Investments in more animal-friendly barns to improve animal welfare have already been made by some farmers. However, more farmers must be persuaded to modernize their barns. The marketing of animal-friendly products is the responsibility of retailers, and consumers have to purchase these products. Currently, little is known about what (and how) underlying psychological factors influence a farmerâs intention to construct pig housing to improve farm animal welfare. Pig farmers in Germany were questioned via an online questionnaire in May 2020 (n = 424). Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), partial least squares path modeling was used. The constructs: attitude, subjective norm, direct and indirect experience associated with the construction of pig housing substantially influenced the farmersâ behaviors. As expected, the impact of perceived behavioral control on intention was negative but was also very low and only slightly significant. Contrary to expectations, the perceived behavioral control had no significant influence on farmersâ behaviors. Pig farmers who have already rebuilt their pigsâ housing should be motivated to share their experiences to influence their colleaguesâ intentions to construct. Our results will encourage policy makers to consider the important role of the different psychological and intrinsic factors influencing pig farmers. Thus, the sustainability of pig farming can be improved by giving politicians a better understanding of farmersâ behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3afarmers 3aissues and policy 3aquestionnaires 3astakeholders 3aswine 3aGermany1 avon Meyer-HÃ¶fer, Marie 1 aHeise, Heinke 0 tAnimals.g2020 Sept. 28, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101017603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014800160300001600308520168200324592002802006650002502034650002102059650002102080650003102101650002102132650002202153650002202175650001402197650002402211650002402235650001702259650001802276650002002294650003202314700002702346700002102373700002802394773012102422856007402543852000902617655001202626IND60662127020221118055841.0190904e20130528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066212702DNAL7 a10.1039/c3fo60036j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeguin, Pauline10aEffect of polyunsaturated fatty acids on tight junctions in a model of the human intestinal epithelium under normal and inflammatory conditions  ap. 923-931.  aOwing to their immune-modulatory action on the intestinal mucosa immune cells, the n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been suggested to modulate the risk and development of inflammatory bowel diseases. Failure in the intestinal barrier is an important hallmark of inflammatory bowel diseases. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of dietary PUFA on tight junction protein localisation and on the modulation of epithelial permeability under physiological conditions or under an inflammatory stress. For this purpose, we first confirmed the accumulation of PUFA in phospholipid fractions of Caco-2 cells upon 7 days of incubation with specific PUFA. Thereafter, Caco-2 cells were cultured in inserts, which provide a model of the human intestinal barrier. Accumulation of dietary n-3 PUFA in phospholipids did not affect the presence of occludin in tight junction complexes, while that of dietary n-6 PUFA decreased it. Whatever the PUFA, at 30 Î¼M, no distortion of the Caco-2 barrier function was observed. Otherwise, 150 Î¼M of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) affected ZO-1 intensity under normal conditions, but not occludin or the barrier function parameters. Finally, to simulate an inflammatory state, cells were exposed for 24 h to interleukin-1Î², tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interferon-Î³ at their basolateral side and to lypopolysaccharides at both sides. DHA limited the effect of inflammatory stimulus on occludin, ZO-1 and barrier function. In conclusion, this study has evidenced the specific effect of individual PUFA to modulate occludin and ZO-1 localization, according to the inflammatory status of this in vitro model of the intestinal barrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3ahuman cell lines 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aintestinal mucosa 3aoccludins 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3apermeability 3aphospholipids 3atight junctions 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aErrachid, Abdelmounaim1 aLarondelle, Yvan1 aSchneider, Yves-Jacques0 tFood & function.g2013 May 28, v. 4, no. 6 p.923-931dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3fo60036j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012200170520132400292592002801616650001201644650001701656650002601673650002901699651001001728653002201738653003101760653002801791653002501819653002701844653002201871700005501893700001501948700005801963773011802021856008602139852000902225655001202234IND60786164120221118064909.0221004e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078616412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1158252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Fangnan10aPromoting public engagement with household waste separation through government social media: A case study of Shanghai  aGovernment agencies around the world are increasingly using social media to promote public engagement with government-initiated activities, such as Household Waste Separation (HWS). However, existing studies fail to examine how governments can use their official social media accounts to promote public engagement with HWS. This pioneering study investigates the effects of dialogic loop, media richness, content theme, and emotional valence on public engagement with HWS through Government Social Media (GSM). Moreover, the influencing mechanisms are explored by examining the moderating role of social media capital. In total, 1795 posts were scraped from the official Sina Weibo accounts of seventeen Shanghai governments and later analyzed. Results reveal that dialogic loop positively predicts public engagement with HWS through GSM, but media richness negatively affects public engagement. Content themes have significantly different impacts on the level of public engagement with HWS through GSM. Unexpectedly, the effect of emotional valence is not significant. This study is the first of its kind to demonstrate the moderating role of social media capital which is seen to weaken the positive effect of dialogic loop on public engagement with HWS through GSM and mitigate the negative effect of media richness.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acase studies 3acitizen participation 3aenvironmental management 3aChina 0aPublic engagement 0aHousehold waste separation 0aGovernment social media 0aSocial media capital 0aDialogic communication 0aEmotional valence1 aChen, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8123-077X1 aMa, Wenjie1 aEvans, Richard1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6367-05600 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 320 p.115825-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1158253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245012300176300001400299520147400313592002801787650002301815650001201838650001001850650001501860650001501875650001901890650002601909650001201935650001301947650001401960650001301974650001001987650001501997650002102012650001402033650001202047700002102059700002102080773008302101856008802184852000902272655001202281IND60561090420221121164301.0170606e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056109042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2013.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtwood, Alyssa R.10aCharacterization of unusual sterols and long chain diols, triols, keto-ols and n-alkenols in El Junco Lake, GalÃ¡pagos  ap. 80-89.  aA variety of lipid biomarkers were identified in sediments from El Junco Lake, GalÃ¡pagos and their sources investigated for potential use in paleoclimate applications. A series of unusual sterols was also found, including 4Î±-methylgorgostanol, reported in only four species of dinoflagellates to date. We also tentatively assigned 22,23-methylene-4Î±-methyl-24-ethylcholest-5-en-3Î²-ol, the mass spectrum of which matched a sterol found in resting cysts of the dinoflagellate Peridinium umbonatum. In addition, we identified the novel sterol 4Î±,22,23,24-tetramethyl-5Î±-cholest-22E-en-3Î²-ol. Based on the unique sterol distribution, we hypothesize that a dinoflagellate from the genus Peridinium was the primary source of dinosterol and the novel sterols throughout the sediment record. The source specificity and abundance throughout the 3.7m of recovered sediment make dinosterol an excellent target for hydrogen isotope analysis for use as a paleohydrological proxy in future studies. The abundant C30 and C32 1,Ï20-diols and keto-ols, C29 9,10-diol and C29 1,Ï9,Ï10-triol likely derive from the ferns Azolla microphylla and Cyathea weatherbyana, while sources of the C30 1,Ï16-diol and keto-ol, C32 1,Ï18-diol and keto-ol, and the C30âC32n-alken-1-ols are likely limited to aquatic microalgae. Due to their source specificity, these diol, triol, keto-ol, and n-alkenol biomarkers present further tools for studying past environmental and climatic change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzolla microphylla 3aCyathea 3aJunco 3aPeridinium 3abiomarkers 3aclimate change 3aferns and fern allies 3aglycols 3ahydrogen 3ahydrology 3aisotopes 3alakes 3amicroalgae 3apaleoclimatology 3asediments 3asterols1 aVolkman, John K.1 aSachs, Julian P.0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2014 Jan., v. 66 p.80-89dElsevier Ltdx0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2013.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009200159300001600251520172100267592002801988650001702016650001802033650002802051650002602079650001402105650001702119650001902136650001802155650001702173650001102190650003602201650000802237650001502245650000902260650002402269650002402293650002702317650002402344650002002368650001302388650004002401650002602441700001602467700002102483700002002504700001702524700002002541773012102561856007402682852000902756655001202765IND60662127120221118060034.0190904e20130528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066212712DNAL7 a10.1039/c3fo60037h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Ching-Shu10aPotent anti-cancer effects of citrus peel flavonoids in human prostate xenograft tumors  ap. 944-949.  aProstate cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. Fruit and vegetable consumption is a novel, non-toxic therapeutic approach that can be used to prevent and treat prostate cancer. Citrus peels and their extracts have been reported to have potent pharmacological activities and health benefits due to the abundance of flavonoids in citrus fruits, particularly in the peels. Our previous studies demonstrated that oral administration of Gold Lotion (GL), an extract of multiple varieties of citrus peels containing abundant flavonoids, including a large percentage of polymethoxyflavones (PMFs), effectively suppressed azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colonic tumorigenesis. However, the efficacy of GL against prostate cancer has not yet been investigated. Here, we explored the anti-tumor effects of GL using a human prostate tumor xenograft mouse model. Our data demonstrated that treatment with GL by both intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection and oral administration dramatically reduced both the weights (57%â100% inhibition) and volumes (78%â94% inhibition) of the tumors without any observed toxicity. These inhibitory effects were accompanied by mechanistic down-regulation of the protein levels of inflammatory enzymes (inducible nitric oxide synthase, iNOS and cyclooxygenase-2, COX-2), metastasis (matrix metallopeptidase-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9), angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF), and proliferative molecules, as well as by the induction of apoptosis in prostate tumors. Our findings suggest that GL is an effective anti-cancer agent that may potentially serve as a novel therapeutic option for prostate cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3aazoxymethane 3acarcinogenesis 3acitrus fruits 3acitrus peels 3afruits 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3amen 3ametastasis 3amice 3aoral administration 3apolymethoxyflavones 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aprotein content 3atoxicity 3avascular endothelial growth factors 3avegetable consumption1 aLi, Shiming1 aMiyauchi, Yutaka1 aSuzawa, Michiko1 aHo, Chi-Tang1 aPan, Min-Hsiung0 tFood & function.g2013 May 28, v. 4, no. 6 p.944-949dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3fo60037h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245017200170300001600342520126200358592002801620650001501648650002201663650001701685650001801702700001501720700002001735700001801755700001601773700001701789773011701806856008601923990002302009852000902032655001202041IND60093738620221120233429.0141103e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009373862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemolab.2012.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Jin-Fang10aAdvanced chemometric algorithm coupled to subspace projection technique between original and pseudo samples: A snapshot of chemical rank estimation for high-order data  ap. 211-218.  aA new method, âadvanced chemometric algorithm coupled to subspace projection technique between original and pseudo samples (ACA-SPOPS)â, is proposed for the first time for chemical rank estimation of three-way data arrays. In ACA-SPOPS, self-weighted alternating trilinear decomposition (SWATLD) algorithm is used to create pseudo samples to produce a pseudo array. Singular value decomposition (SVD) is then performed on the unfolded matrices of both pseudo array and original array. The chemical rank can be accordingly determined via the subspace projection technique. The performance of ACA-SPOPS has been demonstrated by both simulated and experimental data arrays. By comparing with four other widely used methods, namely core consistency diagnostic (CORCONDIA) test, ADD-ONE-UP truncating and fitting (ADD-ONE-UP), two-mode subspace comparison (TMSC) and subspace projection of pseudo high-way data array (SPPH), the results showed that this new method possessed better analytical performance than many other ones, in terms of noise, collinearity, concentration and computation speed. Moreover, the ACA-SPOPS method may be further applied for processing higher-order data arrays by accordingly extending the SWATLD algorithm to higher dimensions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achemical analysis 3achemometrics 3adata analysis1 aZhang, Yun1 aYi, Zhong-Sheng1 aZou, Hong-Yan1 aFu, Hai-Yan1 aWu, Hai-Long0 tChemometrics and intelligent laboratory systems.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 118 p.211-218dElsevier B.V.x0169-74397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2012.06.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245013300168300001600301520221300317592002802530650001102558650000902569650001902578650001302597650001102610650000902621650000902630650001702639650001802656650001302674651001602687700001302703700001702716700001402733700001602747700001902763700001802782773008502800856008802885852000902973655001202982IND60561090520221121215716.0170606e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056109052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2013.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSykes, R.10aMarine influence helps preserve the oil potential of coaly source rocks: Eocene Mangahewa Formation, Taranaki Basin, New Zealand  ap. 140-163.  aMany CretaceousâCenozoic coaly source rocks in Australasian and southeast Asian basins were deposited in coastal plain environments, yet the effect of early diagenetic marine influence on their oil potential is not well understood. An integrated organic geochemical and petrographic study of humic coals from the Eocene Mangahewa Formation (Taranaki Basin, New Zealand) was undertaken with coals predominantly from raised mire petrofacies, with subordinate proportions from planar mires. The total S content of 0.63â4.4% (dry, ash-free) indicated very slight to strong degrees of marine influence. Other than minor addition of inferred mangrove derived suberinite and associated liptodetrinite, the degree of marine influence had no obvious effect on maceral or plant tissue abundance. However, hydrogen index (HI) values were up to ca. 150% (109mgHC/gTOC) higher, and total (C6+) oil potential up to ca. 140% (43mg/gTOC) higher among the more strongly marine influenced coals. Correlation of organic S with solvent extract parameters pristane/phytane, C27âC29 diasteranes/steranes, C29 steranes/hopanes, C35/(C35+C34) homohopanes and oleanane index suggested that inundation of brackish water into the early diagenetic peat forming environment enhanced the bio-resistance of higher plant and other lipids through sulfurization, thereby helping to preserve more of the inherent H content and total oil potential of the original peat biomass. Conversely, marine influence had only a minor effect on the capacity of Mangahewa coals to generate paraffinic oil. Total (n-C6+) and non-volatile (n-C15+) paraffinic oil potentials were instead controlled primarily by the abundance of leaf derived cutinite and associated liptodetrinite. This, in turn, was dependent on the type of peat mire facies, with planar mire facies having better potential for preservation of leaf litter than raised mire facies because of their generally higher groundwater level. Marine influence is nonetheless beneficial for paraffinic oil charge from coaly source rock sequences in that the associated higher HIs enhance the efficiency and quantum of paraffinic oil expulsion through increased saturation of the coal pore system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acoal 3acoastal plains 3ahydrogen 3aleaves 3aoils 3apeat 3aplant litter 3aplant tissues 3asolvents 3aNew Zealand1 aVolk, H.1 aGeorge, S.C.1 aAhmed, M.1 aHiggs, K.E.1 aJohansen, P.E.1 aSnowdon, L.R.0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2014 Jan., v. 66 p.140-163dElsevier Ltdx0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2013.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001400169245012800183300001600311500001500327520083100342592002801173650001601201650001201217650001301229650001001242650002301252650002101275650001901296650001801315650001401333650002601347650001301373650000901386650002701395650002401422650000901446650006401455650002401519650003601543650002301579650002801602650002001630650006901650650006801719650002901787653001301816653001101829653001401840653001301854653003901867653001701906653002401923700001901947700001901966700001501985773010702000856008702107852000902194655001202203IND4465677320221119035628.0190402e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446567732DNAL7 a230174152pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.07.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatif, S.10aAmino acid composition, antinutrients and allergens in the peanut protein fraction obtained by an aqueous enzymatic process  ap. 213-217.  a2019-12-06  aEnzyme-assisted aqueous extraction (EAE) of peanut kernel was used to extract oil and protein.

In this work, we explored the chlorination kinetics of three structurally related alkenes (Î±-ionone, Î²-ionone, and dehydro-Î²-ionone), a class of compounds whose reactivities with Clâ and ClâO have not been previously investigated. Second-order rate constants for Clâ, ClâO, and HOCl were computed from experimental rate constants obtained at various pH values, [Clâ], and [FAC]. Our results show that while HOCl is the predominant chlorinating agent for the most reactive alkene, Clâ and ClâO can dominate the chlorination kinetics of the less reactive alkenes at high [Clâ] and high [FAC], respectively. The tradeoff between overall reactivity with FAC and selectivity for Clâ and ClâO previously observed for aromatic compounds also applies to the alkenes examined. In laboratory experiments in which high [FAC] may be used, omission of ClâO in data modeling could yield second-order rate constants of dubious validity. In chlorinating real waters with elevated [Clâ], formation of Clâ may enhance the formation kinetics of chlorinated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) and exacerbate the burden of DBP control for water utilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3achlorination 3achlorine 3adisinfection 3aenvironmental science 3apH1 aReber, Keith P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0407-92811 aRoberts, A.

Three of the seven alleles identified in this study have not previously been described. Two new DtxR types were identified, one of which has an unusual polypeptide length. All the new DtxR types were found in toxigenic isolates, suggesting that they effectively regulate the expression of diphtheria toxin. Furthermore, one of the new DtxR identified was also found in a nonâtoxigenic isolate, making it a potential source of toxigenic isolates after lysogenic conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium diphtheriae 3aalleles 3aetiological agents 3amutation 3apatients 3apolypeptides1 aDamian, Maria1 aBadell, Edgar1 aDragomirescu, Cristiana Cerasella1 aGuiso, Nicole0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2014 Oct., v. 54, no. 10 p.1136-1139dWiley-VCHx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2013006863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245019000157300001800347520146500365592002801830650001701858650002501875650002401900650002701924650001801951650001701969650001601986650002002002650001102022650001502033650001302048650000902061650001302070650001202083650002202095650001602117650001702133650001702150650002302167650001202190650002302202650002202225650001002247650001002257650001202267650002402279650001902303650000902322650001102331650001702342650002102359650000902380650001502389700001902404700001502423700001902438700001702457700002002474700001602494700002002510700001702530773012402547856007402671852000902745655001202754IND60662127320221118055853.0190904e20130724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066212732DNAL7 a10.1039/c3fo60039d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aG.

These important health issues lead researchers to investigate new approaches to prevent and treat obesity and insulin resistance. Good candidates are the phytochemical compounds that have been extensively studied in the field. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test whether sulforaphane (SFN, 1 mg kgâ»Â¹, 4 months treatment), a potent inducer of antioxidant enzymes present in cruciferous vegetables, had some beneficial effects on obesity and insulin resistance induced by a highly palatable (HP) diet in male Wistar rats. Glucose tolerance, serum and hepatic lipid levels, lipid profile, ALT, AST, urea and creatinine, GLUT1 and GLUT3 levels in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus were analyzed. Glucose tolerance was lower in the HP diet groups, especially in the HP group treated with SFN. Except for the liver triacylglycerols, no differences were found in serum lipids, hepatic and kidney markers of the HP diet groups. Although expression of GLUT1 was similar between groups for all three brain structures analyzed, expression of GLUT3 in the cortex and hypothalamus had a tendency to decrease in the HP diet group treated with SFN. In conclusion, SFN at the specific dose was able to accentuate glucose intolerance and may affect GLUT3 expression in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassicaceae 3aalanine transaminase 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood glucose 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3acerebral cortex 3acortex 3acreatinine 3adiabetes 3adiet 3aetiology 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ahippocampus 3ahypertension 3ahypothalamus 3ainsulin resistance 3akidneys 3alaboratory animals 3alipid composition 3aliver 3amales 3aobesity 3aoral administration 3aphytochemicals 3arats 3astroke 3asulforaphane 3atriacylglycerols 3aurea 3avegetables1 aRiboldi, B.

The aim of this work was to study the in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of phenolic compounds isolated from the flowers of Nymphaea mexicana Zucc. Seven phenolic compounds including vanillic acid (1), 4-methoxy-3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2), (2R,3R)-3,7-dihydroxyflavanone (3), naringenin (4), kaempferol 3-O-(3-O-acetyl-Î±-l-rhamnopyranoside) (5), kaempferol 3-O-(2-O-acetyl-Î±-l-rhamnopyranoside) (6), and quercetin 3-(3â²â²-acetylrhamnoside) (7) were isolated from the flowers of Nymphaea mexicana Zucc. These results revealed that compound 4 has the most prominent inhibitory effect on the LPS-stimulated nitric oxide (NO), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) production in RAW 264.7 macrophages. In addition, compound 4 also inhibited LPS-mediated induction of protein expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and phospho-ERK in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Thus, compound 4 from the flowers of Nymphaea mexicana Zucc. may provide a potential therapeutic approach for inflammation-associated disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNymphaea 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3achemokine CCL2 3aflowers 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3akaempferol 3amacrophages 3anaringenin 3anitric oxide 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aquercetin 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avanillic acid 3awater lilies1 aFang, Song-Chwan1 aYen, Gow-Chin0 tFood & function.g2013 July 24, v. 4, no. 8 p.1216-1222dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3fo60041f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04097naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100001700175245006800192300001400260520236500274592002802639650000802667650002202675650001302697650001502710650000802725650002902733650001202762650001102774650003602785650000902821650001902830650003402849650001302883650001402896650001302910650000902923650001502932650001102947650001502958650001302973650001502986650001203001650001303013650001303026650001203039650002603051700002203077700001703099700001903116773014903135856006803284856009903352990002303451852000903474655001203483IND60643361920221121225928.0190510e20120420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064336192DNAL7 a10.3791/39232doi7 aPMC48463322pmcid7 a225469562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Pei Yun10aAgarose gel electrophoresis for the separation of dna fragments  ap. e3923.  aAgarose gel electrophoresis is the most effective way of separating DNA fragments of varying sizes ranging from 100 bp to 25 kb1. Agarose is isolated from the seaweed genera Gelidium and Gracilaria, and consists of repeated agarobiose (L- and D-galactose) subunits2. During gelation, agarose polymers associate non-covalently and form a network of bundles whose pore sizes determine a gel's molecular sieving properties. The use of agarose gel electrophoresis revolutionized the separation of DNA. Prior to the adoption of agarose gels, DNA was primarily separated using sucrose density gradient centrifugation, which only provided an approximation of size. To separate DNA using agarose gel electrophoresis, the DNA is loaded into pre-cast wells in the gel and a current applied. The phosphate backbone of the DNA (and RNA) molecule is negatively charged, therefore when placed in an electric field, DNA fragments will migrate to the positively charged anode. Because DNA has a uniform mass/charge ratio, DNA molecules are separated by size within an agarose gel in a pattern such that the distance traveled is inversely proportional to the log of its molecular weight3. The leading model for DNA movement through an agarose gel is "biased reptation", whereby the leading edge moves forward and pulls the rest of the molecule along4. The rate of migration of a DNA molecule through a gel is determined by the following: 1) size of DNA molecule; 2) agarose concentration; 3) DNA conformation5; 4) voltage applied, 5) presence of ethidium bromide, 6) type of agarose and 7) electrophoresis buffer. After separation, the DNA molecules can be visualized under uv light after staining with an appropriate dye. By following this protocol, students should be able to: 1. Understand the mechanism by which DNA fragments are separated within a gel matrix 2. Understand how conformation of the DNA molecule will determine its mobility through a gel matrix 3. Identify an agarose solution of appropriate concentration for their needs 4. Prepare an agarose gel for electrophoresis of DNA samples 5. Set up the gel electrophoresis apparatus and power supply 6. Select an appropriate voltage for the separation of DNA fragments 7. Understand the mechanism by which ethidium bromide allows for the visualization of DNA bands 8.

Two trials were conducted to evaluate the effect of MCOA on growth performance of pigs in comparison with benzoic acid (BA) and ZnO (ZnO). Each used 240 pigs in a randomised complete block design with six treatments in eight replicate pens. Trial 1 tested a blend of C6:0, C8:0, C10:0 and C12:0 for 56 d post-weaning. Treatments were (1) control basal diet (BD), (2) BD+ZnO (3) BD+ZnO+BA, (4) BD+MCOA (5) BD+MCOA+ZnO, (6) BD+MCOA+BA. Pigs receiving MCOA+BA showed higher average daily liveweight gain in the grower period (849 g/d) than pigs receiving the control diet (773 g/d) or the ZnO treatment (779 g/d; P=0.040), grew 7% more efficiently (P=0.008) and were 3.02 kg heavier at 56 d than control pigs. Trial 2 tested the MCOA blend at two inclusion levels in comparison with C6:0/C12:0 (50/50) and C6:0/C12 monolaurin (C12M; 50/50), for 28 d post-weaning. Treatments were (1) control basal diet, (2) BD+ZnO (3) BD+1,500 mg/kg MCOA (4) BD+750 mg/kg MCOA (5) BD+ C6/C12 (total 3,000 mg/kg), (6) BD + C6/C12M (total 3,000 mg/kg). Pigs receiving 750 mg/kg MCOA grew more slowly than those receiving C6/C12M or ZnO (P<0.05) to d 21. Pigs fed ZnO were 1.61 kg heavier than these pigs (P<0.05), while those fed C6/C12M were 1.29 kg heavier (P<0.05) at d 21. During 0-14 d pigs fed ZnO showed the best feed conversion ratio (FCR), but at 15-28 d the improvement was no longer seen. Both the C6/C12 and the C6/C12M treatments appeared to improve FCR during this second phase (P<0.01). The results suggested that supplementation with a combination of MCOA and BA may be a promising strategy to improve growth performance while replacing ZnO and reducing antibiotic dependence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial properties 3abenzoic acid 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3agrowth performance 3aliveweight gain 3amonolaurin 3azinc oxide 0aantimicrobial resistance 0aantibiotic reduction strategy0 tJournal of applied animal nutrition.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 10, no. 1 p.31-38dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:2269x2049-257X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/JAAN2021.00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003000142245014000172300001800312520159800330592002801928650001401956650002101970650000901991650001602000700002202016773013102038856007802169852000902247655001202256IND60565363720221118231251.0170323e20170308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056536372DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b110542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Passos Gomes, Gabriel10aDrawing Catalytic Power from Charge Separation: Stereoelectronic and Zwitterionic Assistance in the Au(I)-Catalyzed Bergman Cyclization  ap. 3406-3416.  aThe synergy between bond formation and bond breaking that is typical for pericyclic reactions is lost in their mechanistic cousins, cycloaromatization reactions. In these reactions, exemplified by the Bergman cyclization (BC), two bonds are sacrificed to form a single bond, and the reaction progress is interrupted at the stage of a cyclic diradical intermediate. The catalytic power of Au(I) in BC stems from a combination of two sources: stereoelectronic assistance of CâC bond formation (i.e., âLUMO umpolungâ) and crossover from a diradical to a zwitterionic mechanism that takes advantage of the catalystâs dual ability to stabilize both negative and positive charges. Not only does the synergy between the bond-forming and charge-delocalizing interactions lead to a dramatic (>hundred-billion-fold) acceleration, but the evolution of the two effects results in continuous reinforcement of the substrate/catalyst interaction along the cyclization path. This cooperativity converts the BC into the first example of an aborted [3,3] sigmatropic shift where the pericyclic âtransition stateâ becomes the most stable species on the reaction hypersurface. Aborting the pericyclic path facilitates trapping of cyclic intermediate by a variety of further reactions and provides a foundation for the discovery of new modes of reactivity of polyunsaturated substrates. The application of distortion/interaction analysis allows us to quantify the increased affinity of Au-catalysts to the Bergman cyclization transition state as one of the key components of the large catalytic effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3agold 3azwitterions1 aAlabugin, Igor V.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Mar. 08, v. 139, no. 9 p.3406-3416dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b110543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012300169300001200292520130300304592002801607650002201635650002801657650001001685650002001695650001001715650001101725650002501736650001401761650001401775650003001789650004501819650002301864650002301887650002501910650001801935653002201953653002801975653002602003653002202029653001502051700001802066700001902084700001902103700001902122700001902141773010602160856008502266852000902351655001202360IND60602304320221118220632.0180711e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060230432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2015.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jin-Lei10aRhoptry protein 47 gene sequence: A potential novel genetic marker for population genetic studies of Toxoplasma gondii  ap. 1-4.  aToxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite, is able to infect many animal species and humans, and can cause toxoplasmosis of the host. In this study, we examined sequence variation in rhoptry protein 47 (ROP47) gene among T.âgondii isolates originating from different hosts and geographical regions. The entire genome region of the ROP47 gene was amplified and sequenced, and phylogenetic relationship was reconstructed using maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbor-joining (NJ), based on the ROP47 gene sequences. The results of sequence alignments showed that all ROP47 gene sequences were 396âbp in length. There were 19 variable nucleotide positions in the coding region, resulted in 16 amino acid substitutions (12.21%) among all examined T.âgondii strains and the existence of polymorphic restriction sites for endonucleases SacI and AflIII, allowing the differentiation of the three major clonal lineage types I, II and III by PCR-RFLP. Phylogenetic analysis of ROP47 gene sequences showed that three major clonal lineage types I, II and III were clustered differently, consistent with PCR-RFLP results. These results suggest that ROP47 gene sequence may represent a potential novel genetic marker for population genetic studies of T.âgondii isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aamino acid substitution 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahosts 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asequence alignment 3asequence diversity 3astatistical analysis 3atoxoplasmosis 0aToxoplasma gondii 0aRhoptry protein 47 gene 0aPhylogenetic analysis 0aGenetic diversity 0aGenotyping1 aLi, Ting-Ting1 aLi, Zhong-Yuan1 aHuang, Si-Yang1 aNing, Hong-Rui1 aZhu, Xing-Quan0 tExperimental parasitology.g2015 July, v. 154 p.1-4dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2015.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245010900207300001400316500001900330520177400349592002802123596009702151596010602248596005602354650001702410650001902427650002602446650001402472650001502486650002002501650002102521650001702542700002102559700002202580773010502602856008202707852000902789655001202798IND60682681020221116191506.0200130e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068268102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-019-00904-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelskaya, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3284-882910aCarabidae assemblages in pine forests with different recreation regimes within and outside a megalopolis  ap. 27-38.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe expansion of cities highlights the need for studies of the biodiversity on urban territories and factors affecting the structure and functioning of communities. In 2010â2011, we compared the abundance and diversity of carabid beetles in pine forests of natural origin within the Russian megalopolis Yekaterinburg and outside. To estimate the effects of recreation (R+: trampling, soil compaction, eutrophication) and other urbanization factors (U+: pollution, habitat fragmentation, adventive species), we selected 12 urban and non-urban forest sites with contrasting recreation regimes (Uâ+âR+, Uâ+âRâ, UâââR+, UâââRâ; three sites in each combination). We hypothesized that both urbanization and recreation decrease the abundance and diversity of carabids; the combination of two factors enhances negative effects. The total activity density of carabids and the abundances of all ecological groups increased in urban forests compared to non-urban ones. In urban forests, the Simpson dominance decreased, while Shannon diversity, total species richness, and mean number of species per site increased. The most abundant species in all forests were Pterostichus oblongopunctatus, P. mannerheimii, and P. magus, while Carabus nemoralis was abundant in urban forests only. Proportion (by the number of individuals) of forest species was lower and that of generalists and large-sized species higher in urban forests. High recreation load resulted in lower total abundance and diversity of ground beetles. Negative effect of recreation load on carabids leveled positive effect of urbanization: both abundance and diversity of ground beetles were lower at urban sites with intense recreational use compared to forest sites closed for townspeople.  aPublisher supplied data  a01201356805cInstitute of Plant and Animal Ecology, Ural Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences  aState Contract no. 0400-2018-0012cMinistry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation  a18-4-4-24cUral Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences 3aPterostichus 3aeutrophication 3ahabitat fragmentation 3apollution 3arecreation 3asoil compaction 3aspecies richness 3aurbanization1 aZolotarev, Maxim1 aZinovyev, Evgeniy0 tUrban ecosystems.g2020 Feb., v. 23, no. 1 p.27-38dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870259x1083-81557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-019-00904-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01628naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010200171300001600273500001900289520063400308592002800942596002800970650001100998650002201009650002401031650001801055700001501073700002801088773010701116856008201223852000901305655001201314IND60682681120221116191553.0200130e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068268112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-019-00905-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaur, Joshua W.

For this, a Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis stand, at the 79 months age, was evaluated. Sixty trees were selected to be scaled, and samples of leaves and branches collected; of these 60 trees, 15 were selected for wood and bark basic density determination. To determine the bark loss 100 logs of 3Â m long were selected at 3 different logs movement stages: the field edge, the courtyard of CPU and the oven. The biomass stock of the Eucalyptus forest was 145.99Â tÂ haâ»Â¹, and 11.67% was in the form of harvest waste, and presents potential for use mainly for heat and electricity generation. The total bark loss was 25.7%, and the first step that generated the greatest loss of bark, when the wood is still on the edge of the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aEucalyptus urophylla 3abark 3abiomass 3abranches 3acarbonization 3acharcoal 3adrying 3aelectricity 3aforestry 3aforests 3aheat 3aleaves 3alogging 3arenewable energy sources 3atrees 3awastes 3awood 0aPotential energy 0aPower generation 0aWaste inventory1 aCastro, Renato VinÃ­cius Oliveira1 aCarneiro, AngÃ©lica de CÃ¡ssia Oliveira1 aCarvalho, Ana MÃ¡rcia Macedo Ladeira1 ada Silva, ClÃ¡udio Homero Ferreira1 aCÃ¢ndido, Welliton Lelis1 ados Santos, Rosimeire Cavalcante0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Apr., v. 103 p.432-438dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.11.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001700172245018100189300001600370520137400386592002801760650002801788650001101816650001701827650001801844650001001862650002601872650001101898650001401909650000901923650001301932650002101945650003701966650002302003650001102026650005102037650001302088650002302101650003602124650004602160650001402206650002002220651001002240651001002250653001802260653002002278653001302298653002702311653001902338700002502357700002202382700002202404700002602426773010602452856008702558852000902645655001202654IND50060591720221116155104.0160902e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006059172DNAL7 a233543732pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.12.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, De-Gao10aHuman health risk assessment of occupational and residential exposures to dechlorane plus in the manufacturing facility area in China and comparison with e-waste recycling site  ap. 329-336.  aA screening level human health risk assessment based on the worst-case scenario was conducted on the occupational and residential exposures to dechlorane plus (DP) in the manufacturing facility region and an electronic-waste (e-waste) recycling site in China, which are two of the most polluted areas of DP in the world. Total estimated exposure doses (EEDs) via dietary intake, dermal contact, and inhalation was approximately 0.01mgkgâ1dâ1 for people living in the manufacturing facility region. In comparison, total EEDs (approximate 0.03Î¼gkgâ1, dâ1) were 300-fold lower in people living near an e-waste recycling site in China. Chronic oral, dermal, and inhalation reference doses (RfDs) were estimated to be 5.0, 2.0, and 0.01mgkgâ1dâ1, respectively. The oral RfD was markedly greater than Mirex (2Ã10â4mgkgâ1dâ1) and decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209; 7Ã10â3mgkgâ1dâ1), which have been or might be replaced by DP as a flame retardant with less toxicity. Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate the probability densities and functions for the hazard index which was calculated from the EEDs and RfDs to assess the human health risk. The hazard index was three orders of magnitude lower than 1, suggesting that occupational and residential exposures were relatively safe in the manufacturing facility region and e-waste recycling site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestimated exposure dose 3aethers 3ahuman health 3amanufacturing 3amirex 3aoccupational exposure 3apeople 3arecycling 3arisk 3atoxicity 2aElectronic Waste 2aEnvironmental Exposurexanalysis 2aFood Contamination 2aHumans 2aHydrocarbons, Chlorinatedxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aIndustry 2aMonte Carlo Method 2aOccupational Exposurexanalysis 2aPolycyclic Compoundsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aRecycling 2aRisk Assessment 3aChina 0aChina 0aRisk analysis 0aDechlorane plus 0aFacility 0aE-waste recycling site 0aReference dose1 aAlaee, M.q(Mehran),1 aByer, Jonathan D.1 aBrimble, Samantha1 aPacepavicius, Grazina0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 445-446 p.329-336dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.12.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245008700164300001300251520129100264592002801555650001601583650002101599650000901620650002101629650001801650650001101668650001301679650001501692650001201707650002301719651001201742653001501754653002501769653001401794653001101808700001901819700002101838700002601859773011101885856007801996852000902074655001202083IND60768678220221119105123.0220410e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076867822DNAL7 a10.2478/cjf-2022-00022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerfolja, Marina10aConsumer Knowledge and Perception about Fresh Fish from Organic Farming in Croatia  ap. 7-16.  aAlong with growing consumer awareness about the impact of food on health, there is a trend towards increasing fresh fish consumption. At the same time, the demand for organic food is increasing in the modern market. Although fruits, vegetables and nuts have the biggest share in the organic food market in Europe, the aquaculture production of organic fish is also growing. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to explore the knowledge and perception of Croatian consumers about fresh fish from organic farming. An online and face-to-face survey was conducted on a sample of 303 respondents. Data analysis (univariate and bivariate) was performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows. Most consumers have medium and low subjective knowledge about fresh fish from organic farming, and objective knowledge about fresh fish from organic farming is low. Only half of the consumers are aware that they can buy fresh fish from organic farming in the domestic market. Half of the consumers have already consumed fresh organic fish, and half are willing to pay a higher price for fresh fish from organic farming. Compared to fresh fish from conventional farming, respondents consider fresh organic fish to be healthier, tastier and to have less fat, but also more expensive and less available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3adomestic markets 3afish 3afish consumption 3aorganic foods 3aprices 3araw fish 3astatistics 3asurveys 3awillingness to pay 3aCroatia 0afresh fish 0aorganic fish farming 0aconsumers 0asurvey1 aCerjak, Marija1 aMatuliÄ, Daniel1 aMaksan, Marina TomiÄ0 tCroatian journal of fisheries.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 80, no. 1 p.7-16dSciendowJournal:21436x1848-05867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/cjf-2022-00023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010500164300001600269520150900285592002801794650002901822650001701851650001301868650002501881650001901906650002101925650002201946650001801968650002101986650002002007650001002027650002402037650004302061650005202104650002202156650002002178653002202198653002902220653001902249653001202268653001202280700001802292700001702310700001502327700001602342773012202358856008402480852000902564655001202573IND60593023920221119123455.0180414e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059302392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.03.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yi10aGlobal transcriptomic analysis of Rhodococcus erythropolis D310-1 in responding to chlorimuron-ethyl  ap. 111-120.  aChlorimuron-ethyl is a typical long-term residual sulfonylurea herbicide whose long period of residence poses a serious hazard to rotational crops. Microbial degradation is considered to be the most acceptable method for its removal, but the degradation mechanism is not clear. In this work, we investigated gene expression changes during the degradation of chlorimuron-ethyl by an effective chlorimuron-ethyl-degrading bacterium, Rhodococcus erythropolis D310-1. The genes that correspond to this degradation and their mode of action were identified using RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR. The RNA-Seq results revealed that 500 genes were up-regulated during chlorimuron-ethyl degradation by strain D310-1. KEGG annotation showed that the dominant metabolic pathways were âToluene degradationâ and âAminobenzoate degradationâ. Combining GO and KEGG classification with the relevant literature, we predicted that cytochrome P-450, carboxylesterase, and monooxygenase were involved in metabolic chlorimuron-ethyl biodegradation and that the enzyme active site and mode of action coincided with the degradation pathway proposed in our previous study. qRT-PCR experiments suggested that the R. erythropolis D310-1 carboxylesterase, cytochrome P-450 and glycosyltransferase genes were the key genes expressed during chlorimuron-ethyl biodegradation. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to describe the transcriptome analysis of a Rhodococcus species during the degradation of chlorimuron-ethyl.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodococcus erythropolis 3aactive sites 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3abiodegradation 3acarboxylesterase 3achlorimuron ethyl 3acrop rotation 3acytochrome P-450 3agene expression 3agenes 3amechanism of action 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptomics 0aChlorimuron-ethyl 0aRhodococcus erythropolis 0aBiodegradation 0aRNA-Seq 0aQRT-PCR1 aZang, Hailian1 aWang, Hailan1 aLi, Dapeng1 aLi, Chunyan0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 157 p.111-120dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.03.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009600156300001800252520212200270592002802392650001602420650002102436650001502457650001902472650001502491650001102506650002002517650001002537700001802547700001802565773017002583856007402753852000902827655001202836IND60765729020221118163756.0220409s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076572902DNAL7 a10.13031/aea.147562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Xiulan10aKinematics Analysis and Trajectory Planning of Segmentation Robot for Chilled Sheep Carcass  ap. 1147-1154.  aHighlights An automatic sheep segmentation robot system was developed to realize the automatic segmentation of chilled sheep carcass and improve the segmentation efficiency. The mechanical properties of mutton and lamb ribs were analyzed.The motion model of robot was established and the cutting path of sheep carcass was designed.Accurate segmentation of sheep carcass was realized. With the quick development of animal husbandry, it is imperative to switch from extensive management to intensive operation. To improve the automation and quality of mutton segmentation, an automatic sheep segmentation robot system was developed in this article, which realizes the automatic segmentation of chilled sheep carcass and improves the segmentation efficiency of chilled sheep carcass. According to the technological requirements of sheep carcass segmentation, the cutting procedure of slaughtering chilled fresh sheep carcass was designed and the three-dimensional model of chilled fresh sheep carcass was established in reverse. A chilled fresh sheep carcass clamp was designed based on the characteristics of the profiling structure. Then the mechanical characteristics of chilled fresh mutton and sheep ribs were analyzed. Specifically, considering that the carcass of chilled fresh sheep is a viscous body, the shear test of chilled fresh mutton tissue was carried out. Thus, the kinematics model of segmentation robot was established. The workspace of the slaughtering robot was analyzed. Furthermore, the dynamic model of a slaughtering robot was established. The cutting track of the segmentation robot was designed and the sheep carcass cutting experiment was completed on the segmentation robot system. The mass of sheep carcass before and after cutting were 15.3 and 14.9 kg, respectively. The loss rate during cutting was 2.61%, which indicates the incision was smooth and the sheep carcass segmentation was accurate. The effectiveness of the sheep carcass segmentation robot was proved by experimental results.

OHC concentrations measured in subcutaneous adipose tissue were between 3556 and 28,670ângâgâ»Â¹âlw for polychlorinated biphenyls (Î£PCBââ), 9 and 3403ângâgâ»Â¹âlw for the sum of organochlorine pesticides (hexachlorocyclohexanes, hexachlorobenzene, chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes, and dieldrin), and from 21 to 130ângâgâ»Â¹âlw for polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Histological examinations revealed that 12 of the bears (10 males aged 3â19 years and two females aged 4â7 years) had normal thyroid tissue while eight bears (40%) of varying ages and genders (three males aged 3â9 years and five females aged 4â25 years) showed clear histological lesions including parafollicular C-cell proliferation, nodular hyperplasia, and interstitial fibrosis. No significant differences were found in prevalence of thyroid gland lesions between males and females. Similarly, no marked difference was found in mean age between individuals with and without lesions. There was no significant difference in OHC mean concentrations between males and females or between individuals with and without lesions. Despite no documented relationship to OHC concentrations in adipose tissue, it is worth noting that the lesions were similar to that of OHC exposed lab and wildlife contaminated mammals. Since the lesions were not associated with age or gender, other environmental factors such as energetic stress and autoimmunity/genetic predisposition also need to be considered. It is therefore possible that OHCs, in combination with other environmental and intrinsic factors described in the literature, may interfere with the hypothalamicâpituitaryâthyroid axis (HPT axis) resulting in endocrine perturbations in East Greenland polar bears.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrsus maritimus 3aadipose tissue 3aautoimmunity 3adieldrin 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3afibrosis 3ahexachlorobenzene 3ahistology 3ahyperplasia 3amales 3amammals 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3athyroid gland 3awildlife 3aGreenland 0aEast Greenland 0aorganohalogen contaminants 0aPCBs 0apolar bear, thyroid gland lesions 0aUrsus maritimus1 aIburg, Tine1 aLeifsson, PÃ¡ll S.,1 aBorn, Erik W.1 aLetcher, Robert J.1 aDietz, Rune0 tToxicological and environmental chemistry.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 93, no. 4 p.789-805dTaylor & Francis Groupx1029-04867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02772248.2011.558669  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011500165300001600280520130300296592002801599650002101627650002101648650001501669650001701684650001401701650001301715650002401728653001901752653000901771653003201780653002201812653002001834700001401854700001301868700001401881773007101895856008401966852000902050655001202059IND60560224520221118001418.0170628e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056022452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2016.12.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJena, R.K.12aA novel high performance poly (2-methyl thioaniline) based composite electrode for supercapacitors application  ap. 175-187.  aOver the last decade there has been an increasing worldwide demand for electrochemically active materials for supercapacitor applications. In this study, a novel PANI derivative, poly (2-methyl thioaniline) coated MWCNT (PMTA@CNT) and its composite with graphene (PMTA@CNT/RGO) have been explored for supercapacitor application. Both the PMTA@CNT and PMTA@CNT/RGO electrodes showed much higher specific capacitances of about 522Â FÂ gâ1 and 616Â FÂ gâ1, respectively in 6Â M KOH electrolyte at a current density of 1Â AÂ gâ1. These results are about 36% and 28% higher compared to the PANI@CNT and PANI@CNT/RGO, respectively, which were prepared by same synthesis route as that of PMTA based electrode. The excellent electrochemical performance of the PMTA based composite electrode compared to PANI based composite electrode is due to the presence of very good electron donating group (SCH3) in PMTA that makes the PMTA molecule electronically rich through resonance effect which helps to facilitate the charge-transfer between the two components through the Ï electrons of the quinoid rings in PMTA and the benzenoid rings of carbon nanotubes or graphene. Therefore, PMTA composite electrode with good capacitive behaviour encourages its use to compete with PANI composite based electrode.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrons 3agraphene 3apotassium hydroxide 0aSupercapacitor 0aPANI 0aPoly (2-methyl thioaniline) 0aPANI coated MWCNT 0aCharge transfer1 aYue, C.Y.1 aSk, M.M.1 aGhosh, K.0 tCarbon.g2017 May, v. 115 p.175-187dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2016.12.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245012400204300001600328500001900344520130800363592002801671596006801699650002601767650002501793650002501818650001301843650001401856650001201870650001201882650002001894650001101914650002001925650002601945650001201971650002501983700001802008700002402026700002002050700002202070773010902092856008202201852000902283655001202292IND60714707220221119105840.0201024e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071470722DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-020-00466-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohal, Norah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5406-110310aPhysiological and Biochemical Responses of Chickpea Accessions at Reproductive Stage Under Receding Moisture Conditions  ap. 554-567.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study was conducted to assess the physiological and biochemical responses in the leaves of ten chickpea accessions trifurcated into moderately tolerant, intermittent and moderately sensitive on the basis of their yield losses via drought susceptibility index. Moderately sensitive accessions recorded higher decline in number of leaves and dehydrogenase activity and increased membrane permeability index (MPI) under receding moisture conditions. However, moderately tolerant genotypes, viz. GL 29078 and ICC 4958, maintained number of leaves and optimal dehydrogenase activity and lower MPI in leaves at reproductive stages by enhanced enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase that upregulated their antioxidative defense system at 75% moisture reduction levels. Furthermore, the tolerance capacity was maintained in moderately tolerant genotypes (IPCK-2009-165 and ICC 4958) due to increased proline level that acted as a positive loading variable component in principal component biplot analysis and lowered malondialdehyde content levels in leaves at receding moisture levels. Assessment of leaf tissue-specific response under lysimetric screening and its final correlation with yield adds to paramount importance and uniqueness to the current study.  aPublisher supplied data  aMANF-2015-17-PUN-53236cUNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION, NEW DELHI 3aagricultural research 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3achickpeas 3adecline 3adrought 3aenzyme activity 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3amembrane permeability 3aproline 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aKaur, Jagmeet1 aGrewal, Satvir Kaur1 aSingh, Sarvjeet1 aKushwah, Ashutosh0 tAgricultural research.g2020 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.554-567dSpringer IndiawJournal:21667x2249-720X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40003-020-00466-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245009200205300002000297506007600317520140000393592002801793506003701821650001701858650001801875650001101893650001101904650001101915650001501926653000801941653000901949653002401958653002801982653002402010700001902034700002302053700001902076700002602095773019402121856007902315852000902394655001202403IND60178752120221207143028.0150604e20141014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017875212DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14104311112doi7 aPMC42056652pmcid7 a252676522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazmier, Kelli10aConformational cycle and ion-coupling mechanism of the Naâº/hydantoin transporter Mhp1  ap. 14752-14757.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIon-dependent transporters of the LeuT-fold couple the uptake of physiologically essential molecules to transmembrane ion gradients. Defined by a conserved 5-helix inverted repeat that encodes common principles of ion and substrate binding, the LeuT-fold has been captured in outward-facing, occluded, and inward-facing conformations. However, fundamental questions relating to the structural basis of alternating access and coupling to ion gradients remain unanswered. Here, we used distance measurements between pairs of spin labels to define the conformational cycle of the Na âº-coupled hydantoin symporter Mhp1 from Microbacterium liquefaciens . Our results reveal that the inward-facing and outward-facing Mhp1 crystal structures represent sampled intermediate states in solution. Here, we provide a mechanistic context for these structures, mapping them into a model of transport based on ion- and substrate-dependent conformational equilibria. In contrast to the Na âº/leucine transporter LeuT, our results suggest that Na âº binding at the conserved second Na âº binding site does not change the energetics of the inward- and outward-facing conformations of Mhp1. Comparative analysis of ligand-dependent alternating access in LeuT and Mhp1 lead us to propose that different coupling schemes to ion gradients may define distinct conformational mechanisms within the LeuT-fold class.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adissociation 3aisomerization 3alipids 3amodels 3asodium 3asymporters 0aEPR 0aDEER 0aNa+-coupled symport 0aconformational dynamics 0atransport mechanism1 aSharma, Shruti1 aIslam, Shahidul M.1 aRoux, BenoÃ®t,1 aMchaourab, Hassane S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Oct. 14, v. 111, no. 41 p.14752-14757dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14104311113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245014700208300001600355500001900371520154900390592002801939650002401967650002601991650002702017650001802044650001602062650002402078650001802102650000902120650001902129650001902148700001802167700001902185700001302204700001502217700001402232700001302246700002102259773010902280856008202389852000902471655001202480IND60714707320221119105953.0201024e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071470732DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-020-00454-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChilagane, E.

Applying inorganic fertilizer at reduced amount (micro-dose) and in situ rainwater harvesting using infiltration pits (IP) or tied ridges (TR) are low-input strategies to cope with these constraints. This work investigates the effect of integrating fertilizer with in situ rainwater harvesting technologies on pearl millet growth, yield and household profitability among Tanzanian smallholder farming communities. Split plot field experiments were conducted from 2015 to 2017 cropping seasons. Flat cultivation (FC) with zero fertilizer application resulted in lowest grain yield ranging from 297 to 453Â kg/ha and in a negative net profit (NP). The highest yield of 2202Â kg/ha was obtained upon the use of recommended rate under IP, but it resulted in negative NP. Infiltration pits under 25% micro-dose resulted in relative higher grain yield (778â2202Â kg/ha) compared to TR (887â1915Â kg/ha) and FC (592â1144Â kg/ha); despite higher yield, it resulted in negative NP. Tied ridges and FC with micro-dose at 25% of recommended rate had a yield advantage ranging from 537 to 959Â kg/ha and 295 to 455Â kg/ha, respectively, compared to farmer practices, and both resulted in positive NP.

Scanning modeling required 80% of the rolling friction coefficient of spherical modeling to reflect actual motion.The relative error of scanning modeling (7.91%) was better than that of spherical modeling (30.84%). The discrete element method (DEM) is widely used to simulate the behavior of granular materials. The accurate establishment of the particle model has a great influence on the accuracy of the simulation. Most of the existing discrete element simulations of granular compound fertilizers use spherical modeling without considering the shape or particle size distribution. To compare the simulation accuracy of spherical modeling (spherical particles with equivalent diameters) and scanning modeling (a three-dimensional model of fertilizers was obtained by a scanner and then automatically filled by EDEM2020 software) on compound fertilizer discharge, three kinds of granular compound fertilizers (Changqingshu, Xinshidai, and Munvhong) were selected as the research objects. The characterization parameters of fertilizer shape and fluidity were measured. Principal component analysis and Pearson correlation analysis were used to analyze the influence of the compound fertilizer characterization parameters on the angle of repose. The results showed that the particle shape and particle size distribution of compound fertilizer were the main factors affecting its angle of repose. Through the golden section method and a single-factor experiment, the rolling friction coefficients of the three granular fertilizers under the two granular modeling methods for spherical modeling and scanning modeling were determined. The results showed that the rolling friction coefficient when using scanning modeling to approximate the actual angle of repose was approximately 80% of that when using the spherical modeling method. The influence of different modeling methods on the total rotational kinetic energy and the formation of the angle of repose was discussed. For the same fertilizer, the total rotational kinetic energy was greater in spherical modeling than in scanning modeling, and the formation time of the angle of repose was longer in scanning modeling than in spherical modeling. The results of an external tank wheel fertilization simulation and bench test showed that considering the scanning modeling of fertilizer shape and particle size distribution, the fertilization variation coefficient obtained from the simulation test was closer to that of the bench test. This research helps to better understand the influence of particle shape and particle size distribution on DEM simulations and provides references for discrete element modeling of other granular fertilizers.

However, it is difficult to assess the tertiary packing of transiently populated species to evaluate this hypothesis. Escherichia coli RNase H is known to populate an intermediate before the rate-limiting barrier to folding that has long been thought to be a molten globule. We investigated this hypothesis by making mimics of the intermediate that are the ground-state conformation at equilibrium, using two approaches: a truncation to generate a fragment mimic of the intermediate, and selective destabilization of the native state using point mutations. Spectroscopic characterization and the response of the mimics to further mutation are consistent with studies on the transient kinetic intermediate, indicating that they model the early intermediate. Both mimics fold cooperatively and exhibit NMR spectra indicative of a closely packed conformation, in contrast to the hypothesis of molten tertiary packing. This result is important for understanding the nature of the subsequent rate-limiting barrier to folding and has implications for the assumption that many other proteins populate molten globule folding intermediates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aprotein folding 3aproteins 3awater1 aConnell, Katelyn B.1 aMarqusee, Susan0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Oct. 14, v. 111, no. 41 p.14746-14751dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14106301113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245014200163300001800305520226300323592002802586650001902614650001702633650001202650650002202662650001102684650001102695651001402706651001702720700002202737700002102759700002002780773010502800856007302905852000902978655001202987IND60081508120221121130048.0150206e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008150812DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.122092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMesgaran, Mohsen B.10aHere be dragons: a tool for quantifying novelty due to covariate range and correlation change when projecting species distribution models  ap. 1147-1159.  aAIM: Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) often involve some degree of projection into novel covariate space (i.e. extrapolation), because calibration data may not encompass the entire space of interest. Most methods for identifying extrapolation focus on the range of each model covariate individually. However, extrapolation can occur that is well within the range of univariate variation, but which exhibits novel combinations between covariates. Our objective was to develop a tool that can detect, distinguish and quantify these two types of novelties: novel univariate range and novel combinations of covariates. LOCATION: Global, Australia, South Africa. METHODS: We developed a new multivariate statistical tool, based on the Mahalanobis distance, which measures the similarity between the reference and projection domains by accounting for both the deviation from the mean and the correlation between variables. The method also provides an assessment tool for the detection of the most influential covariates leading to dissimilarity. As an example application, we modelled an Australian shrub (Acacia cyclops) widely introduced to other countries and compared reference data, global distribution data and both types of model extrapolation against the projection globally and in South Africa. RESULTS: The new tool successfully detected and quantified the degree of dissimilarity for points that were either outside the univariate range or formed novel covariate combinations (correlations) but were still within the univariate range of covariates. For A.Â cyclops, more than half of the points (6617 of 10,785) from the global projection space that were found to lie within the univariate range of reference data exhibited distorted correlations. Not all the climate covariates used for modelling contributed to novelty equally over the geographical space of the model projection. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Identifying nonâanalogous environments is a critical component of model interrogation. Our extrapolation detection (ExDet) tool can be used as a quantitative method for exploring novelty and interpreting the projections from correlative SDMs and is available for free download as standâalone software from http://www.climond.org/exdet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia cyclops 3abiogeography 3aclimate 3acomputer software 3amodels 3ashrubs 3aAustralia 3aSouth Africa1 aCousens, Roger D.1 aWebber, Bruce L.1 aFranklin, Janet0 tDiversity & distributions.g2014 Oct., v. 20, no. 10 p.1147-1159dBlackwell Sciencex1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.122093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010600163300001400269500001900283520115800302592002801460650000901488650001201497650001401509650001901523650001301542653002901555653002501584653002601609653001401635700001501649700001701664700001701681700001801698773011001716856008301826852000901909655001201918IND60708077520221116165405.0201023e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070807752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2020.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Y.10aRelationship between Histological Grade and Histopathological Appearance in Canine Mammary Carcinomas  ap. 59-64.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCanine mammary carcinomas are common tumours in female dogs and histopathological examination has an important role in identifying whether they are benign or malignant. The latest and most commonly used histological grading system was established by PeÃ±a etÂ al. (2013) and is based on the extent of tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism and number of mitoses. Before the establishment of this grading system, tumour size and classical histological indicators of malignancy such as lymphovascular invasion, infiltration into surrounding tissue, necrosis and presence of a micropapillary pattern were important predictors of biological behaviour. However, the system of PeÃ±a etÂ al. does not consider tumour size or these histological features. Clarifying the association of these features and histological grade, especially in grade II and III carcinomas, is important. In this study, we confirmed that the system of PeÃ±a etÂ al. is effective for predicting biological behaviour and that evaluation of histological features of malignancy reinforced histological grade, as determined by the system of PeÃ±a etÂ al., especially in grade II carcinomas.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3afemales 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3anecrosis 0acanine mammary carcinoma 0ahistological grading 0alymph node metastasis 0aprognosis1 aKoyama, K.1 aHoriuchi, N.1 aWatanabe, K.1 aKobayashi, Y.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2020 Aug., v. 179 p.59-64dElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2020.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245013900205300002000344506007600364520149900440592002801939506003701967650002602004650001402030650001502044650001702059650002402076650001902100650001402119650001302133650001302146653001902159653002102178653001902199653002802218653001102246700002002257700003002277700003602307700002302343700002102366773019402387856007902581852000902660655001202669IND60178752420221207143027.0150604e20141014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017875242DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14109321112doi7 aPMC42056412pmcid7 a252713222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrzoss, Lynnie10aSeriniquinone, a selective anticancer agent, induces cell death by autophagocytosis, targeting the cancer-protective protein dermcidin  ap. 14687-14692.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNatural products continue to provide vital treatment options for cancer. Although their translation into chemotherapeutics is complex, collaborative programs continue to deliver productive pipelines for cancer chemotherapy. A new natural product, seriniquinone, isolated from a marine bacterium of the genus Serinicoccus , demonstrated potent activity over a select set of tumor cell lines with particular selectivity toward melanoma cell lines. Upon entering the cell, its journey began by localization into the endoplasmic reticulum. Within 3 h, cells treated with seriniquinone underwent cell death marked by activation of autophagocytosis and gradually terminated through a caspase-9 apoptotic pathway. Using an immunoaffinity approach followed by multipoint validation, we identified the target of seriniquinone as the small protein, dermcidin. Combined, these findings revealed a small molecule motif in parallel with its therapeutic target, whose potential in cancer therapy may be significant. This discovery defines a new pharmacophore that displayed selective activity toward a distinct set of cell lines, predominantly melanoma, within the NCI 60 panel. This selectivity, along with the ease in medicinal chemical modification, provides a key opportunity to design and evaluate new treatments for those cancers that rely on dermcidin activity. Further, the use of dermcidin as a patient preselection biomarker may accelerate the development of more effective personalized treatments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantineoplastic agents 3aautophagy 3abiomarkers 3adrug therapy 3amechanism of action 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aproteins 0amode of action 0achemical biology 0adrug discovery 0amarine natural products 0acancer1 aFukuda, Takashi1 aCosta-Lotufo, LetÃ­cia V.1 aJimÃ©nez EspaÃ±a, Paula,d1969-1 aLa Clair, James J.1 aFenical, William0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Oct. 14, v. 111, no. 41 p.14687-14692dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14109321113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01562naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011500168300001800283520047200301592002800773650001400801650002300815650002100838650001800859650001200877650002200889650001000911700001100921700001500932700001800947700001700965700001900982773010501001856008501106852000901191655001201200IND60579040120221118062852.0170815e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057904012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b002762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Wen-Xue10aIridium-Catalyzed Selective Hydrogenation of 3-Hydroxypyridinium Salts: A Facile Synthesis of Piperidin-3-ones  ap. 1640-1643.  aThe selective hydrogenation of 3-hydroxypyridinium salts has been achieved using a homogeneous iridium catalyst, providing a direct access to 2- and 4-substituted piperidin-3-one derivatives with high yields, which are important organic synthetic intermediates and the prevalent structural motifs in pharmaceutical agents.

This has potential short and chronic adverse health risks. Information is currently scarce on potential genotoxicity of e-waste leachate. In this study, the potential mutagenic and genotoxic effects of leachates from e-waste dumpsites at two electronic markets in Lagos, Nigeria, were investigated. The assays utilized were: bone marrow micronucleus (MN) and chromosome aberration (CA), spermatogonia CA, sperm morphology, and sperm count in mice. Experiments were carried out at concentrations of 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, and 50% (v/v; leachate: distilled water) of leachate samples. MN analysis showed a concentration-dependent induction of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) across the treatment groups. In the CA tests (bone marrow and spermatogonia), there was concentration-dependent significant reduction in mitotic index and induction of different types of CA. Assessment of sperm shape showed a significant increase in sperm abnormalities with significant decrease in mean sperm count in treated groups. Heavy metals analyzed in the tested samples are believed to contribute significantly to the observed genetic damage. This indicates that e-waste contains potential genotoxic agents; and constitutes a genetic risk in exposed human population.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioassays 3abone marrow 3achromosome aberrations 3adeveloping countries 3aelectronic wastes 3aerythrocytes 3agenotoxicity 3aheavy metals 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aleachates 3amarkets 3amice 3amutagenicity 3arisk 3aspermatogonia 3aspermatozoa 3aNigeria 0aelectronic waste 0agenotoxicity 0amutagenicity 0aleachate 0abioassays 0amouse 0aNigeria1 aBakare, Adekunle A.0 tToxicological and environmental chemistry.g2011 May 1, v. 93, no. 5 p.1073-1088dTaylor & Francis Groupx1029-04867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02772248.2011.561949  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015000166506011700316506007600433520203400509592002802543506003702571650002002608650001702628650001202645650002902657650001502686650002502701650001402726650001902740650001502759650001902774650001102793650002002804650001902824650001102843650001602854651002002870653002802890653001902918653002202937653001602959653001302975700001502988700001803003700001503021773010103036856008603137852000903223655001203232IND60777221220221207142554.0220704e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077722122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1089502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKe, Zhixin10aSpatial distributions of zooplankton stable isotopes and their trophic positions in a bay under serious anthropogenic influences: Daya Bay, China  aCreative Commons AttributionÂ 4.0Â Generic (CC BY-NC-NDÂ 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTrophic structure of zooplankton community can effectively reflect the ecosystem health and the influence of anthropogenic disturbances. The Daya Bay is a semi-closed coastal bay under intensive anthropogenic impacts in northern South China Sea. Spatial variations of stable isotope values (Î´Â¹Â³C and Î´Â¹âµN) and trophic positions of dominant zooplankton groups were investigated in Daya Bay during winter. The Î´Â¹Â³C values of zooplankton ranged from â22â° to â15.59â°, and the Î´Â¹âµN ranged from 4.19â° to 12.65â°, respectively. Generally, the Î´Â¹Â³C values of zooplankton were higher in the inner bay. This distribution pattern was determined by the less terrestrial organic matter input and high nutrient loading in Daya Bay. An abnormally lower Î´Â¹âµN value of zooplankton occurred near the Danâao River estuary. It suggested that the Â¹âµN-depleted signature of food source can be transferred to the zooplankton along the food chain. The isotopic Bayesian ellipses of dominant zooplankton groups were generally larger in the inshore region, suggesting a wider food source. In the offshore region, the isotopic ellipses of these dominant zooplankton groups were relatively separate. Our results suggested that eutrophication can increase the trophic overlap between zooplankton groups. The Î´Â¹âµN value indicated large Sagitta was the top predator in zooplankton community. Excluding the abnormal estuarine station, the relative trophic level of large Sagitta was generally lower in the inner bay, suggesting a shorter food chain in eutrophic waters. In addition, our results showed that the stable isotopic signatures of mysids were significantly different from other zooplankton groups. It can be speculated that the mysids might migrate from the open sea in a short time. This study provided detail information on the Î´Â¹Â³C and Î´Â¹âµN values of different zooplankton groups in Daya bay, which will be useful for understanding the anthropogenic influence on the ecosystem structure and function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aMalacostraca 3aSagitta 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3afood chain 3aorganic matter 3arivers 3astable isotopes 3atrophic levels 3awinter 3azooplankton 3aSouth China Sea 0aAnthropogenic influence 0aStable isotope 0aTrophic structure 0aZooplankton 0aDaya Bay1 aLi, Ruofei1 aChen, Danting1 aTan, Yehui0 tEcological indicators.g2022 June, v. 139 p.108950-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1089503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245006800179300001400247520147200261592002801733650002001761650002401781650001301805650001101818650002001829650002801849650001401877650001301891650001501904650001601919650001101935650001501946650001001961650000901971651001001980700002001990700001702010700002202027700002102049773013402070856008102204852000902285655001202294IND60574401920221120033722.0170726e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057440192DNAL7 a10.1007/s13253-016-0271-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSÃ¡nchez-GonzÃ¡lez, Mariola10aSmooth additive mixed models for predicting aboveground biomass  ap. 23-41.  aAboveground biomass estimation in short-rotation forestry plantations is an essential step in the development of crop management strategies as well as allowing the economic viability of the crop to be determined prior to harvesting. Hence, it is important to develop new methodologies that improve the accuracy of predictions, using only a minimum set of easily obtainable information i.e., diameter and height. Many existing models base their predictions only on diameter (mainly due to the complexity of including further covariates), or rely on complicated equations to obtain biomass predictions. However, in tree species, it is important to include height when estimating aboveground biomass because this will vary from one genotype to another. This work proposes the use of a more flexible and easy to implement model for predicting aboveground biomass (stem, branches and total) as a smooth function of height and diameter using smooth additive mixed models which preserve the additive property necessary to model the relationship within wood fractions, and allows the inclusion of random effects and interaction terms. The model is applied to the analysis of three trials carried out in Spain, where nine clones at three different sites are compared. Also, an analysis of slash pine data is carried out in order to compare with the approach proposed by Parresol (Can J For Res 31:865â878, 2001).Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus elliottii 3aaboveground biomass 3abranches 3aclones 3acrop management 3aeconomic sustainability 3aequations 3agenotype 3aharvesting 3amethodology 3amodels 3aprediction 3atrees 3awood 3aSpain1 aDurbÃ¡n, MarÃ­a1 aLee, Dae-Jin1 aCaÃ±ellas, Isabel1 aSixto, Hortensia0 tJournal of agricultural, biological, and environmental statistics.g2017 Mar., v. 22, no. 1 p.23-41dSpringer USx1085-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13253-016-0271-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245004800172300001600220520111800236592002801354650001301382650001201395650001301407650001201420650001701432650002201449650000901471650001401480650001401494650001601508650001701524650000901541651001201550653002501562653001701587653001201604700002401616700002101640773012401661856005101785852000901836655001201845IND50076106520221120185428.0140410e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007610652DNAL7 a10.1080/02772248.2011.5628982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrÃ¶ppl, Michaela10aTrace elemental characterization of fly ash  ap. 886-894.  aThe purpose of this study was to determine heavy metal concentrations in ash samples taken from the filter of the gas cleaning system of biomass incinerators in Austria. Knowing the concentrations of heavy metals is important for the decision of further treatment or utilization of the ashes. The heavy metals contained in the ashes remain in the bottom ash of the incinerator or leave the incinerator with the off-gas and are collected in the off-gas filter. The amount of the metals in the collected fly ash depends on the composition of the input material. The aim of this study was to examine this influence and compare the results with literature data. For measurement, the fly ash samples were at first dissolved in a microwave digestion unit using nitric acid and hydrochloric acid. Afterwards, 20 metals were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Al, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Zn were found in higher concentrations in the fly ash samples. The enrichment factor between the concentrations in the fly ash and the concentrations in the input material was on average in the range of 18.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abiomass 3acleaning 3afly ash 3aheavy metals 3ahydrochloric acid 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anitric acid 3aspectroscopy 3azinc 3aAustria 0abiomass incineration 0aheavy metals 0afly ash1 aMuÃ±oz, Irene Lahoz1 aZeiner, Michaela0 tToxicological and environmental chemistry.g2011 May 1, v. 93, no. 5 p.886-894dTaylor & Francis Groupx1029-04867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02772248.2011.562898  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024003700134040001800171100001800189245015700207506010400364506007600468506003100544520119000575592002801765596004501793506003701838650003101875650004401906650002301950650001501973650001801988650002202006650001102028650002202039650001602061653001902077653002202096653003802118653001002156700005702166700002602223700002602249773010802275856008402383852000902467655001202476IND60765729820221215142849.0220802e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076572982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.afres.2022.1000492chorus7 a10.1016/j.afres.2022.1000492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yaohua10aReal-time FTIR monitoring and modeling Bacillus amyloliquefaciens spore germination: Effect of temperature and sub-lethal treatment by nonthermal plasma  aCreative Commons AttributionÂ 4.0Â Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThis study uses real-time FTIR spectroscopy to probe biochemical changes occurring in spores of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens during nutrient germination at TÂ =Â 23Â âÂ 50Â°C and after sub-lethal injury by treatment with a nonthermal plasma (NTP).

The results indicated that high estimates of genotypic and phenotypic coefficient of variation were recorded for plant height, number of reproductive tillers per plant, panicle length, biological yield per plant, harvest index, test weight, number of grain per panicle and grain yield per plant. High heritability coupled with high genetic advance were revealed for plant height, number of reproductive tillers per plant, panicle length, biological yield per plant, harvest index, test weight, number of grain per panicle and grain yield per plant. Improvement in grain yield can be made by selecting these yield contributed characters having high heritability coupled with high genetic advance. Grain yield per plant showed significant and positive association with number of reproductive tillers per plant, panicle length, days to maturity, number of grain per panicle biological yield per plant and harvest index at both genotypic and phenotypic level. Thus, it can be inferred that selection based on any one of these traits either alone or in combination, will result in identifying high yielding strains. Path coefficient analysis of genotypic and phenotypic exhibited high positive and direct effect of harvest index, number of grains per panicle, test weight, biological yield per plant and plant height on grain yield per plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3agenetic improvement 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3aheritability 3apanicles 3apath analysis 3aphenotype 3aplant height 3arice 0aOryza sativa 0aGenetic variability 0acharacter association1 aSingh, S.K.1 aSingh, S.

CHHQ (dihydroxychloroquinoxalin), CHQ (6-chloroquinoxalin-2-ol) and PPA ((R)-2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)propionicacid) were the main metabolites of this active substance (quizalofop-p) in water. The degradation of the parent compound has been monitored in distilled water. Several commercial products (PanarexÂ®, Master-DÂ® and DixonÂ®) were used to evaluate the degradation of the target compounds into their metabolites. The concentration of the main active substances (quizalofop-p-tefuryl, quizalofop-p-ethyl and propaquizafop) decreased during the degradation studies, whereas the concentration of quizalofop-p increased. DT50 of the main active substances ranged from 10 days to 70 days for most of the analytes, so it can be concluded that compounds are medium-high persistent in this matrix. Metabolites, such as PPA, CHHQ and CHQ, were detected in water samples after 7 days of the application of the commercial products at concentrations higher than their limits of quantification (> 0.1â¯Âµg/L). CHQ was detected at 1400â¯Âµg/L after 75 days of the application of quizalofop-p-ethyl commercial product. CHHQ and CHQ were found at the highest concentrations at 7â45â¯days after the application of quizalofop-p-tefuryl, whereas PPA was detected at higher concentrations (up to 5.37â¯Âµg/L) in propaquizafop samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3apropaquizafop 3aquizalofop 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aQuizalofop-p 0aDegradation 0aWater 0aActive substances 0aMetabolites 0aLC-HRMS1 aRomero GonzÃ¡lez, Roberto,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2505-20561 aMartÃ­nez Vidal, JosÃ© Luis1 aGarrido Frenich, Antonia0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 157 p.285-291dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.03.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01894naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245011200164300001600276520076200292592002801054650002301082650002601105650001801131653004001149653002101189653007301210653001501283653001601298700001801314773015001332856007701482852000901559655001201568IND60521980420221121063319.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052198042DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1993-04172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yong-Kang10aSynthesis of a Dihydroxy-Substituted Aminoxyl Spin Label and its Crown Ether and Cyclic Diester Derivatives  ap. 505-510.  aA novel dihydroxy-substituted aminoxyl spin label, 4-hydroxy-3-(3'-hydroxypropyl)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy (5), has been prepared.

Activity of proteasomes is regulated by constitutive ATPases that respond to intracellular concentrations of ATP. Although recent data suggest a role of proteasomes in fatty acid metabolism, whether lipogenic activity in mammary cells is responsive to ATP concentrations and proteasome activity is unknown. To investigate whether proteasomes play a role in milk fat depression induced by trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10,c12 CLA), a bovine mammary epithelial cell line was treated with t10,c12 CLA for 24 h before analysis of lipogenic protein abundance. Western blot analysis of inactive sterol response element-binding protein-1 (pSREBP1) and active (nSREBP1) fragments indicated a decrease in abundance induced by exogenous t10,c12 CLA. At 150 nM t10,c12 CLA, abundance of both pSREBP1 and nSREBP1 was lowest, and decreased from basal levels by 16 and 64%, respectively. Exogenous t10,c12 CLA had no effect on abundance of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARÎ³), but at 150 and 300 nM it decreased abundance of SREBF chaperone (SCAP). Inhibition of proteasome activity via incubation with MG-132 (a proteasome inhibitor) alone had no effect on pSREBP1, nSREBP1, PPARÎ³, or SCAP abundance. However, when cells were pre-incubated with MG-132, treatment with t10,c12 CLA reduced pSREBP1 (â¼27%) and nSREBP1 (â¼41%) abundance without affecting PPARÎ³ or SCAP. Compared with the control, exogenous t10,c12 CLA increased ATP concentrations, and MG-132 alone had no effect. However, ATP concentration decreased markedly in cells incubated with both MG-132 and t10,c12 CLA. Combined with the alteration of SCAP and nSREBP1, the increase of ATP concentrations with t10,c12 CLA suggested that this fatty acid influenced the function of the SREBP1-SCAP complex through altering proteasome activity. Collectively, the current data highlight a role of proteasomes and intracellular ATP concentrations in the antilipogenic effect induced by t10,c12 CLA that leads to milk fat depression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acattle 3acell lines 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aepithelial cells 3afatty acid metabolism 3amammary glands 3amilk fat yield 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteasome inhibitors 3asterols 0atrans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid 0aproteasome 0aATP 0aprotein expression1 aTai, D.M.1 aWang, C.1 aLiu, J.X.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5812-51861 aLoor, J.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1586-43651 aLiu, H.Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8806-62040 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Oct., v. 103, no. 10 p.9096-9101dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-178723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002100136245008800157300001800245520141000263592002801673650002001701650002101721650002201742650003001764650001501794650002301809650002801832650002301860650002401883651001401907653001801921653002501939653002301964653003001987653002202017653001402039653002202053653003102075653002202106700002402128773010902152856007402261852000902335655001202344IND4425120520221121114236.0151127e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442512052DNAL7 a10.2193/2008-4412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTwedt, Daniel J.10aBird Response to Prescribed Silvicultural Treatments in Bottomland Hardwood Forests  ap. 1140-1150.  aSilvicultural treatments prescribed to enhance wildlife habitat by promoting structural heterogeneity via retention of large live trees, snags, and coarse woody debris has been termed wildlife-forestry. Wildlife-forestry has been advocated for management of bottomland hardwood forests on public conservation lands within the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, USA. On Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Louisiana, we used distance sampling during 6 visits to 138 point locations to estimate avian densities within stands subjected to variable-retention harvests, within a 13-year chronosequence, and untreated control stands. Densities of 9 species, including 6 species of conservation concern, were greater in treated stands than on untreated stands. Five species responded negatively to treatments and had greater densities in untreated control stands. Based on conservation concern scores established by Partners in Flight and annual detections of each of 30 species, treated stands afforded greater community-wide bird conservation than did untreated stands. For most species, maximum treatment response was between 5 years and 8 years posttreatment with duration of treatment effect <13 years.

However, the layer-number-dependent studies on 2D materials to date are largely limited to exfoliated flakes with relatively small lateral size and poor yield. The direct synthesis of 2D materials with a precise control of the number of atomic layers remains a substantial synthetic challenge. Here we report a systematic study of chemical vapor deposition synthesis of large-area atomically thin 2D nickel telluride (NiTeâ) single crystals and investigate the thickness dependent electronic properties. By controlling the growth temperature, we show that the highly uniform NiTeâ single crystals can be synthesized with precisely tunable thickness varying from 1, 2, 3, . . . to multilayers with a standard deviation (â¼0.3 nm) of less than the thickness of a monolayer layer NiTeâ. Our studies further reveal a systematic evolution of single crystal domain size and nucleation density with the largest lateral domain size up to â¼440 Î¼m. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and high resolution scanning transmission electron microscope studies demonstrate that the resulting 2D crystals are high quality single crystals and adopt hexagonal 1T phase. Electrical transport studies reveal that the 2D NiTeâ single crystals show a strong thickness-tunable electrical properties, with an excellent conductivity up to 7.8 Ã 10âµ S mâÂ¹ and extraordinary breakdown current density up to 4.7 Ã 10â· A/cmÂ². The systematic study and robust synthesis of NiTeâ nanosheets defines a reliable chemical route to 2D single crystals with precisely tailored thickness and could enable the design of new device architectures based on thickness-tunable electrical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystals 3aelectrical properties 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aoptical properties 3astandard deviation 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avapors1 aDang, Weiqi1 aLiu, Yuan1 aLi, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5802-75191 aLi, Jia1 aLuo, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5084-20871 aZhang, Zhengwei1 aWu, Ruixia1 aMa, Huifang1 aSun, Guangzhuang1 aHuang, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1793-07411 aDuan, Xidong1 aDuan, Xiangfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4321-62880 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Oct. 22, v. 140, no. 43 p.14217-14223dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b081243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009200165506011700257506007600374520125200450592002801702506003701730650002901767650002201796650001701818650001401835650002301849650002301872650001901895651001001914653002001924653002801944653002401972653003201996700002002028700001402048700001502062700001402077700001602091700001602107773010102123856008602224852000902310655001202319IND60777222120221207142551.0220704e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077722212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1089592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Wen10aStudy on cultivated land quality evaluation from the perspective of farmland ecosystems  aCreative Commons AttributionÂ 4.0Â Generic (CC BY-NC-NDÂ 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHistorically, the cognition and management of cultivated land quality (CLQ) have been fragmented, leading to an inability to meet contemporary scenarios and requirements of Chinaâs agricultural development and cultivated land protection. This study aimed to systematically recognize the concepts, elements, connotations, and dimensions of CLQ and build a new cultivated land quality evaluation (CQE) system. Initially, we deduced the concept of CLQ through the clear concept of âqualityâ in line with international standards. Next, we connected CLQ with the framework of farmland ecosystem service cascades and clarified the element structure of CLQ based on the structure of farmland ecosystems. Then, based on the multi-level human well-being that farmland ecosystems can provide, the connotations and dimensions of CLQ was determined. Using Wen County within Henan Province as a case study site, we constructed a CQE system for empirical analysis and comparative verification, showing that the new system was better than the existing one. This study helped to clarify the CLQ and provided a theoretical basis and technical reference for sustainable intensification (SI) and multi-directional protection and supervision of cultivated land.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural land 3acase studies 3acognition 3aecosystem services 3aempirical research 3asocial welfare 3aChina 0aLand evaluation 0aCultivated land quality 0aFarmland ecosystems 0aSustainable intensification1 aZhang, Huizhong1 aZhao, Rui1 aWu, Kening1 aLi, Xinju1 aNiu, Beibei1 aLi, Junying0 tEcological indicators.g2022 June, v. 139 p.108959-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1089593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003000155245008800185500002200273520178100295592002802076650002202104650001502126650001202141650001502153650001102168650002102179650001602200650002102216650001102237653004902248653001602297653003202313653000802345700001902353773005602372856008902428852000902517655001202526IND60563204920221116182111.0170719s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056320492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartÃ­nez, Rodrigo Javier10aUnderstanding Nitrilotris(methylenephosphonic acid) reactions with ferric hydroxide  aPre-press version  aPhosphonate compounds are used in a wide variety of industrial and agricultural applications, and are commonly found in surface and ground waters. Adsorption to ferric hydroxide can have a significant effect on the transport and fate of phosphonate compounds in the environment. This research used density functional theory modeling to investigate the adsorption mechanisms of nitrilotris(methylenephosphonic acid) (NTMP) on ferric hydroxide. Standard Gibbs free energies of reaction (ÎGro) and reaction activation barriers (Ea) were calculated for different possible adsorption mechanisms. Physical adsorption of NTMP to ferric hydroxide was promoted by negative charge assisted hydrogen bonding, and had ÎGro ranging from â2.7 to â7.4Â kcal/mol. NTMP was found to form three different types of inner sphere complexes, monodentate, bidentate mononuclear and bidentate binuclear. For the monodentate complexes, ÎGro ranged from â8.0 to â13.7Â kcal/mol, for the bidentate complexes ÎGro ranged from â15.3 to â28.9Â kcal/mol. Complexation with Ca2+ decreased the energy for physical adsorption but increased the binding energies for mono- and bidentate complexes. Complexation with Ca2+ also allowed formation of a tridentate ternary surface complex, whereby the Ca2+ ion formed a bridge between three FeâO- and three PâO- groups. Physical adsorption had EaÂ =Â 0, but mono- and bidentate complex formation had Ea values ranging from 36 to 53Â kcal/mol. Formation of tridentate ternary surface complexes involving Ca2+ had the lowest activation barriers of 8 and 10Â kcal/mol. The different activation barriers for different modes of adsorption may explain previous experimental observations of unusual kinetic behavior for adsorption and desorption of NTMP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3acalcium 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aferric hydroxide 3agroundwater 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 0anitrilotris(methylenephosphonic acid) (NTMP) 0aPhosphonate 0aFerric hydroxide adsorbents 0aDFT1 aFarrell, James0 tChemosphere.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03731naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013100167300001600298500001900314500001100333520223800344592002802582650002402610650002602634650001702660650002402677650001302701650001602714650002202730650002402752650001202776650001402788650002002802650001602822650001602838650001102854650002302865650001802888650001802906650001802924650002302942650001802965650002102983700002103004773010903025856008203134852000903216655001203225IND60714708620221119110028.0201024e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071470862DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-020-00469-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgbuewu, I.

The use of spices to maintain health and increase productivity in livestock and poultry has been documented. However, a consensus has not been attained whether ginger, one of such spices, improves productivity in poultry. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to ascertain the effect of ginger administration on chicken performance. We searched AGORA, Scopus, Science Direct and Google Scholar for papers published in English using Boolean operators, proximity searching, wildcard and alternate spelling. Selected criteria were randomized and control trials with chickens, studies published in peer-reviewed journals, reported at least one presentation form of ginger and outcomes of interest and a measure of dispersion (standard deviation or p value). Twenty-one papers that satisfy the selection criteria were employed to determine the impact of ginger on feed intake, body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), organ weight, semen parameters and total serum lipid (triglyceride and cholesterol) content using Open Meta-analyst for Ecology and Evolution software. A positive relationship was found between ginger and semen quality in chickens. Ginger administration improved BWG (Hedgesâ d, dâ=â0.495; 95% confidence interval (CI)â=â0.041â0.949; pâ=â0.033) and FCR (dâ=âââ0.732; 95% CI ââ1.195 to ââ0.270; pâ=â0.002) taking cognizance of publication bias and heterogeneity. Restricted subgroup analysis showed there is a positive association between ginger powder and FCR (dâ=âââ0.732; 95% CIâ=â1.195 to ââ0.270; pâ=â0.002). Meta-regression revealed that covariates (duration of administration, dietary form, inclusion level and strain) explained most of the heterogeneity. The occurrence of variations and publication bias does not pose a major problem in this study since a relatively large number of unpublished studies will be needed to change significant impacts. In conclusion, meta-analytical results suggest enhanced performance in chickens on different levels of ginger administration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZingiber officinale 3aagricultural research 3ablood lipids 3abody weight changes 3achickens 3acholesterol 3acomputer software 3aconfidence interval 3aecology 3aevolution 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeed prices 3aginger 3agrowth performance 3ahealth status 3ameta-analysis 3asemen quality 3astandard deviation 3atissue weight 3atriacylglycerols1 aMbajiorgu, C.

Thus, acute toxicity (24-h-LCââ) of PM was determined on Caspian roach in two size classes (small and large groups), under aerated and non-aerated conditions, using static non-renewal system. 24-h-LCââ for PM in Caspian roach was 3.2, 3, 3.2, and 2.8âmgâLâ»Â¹ in large-aerated, large-non-aerated, small-aerated, and small-non-aerated groups, respectively. Results indicated that aeration was led to decrease in PM toxicity, regardless of size class. However, large fish showed more tolerance to PM toxicity compared to small ones, under non-aerated condition. It is concluded that aeration could decrease the toxicity of PM that seems to be due to the increase in PM degradation, derived from increase in water turbulence. It is suggested that 96-h-LCââ may be more suitable to determine the effects of fish size on PM toxicity than 24-h-LCââ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRutilus caspicus 3aRutilus rutilus 3aacute toxicity 3aaeration 3afish 3afish culture 3apotassium permanganate 3aturbulent flow 3aIran 0apotassium permanganate 0aCaspian roach 0atoxicity 0aLC501 aNodeh, Ali Jafar0 tToxicological and environmental chemistry.g2011 May 1, v. 93, no. 5 p.996-1001dTaylor & Francis Groupx1029-04867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02772248.2011.568484  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245019700167300001800364520154200382592002801924650002201952650003501974650001302009650001502022650001702037650001702054650001802071650002202089650001802111650000702129650001302136650001102149650001002160650001602170700002502186700002202211700002502233700002202258773014702280856008202427852000902509655001202518IND60574402620221121044801.0190726e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057440262DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-016-0142-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVitali, Luciano10aDevelopment of a fast method for simultaneous determination of hippuric acid, mandelic acid, and creatinine in urine by capillary zone electrophoresis using polymer multilayer-coated capillary  ap. 1943-1950.  aThis paper reports the development of a fast separation method employing capillary zone electrophoresis for the simultaneous determination of hippuric acid, mandelic acid, and creatinine in samples of urine using a coated capillary. The background electrolyte was composed of 10Â mmolÂ Lâ»Â¹ tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane and 30Â mmolÂ Lâ»Â¹ 2-hydroxy-isobutyric acid at pHÂ 3.6. The internal standard was 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Separations were performed in a fused silica capillary (32Â cm total length, 8.5Â cm effective length, and 50Â Î¼m internal diameter) coated with crosslinked hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan and Îº-carrageenan. Direct UV detection was performed at a wavelength of 200Â nm. Samples and standards were injected hydrodynamically (â50Â mbar, 3Â s) using the short-end injection procedure. The electrophoretic system was operated under constant voltage of 30Â kV with positive polarity on the injection side. The separation time for hippuric acid, mandelic acid, and creatinine was less than 70Â s. The evaluation of some analytical parameters of the method for the three analytes showed good linearity (R Â²â>â0.99), limit of detections of 0.21 to 0.63Â mgÂ Lâ»Â¹, inter-day precision better than 3.0% (peak area), and recovery in the range of 98 to 106%. The method developed was applied in the analysis of the three analytes in urine samples.

The results showed that the average of the canopy temperature was lower than atmosphere temperature. However, there was no significant difference among the three water treatments. Under CI treatment, the daily variation of canopy temperature was higher than atmosphere temperature from 11:00 to 15:00 oâclock at heading stage, indicating the water stress appeared at this time. The correlation analysis was found that the canopy temperature had no effects on Fáµ¥/Fâ, QP and dry biomass growth rate, and the highest values of Fáµ¥/Fâ, QN and the dry biomass growth rate were recorded in FI treatment. Therefore, based on the results of this experiment during the 2Â years, it could provide some reference and theoretical support for the water management, in cold region and black glebe, in northeast China.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0300105-2cNational key Research and Development Project of China  a2016YFC0400108cNational key Research and Development Project of China  a2018YFC0407301cNational key Research and Development Project of China  a51809042cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a51779046cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aagricultural research 3abiomass 3acanopy 3acold 3aflood irrigation 3afluorescence 3apaddies 3arice 3atemperature 3awater content 3awater management 3awater stress 3aChina1 aZhang, Chao1 aQi, Zhijuan1 aZhang, Zhongxue0 tAgricultural research.g2020 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.599-608dSpringer IndiawJournal:21667x2249-720X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40003-019-00452-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001200145245012700157300001600284500002000300520131200320592002801632596005901660596005901719596005501778596005501833596007101888596007501959596008202034596008202116596008802198596008902286596007902375650001402454650001802468650001702486650001702503650001402520700001602534700006102550700001602611700005902627700001802686700005602704700001702760700001302777700001502790700005502805773012902860856008002989852000903069655001203078IND60768674820221119105007.0220226e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076867482DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.156122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Rui10aMetabolic potentials of members of the class Acidobacteriia in metalâcontaminated soils revealed by metagenomic analysis  ap. 803-818.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe relative abundance of Acidobacteriia correlated positively with the concentrations of arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu) and other metals, suggesting their adaptation of the metalârich environments. Metagenomic binning reconstructed 29 highâquality metagenomeâassembled genomes (MAGs) associated with Acidobacteriia, providing an opportunity to study their metabolic potentials. These MAGs contained genes to transform As, Hg and Cr through oxidation, reduction, efflux and demethylation, suggesting the potential of Acidobacteriia to transform such metal(loid)s. Additionally, genes associated with alleviation of acidic and metal stress were also detected in these MAGs. Acidobacteriia may have the capabilities to resist or transform metal(loid)s in acidic metalâcontaminated sites. Moreover, these genes encoding metal transformation could be also identified in the Acidobacteriiaâassociated MAGs from five additional metalâcontaminated sites across Southwest China, as well as Acidobacteriiaâassociated reference genomes from the NCBI database, suggesting that the capability of metal transformation may be widespread among Acidobacteriia members. This discovery provides an understanding of metabolic potentials of the Acidobacteriia in acidic metalârich sites.  aPublisher supplied data  a42007357cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41771301cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2020T130127cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a2019M662825cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a202002030271cScience and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou  a2019A1515110351cGuangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation  a2020GDASYLâ20200103086cGDAS' Project of Science and Technology Development  a2020GDASYLâ20200102014cGDAS' Project of Science and Technology Development  a2019B121205006cGuangdong Foundation for Program of Science and Technology Research  a2020B1212060048cGuangdong Foundation for Program of Science and Technology Research  a2017GC010570cGuangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talents 3adatabases 3ademethylation 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiology 3aoxidation1 aSun, Xiaoxu1 aHÃ¤ggblom, Max M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6307-78631 aDong, Yiran1 aZhang, Miaomiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5870-50871 aYang, Zhaohui1 aXiao, Enzong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8220-74131 aXiao, Tangfu1 aGao, Pin1 aLi, Baoqin1 aSun, Weimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3456-81770 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2022 Feb., v. 24, no. 2 p.803-818dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.156123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011500156300001800271520122800289592002801517650001001545650001201555650000901567650000701576650001101583650003301594650001901627650002201646650001301668650001501681650001901696650001301715650004001728650000901768700001501777700001601792773012801808856007401936852000902010655001202019IND60656664920221121051948.0190814e20131121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065666492DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay40527c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jiaman10aOptimization of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis for proteome analysis of suspension-cultured ginseng cells  ap. 7030-7035.  aTwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) is the most widely used protocol to study protein expression and function in plants and plant diseases. In this study, optimized 2-DE sample preparation methodologies were established for suspension-cultured ginseng cells. Trichloroacetic acidâacetone (TCAâacetone), urea/thiourea and phenol extraction methods were evaluated for proteomic analysis of suspension cultures of ginseng. The solubilization buffer, sample volumes and concentration of polyacrylamide gels were also optimized in the 2-DE system. The phenol extraction method was proved to be the best method, which provided a greater spot resolution, a higher protein yield and a minimal streaking on 2-DE gels for suspension-cultured ginseng cells. A solubilization buffer containing 9 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% w/v CHAPS, 50 mM DTT, 1% TBP and 2% v/v IPG buffer at pH 3â10, yielded the best protein solubilization. High quality 2-DE protein expression profiles were obtained under the conditions of 0.8 mg sample mass loaded, 17 cm IPG strips (linear pH gradient 5â8), and 12% polyacrylamide gels. The optimized protocol is useful for comparative proteome analysis of suspension-cultured ginseng cells by 2-DE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax 3abuffers 3agels 3apH 3aphenol 3aplant diseases and disorders 3apolyacrylamide 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asolubilization 3athiourea 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3aurea1 aFu, Junfan1 aZhou, Rujun0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Nov. 21, v. 5, no. 24 p.7030-7035dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay40527c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008100169300001600250520125700266592002801523650003101551650001901582650001801601650001501619650003801634650002101672650001701693650002401710650001201734650002201746650001501768653001401783653001701797653001501814653000801829700001901837700001801856700001701874700001301891773010401904856008602008852000902094655001202103IND60581197620221119121703.0180830e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058119762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2017.07.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Haifeng10aProtective effects of sinomenine against LPS-induced inflammation in piglets  ap. 573-577.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate in piglets, the anti-endotoxin and anti-inflammatory effects of sinomenine, an agent commonly found in Chinese herbal medicines. In high-, middle- and low-dose sinomenine groups, piglets were initially challenged with endotoxin (i.e., 1Â mg lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/kg) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection and, 3Â h later, intramuscularly (IM) with sinomenine at 1, 5, or 10Â mg/kg. In a drug control group, piglets were dosed IP with vehicle and 3Â h late IM with 10Â mg/kg sinomenine while those in an LPS control group were challenged with 1Â mg LPS/kg (IP) and then vehicle 3Â h later; naÃ¯ve control piglets were administered normal saline IP and then IM only. At 12, 24, and 48Â h post-LPS/vehicle injection, blood samples were collected from the precaval vein of piglets. Clinical signs were recorded during the trial and index levels were analyzed by ELISA kits. The results revealed sinomenine could reduce the incidence/severity of certain LPS-induced toxicities, e.g., cell adhesion, systemic inflammation, and multiple organ dysfunction. Taken together, the data suggested to us that sinomenine might effectively be useful to regulate inflammatory responses as part of future anti-endotoxin therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablood sampling 3acell adhesion 3aendotoxins 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aherbal medicines 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3apiglets 3aprotective effect 3asinomenine 0aEndotoxin 0aInflammation 0aSinomenine 0aLPS1 aJiang, Chunmao1 aChen, Xiaolan1 aHe, Kongwang1 aHu, Yiyi0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2017 Sept., v. 110 p.573-577dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.07.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010900161300001800270520128500288592002801573650003601601650001701637650001301654650001301667650001501680650001201695650002901707650002201736650001201758651001901770700002601789700001901815773012801834856007401962852000902036655001202045IND60656665020221122192116.0190814e20130725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065666502DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay40530c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRicciardi, Paola10aâIt's not easy being greenâ: a spectroscopic study of green pigments used in illuminated manuscripts  ap. 3819-3824.  aThis study explores the use of green pigments and mixtures in manuscript illumination, drawing upon experimental evidence derived from a non-invasive spectroscopic survey of green pigments used in 31 bound manuscripts and 23 manuscript cuttings or single folios in the collections of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, UK. Analytical investigations were carried out on green-coloured areas by visible and near-infrared fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS), at times supplemented by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). FORS spectra can easily be acquired in great numbers and without subjecting the manuscripts to any physical strain, making this technique especially suitable for analytical surveys of valuable and fragile objects. Despite some drawbacks, its use in combination with XRF often provides a relatively complete characterisation of pigments and mixtures, particularly when FORS analysis is extended into the shortwave-infrared range (to 2500 nm). The experimental results are examined in light of the recipes for green pigments found in medieval technical treatises. The outcome is a contextualized study with a focus on French illumination between the 13th and the 16th century, but allowing for comparisons with contemporary materials of different geographic origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3afiber optics 3alighting 3apigments 3aprovenance 3arecipes 3areflectance spectroscopy 3aspectral analysis 3asurveys 3aUnited Kingdom1 aPallipurath, Anuradha1 aRose, Kristine0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 July 25, v. 5, no. 16 p.3819-3824dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay40530c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245023200205520139100437592002801828650001501856650001201871650002501883650001801908650001301926650001001939650002401949650001501973650001701988650001402005650001402019650001502033650001202048650000702060650001902067650002302086650001402109650001902123653001902142653002302161653003802184653001802222653002302240700002002263700001802283700002102301700001602322700001902338700001802357773012202375856008102497852000902578655001202587IND60737473020221120033813.0211030e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073747302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1117142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, R.T.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5306-168910aPhysicochemical characterization, bioactive compounds, in vitro antioxidant activity, sensory profile and consumer acceptability of fermented alcoholic beverage obtained from Caatinga passion fruit (Passiflora cincinnata Mast.)  aThe aim of this research was to evaluate the quality of fermented alcoholic beverage from passion fruit produced using passion fruit species obtained from the Brazilian Caatinga biome (Passiflora cincinnata Mast.). Four treatments were elaborated using fruit pulp in two different ripening stages (unripe and ripe), with and without dilution of the pulp. The following analyses were conducted to characterize the passion fruit wines: pH, density, soluble solids, titratable and volatile acidity, sulfur dioxide, dry extract, alcohol content, total sugar, color parameters (L*, a*, b*, C* and h) and bioactive compounds (ascorbic acid and phenolic compounds). The antioxidant potential as determined in vitro by DPPH, FRAP and ORAC assays. The overall acceptance and purchase intention of the beverages were evaluated using a consumer test. The physiochemical compositions of the samples were different, except for volatile acidity and ascorbic acid. The total phenolic compounds content was considered relevant, >700 mg GAE LÂ¹. Twenty-one phenolic compounds, among phenolic acids, flavonols, flavanols and stilbenes were identified and quantified by HPLC-DAD-FD. The sensory score obtained was considered satisfactory. This study showed the feasibility of using the Caatinga passion fruit to produce fermented alcoholic beverage, which could be inserted on the market as a new product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPassiflora 3aacidity 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acaatinga 3acolor 3aconsumer acceptance 3aecosystems 3afermentation 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3afruit pulp 3amarkets 3apH 3apassion fruits 3asensory evaluation 3astilbenes 3asulfur dioxide 0aCaatinga biome 0aPassion fruit wine 0aCATA (âCheck-all-that-applyâ) 0aAscorbic acid 0aPhenolic compounds1 aBiasoto, A.C.T.1 aRybka, A.C.P.1 aCastro, C.D.P.C.1 aAidar, S.T.1 aBorges, G.S.C.1 aSilva, F.L.H.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Aug., v. 148 p.111714-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1117143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02036naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008700165300001800252520090700270592002801177650001601205650002801221650001901249650002601268650001901294650001401313650001301327650001901340700002301359700002301382700002101405700002101426700001501447773011001462856008101572852000901653655001201662IND60586702120221122201152.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058670212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-017-1177-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuÃ­s, Ana T.10aAtomic force microscopy (AFM) application to diatom study: review and perspectives  ap. 2989-3001.  aAtomic force microscopy (AFM) allows high image resolution, based on slight differences in surface height and on imaging transparent structures, thus, is an excellent type of microscopy for imaging nano-sized objects, such as diatoms.

Our study considers different aspects related with AFM and diatom samples preparation, AFM types and its application in studies of taxonomy, biomineral formation, ultrastructure, mucilage layers, and micromechanical properties. We also present new AFM data highlighting the taxonomical importance of Amphipleura pellucida.

The majority of plant species suffer from developmental abnormalities caused by an exposure to toxic concentrations of metals and metalloids, mainly Al, As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn. However, defense mechanisms are activated with diverse intensity and efficiency. Enhancement of defense potential can be achieved though exogenously applied treatments, resulting in a higher capability of surviving and developing under stress and become, at least temporarily, tolerant to stress factors. In this review, I present several already recognized as well as novel methods of the priming process called priming, resulting in the so-called âprimed stateâ of the plant organism. Primed plants have a higher capability of surviving and developing under stress, and become, at least temporarily, tolerant to stress factors. In this review, several already recognized as well as novel methods of priming plants towards tolerance to metallic stress are discussed, with attention paid to similarities in priming mechanisms activated by the most versatile priming agents. This knowledge could contribute to the development of priming mixtures to counteract negative effects of multi-metallic and multi-abiotic stresses. Presentation of mechanisms is complemented with information on the genes regulated by priming towards metallic stress tolerance. Novel compounds and techniques that can be exploited in priming experiments are also summarized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal development 3acomplementary genes 3adefense mechanisms 3ametalloids 3ametals 3aorganisms 3aplanting 3aprocessing technology 3astress tolerance 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3atrace elements0 tPlants.g2021 Mar. 25, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100406233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008900171520181700260592002802077650001202105650001302117650001502130650001302145650002202158650001102180650001502191650001902206650001202225650001402237650001902251650002402270650001402294650002202308653001802330653001702348653001602365653001602381653000902397700002202406700002102428700002302449773010602472856008602578852000902664655001202673IND60758319020221122212006.0211227e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075831902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2021.1136552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEulalia, Catamo10aAre taste variations associated with the liking of sweetened and unsweetened coffee?  aIn this study, we evaluated the influence of taste phenotypes and genotypes on the hedonics of sweetened and unsweetened coffee.Liking of espresso coffee from food questionnaire and of a ready-to-drink unsweetened coffee beverage was measured using a 9-point hedonic scale in 1551 Italian individuals. Perception and liking for different bitter and sweet compounds were also collected. Genotyping of selected Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in five taste genes (TAS1R3, GNAT3, TAS2R14, TAS2R19, TAS2R38) was performed. Linear and logistic regression models, including sex and gender as covariates, were used to test the relationship of taste phenotypes and selected SNPs with coffee liking.We found that increased caffeine bitterness perception was associated with an increasing liking for sweetened coffee (p-valueÂ =Â 0.018) and decreased liking of unsweetened coffee (p-valueÂ =Â 0.034). The liking of unsweetened coffee beverage was also negatively associated with sweet intensity perception (p-valueÂ =Â 0.03). Analysis of SNPs in taste-related genes showed that rs6467192 G allele (intron 4 variant) in GNAT3 sweet taste gene was associated with higher liking of sweetened coffee (p-valueÂ =Â 0.002) and lower liking of unsweetened coffee (p-valueÂ =Â 0.01). An association also emerged between unsweetened coffee and SNPs in bitter receptor genes, with rs2597979 in TAS2R14 gene associated with liking of unsweetened coffee (p-valueÂ =Â 0.004) and rs10772420 in TAS2R19 gene associated with liking of both unsweetened espresso coffee and coffee beverage (p-valueÂ =Â 0.04 and p-valueÂ =Â 0.03, respectively).These findings suggested that individual preference for sweetened and unsweetened coffee may be influenced by both phenotypic and nucleotide variations in bitter and sweet taste sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abehavior 3abitterness 3acaffeine 3acoffee (beverage) 3agender 3agenotyping 3ahedonic scales 3aintrons 3aphenotype 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asweetness 3ataste sensitivity 0aCoffee liking 0aBitter taste 0aSweet taste 0aTaste genes 0aSnps1 aLuciano, Navarini1 aPaolo, Gasparini1 aAntonietta, Robino0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 244 p.113655-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2021.1136553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01403naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245012400162300001800286520031500304592002800619650001500647650001000662650002200672700001700694700005300711700005800764700005700822773013300879856008001012852000901092655001201101IND60769240220221118045807.0220304e20220208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076924022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c026622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fangran10aRu-Catalyzed Defluorinative Alkylation or Catalyst-Free Hydroalkylation of gem-Difluoroalkenes Enabled by Visible Light  ap. 2730-2739.  aA catalyst-induced defluorinative, alkylation or metal-free hydroalkylation of gem-difluoroalkenes enabled by visible light was developed.

Although quenching of Â¹Oâ by prenylquinols has been previously studied, direct evidence for chemical quenching of Â¹Oâ by plastoquinols and their oxidation products is limited inÂ vivo. In the present study, the role of plastoquinolâ9 (PQHââ9) in chemical quenching of Â¹Oâ was studied in Arabidopsis thaliana lines overexpressing the SOLANESYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1 gene (SPS1oex) involved in PQHââ9 and plastochromanolâ8 biosynthesis. In this work, direct evidence for chemical quenching of Â¹Oâ by plastoquinols and their oxidation products is presented, which is obtained by microscopic techniques inÂ vivo. Chemical quenching of Â¹Oâ was associated with consumption of PQHââ9 and formation of its various oxidized forms. Oxidation of PQHââ9 by Â¹Oâ leads to plastoquinoneâ9 (PQâ9), which is subsequently oxidized to hydroxyplastoquinoneâ9 [PQ(OH)â9]. We provide here evidence that oxidation of PQ(OH)â9 by Â¹Oâ results in the formation of trihydroxyplastoquinoneâ9 [PQ(OH)ââ9]. It is concluded here that PQHââ9 serves as an efficient Â¹Oâ chemical quencher in Arabidopsis, and PQ(OH)ââ9 can be considered as a natural product of Â¹Oâ reaction with PQ(OH)â9. The understanding of the mechanisms underlying Â¹Oâ chemical quenching provides information on the role of plastoquinols and their oxidation products in the response of plants to photooxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abiosynthesis 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aphotooxidation 3asinglet oxygen1 aCiura, Joanna1 aKsas, Brigitte1 aRÃ¡c, Marek1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0226-67961 aSedlÃ¡ÅovÃ¡, Michaela1 aKruk, Jerzy1 aHavaux, Michel1 aPospisil, Pavel,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9126-20110 tplant journal.g2018 Sept., v. 95, no. 5 p.848-861dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.139933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245004900178300001800227520106100245592002801306650002101334650001101355650001601366650001101382650001801393650001401411650000901425650002301434700002201457700002101479700002001500700002601520700002301546773008701569856009001656852000901746655001201755IND60090304620221121055102.0141102e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009030462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.12.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarkin, Damien G.10aSilk fibroin in ocular tissue reconstruction  ap. 2445-2458.  aThe silk structural protein fibroin displays potential for use in tissue engineering. We present here our opinion of its value as a biomaterial for reconstructing tissues of clinical significance within the human eye. We review the strengths and weaknesses of using fibroin in those parts of the eye that we believe are most amenable to cellular reconstruction, namely the corneoscleral limbus, corneal stroma, corneal endothelium and outer blood-retinal barrier (Ruyschâs complex). In these areas we find that by employing the range of manufacturing products afforded by fibroin, relevant structural assemblies can be made for cells expanded ex vivo. Significant questions now need to be answered concerning the effect of this biomaterial on the phenotype of key cell types and the biocompatibility of fibroin within the eye. We conclude that fibroinâs strength, structural versatility and potential for modification, combined with the relative simplicity of associated manufacturing processes, make fibroin a worthy candidate for further exploration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acornea 3aendothelium 3ahumans 3amanufacturing 3aphenotype 3asilk 3atissue engineering1 aGeorge, Karina A.1 aMadden, Peter W.1 aSchwab, Ivan R.1 aHutmacher, Dietmar W.1 aChirila, Traian V.0 tBiomaterials.g2011 Apr., v. 32, no. 10 p.2445-2458dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.12.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01655naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245011700165300001800282520075600300592002801056650002301084650001001107650000901117700001801126700002101144773012901165856007401294852000901368655001201377IND60656665320221121040733.0190814e20130926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065666532DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay40533h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharlton, Deborah T.10aEvaluation of the multimetal deposition process for fingermark enhancement in simulated operational environments  ap. 5411-5417.  aMultimetal deposition is a fingermark development process that has been adapted from colloidal gold labelling used for biological applications.

This paper focuses on exploring whether multimetal deposition continues to be effective when the cling film surface is exposed to simulated operational conditions including exposure to drugs contamination, immersion in water and physical distortion. The results indicate that multimetal deposition continues to develop fingermarks after such exposure and there are potential benefits in implementing the process more widely.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3adrugs 3agold1 aBleay, S.

However, although great efforts have been made, molecular ferroelectrics with three-dimensional (3D) perovskite structures are still rare. So far, reported perovskite-like molecular ferroelectrics are basically one- or two-dimensional, significantly deviating from the inorganic perovskite ferroelectrics. Thus, their ferroelectric properties have to be greatly improved to meet the requirements of practical applications. Here, we report a 3D molecular perovskite ferroelectric: (3-ammoniopyrrolidinium)RbBrâ [(AP)RbBrâ], with a high Curie temperature (Tc = 440 K) beyond that of BaTiOâ. To the best of our knowledge, such above-room-temperature ferroelectricity in the 3D molecular perovskite compound is unprecedented. Furthermore, (AP)RbBrâ has great potential for applications due to its high thermal stability, ultrafast polarization reversal (greater than 20 kHz), and fascinating multiaxial characteristic. This finding opens a new avenue to the design and controllable synthesis of molecular ferroelectric perovskites, where the metal ion, halogen ion, and organic cation can be easily tuned.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aLiu, Zhi-Bo1 aTang, Yuan-Yuan1 aLi, Peng-Fei1 aMa, Rong-Wei1 aWei, Ru-Yuan1 aZhang, Yi1 aYou, Yu-Meng1 aYe, Heng-Yun1 aXiong, Ren-Gen0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Mar. 22, v. 139, no. 11 p.3954-3957dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b004923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245008700216300001600303520128700319592002801606650002201634650001401656650001101670650001601681653003501697653003701732653002001769653002401789653002501813653001601838700001901854700002301873700002501896773009701921856008502018852000902103655001202112IND60560547020221116230236.0180831e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056054702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2016.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell Ferguson, Tom1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8997-553812aA PIV investigation of OWC operation in regular, polychromatic and irregular waves  ap. 143-155.  aModel scale testing plays an essential role in the development and evaluation of wave energy converters and is generally performed in either regular or irregular waves. A less frequently used intermediate wave type is a polychromatic wave which has properties of both. This paper presents methodology for data processing and results from experiments in all three wave types using PIV to capture the velocity fields in and around an oscillating water column. Two methods for the merging of data in the time domain from multiple runs are presented for data sources with high and low sampling rates.The operation of the OWC in regular, polychromatic and irregular waves was compared using a novel application of normalised histograms and revealed numerous differences including the frequency and size of vortices. A linear relationship was identified between total kinetic energy and energy contained within vortices in the irregular wave. Polychromatic waves successfully represented the power output of the device in irregular waves but more investigation is required into whether they can represent the impact of vortices on device operation. The techniques developed enable evaluation of WEC design changes using PIV in the time domain, and therefore in a more realistic sea state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conversion 3aequations 3amodels 3awater power 0aOscillating water column (OWC) 0aParticle image velocimetry (PIV) 0aIrregular waves 0aPolychromatic waves 0aTime-series analysis 0aWave energy1 aPenesis, Irene1 aMacfarlane, Gregor1 aFleming, Alq(Alan),0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Apr., v. 103 p.143-155dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001100197245009600208300001800304506007600322520092500398592002801323506003701351650001601388650001501404650001101419650001601430650001301446650001901459650001401478700001701492700001401509700001601523700003101539700001801570700001401588773008701602856009001689852000901779655001201788IND60090304820221207134417.0141102e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009030482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.12.0312doi7 aPMC30387832pmcid7 a212327872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xi10aEnhancement of cell recognition in vitro by dual-ligand cancer targeting gold nanoparticles  ap. 2540-2545.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA dual-ligand gold nanoparticle (DLGNP) was designed and synthesized to explore the therapeutic benefits of multivalent interactions between gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and cancer cells. DLGNP was tested on human epidermal cancer cells (KB), which had high expression of folate receptor. The cellular uptake of DLGNP was increased by 3.9 and 12.7 folds compared with GNP-folate or GNP-glucose. The enhanced cell recognition was due to multivalent interactions between both ligands on GNPs and cancer cells as shown by the ligand competition experiments. Furthermore, the multivalent interactions increased contrast between cells with high and low expression of folate receptors. The enhanced cell recognition enabled DLGNP to kill KB cells under X-ray irradiation at a dose that was safe to folate receptor low-expression (such as normal) cells. Thus DLGNP has the potential to be a cancer-specific nano-theranostic agent.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-radiation 3afolic acid 3ahumans 3airradiation 3ananogold 3aneoplasm cells 3areceptors1 aZhou, Hongyu1 aYang, Lei1 aDu, Guoqing1 aPai-Panandiker, Atmaram S.1 aHuang, Xuefei1 aYan, Bing0 tBiomaterials.g2011 Apr., v. 32, no. 10 p.2540-2545dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03534naa a2200889 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245011400177520142100291592002801712650002001740650001801760650002801778650001801806650001201824650001501836650002601851650002201877650001901899650001901918653000801937653002101945653001001966653001401976653001801990653001002008653001102018653001002029653000802039653000902047653001102056653000802067653000802075653001202083653000702095653000802102653000902110653000902119653001002128653000902138653000902147653000802156653000902164653000802173653001202181653000802193653001202201653000702213653001102220653001102231653001102242653000802253653000802261653000902269653000802278653000902286653000902295653000902304653000802313653000802321653000802329653000902337653000702346653000802353653000902361700002102370700002402391700002202415773009802437856008802535852000902623655001202632IND60758319420221122135413.0211219e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075831942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2021.1130392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWojtaczka, Patrycja14aThe GH3 amidosynthetases family and their role in metabolic crosstalk modulation of plant signaling compounds  aThe Gretchen Hagen 3 (GH3) genes encoding proteins belonging to the ANL superfamily are widespread in the plant kingdom. The ANL superfamily consists of three groups of adenylating enzymes: aryl- and acyl-CoA synthetases, firefly luciferase, and amino acid-activating adenylation domains of the nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). GH3s are cytosolic, acidic amidosynthetases of the firefly luciferase group that conjugate auxins, jasmonates, and benzoate derivatives to a wide group of amino acids. In contrast to auxins, which amide conjugates mainly serve as a storage pool of inactive phytohormone or are involved in the hormone degradation process, conjugation of jasmonic acid (JA) results in biologically active phytohormone jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile). Moreover, GH3s modulate salicylic acid (SA) concentration by conjugation of its precursor, isochorismate. GH3s, as regulators of the phytohormone level, are crucial for normal plant development as well as plant defense response to different abiotic and biotic stress factors. Surprisingly, recent studies indicate that FIN219/JAR1/GH3.11, one of the GH3 proteins, may act not only as an enzyme but is also able to interact with tau-class glutathione S-transferase (GSTU) and constitutive photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) proteins and regulate light and stress signaling pathways. The aim of this work is to summarize our current knowledge of the GH3 family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacyl coenzyme A 3abiotic stress 3aglutathione transferase 3ajasmonic acid 3aligases 3aluciferase 3anonribosomal peptides 3aplant development 3aplant hormones 3asalicylic acid 0aGH3 0aAmide conjugates 0aAuxin 0aJasmonate 0aPhytohormones 0a2,4-D 0a2,4-DB 0a4-HBA 0aABA 0aAIEP 0aAMPCPP 0aANL 0aARF 0aAux/IAA 0aBA 0aCBF 0aCOP1 0aDFL1 0aDH-JA 0aFIP1 0aGDG1 0aGH3 0aGSTU 0aIAA 0aIAA-Asp 0aIBA 0aICA-Cys 0aJA 0aJA-Ile 0aJA-Leu 0aJA-Val 0aJAR 0aLEA 0aMeJA 0aNAA 0aNPR1 0aNRPS 0aOPDA 0ap4A 0aPAA 0aPPi 0aPR-1 0aSA 0aSAR 0aSAUR1 aCiarkowska, Anna1 aStarzynska, Ewelina1 aOstrowski, Maciej0 tPhytochemistry.g2022 Feb., v. 194 p.113039-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2021.1130393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006200145245016500207300001600372500002000388520148000408592002801888596005701916596005501973650001702028650002202045650002902067650001802096650002302114650001602137650000902153650001702162650001702179650001502196650002802211650001702239700002802256700001902284700001702303700004102320773012902361856008002490852000902570655001202579IND60768675620221119105239.0220226e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076867562DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.154912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShafiee, Roxana T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5605-119810aProteomic response of the marine ammoniaâoxidising archaeon Nitrosopumilus maritimus to iron limitation reveals strategies to compensate for nutrient scarcity  ap. 835-849.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDissolved iron (Fe) is vanishingly low in the oceans, with ecological success conferred to microorganisms that can restructure their biochemistry to maintain high growth rates during Fe scarcity. Chemolithoautotrophic ammoniaâoxidising archaea (AOA) are highly abundant in the oceans, constituting ~30% of cells below the photic zone. Here we examine the proteomic response of the AOA isolate Nitrosopumilus maritimus to growthâlimiting Fe concentrations. Under Fe limitation, we observed a significant reduction in the intensity of Feâdense ferredoxins associated with respiratory complex I whilst complex III and IV proteins with more central roles in the electron transport chain remain unchanged. We concomitantly observed an increase in the intensity of Feâfree functional alternatives such as flavodoxin and plastocyanin, thioredoxin and alkyl hydroperoxide which are known to mediate electron transport and reactive oxygen species detoxification, respectively. Under Fe limitation, we found a marked increase in the intensity of the ABC phosphonate transport system (Phn), highlighting an intriguing link between Fe and P cycling in N. maritimus. We hypothesise that an elevated uptake of exogenous phosphonates under Fe limitation may either supplement N. maritimus' endogenous methylphosphonate biosynthesis pathway â which requires Fe â or enhance the production of phosphonateâcontaining exopolysaccharides known to efficiently bind environmental Fe.  aPublisher supplied data  aERCâ2015âCOGâ681746cEuropean Research council  aNE/L002612/1cNatural Environment Research Council 3abiosynthesis 3aelectron transfer 3aelectron transport chain 3aeuphotic zone 3aexopolysaccharides 3aferredoxins 3airon 3aphosphonates 3aplastocyanin 3aproteomics 3areactive oxygen species 3athioredoxins1 aSnow, Joseph T.,d1941-1 aHester, Svenja1 aZhang, Qiong1 aRickaby, R.

Many studies have evaluated different egg quality attributes subjected to various storage conditions. The present work aimed to study the influence of three environmental parameters (temperature, storage time and relative humidity) on egg quality indicators. Through application of response surface methodology, it was verified that the temperature is the most important environmental factor affecting egg quality attributes followed by the storage time and relative humidity, respectively. Principal Component Analysis showed that most quality indexes are similar except for the eggshell percentage that represents an exterior quality indicator. An artificial neural network composed by one hidden layer and four neurons provided accurate predictions of the Yolk index and is a promising tool to evaluate egg quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aegg quality 3aegg shell 3aenvironmental factors 3aneural networks 3aprincipal component analysis 3arelative humidity 3aresponse surface methodology 3astorage time 3atemperature 0aEggs freshness 0aHaugh unit 0aYolk index 0aInterior quality 0aExterior quality1 aZampar, Aline1 aGalvÃ£o, Alessandro Cazonatto1 ada Silva Robazza, Weber1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7995-87771 aBoiago, Marcel Manente0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Aug., v. 148 p.111720-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1117203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245006700166300001400233520134500247592002801592650002001620650002501640650002001665650001301685650001801698650001201716650002301728650002301751653002701774653002801801653001501829653001801844653001201862653001501874700002501889773012001914856007802034852000902112655001202121IND60580745620221121160945.0180620e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058074562DNAL7 a10.1515/ata-2017-00132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoÅodziej, Sabina14aThe Influence of Physical Fatigue on Work on a Production Line  ap. 63-68.  aThe purpose of this study is to determine the factors having impacts on the physical fatigue of employees and to analyse its influence on work on a production line. In order to carry out these objectives, a comprehensive research was conducted in a medium enterprise producing processed fruit and vegetable products. Air temperature and humidity tests, employee survey, production line productivity measurements, and other observations were performed. Large variations in temperature and humidity were observed during the analysed period. Analysing the survey results, attention was paid to the declared length of sleeping of employees after each shift, the time when they feel fatigue and the factors that, according to respondents, have the greatest impact on the work performed. Attempts were made to determine the wellbeing of employees and to indicate the disturbing symptoms. Special attention was paid to the negative phenomena felt by respondents. The main factors affecting the physical fatigue of employees were identified and described. We sought to explain the impacts of physical fatigue on work on the production line. Improvements, which should help to reduce fatigue and improve working conditions, have been proposed. The analysis provided interesting information that could be used in various food manufacturing companies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abusiness enterprises 3ahuman resources 3ahumidity 3amanufacturing 3asurveys 3avegetable products 3aworking conditions 0aproduction engineering 0aproduction organisation 0aergonomics 0afood industry 0afatigue 0ashift work1 aLigarski, Mariusz J.0 tActa technologica agriculturae.g2017 Sept. 1, v. 20, no. 3 p.63-68dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:6159x1338-52677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ata-2017-00133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009600169300001600265520135600281592002801637650002001665650001801685650001301703650002201716650002901738650001301767653001301780653001701793653001501810653001301825700001501838773009701853856008501950852000902035655001202044IND60560547220221116230648.0180831e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056054722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2016.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinsey, Thomas10aImpact of channel blockage on the performance of axial and cross-flow hydrokinetic turbines  ap. 239-254.  aThis work investigates the effect of channel blockage on the performance of axial and cross-flow turbines with the objective of filling a gap in the literature on suitable blockage corrections for cross-flow turbines. Our investigation is based on 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations at high Reynolds number. Blockage corrections are proposed for axial and cross-flow hydrokinetic turbines. These corrections allow the estimation of the drag, power and tip speed ratio of the theoretically unconfined turbine, based on results of the confined turbine. It is found that a blockage correction based on a simple linear momentum actuator disk theory, is quite adequate when applied to both axial and low-solidity cross-flow turbines. Results suggest that for the 3-bladed (high-solidity) cross-flow turbine, this method slightly underpredicts the correction factor, more so for drag than for power. Normalizing with the bypass flow velocity improves the drag correction. For both technologies, the power extracted is found to be almost insensitive to blockage when dynamic stall is present. To discriminate between lateral and vertical confinement is usually not required, the performance being mostly dependent on the blockage ratio (ratio of turbine and channel frontal areas) unless the confinement asymmetry differs by more than a factor of 3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3ahydrodynamics 3amomentum 3apreferential flow 3arenewable energy sources 3aturbines 0aBlockage 0aHydrokinetic 0aCross-flow 0aTurbines1 aDumas, Guy0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Apr., v. 103 p.239-254dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245006800210300001600278520152700294592002801821650001301849650001301862650001201875650001701887650001901904650001601923650002001939650002901959650001701988650001702005650001602022650001202038650001102050650002102061650001402082650001102096650001302107650001502120650001002135651001202145651000902157651001002166653001202176653001602188700001502204700001902219700001802238773010102256856008802357852000902445655001202454IND60581198220221119121341.0180830e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058119822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcMahon, P.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7452-237910aMethane in aquifers used for public supply in the United States  ap. 337-347.  aIn 2013 to 2015, 833 public supply wells in 15 Principal aquifers in the U.S. were sampled to identify which aquifers contained high methane concentrations (>1Â mg/L) and determine the geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical conditions associated with high concentrations. This study represents the first national assessment of methane in aquifers used for public supply in the U.S. and, as such, advances the understanding of the occurrence and distribution of methane in groundwater nationally. Methane concentrations >1 andÂ >Â 10Â mg/L occurred in 6.7 and 1.1% of the samples, respectively. Most high concentrations occurred in aquifers in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain regions and upper Midwest. High methane concentrations were most commonly associated with Tertiary and younger aquifer sediments, old groundwater (>60 years), and concentrations of oxygen, nitrate-N, and sulfate <0.5Â mg/L. Concentrations of methane were also positively correlated (pÂ <Â 0.05) with dissolved organic carbon and ammonium. Case studies in Florida, Texas, and Iowa were used to explore how regional context from this data set could aid our understanding of local occurrences of methane in groundwater. Regional data for methane, Br/Cl ratios, sulfate, and other parameters helped identify mixing processes involving end members such as wastewater effluent-impacted groundwater, saline formation water, and pore water in glacial till that contributed methane to groundwater in some cases and supported methane oxidation in others.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aaquifers 3abromine 3acase studies 3acoastal plains 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3adissolved organic carbon 3ageochemistry 3aglacial till 3agroundwater 3amethane 3amixing 3anitrate nitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asulfates 3awastewater 3awells 3aFlorida 3aIowa 3aTexas 0aMethane 0aGroundwater1 aBelitz, K.1 aBarlow, J.R.B.1 aJurgens, B.C.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2017 Sept., v. 84 p.337-347dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009700174300001300271520115200284592002801436650002301464650001101487650001001498650003801508650002101546650001701567650001101584650001801595650000901613650002601622650001201648650002501660653002301685653002701708653001901735653002001754700002501774700003001799700002701829700002901856700006301885700002101948700002701969700002001996773011702016856008502133852000902218655001202227IND60602302520221121003627.0180711e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060230252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2015.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKueakhai, Pornanan10aSaposin-like protein 2 has an immunodiagnostic potential for detecting Fasciolosis gigantica  ap. 8-13.  aSaposin-like protein 2 (SAP-2) plays an important role in the digestive process of Fasciola gigantica (Fg). It is one of the major proteins synthesized by the caecal epithelial cells and released into fluke's excretionâsecretion. Therefore, FgSAP-2 is a plausible target for detecting fasciolosis. A polyclonal antibody (PoAb) against recombinant FgSAP-2 was produced by immunizing rabbits with the recombinant protein (rFgSAP-2), and used in sandwich ELISA assay to detect the circulating FgSAP-2 in sera of mice experimentally infected with F. gigantica metacercariae. The assay could detect rFgSAP-2 and the native FgSAP-2 in the excretoryâsecretory (ES) and whole body (WB) fractions of adult F. gigantica at the concentrations as low as 38âpg/ml, 24âng/ml, and 102âng/ml, respectively. As well, the sera from mice experimentally infected with F. gigantica were tested positive by this sandwich ELISA, which exhibited sensitivity, specificity, false positive rate, false negative rate and accuracy at 99.99, 98.67, 1.33, 0.01 and 99.32%, respectively.

Results showed that a high level of E. coli populations, antibiotic contamination in supplied water, and additional antibiotics used, such as neomycin (NEO) or colistin (CLT), were observed in OSF. Similar ARE resistance to five antibiotics, including NEO, was observed in the water source, dung, and wastewater/sludge but were different from those of CLT. An increased occurrence of ARE was found in the sludge of anaerobic digestion (AD) and the waste stabilisation pond (WSP), but they were not well correlated with their residual antibiotic concentrations. CLT administration yielded higher ARE prevalence in pig excreta and wastewater in OSF, but its absence in CSF also resulted in ARE occurrence with increased minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels in the anaerobic digester/waste stabilisation ponds. This study revealed that ARE prevalence and MIC levels of CLT could be developed during the wastewater treatment process in the pig farm, although none of the AREs were found in the original excreta/wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3aantibiotic residues 3aantibiotic resistance 3acolistin 3aenvironment 3afarms 3afeces 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aneomycin 3asludge 3aswine 3awaste lagoons 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aAntibiotics residues 0aAntimicrobial resistance 0aLivestock 0aWastewater1 aChan, Rathborey1 aChiemchaisri, Wilai1 aChiemchaisri, Chart0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Aug. 10, v. 781 p.146743-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1467433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245012300165300001800288520110100306592002801407650001601435650001301451650001201464650001301476650001501489650001301504700002101517700001801538700001901556700002501575773013201600856007801732852000901810655001201819IND60565361920221122061844.0170323e20170322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056536192DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b005682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntonello, Sabrina10aElectrocrystallization of Monolayer-Protected Gold Clusters: Opening the Door to Quality, Quantity, and New Structures  ap. 4168-4174.  aThiolate-protected metal clusters are materials of ever-growing importance in fundamental and applied research. Knowledge of their single-crystal X-ray structures has been instrumental to enable advanced molecular understanding of their intriguing properties. So far, however, a general, reliable, chemically clean approach to prepare single crystals suitable for accurate crystallographic analysis was missing. Here we show that single crystals of thiolate-protected clusters can be grown in large quantity and very high quality by electrocrystallization. This method relies on the fact that charged clusters display a higher solubility in polar solvents than their neutral counterparts. Nucleation of the electrogenerated insoluble clusters directly onto the electrode surface eventually leads to the formation of a dense forest of millimeter-long single crystals. Electrocrystallization of three known Auââ(SR)âââ° clusters is described. A new cluster, Auââ(S-nCâHââ)ââ, was also prepared and found to crystallize by forming bundles of millimeter-long Auââ polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acrystals 3aforests 3apolymers 3asolubility 3asolvents1 aDainese, Tiziano1 aPan, Fangfang1 aRissanen, Kari1 aMaran, F.q(Flavio),0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Mar. 22, v. 139, no. 11 p.4168-4174dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b005683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245008300211300001600294520143300310592002801743650001401771650002201785650002901807650001101836650001801847650001901865650002001884650002001904700001801924773012201942856008202064852000902146655001202155IND60682679120221119195059.0200130e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068267912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11120-019-00670-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Katherine A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6060-829410aCoupling biology to synthetic nanomaterials for semi-artificial photosynthesis  ap. 193-203.  aBiohybrid artificial photosynthesis aims to combine the advantages of biological specificity with a range of syntheticÂ nanomaterials to create innovative semi-synthetic systems for solar-to-chemical conversion. Biological systems utilize highly efficient molecular catalysts for reductionâoxidation reactions. They can operate with minimal overpotentials while selectively channeling reductant energy into specific transformation chemistries and product forming pathways. Nanomaterials can be synthesized to have efficient light-absorption capacity and tuneability of charge separation by manipulation of surface chemistries and bulk compositions. These complementary aspects have been combined in a variety of ways, for example, where biological light-harvesting complexes function as antenna for nanoparticle catalysts or where nanoparticles function as light capture, charge separation components for coupling to chemical conversion by redox enzymes and whole cells. The synthetic diversity that is possible with biohybrids is still being explored. The progress arising from creative approaches is generating new model systems to inspire scale-up technologies and generate understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that control energy conversion at the molecular scale. These efforts are leading to discoveries of essential design principles that can enable the development of scalable artificial photosynthesis systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aenergy conversion 3alight harvesting complex 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aphotosynthesis 3aredox reactions 3areducing agents1 aKing, Paul W.0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2020 Feb., v. 143, no. 2 p.193-203dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32702x0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-019-00670-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012800163520139300291592002801684650001501712650001601727650002201743650001201765650000801777650001901785650001001804650001501814650001701829650001101846650000901857650001901866650002001885653001601905653000801921653001801929653001301947653001701960700001801977700001601995700001702011700001502028700001802043700001802061700005702079700001102136773012302147856008102270852000902351655001202360IND60737473620221120052848.0211030e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073747362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1117232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shuai10aUnraveling the mystery of âbask in daytime and dewed at nightâ technique in doubanjiang (broad bean paste) fermentation  aâBask in daytime and dewed at nightâ technique is traditionally used in doubanjiang fermentation, however, the underlying mechanism behind this technique is still unrevealed. This study aimed to elaborate the roles of three key indexes in this technique, that are air, sunlight, and mash turnover, on doubanjiang quality through the design of doubanjiang fermentation. The results showed that the exposure to air or sunlight was beneficial for doubanjiang to yield reddish-brown luster color, less acidity and balanced flavor. On the contrary, blocking of air and sunlight could accumulate higher acidity (4.75Â Â±Â 0.01Â g/100gdw), amino nitrogen (2.08Â Â±Â 0.07Â g/100gdw), alcohols (36.9Â g/kg) and esters (26.9Â g/kg). Regular mash turnover was mainly involved in making different mash layers exposure to air or sunlight equally through homogenizing mash layers. Different conditions also have been suggested to affect the microbiota dynamics by amplicon sequencing and RT-qPCR. Based on RDA analysis, Pediococcus, Meyerozyma, Bacillus and Zygosaccharomyces were predicted to be related to the changes of physicochemical properties or volatile compounds in different conditions, and their function was validated by simulated fermentation. This study would unravel the underlying scientific meaning of âbask in daytime and dewed at nightâ technique in doubanjiang fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeyerozyma 3aPediococcus 3aZygosaccharomyces 3aacidity 3aair 3aamino nitrogen 3acolor 3afaba beans 3afermentation 3aflavor 3amash 3amicroorganisms 3asolar radiation 0aDoubanjiang 0aAir 0aMash turnover 0aSunlight 0aFermentation1 aNiu, Chengtuo1 aSuo, Jingyi1 aZan, Youlong1 aWei, Yuehu1 aZheng, Feiyun1 aLiu, Chunfeng1 aWang, Jinjing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3031-95251 aLi, Qi0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Sept., v. 149 p.111723-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1117233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245017600162300001800338520167700356592002802033650001502061650002302076650002202099650001302121650001802134650001602152650001002168650003202178650002002210650002302230650001402253650002302267650001602290650001502306650001402321650001802335650001102353650001202364650001102376650002002387650002402407650001202431650001202443650001602455700001602471700001802487700001902505700001602524773011002540856008102650852000902731655001202740IND60586702920221122222850.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058670292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-017-1187-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Dashi10aEvaluation of the red alga Gracilaria lemaneiformis and brown alga Sargassum horneri as ingredients in diets for white spotted snapper Lutjanus stellatus Akazaki juveniles  ap. 3211-3219.  aThis study evaluated the red alga Gracilaria lemaneiformis and brown alga Sargassum horneri as ingredients to partially replace fishmeal in diets for white spotted snapper Lutjanus stellatus Akazaki (initial mass 12.0Â Â±Â 0.1Â g). Nine test diets containing 0 (control), 5, 10, 15, and 20% G. lemaneiformis or S. horneri were prepared; each diet was assigned to triplicate groups of fish in a total of 27 floating sea cages (each cage contained 30 fish). After a 60-day feeding trail, significantly lower final body weight, weight gain, and specific growth ratio were found in fish fed 20% G. lemaneiformis diet (PÂ <Â 0.05), whereas the poorest fish growth performance was obtained with the 20% S. horneri diet. Lipid content in muscle of fish fed 20% G. lemaneiformis diet was significantly lower than that of other groups (PÂ <Â 0.05); however, body protein was higher than that in other groups. The lowest lipid and moisture contents in muscle were recorded in fish fed 5 and 15% S. horneri diets, and protein content in whole body of fish fed 20% S. horneri diet was significantly lower than that of control and 5% diets (PÂ <Â 0.05). Activities of pepsin in the stomach and lipase and amylase in the intestine were significantly suppressed in fish fed 20% G. lemaneiformis diet compared with that of control (PÂ <Â 0.05). The lowest pepsin activity in stomach and lipase activity in intestine were observed in fish fed 20% S. horneri diet. Based on a quadratic regression model of weight gain, the results suggested that the maximum incorporation of G. lemaneiformis and S. horneri in diets should be 16.44 and 15%, respectively, for juvenile white spotted snapper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGracilaria 3aLutjanus stellatus 3aSargassum horneri 3aamylases 3aanimal growth 3abody weight 3acages 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aenzyme activity 3aexperimental diets 3afish meal 3agrowth performance 3aingredients 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3alipid content 3alipids 3amuscles 3apepsin 3aprotein content 3aregression analysis 3asnapper 3astomach 3aweight gain1 aWen, Xiaobo1 aLi, Shengkang1 aXuan, Xiongzhi1 aLi, Yuanyou0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2017 Dec., v. 29, no. 6 p.3211-3219dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-017-1187-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245016100159300001600320500002000336520141800356592002801774596005901802596005901861650001901920650000901939650001601948650001301964650001501977650001001992650002202002650000902024650001202033650001602045650001802061650001402079650002202093650001702115650001202132650001602144650001802160650001302178651001002191700005502201700005902256700001902315700005202334700005602386700005602442773012902498856008002627852000902707655001202716IND60768676020221119104958.0220226e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076867602DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.158482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lin10aAnaerobic methane oxidation linked to Fe(III) reduction in a Candidatus Methanoperedensâenriched consortium from the cold Zoige wetland at Tibetan Plateau  ap. 614-625.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAnaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is a microbial process degrading ample methane in anoxic environments, and Ca. Methanoperedens mediated nitrateâ or metalâreduction linked AOM is believed important in freshwater systems. This work, via 16S rRNA gene diversity survey and 16S rRNA quantification, found abundant Ca. Methanoperedens along with iron in the cold Zoige wetland at Tibetan Plateau. The wetland soil microcosm performed Fe(III) reduction, rather than nitrateâ nor sulphateâreduction, coupled methane oxidation (3.87âÎ¼molâdâ»Â¹) with 32.33âÎ¼mol Fe(II) accumulation per day at 18Â°C, but not at 30Â°C. A metagenomeâassembled genome (MAG) recovered from the microcosm exhibits ~74% average nucleotide identity with the reported Ca. Methanoperedens spp. that perform Fe(III) reduction linked AOM, thus a novel species Ca. Methanoperedens psychrophilus was proposed. Ca. M. psychrophilus contains the whole suite of COâ reductive methanogenic genes presumably involving in AOM via a reverse direction, and comparative genome analysis revealed its unique gene categories: the multiâheme clusters (MHCs) cytochromes, the Sâlayer proteins highly homologous to those recovered from lower temperature environments and type IV pili, those could confer Ca. M. psychrophilus of cold adaptability. Therefore, this work reports the first methanotroph implementing AOM in an alpine wetland.  aPublisher supplied data  a32070061cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a91751203cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3acarbon dioxide 3acold 3acytochromes 3afimbriae 3afreshwater 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3airon 3amethane 3amethanogens 3amethanotrophs 3aoxidation 3asequence analysis 3asoil ecology 3asurveys 3atemperature 3awetland soils 3awetlands 3aChina1 aLi, Lingyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2781-57071 aZhang, Shengjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6988-27911 aZhang, Wenting1 aXue, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5990-44481 aWang, Yanfen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5666-92891 aDong, Xiuzhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6926-54590 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2022 Feb., v. 24, no. 2 p.614-625dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.158483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245016600174300001600340500001500356520137400371592002801745650001601773650001201789650001201801650002201813650002201835650001901857650001501876650001301891650002301904650003901927653004601966653001502012653002502027653005002052653003602102653001702138700002402155700001902179700002202198700002502220773011102245856008602356852000902442655001202451IND60530598920221122162441.0180905e20160415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053059892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.12.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrizzolari, Andrea10aEvaluation of the antioxidant activity and capacity of some natural N6-substituted adenine derivatives (cytokinins) by fluorimetric and spectrophotometric assays  ap. 164-168.  a2019-12-06  aFour natural Nâ¶-substituted adenine derivatives (cytokinins) were evaluated for the first time in vitro for they antioxidant capacity by using fluorimetric and spectrophotometric assays, i.e., the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), trolox equivalence antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and the 2-deoxyribose degradation (2-DRA) assays. The results from the TEAC assay show that only Nâ¶-(4-hydroxybenzyl)adenine (p-topolin) shows an electron transfer capacity due to the presence of a phenolic moiety in the Nâ¶-position. The results from the ORAC test show that the antioxidant activity of Nâ¶-furfuryladenine (kinetin, K) is the highest up to a concentration of 1Î¼M, whereas at concentrations higher than 1Î¼M p-topolin is the most efficient antioxidant. Analysis of the kinetic data suggests that, compared to the other cytokinins, more sites of the molecular structure of p-topolin are available for the quenching of peroxyl radicals. The hydroxyl radical scavenger ability, as measured by the 2-DRA assay, showed that all tested cytokinins react in this test and that Nâ¶-(ÎÂ²-isopentenyl)adenine is slightly more potent, probably because of the allylic methylene group present in the Nâ¶-isopentenyl moiety. Our data suggest that a part of the biological activity of the evaluated cytokinins is likely to be related to an intrinsic antioxidant capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorometry 3akinetin 3aadenine 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aelectron transfer 3achromatography 3acytokinins 3akinetics 3achemical structure 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 0aOxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) 0aCytokinins 0aAntioxidant activity 0aTrolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) 0a2-Deoxyribose degradation assay 0aantioxidants1 aMarinello, Cristina1 aCarini, Marina1 aSantaniello, Enzo1 aBiondi, Pier Antonio0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 1019 p.164-168dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.12.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003400140245010200174300001800276520124100294592002801535650002501563650001601588650001901604650001701623650001601640650001501656650002301671650001601694650001601710700002701726700003001753773012801783856007401911852000901985655001201994IND60656665920221120060043.0190814e20130725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065666592DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay40541a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaballero-DÃ­az, EncarnaciÃ³n10aNanodiamonds assisted-cloud point extraction for the determination of fluoranthene in river water  ap. 3864-3871.  aThe classic cloud point extraction has been modified by the inclusion of nanodiamonds and applied to the extractionâpreconcentration of fluoranthene from river water. The effects of ionic strength and surfactant concentration, process temperature, incubation time, nanoparticle type and concentration and elution conditions were investigated in depth. The effect of the carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) on the performance of the conventional cloud point scheme enabled the formation of two phases in a relatively short time and without temperature requirements. Experiments carried out under optimized conditions but in absence of nanoparticles were unsuccessful in terms of phase separation and consequently, the nanoparticles are indispensable to the analytical performance. The work developed here, confirms the versatility of the CNPs to be introduced in diverse sample treatment processes, resulting very interesting to investigate in each case their impact on the performance of the process. The application of the proposed method followed by fluorimetric detection enabled the determination of fluoranthene in spiked river water providing a good relative standard deviation (RSD) (6.6%, n = 3) and acceptable recovery values (>65%).  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanoparticles 3afluorometry 3aionic strength 3ananodiamonds 3ariver water 3aseparation 3astandard deviation 3asurfactants 3atemperature1 aSimonet, BartolomÃ© M.1 aValcÃ¡rcel Cases, Miguel,0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 July 25, v. 5, no. 16 p.3864-3871dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay40541a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003300140245014100173300001800314520156300332592002801895650002001923650001701943650001101960650002101971650001401992650001802006650004602024650004302070650002802113650000902141650001302150650001502163650001202178650002602190650001302216650002302229650004402252700002202296700002402318773012802342856007402470852000902544655001202553IND60656666020221120043537.0190814e20130613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065666602DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay40542g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandiyan, Punniyavel Jeyavel12aA high throughput analysis of boronic acids using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry  ap. 3386-3394.  aAn ultra high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry method was developed for the analysis of a broad range of boronic acids present in industrial samples. A set of 7 boronic acids having different functional groups was successfully separated on an Acquity BEH C18 column using 10 mM ammonium acetate and acetonitrile as the mobile phase. The proposed method has excellent potential for high-throughput analysis as it enjoys the advantage of one minute run time without using any sample pretreatment or pre-derivatization which has been mandatorily followed during boronic acid analysis to avoid dehydration. The influence of specific instrument parameters of UPLC-MS was examined and an optimized condition has been proposed for the identification of boronic acids and to reduce the predominant formation of boroxine, solvent adduct and dimer ions which normally complicate the analysis of boronic acids. The proposed method was further validated by analyzing a wide range of 20 boronic acids having different functional groups. The estimated recovery values of the boronic acids were ranged from 97.1 to 105.7%, and precision, expressed as relative standard deviation, was below 2.0% and the linearity RÂ² was 0.98 based on UV response. This method provides LOD of 0.1 Î¼g and LOQ of 1.0 Î¼g for the majority of boronic acids and was successfully applied for the quantitative analysis of boronic acids in industrial applications such as reaction monitoring samples from Suzuki coupling, arylation of amines and phenols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuzuki reaction 3aacetonitrile 3aamines 3aammonium acetate 3aarylation 3aboronic acids 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindustrial applications 3aions 3amoieties 3amonitoring 3aphenols 3aquantitative analysis 3asolvents 3astandard deviation 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aAppadurai, Ramesh1 aRamesh, Subbaratnam0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 June 13, v. 5, no. 13 p.3386-3394dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay40542g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012500168300001800293520113200311592002801443650001801471650000901489650001701498650001101515650001901526650003801545650001501583650004301598650001701641650006601658650001701724650001501741650001801756650002001774650001801794650002101812650001701833700002101850700002401871700002401895700001701919700002301936700002301959700003501982700001902017700002302036700002402059773011002083856008102193852000902274655001202283IND60586703120221122232839.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058670312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-017-1193-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLauceri, Rosaria10aCoupling a bio-accumulator organism and MALDI-TOF MS: an early warning detection system for microcystins in water bodies  ap. 2979-2988.  aMicrocystins produced by freshwater cyanobacteria pose serious threats to human health and are a growing problem in drinking water supplies worldwide. Toxin detection and identification in water reservoirs when cyanobacterial density is still low is a key step to predict harmful algal blooms and to allow the safe use of the resource. For this purpose, developing sensitive and rapid methods of analysis is crucial. Adopting a strategy that couples the use of a filter-feeder organism (Unio elongatulus, Pfeiffer 1825 (Bivalvia: Unionidae)) with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationâtime of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technology, effective microcystin detection was achieved. The performances of MALDI-TOF MS, high-liquid-performance chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) test were compared. The results obtained in this study suggest that the exploitation of an efficient bio-accumulator organism, coupled with a rapid and sensitive analytical method, can be a very useful strategy in monitoring programs for early and prompt risk management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aUnio 3aalgal blooms 3adiodes 3adrinking water 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afreshwater 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman health 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amicrocystins 3amonitoring 3arapid methods 3arisk management 3asurface water 3awater reservoirs 3awater supply1 aAustoni, Martina1 aCaviglia, Francesca1 aKamburska, Lyudmila1 aLami, Andrea1 aMorabito, Giuseppe1 aPflueger, Valentin1 aBenavides, Ana Margarita Silva1 aTonolla, Mauro1 aTorzillo, Giuseppe1 aRiccardi, Nicoletta0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2017 Dec., v. 29, no. 6 p.2979-2988dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-017-1193-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245007700210500002200287520113900309592002801448650001301476650001301489650001101502650001301513650002801526650001601554651001101570653000901581653000901590653000901599653001401608653001001622653000801632653000901640653001301649653001101662653000901673653001001682653000801692653001801700653002101718653002301739653001101762653000901773700002701782773005401809856008301863852000901946655001201955IND60581198720221119121716.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058119872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2017.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuansah, Emmanuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4532-172410aTowards diversity in genomics: The emergence of neurogenomics in Africa?  aPre-press version  aThere is a high burden of mental and neurological disorders in Africa. Nevertheless, there appears to be an under-representation of African ancestry populations in large-scale genomic studies. Here, we evaluated the extent of under-representation of Africans in neurogenomic studies in the GWAS Catalog. We found 569 neurogenomic studies, of which 88.9% were exclusively focused on people with European ancestry and the remaining 11.1% having African ancestry cases included. In terms of population, only 1.2% of the total populations involved in these 569 GWAS studies were of African descent. Further, most of the individuals in the African ancestry category were identified to be African-Americans/Afro-Caribbeans, highlighting the huge under-representation of homogenous African populations in large-scale neurogenomic studies. Efforts geared at establishing strong collaborative ties with European/American researchers, maintaining freely accessible biobanks and establishing comprehensive African genome data repositories to track African genome variations are critical for propelling neurogenomics/precision medicine in Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfricans 3aancestry 3agenome 3agenomics 3anervous system diseases 3aresearchers 3aAfrica 0aADHD 0aAPOE 0acART 0aCEPH-HGDP 0adbGaP 0aEGA 0aGWAS 0aH3Africa 0aHapMap 0aIEDB 0aLRRK2 0aSNP 0aNeurogenomics 0aPharmacogenomics 0aPrecision medicine 0aAfrica 0aGWAS1 aMcGregor, Nathaniel W.0 tGenomics.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0888-75437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2017.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008100166300001600247520152700263592002801790650000801818650002201826650001101848650001801859650002101877650002201898650001601920650001601936653002901952653002801981653002302009653001702032700002002049700002102069700001702090773009702107856008502204852000902289655001202298IND60560547820221116230117.0180831e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056054782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2016.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, Yu-Shu10aHydrodynamic characteristics of Oscillating Water Column caisson breakwaters  ap. 439-447.  aThis study uses the finite difference software, FLOW-3D, to develop a numerical model to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics for Oscillating Water Column (OWC) caisson breakwaters. The numerical model is verified by a flume channel experiment for the interaction mechanism between air and water. Through the analyses with different incident wave parameters of the OWC caisson breakwaters, the following parameters are evaluated as energy capture efficiency indices: the amplitude magnification (a/a0), the air velocity at the orifice (Vori), the air oscillation pressure (Hp), the hydrodynamic efficiency (Î·h), the energy produced by air for a period (Eair), and the average power produced by the air (Pair). The results show that the optimal dimensionless wavelength ratio (L/lcâ) for the optimal hydrodynamic efficiency (Î·h) is different from the optimal dimensionless wavelength ratio (L/lcâ) for the average power produced by the air (Pair), the amplitude magnification (a/a0), the air velocity at the orifice (Vori), and the air oscillation pressure (Hp). For power generation purpose, this study suggests that the relationship curve between the dimensionless wavelength ratio (L/lcâ) and the average power produced by air (Pair) can be used to determine the optimal range for wave energy capture and to design the optimal size for the OWC caisson breakwaters. Under the incident wave conditions of maximum average power produced by air, the lateral force and the base moment has enlargement phenomenon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3ahydrodynamics 3apower generation 3asimulation models 3awater power 3awavelengths 0aOscillating Water Column 0aHydrodynamic efficiency 0aCaisson breakwater 0aLateral load1 aChung, Chih-Yin1 aHsiao, Shih-Chun1 aWang, Yu-Kai0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Apr., v. 103 p.439-447dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01729naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003000144245005700174500001900231520075600250592002801006650001001034650001401044650001301058650002901071650001801100650002001118650001701138700001801155700002301173773012001196856007801316852000901394655001201403IND60735254820221123044122.0210423e20210412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073525482DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100407512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez, Susana 10aNanoimpact in Plants: Lessons from the Transcriptome  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTranscriptomics studies are available to evaluate the potential toxicity of nanomaterials in plants, and many highlight their effect on stress-responsive genes. However, a comparative analysis of overall expression changes suggests a low impact on the transcriptome. Environmental challenges like pathogens, saline, or drought stress induce stronger transcriptional responses than nanoparticles. Clearly, plants did not have the chance to evolve specific gene regulation in response to novel nanomaterials; but they use common regulatory circuits with other stress responses. A shared effect with abiotic stress is the inhibition of genes for root development and pathogen response. Other works are reviewed here, which also converge on these results.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3apathogens 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3awater stress1 aGala, Michal 1 aÅ½oldÃ¡k, Gabriel 0 tPlants.g2021 Apr. 12, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100407513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03685naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245011700177300001800294520170100312592002802013650000802041650001602049650001602065650002002081650001902101650002002120650002002140650001702160650001102177650001502188650001002203650001802213650001102231650001502242650002502257650001902282650001002301650001702311700002502328700002202353700001902375700001802394700002302412700001902435700001802454700001802472700002202490700002302512700002502535700001902560700002202579700002002601700003102621700001902652700002302671700002102694700002102715700002102736700002102757700002302778773008702801856009002888852000902978655001202987IND60090305620221121055211.0141102e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009030562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriesenbach, Uta10aSecreted Gaussia luciferase as a sensitive reporter gene for in vivo and ex vivo studies of airway gene transfer  ap. 2614-2624.  aThe cationic lipid GL67A is one of the more efficient non-viral gene transfer agents (GTAs) for the lungs, and is currently being evaluated in an extensive clinical trial programme for cystic fibrosis gene therapy. Despite conferring significant expression of vector-specific mRNA following transfection of differentiated human airway cells cultured on air liquid interfaces (ALI) cultures and nebulisation into sheep lung in vivo we were unable to detect robust levels of the standard reporter gene Firefly luciferase (FLuc). Recently a novel secreted luciferase isolated from Gaussia princeps (GLuc) has been described. Here, we show that (1) GLuc is a more sensitive reporter gene and offers significant advantages over the traditionally used FLuc in pre-clinical models for lung gene transfer that are difficult to transfect, (2) GL67A-mediated gene transfection leads to significant production of recombinant protein in these models, (3) promoter activity in ALI cultures mimics published in vivo data and these cultures may, therefore, be suitable to characterise promoter activity in a human ex vivo airway model and (4) detection of GLuc in large animal broncho-alveolar lavage fluid and serum facilitates assessment of duration of gene expression after gene transfer to the lungs. In summary, we have shown here that GLuc is a sensitive reporter gene and is particularly useful for monitoring gene transfer in difficult to transfect models of the airway and lung. This has allowed us to validate that GL67A, which is currently in clinical use, can generate significant amounts of recombinant protein in fully differentiated human air liquid interface cultures and the ovine lung in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatomization 3ablood serum 3aclinical trials 3acultured cells 3acystic fibrosis 3agene expression 3agene therapy 3ahumans 3aluciferase 3alungs 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3amonitoring 3arecombinant proteins 3areporter genes 3asheep 3atransfection1 aVicente, Catarina C.1 aRoberts, Megan J.1 aMeng, Cuixiang1 aSoussi, Samia1 aXenariou, Stefania1 aTennant, Peter1 aBaker, Alison1 aBaker, Eilidh1 aGordon, Catherine1 aVrettou, Christina1 aMcCormick, Dominique1 aColes, Rebecca1 aGreen, Anne-Marie1 aLawton, Anna E.1 aSumner-Jones, Stephanie G.1 aCheng, Seng H.1 aScheule, Ronald K.1 aHyde, Stephen C.1 aGill, Deborah R.1 aCollie, David D.1 aMcLachlan, Gerry1 aAlton, Eric W.F.W.0 tBiomaterials.g2011 Apr., v. 32, no. 10 p.2614-2624dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245010400163300001300267520131000280592002801590650002201618650001201640650002601652650000901678650001501687650001001702650001201712650001501724650001901739650001101758650001601769650002601785650000901811650001701820650001601837650002001853650002001873650001701893651001201910653002201922653001301944653001501957653002601972653002501998700001602023700002102039773010002060856007802160852000902238655001202247IND60580746220221123024135.0170928e20170331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058074622DNAL7 a10.1515/boku-2017-00012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThaler, Sabina10aWater Footprint of main crops in Austria / Wasser-FuÃabdruck wichtiger Nutzpflanzen in Ãsterreich  ap. 1-15.  aWater is a key resource for human activities and a critical trigger for the welfare of the whole society. The agricultural sector makes up the main share in global freshwater consumption and is therefore responsible for a large part of the water scarcity in many drought prone regions. As an indicator that relates human consumption to global water resources, the âWater Footprintâ (WF) concept can be used, where in case of crop production the total consumed water of crop fields for the crop growing seasons is related to the harvested dry matter crop yield (such as grains). In our study, we simulated the green and primary blue WF of selected main crops for Austrian conditions. Different irrigation scheduling scenarios, demonstrated for a main agricultural production area and various crops in Austria with significant irrigation acreage, were studied. The impact of climate and soil conditions on the green crop WFs of reference crops over the whole territory of Austria were simulated in a second step. Sunflower, winter wheat and grain maize showed the highest WF in the semi-arid study regions, especially on soils with low water capacity. In more humid regions, low temperatures were the main limiting factor on the crop yield potential and frequently led to higher WFs due to lower yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aacreage 3aagricultural industry 3acorn 3acrop yield 3acrops 3adrought 3afreshwater 3agrowing season 3ahumans 3ahumid zones 3airrigation scheduling 3asoil 3asoil quality 3atemperature 3awater footprint 3awater shortages 3awinter wheat 3aAustria 0acrop growth model 0aAquaCrop 0airrigation 0agreen water footprint 0ablue water footprint1 aGobin, Anne1 aEitzinger, Josef0 tDie Bodenkultur.g2017 Mar. 31, v. 68, no. 1 p.1-15dDe GruyterwJournal:14415x0006-54717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/boku-2017-00013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03903naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245013100174520209100305592002802396650003002424650001102454650003302465650001502498650001202513650001402525650001402539650001302553650001302566650002002579650001502599650001502614650002102629650003702650653002302687653002602710653002602736653002802762653002502790653002502815700002002840700001402860700001902874700002402893700002102917700002102938700002102959700002502980700002303005700002403028700002003052700002503072773011903097856008803216852000903304655001203313IND60732755520221120160608.0220110e20210810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073275552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1467482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStock, Svenja C.10aPlant carbon investment in fine roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi: A cross-biome study on nutrient acquisition strategies  aComparing the belowground allocation of assimilated carbon (C) to roots and mycorrhizal fungi across biomes can reveal specific plant nutrient acquisition strategies in ecosystems and allows to predict consequences of environmental changes. Three natural ecosystems (arid shrubland, coastal matorral, humid-temperate forest) distinct in annual precipitation and vegetation cover and compositions were selected to conduct a Â¹Â³COâ pulse labeling of natural woody vegetation to chase the allocation of assimilated C to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and fine roots. Further, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability, root traits, root colonization, and the extraradical AM fungal mycelium (PLFA and NLFA 16:1Ï5c) were analyzed to evaluate the efficiency of nutrient acquisition strategies. AM fungal colonization decreased with increasing aridity by up to 55% intraradical and by up to 90% extraradical. High root tissue densities â indicating longevity of roots â and low specific root lengths â indicating a low nutrient uptake capacity â pointed to a slow and resource conservative acquisition strategy of plants in the arid shrubland. Plants in the matorral, on the contrary, had lower root tissue densities but higher specific root lengths and higher root N contents, pointing to a fast nutrient acquisition strategy. The expression of abundant acquisitive fine roots of plants in the matorral, however, comes at the cost of larger C investment, shown by high Â¹Â³C incorporation into root tissue. High root tissue densities and greater root diameter indicated that plants in the humid-temperate forest followed a resource-conservative strategy and outsource their nutrient acquisition to AM fungi. This outsourcing provides an efficient pathway to compensate a low uptake capacity of thick and dense roots. These ecosystem-specific acquisition strategies and distinct mutualism with AM fungi across the biomes will likely affect the sensitivity of plants to abiotic and biotic stressors and, thus, ecosystem responses to future climatic and environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarbon 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3aforests 3alongevity 3amutualism 3amycelium 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3aphosphorus 3ashrublands 3avegetation cover 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aNatural ecosystems 0aTemperate rain forest 0aArbuscular mycorrhiza 0aPlant economic spectrum 0aRoot economics space 0a13CO2 pulse labeling1 aKoester, Moritz1 aBoy, Jens1 aGodoy, Roberto1 aNÃ¡jera, Francisco,1 aMatus, Francisco1 aMerino, Carolina1 aAbdallah, Khaled1 aLeuschner, Christoph1 aSpielvogel, Sandra1 aGorbushina, Anna A.1 aKuzyakov, Yakov1 aDippold, Michaela A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Aug. 10, v. 781 p.146748-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1467483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245011900201300001400320500002000334520131300354592002801667596005901695596005501754650001701809650001001826650001201836650004301848650001301891700001801904700002501922700001201947700001801959700001401977700001501991773012202006856008002128852000902208655001202217IND60768676520221119105153.0220226e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076867652DNAL7 a10.1111/1748-5967.125652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Weiwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2430-203310aSelection and evaluation of reference genes for quantitative realâtime PCR analysis in lac insect (Kerria lacca)  ap. 57-67.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe screening and identification of suitable reference genes are key steps in experiments involving the quantitative realâtime polymerase chain reaction. However, the reference genes of Kerria lacca, a lac insect with considerable economic significance, have not been investigated. In this study, we used five statistical algorithms (ÎCt, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) to evaluate the stability of eight candidate reference genes (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, Î²âACT, EF1âÎ±, RPL10, RPL13, RPS11, and RPS15) in different developmental stages and tissues of K. lacca and under dsRNA treatment. Our results showed that the most stable reference genes were 28S rRNA and RPS11 for the developmental stages, RPL13 and RPS11 for different tissues, and Î²âACT and EF1âÎ± for dsRNA treatments. Although the target genes FAS and 17Î²âHSD showed consistent expression profiles (alone or in combination) when normalized to the expression levels of the stable genes, those changed when the least stable reference gene (18S rRNA) was used. These results highlight that suitable reference genes should be chosen according to the specific experimental conditions used. The reliability and stability of different reference genes can provide a firm foundation for gene expression analysis in lac insects.  aPublisher supplied data  a31772542cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a202005AE160011cInnovative Team of Yunnan Province 3aKerria lacca 3agenes 3ainsects 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresearch1 aLing, Xiaofei1 aBashir, Nawaz Haider1 aLu, Qin1 aZhang, Jinwen1 aLi, Tichu1 aChen, Hang0 tEntomological research.g2022 Feb., v. 52, no. 2 p.57-67dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867074x1738-22977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1748-5967.125653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010300172300001400275520070700289592002800996650001501024650002101039650000901060650000701069650001701076650001601093653002001109653003101129653001701160653001801177653000901195653001601204700002501220700002301245700002001268700001901288773015101307856008601458852000901544655001201553IND60098415620221120204405.0190215e20130104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009841562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2012.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayakawa, Shohei10aSpectroscopic characterization of the acidâalkaline transition of a thermophilic cytochrome P450  ap. 94-97.  aThe spectroscopic properties of thermophilic cytochrome P450 from the thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus tokodaii strain 7 (P450st) were investigated in acidic and basic solutions.

CONTEXT: Monitoring xylem formation (xylogenesis) during extreme meteorological events helps assessing climate change impacts on tree growth. AIMS: For better insight into tree-growth responses, here we compare the intra-annual formation of annual ring with and without intra-annual density fluctuation in J. przewalskii in a cold and arid environment on the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau. METHODS: Cambial phenology and xylogenesis observations of five mature trees during the 2016 intra-annual density fluctuation growth ring and the five-preceding year (2011â2015) were used for comparison. The frequency of population level occurrence of intra-annual density fluctuation in 2016 was examined on additional 50 randomly selected trees. RESULTS: The return of precipitation in conjunction with warm temperatures after summer drought promoted the growth resumption in 64% of our study trees, resulting in the observed intra-annual density fluctuation. These trees experienced a growing season 1Â month longer than trees without intra-annual density fluctuation. The extended growth period resulted in a 17% increase in stem biomass in trees that experienced intra-annual density fluctuation. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the extraordinary resilience of J. przewalskii trees in response to extreme climatic events in the cold and dry conditions of the Tibetan Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019M653788cPostdoctoral Research Foundation of China  a42001043 and 41771046cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aEF-1241930cNational Science Foundation Macrosystem Biology program 3aJuniperus przewalskii 3aarid zones 3abiomass production 3acambium 3aclimate change 3adrought 3adry environmental conditions 3agrowing season 3agrowth rings 3amonitoring 3aphenology 3asummer 3atemperature 3atree growth 3atrees 3awood density 3aChina1 aAlexander, M.

Using synthetic smart chemicals with changeable physicochemical properties to interfere the mitochondrial membrane stability has not yet been reported. Here we show that a thermosensitive anchorâpolymerâpeptide conjugate (anchor-PPC) destabilizes mitochondrial membranes upon in situ molecule changes from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, which consequently induces apoptosis in a spatiotemporally controlled manner and acts as an antitumor pharmaceutical. The anchor-PPC is composed of a thermosensitive copolymer, a photolabile linker, a hydrophilic HIV Tat-derived peptide both for cell penetration and polymer phase transition temperature (Tt) modulation, and an anchor peptide for intercalating into mitochondrial membranes. The photocontrollable anchor-PPC dehydrates and changes from being hydrophilic to hydrophobic upon photoactivation at body temperature. This cell-penetrable anchor-PPC specifically targets mitochondria and destabilizes mitochondrial membranes upon irradiation, and consequently initiates apoptosis in cells and a complex 3D tumor model. This study provides the first experimental evidence that the synthetic smart chemical can spatiotemporally control the stability of organelle membranes based on its in situ physicochemical property change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiocompatible materials 3abody temperature 3acomposite polymers 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3airradiation 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3apeptides 3aphase transition 3athermosensitivity1 aChen, Ke-Zheng1 aQiao, Sheng-Lin0 tBiomaterials science.g2022 May 17, v. 10, no. 10 p.2550-2556dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2bm00212d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03662naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001500180245015900195300001800354506007600372520173800448592002802186506003702214650001902251650001602270650003802286650001202324650001102336650002602347650001502373650001302388650003002401650002202431650001302453650001502466650002902481700002402510700001602534700001402550700001602564700002502580700002202605700001702627700002402644700002102668700001702689700002302706700001802729700002202747700001302769700001902782700002202801700001802823773011102841856007502952852000903027655001203036IND60529517820221207071407.0160717e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052951782DNAL7 a10.1021/ac402105s2doi7 aPMC38398672pmcid7 a240040262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Tujin10aLong-Gradient Separations Coupled with Selected Reaction Monitoring for Highly Sensitive, Large Scale Targeted Protein Quantification in a Single Analysis  ap. 9196-9203.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLong-gradient separations coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS) were recently demonstrated to provide a deep proteome coverage for global proteomics; however, such long-gradient separations have not been explored for targeted proteomics. Herein, we investigate the potential performance of the long-gradient separations coupled with selected reaction monitoring (LG-SRM) for targeted protein quantification. Direct comparison of LG-SRM (5 h gradient) and conventional liquid chromatography (LC)-SRM (45 min gradient) showed that the long-gradient separations significantly reduced background interference levels and provided an 8- to 100-fold improvement in limit of quantification (LOQ) for target proteins in human female serum. On the basis of at least one surrogate peptide per protein, an LOQ of 10 ng/mL was achieved for the two spiked proteins in nondepleted human serum. The LG-SRM detection of seven out of eight endogenous plasma proteins expressed at ng/mL or subng/mL levels in clinical patient sera was also demonstrated. A correlation coefficient of >0.99 was observed for the results of LG-SRM and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measurements for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in selected patient sera. Further enhancement of LG-SRM sensitivity was achieved by applying front-end IgY14 immunoaffinity depletion. Besides improved sensitivity, LG-SRM potentially offers much higher multiplexing capacity than conventional LC-SRM due to an increase in average peak widths (â¼3-fold) for a 300 min gradient compared to a 45 min gradient. Therefore, LG-SRM holds great potential for bridging the gap between global and targeted proteomics due to its advantages in both sensitivity and multiplexing capacity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood proteins 3ablood serum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afemales 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3apatients 3aprostate-specific antigen 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aFillmore, Thomas L.1 aGao, Yuqian1 aZhao, Rui1 aHe, Jintang1 aSchepmoes, Athena A.1 aNicora, Carrie

However, the landmass has received less attention even if it has high ecological, environmental, and economic uses. The present study was conducted in Hirmi woodland vegetation, which is one of the dryland areas in Ethiopia, with the objective of investigating the floristic composition, plant community types, vegetation structure, community-environment relations and its regeneration status. Vegetation and environmental data were collected from 80 sampling plots with a size of 25âm Ã 25âm designated as the main plots. Diameter atÂ breast height (DBH), height, basal area, density, vertical structure,Â importance value index (IVI), and frequency were computed. Species diversity and evenness were analyzed using Shannon diversity and evenness indices. The plant community types and vegetation-environment relationships were analyzed using classification and ordination tools, respectively. A total of 171 vascular plant species belonging to 135 genera and 56 families were recorded. About 5.3% of the species were endemic and near-endemic to Ethiopia. The highest number of species was recorded in families Fabaceae (16.4%) and Poaceae (11.7%) followed by Asteraceae (7.0%), Combretaceae, Lamiaceae, and Moraceae (3.5% each). Five plant communities were identified. According to the results from ordination analysis, the floristic composition of these plant communities was significantly affected by altitude, slope, sand, silt, soil organic matter, total nitrogen, and disturbance. The vegetation structure reveals that a large number of individual species was categorized in the lower DBH, frequency, and height classes. The highest Shannon diversity index and evenness values of the study area were 4.21 and 0.95, respectively. Anogeissus leiocarpa, Combretum hartmannianum, Ziziphus mucronata, Terminalia macroptera, and Acacia polyacantha were the species with high IVI. Some endemic plants were in the IUCN red list categories of Ethiopia and Eritrea. The overall regeneration status of the study area was poor because of anthropogenic disturbances and grazing pressures. Although the study area is endowed with high plant species diversity including endemism, it is under poor regeneration status due to various disturbances. To overcome this challenge, integrated management measures including monitoring and application of restoration techniques by taking into consideration the significant environmental factors associated with species diversity as well as observed regeneration status and IUCN threat level of the species are highly recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnogeissus leiocarpa 3aAsteraceae 3aCombretum 3aLamiaceae 3aMoraceae 3aPoaceae 3aSenegalia polyacantha 3aTerminalia 3aZiziphus mucronata 3aaltitude 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarid lands 3abotanical composition 3agrazing intensity 3aindigenous species 3amonitoring 3aordination techniques 3aplant communities 3asand 3asilt 3asoil organic matter 3atotal nitrogen 3atree and stand measurements 3avascular plants 3avegetation structure 3awoodlands 3aEritrea 3aEthiopia1 aBekele, Tamrat1 aSebsebe Demissew,1 aLulekal, Ermias0 tEcological processes.g2020 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.53-53dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22887x2192-17097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13717-020-00257-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012700164300001400291520149700305592002801802650001501830650002601845650001601871650002501887650002701912650001701939650001601956650001001972650001201982650001601994650001702010650002002027650001102047653002602058653002302084653001602107653002602123653002002149700001402169700001502183700001402198700001902212700001602231773012002247856008402367852000902451655001202460IND60593022720221119123535.0180414e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059302272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.03.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lu10aEffects of the decomposing liquid of Cladophora oligoclona on Hydrilla verticillata turion germination and seedling growth  ap. 81-88.  aExcessive proliferation of filamentous green algae (FGA) has been considered an important factor resulting in the poor growth or even decline of submerged macrophytes. However, there is a lack of detailed information regarding the effect of decaying FGA on submerged macrophytes. This study aimed to investigate whether the decomposing liquid from Cladophora oligoclona negatively affects Hydrilla verticillata turion germination and seedling growth. The results showed that the highest concentrations of decomposing liquid treatments inhibited the turion germination rate, which was the lowest than other treatments, at only 84%. The chlorophyll a fluorescence (JIP test) and physiological indicators (chlorophyll a content, soluble sugars, CaÂ²âº/MgÂ²âº-ATPase and PAL activity) were also measured. The chlorophyll a content in the highest concentration (40% of original decomposing liquid) treatment group decreased by 43.53% than that of the control; however, soluble sugars, CaÂ²âº/MgÂ²âº-ATPase, and PAL activity increased by 172.46%, 271.19%, and 26.43% respectively. The overall results indicated that FGA decay has a considerable effect on submerged macrophyte turion germination and seedling growth, which could inhibit their expansion and reproduction. This study emphasized the need to focus on effects of FGA decomposition on the early growth stages of submerged macrophytes and offered technological guidance for submerged vegetation restoration in lakes and shallow waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladophora 3aHydrilla verticillata 3achlorophyll 3adevelopmental stages 3aecological restoration 3afluorescence 3agermination 3alakes 3aliquids 3amacrophytes 3areproduction 3aseedling growth 3asugars 0aCladophora oligoclona 0aDecomposing liquid 0aGermination 0aHydrilla verticillata 0aSeedling growth1 aPeng, Xue1 aLiu, Biyun1 aZhang, Yi1 aZhou, Qiaohong1 aWu, Zhenbin0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 157 p.81-88dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.03.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002800117040001800145100001500163245005900178300001600237520209300253592002802346650001602374650002802390650002002418650000902438650001102447650001002458700001702468700001502485700001702500700002002517700001302537773016402550856011402714856007502828961000902903852000902912655001202921IND60765727020221118162743.0220904s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076572702DNAL7 a10113/76572702hdl7 a10.13031/aea.144822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rong10aPig Face Recognition Model Based on a Cascaded Network  ap. 879-890.  aHighlightsA pig face recognition model that cascades the pig face detection network and pig face recognition network is proposed.The pig face detection network can automatically extract pig face images to reduce the influence of the background.The proposed cascaded model reaches accuracies of 99.38%, 98.96% and 97.66% on the three datasets.An application is developed to automatically recognize individual pigs.Abstract. The identification and tracking of livestock using artificial intelligence technology have been a research hotspot in recent years. Automatic individual recognition is the key to realizing intelligent feeding. Although RFID can achieve identification tasks, it is expensive and easily fails. In this article, a pig face recognition model that cascades a pig face detection network and a pig face recognition network is proposed. First, the pig face detection network is utilized to crop the pig face images from videos and eliminate the complex background of the pig shed. Second, batch normalization, dropout, skip connection, and residual modules are exploited to design a pig face recognition network for individual identification. Finally, the cascaded network model based on the pig face detection and recognition network is deployed on a GPU server, and an application is developed to automatically recognize individual pigs. Additionally, class activation maps generated by grad-CAM are used to analyze the performance of features of pig faces learned by the model. Under free and unconstrained conditions, 46 pigs are selected to make a positive pig face dataset, original multiangle pig face dataset and enhanced multiangle pig face dataset to verify the pig face recognition cascaded model. The proposed cascaded model reaches accuracies of 99.38%, 98.96%, and 97.66% on the three datasets, which are higher than those of other pig face recognition models. The results of this study improved the recognition performance of pig faces under multiangle and multi-environment conditions.

Using atomic force microscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy, we show that for growth over a wide range of temperatures (500Â Â°C â 1000Â Â°C) the deposited carbon atoms spill off the edge of the h-BN flakes. We attribute this spillage to the very high mobility of the carbon atoms on the BN basal plane, consistent with van der Waals MBE. The h-BN flakes vary in size from 30Â Î¼m to 100Â Î¼m, thus demonstrating that the migration length of carbon atoms on h-BN is greater than 100Â Î¼m. When sufficient carbon is supplied to compensate for this loss, which is largely due to this fast migration of the carbon atoms to and off the edges of the h-BN flake, we find that the best growth temperature for MBE SLG on h-BN is â¼950Â Â°C. Self-limiting graphene growth appears to be facilitated by topographic h-BN surface features: We have thereby grown MBE self-limited SLG on an h-BN ridge. This opens up future avenues for precisely tailored fabrication of nano- and hetero-structures on pre-patterned h-BN surfaces for device applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3aboron nitride 3agraphene 3atemperature 3avan der Waals forces1 aWurstbauer, Ulrich1 aWang, Sheng1 aLevy, Antonio L.1 aFernandes dos Santos, Lara1 aWang, Lei1 aPfeiffer, Loren N.1 aWatanabe, Kenji1 aTaniguchi, Takashi1 aDean, Cory R.1 aHone, Jim,1 aPinczuk, Aron1 aGarcia, Jorge M.0 tCarbon.g2017 Apr., v. 114 p.579-584dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2016.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01881naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009600169300001600265520071400281592002800995650001401023650002001037650000901057650001901066650001101085650001801096650000901114650002001123651001001143653001801153653002101171653001901192653001601211653001701227700002001244700002201264773012501286856005101411852000901462655001201471IND50076104220221120185323.0140410e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007610422DNAL7 a10.1080/02772248.2010.5481182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, M.

For survival from this metal stress, plants always fight with Cd(II) toxicity by themselves or using other external factors. The effects of second metals copper (Cu(II)), zinc (Zn(II)) and calcium (Ca(II)) on the Cd(II)-affected root morphology, Cd(II) translocation and metabolic responses in Catharanthus roseus were investigated under hydroponic conditions. We found that the Cd-stressed plants displayed the browning and rot root symptom, excess H2O2 content, lipid peroxidation and Cd(II) accumulation in plants. However, the supplement with second metals largely alleviated Cd-induced toxicity, including browning and rot roots, oxidative stress and internal Cd(II) accumulation. The amended effects at metabolic and transcriptional levels involved in different second metals share either common or divergent strategies. They commonly repressed Cd uptake and promoted Cd(II) translocation from roots to shoots with divergent mechanisms. High Zn(II) could activate MTs expression in roots, while Cu(II) or Ca(II) did not under Cd(II) stress condition. The presence of Ca(II) under Cd stress condition largely initiated occurrence of lateral roots. We then grouped a metabolic diagram integrating terpenoid indole alkaloid (TIA) accumulation and TIA pathway gene expression to elucidate the metabolic response of C. roseus to Cd(II) alone or combined with second metals. The treatment with 100â¯Cd(II) alone largely promoted accumulation of vinblastine, vindoline, catharanthine and loganin, whereas depressed or little changed the expression levels of genes detected here, compared to 0 Cd(II) control. In the presence of Cd(II), the supplement with second metals displayed specific effect on different alkaloid. Among them, the metal Ca(II) is especially beneficial for serpentine accumulation, Zn(II) mainly promoted tabersonine production. However, the addition of Cu(II) commonly depressed accumulation of most alkaloids detected here. Generally, we presented different mechanisms by which the second metals used to alleviate Cd (II) toxicity. This plant has potential application in phytoremediation of Cd(II), due to relatively substantial accumulation of biomass, as well as secondary metabolites TIAs used as pharmaceutical materials when facing Cd stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatharanthus roseus 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomass 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acopper 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroponics 3alipid peroxidation 3aloganin 3amedicinal plants 3aoxidative stress 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3aroots 3asecondary metabolites 3aserpentine 3ashoots 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 3avinblastine 3azinc 0aTIA 0aDAT 0aSLS 0aSTR 0aSGD 0aTDC 0aPRX1 0aMDR 0aTPT 0aMTs 0aCd(II) 0aCu(II) 0aZinc 0aCa (II) 0aMDA 0aqRT-PCR 0aTF 0aBFs 0aCatharanthus roseus 0aCadmium toxicity 0aTIA pathway gene 0aTerpenoid indole alkaloid1 aLu, Xueyan1 aGuo, Xiaorui1 aPan, Yajie1 aYu, Bofan1 aTang, Zhonghua1 aGuo, Qingxi0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 157 p.266-275dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.03.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03551naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003200135040001800167100001900185245014800204300001000352506007600362520218600438592002802624506003702652650001202689650001102701650001602712650002302728650000902751650003502760650001002795650001202805650001802817650001902835650001502854650001402869650001302883650001302896700001902909773009002928856007803018852000903096655001203105IND50072280320221207125740.0160903e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007228032DNAL7 a244109332pmid7 aPMC38966692pmcid7 a10.1186/1742-9994-11-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Chao-Kai10aMedaka villin 1-like protein (VILL) is associated with the formation of microvilli induced by decreasing salinities in the absorptive ionocytes  ap. 2.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aINTRODUCTION: Villin 1 is an actin-regulatory protein involved in the formation of microvilli of mammalian enterocytes. The microvilli, finger-like protrusions, are more abundant on the apical surfaces of gill ionocytes in various freshwater (FW) teleosts than in seawater (SW) fishes. However, the plasticity in the mechanisms of microvillus formation in the gill ionocytes are poorly understood, and the actin-regulatory proteins involved in the formation of microvilli have not been identified in fishes. The present study used the euryhaline medaka (Oryzias dancena) as a model to explore the role of a homolog of villin 1 in the actin-organization of cellular morphologies induced by decreasing salinities. RESULTS: By ultrastructural observation, there are numerous actin filaments organized on the apical cortex of ion-absorptive ionocytes in the FW-acclimated medaka. From gills of the euryhaline medaka, we have identified the VILL sequence. The phylogenetic tree and functional domains suggest that VILL is the homolog of villin 1 in fishes. Immunofluorescence using a specific antibody revealed that VILL was specifically localized to the apical region of gill ionocytes along with microvilli in the FW medaka, but not in SW fish. The expression levels of Odvill mRNA and VILL protein were higher in the gills of the FW individuals than in the SW group and were induced when fish were transferred from SW to FW. A morpholino oligonucleotide for VILL knockdown eliminated the apical protrusions of ionocytes and pavement cells in the trunk epithelia of embryos. CONCLUSIONS: From a novel aspect of cytoskeletal functions, our findings highlighted the important role of VILL protein in the ionoregulation of aquatic vertebrates in response to different osmotic challenges. This study is the first to show that the expression of VILL is associated with the formation of microvilli in the absorptive ionocytes of a euryhaline fish. Loss-of-function experiments showed that the distribution of VILL may represent the molecular link between the cytoskeletal organization and cellular morphology of the absorptive ionocytes during hypoosmotic adaptation in aquatic vertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryzias 3acortex 3aenterocytes 3aeuryhaline species 3afish 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agills 3amammals 3amessenger RNA 3amicrofilaments 3amicrovilli 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3aseawater1 aLee, Tsung-Han0 tFrontiers in zoology.g2014 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.2-2dBioMed Centralx1742-99947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1742-9994-11-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01997naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012500170520071300295592002801008650002701036650001801063650003101081650002201112650001801134650002501152650001901177650002601196650001001222653002001232653003101252653002601283653002801309653004101337700002701378773011501405856008201520852000901602655001201611IND60777219120221118065358.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077721912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2022.1022322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajheidari, Mohsen10aElucidating the biology of transcription factorâDNA interaction for accurate identification of cis-regulatory elements  aTranscription factors (TFs) play a critical role in determining cell fate decisions by integrating developmental and environmental signals through binding to specific cis-regulatory modules and regulating spatio-temporal specificity of gene expression patterns.

However, the fundamental mechanisms are not completely understood for chiral lyotropic colloidal mesogens such as collagen.To capture the dynamics of NG under a quenching process into the biphasic equilibrium zone, we use direct numerical simulation based on the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model allowing minimization of the total free energy comprised of five key contributions: phase separation (Flory-Huggins), ordering (Landau-de Gennes), chiral orientational elasticity (Frank-Oseen-Mermin), interfacial and coupling effects. LSTM-RNN is applied as a surrogate model to greatly enrich the results. Significant correlations are established using Symbolic Regression.We quantify the NG boundaries existing in the collagen phase diagram that has recently been developed and validated by our thermodynamic model (Khadem and Rey, 2019 [1]). We characterize the three NG stages (induction, nucleation, and coarsening) in terms of tactoidsâ shape, morphology, growth laws, and population across the NG zone. Wide-range generic correlations are developed, revealing the quench depth dependence of NG characteristics and connecting the sequential NG stages. We confirm experimental observations on time-dependent growth law exponent changes from an initial nâ0.5 for the mass transfer limited regime to nâ1 for the volume-driven phase ordering regime upon increasing quench depth during the nucleation period and having exclusively a value of nâ0.5 for the coarsening period regardless of quench depth. We lastly uncover the underlying physics behind the NG phenomena.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3abiocompatible materials 3acollagen 3amass transfer 3aneural networks 3aphysical phases 3aseparation 3astatistical analysis 3athermodynamic models 3atime series analysis 0aBiological chiral lyotropic liquid crystals 0aBiomimetic collagen-based biomaterials 0aLiquid-crystalline self-assembly 0aChiral nematic tactoids 0aCholesteric nucleation 0aGrowth and coarsening 0aUniversal growth laws 0aUphill diffusion 0aTime-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model 0aLong Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network 0aSymbolic Regression1 aRey, Alejandro D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0440-87620 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 582 p.859-873dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.08.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245010800132300001600240520179500256592002802051650001602079650001602095650001802111650001002129650001502139650001202154650001802166650001602184650001102200650001502211650001702226650001102243653002002254653001602274653002302290700002102313700001402334700002202348700001602370773014202386852000902528655001202537IND60706373720221116233953.0200807e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070637372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAttri, Brij Lal10aEvaluation of onion (Allum cepa L.)

The coefficients of variation were low to high and ranged from 9.33 to 33.22%. It was observed moderate for bulb weight was positively associated with polar diameter, length, and girth of bulb. However, it was negatively correlated with days to maturity and total soluble solids. For improving bulb yield and important component traits in onion, the generation of genetically broad base population using diverse genotypes in breeding programmed is advocated. Onion (Allium cepa L.) is one of the most important crops cultivated throughout the world and utilized as spice and condiment. It is hardy, bulbous rooted perennial plant with small narrow rounded leaves a white flower. Onion possesses typical pungent flavoring it useful mainly as a spice, seasoning and flavouring agent for foodstuff. Eating of raw onion boost the immune system and regulate blood sugar level. However, there is great potential for increasing area, production and productivity of this crop in the region, and hence, there is an urgent need to evaluate different onion genotypes under Mukteshwar region. Therefore, the present investigation was undertaken to study the evaluation of onion genotypes for growth, yield, and quality in Mukteshwar condition in order to achieve this objective. The highest bulb yield (313.5 Q/ha) was recorded in genotypes AVT-I-BLRO-1229 and AVT-II-CLRO-1227, followed by 297.0 Q/ha and 280.5 Q/ha recorded in IET hybrid-ALRO-1230 and IET-ALRO-1243. Whereas, the lowest bulb yield (171.6 Q/ha) was obtained in AVT-II-CLRO-1275 genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aagriculture 3ablood glucose 3abulbs 3acondiments 3aflowers 3aimmune system 3aleaf length 3aonions 3aperennials 3aplant height 3aspices 0aOnion germplasm 0avariability 0atrait relationship1 aNÄrÄÊ¼in RÄj,1 aAhmed, N.1 aMer, Mukesh Singh1 aAnil Kumar,0 tProgressive agriculture.g2015 Aug., v. 15, no. 2 p.272-276dSociety for Recent Development in AgriculturewJournal:2097x0976-46157nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012900173300001600302520125400318592002801572650002301600650001801623650003301641650001401674650002001688650001601708650001001724653003001734653002901764653002701793653003101820700002901851700001601880773010801896856008202004852000902086655001202095IND60613682220221119132704.0220411e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061368222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2018.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalimi Khorshidi, Ali10aApplication of low-intensity ultrasound as a rapid, cost-effective tool to wheat screening: A systematic frequency selection  ap. 190-197.  aA preliminary study on the potential of low-intensity ultrasound for wheat screening purposes was carried out. A transmission technique with the use of longitudinal ultrasonic waves at five frequencies was utilised (0.5â10â¯MHz) to enable selection of the frequency at which the best discrimination and quality evaluation of five Canadian wheat varieties are achieved. Mixograph, farinograph and micro-extension parameters were also determined for comparison purposes. Statistical interpretation of the data was performed using principal component analysis (PCA) and generalized linear model (GLM). Results indicated that ultrasonic measurements at 10â¯MHz allowed for better discrimination of wheat varieties with a reasonable degree of confidence, compared to other frequencies. Moreover, correlations between parameters derived from ultrasonic measurements at 10â¯MHz and those of mixograph, farinograph and micro-extension were found to be significant (Pâ¯â¤â¯0.05) and in good agreement with the definitions of the parameters studied. Based on the statistical analysis of the data, ultrasonic phase velocity and longitudinal storage modulus at 10â¯MHz were found to be the best discriminators of the wheat varieties used in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3alinear models 3aprincipal component analysis 3ascreening 3astorage modulus 3aultrasonics 3awheat 0aWheat screening technique 0aLow-intensity ultrasound 0aVariety discrimination 0aWheat flour dough rheology1 aThandapilly, Sijo Joseph1 aAmes, Nancy0 tJournal of cereal science.g2018 July, v. 82 p.190-197dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2018.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009600169506011700265506007600382520110400458592002801562506003701590650002601627650001501653650001801668650002001686650002601706650001401732700006101746773011501807856008201922852000902004655001202013IND60777219220221207141117.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077721922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2022.1022332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRangel, Lorena I.14aThe unsung roles of microbial secondary metabolite effectors in the plant disease cacophony  aCreative Commons AttributionÂ 4.0Â Generic (CC BY-NC-NDÂ 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlants counter disease with an array of responses to styme pathogen ingress. In contrast to this cacophony, plant pathogens orchestrate a finely tuned repertoire of virulence mechanisms in their attempt to cause disease. One such example is the production of secondary metabolite effectors (SMEs). Despite many attempts to functionally categorize SMEs, their many roles in plant disease have proven they march to the beat of their producer's drum. Some lesser studied features of SMEs in plant disease include self-resistance (SR) and manipulation of the microbiome to enhance pathogen virulence. SR can be accomplished in three general compositions, with the first being the transport of the SME to a benign location; the second being modification of the SME so it cannot harm the producer; and the third being metabolic regulation of the SME or the producer homolog of the SME target. SMEs may also play an interlude prior to disease by shaping the plant microbial community, allowing producers to better establish themselves. Taken together, SMEs are integral players in the phytopathology canon.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3aplant biology 3aplant pathology 3asecondary metabolites 3avirulence1 aBolton, Melvin D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1197-20780 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2022 Aug., v. 68 p.102233-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2022.1022333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001400183245006800197300002000265506007600285520126900361592002801630506003701658650002001695650004601715650001301761650000901774650001201783650001201795650001801807650004401825650001401869650003701883650000901920700001301929700001401942700005201956700001502008700001502023700001702038700001302055700005502068700005202123700005402175700005602229700001702285700005602302773014902358856007602507852000902583655001202592IND60619484020221207104119.0181102e20181005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061948402DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b055302doi7 aPMC63484702pmcid7 a302897022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei10aSelf-Assembly of Supramolecular Fractals from Generation 1 to 5  ap. 14087-14096.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the seeking of molecular expression of fractal geometry, chemists have endeavored in the construction of molecules and supramolecules during the past few years, while only a few examples were reported, especially for the discrete architectures. We herein designed and constructed five generations of supramolecular fractals (G1âG5) based on the coordination-driven self-assembly of terpyridine ligands. All the ligands were synthesized from triphenylamine motif, which played a central role in geometry control. Different approaches based on direct Sonogashira coupling and/or â¨tpy-Ru(II)-tpyâ© connectivity were employed to prepare complex Ru(II)-organic building blocks. Fractals G1âG5 were obtained in high yields by precise coordination of organic or Ru(II)-organic building blocks with Zn(II) ions. Characterization of those architectures were accomplished by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), traveling-wave ion mobility mass spectrometry (TWIM-MS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the two largest fractals also hierarchically self-assemble into ordered supramolecular nanostructures either at solid/liquid interface or in solution on the basis of their well-defined scaffolds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaromatic amines 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3ageometry 3aions 3aligands 3aliquids 3ananomaterials 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aruthenium 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc1 aLiu, Ran1 aGu, Jiali1 aSong, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4337-848X1 aWang, Heng1 aJiang, Xin1 aZhang, Keren1 aHan, Xin1 aHao, Xin-Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1942-83091 aBai, Shi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2126-450X1 aWang, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5332-08041 aLi, Xiaohong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3190-72141 aXu, Bingqian1 aLi, Xiaopeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9655-95510 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Oct. 05, v. 140, no. 43 p.14087-14096dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b055303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001500169245010200184300001800286520129200304592002801596650001601624650002601640650002401666650002301690650001001713650001001723650001801733650001201751650001401763650001401777650002101791650001201812650003001824650004601854650003201900650005801932650003101990650000902021650001602030650002902046650001602075700001902091773010302110856008602213852000902299655001202308IND4462020120221121032619.0141110e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446202012DNAL7 a217297022pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunt, V.L.14aThe inhibitory effect of the fungal toxin, destruxin A, on behavioural fever in the desert locust  ap. 1341-1346.  aDuring an infection locusts behaviourally fever by seeking out higher environmental temperatures. This behaviour places the pathogen at sub-optimal growth temperatures while improving the efficiency of the immune system, thereby prolonging the lifespan of the host. It is therefore in the interest of the pathogen to either adapt to fever-like temperatures or to evolve mechanisms to interfere with, or inhibit fever. We investigated the behavioural fever response of desert locusts to two fungal pathogens. A prolonged fever was observed in locusts infected with Metarhizium acridum. However, fever was comparatively short-lived during infection with Metarhizium robertsii. In both cases restriction of thermoregulation reduced lifespan. Destruxin A (dtx A) produced by M. robertsii, but not M. acridum has previously been associated with the inhibition of the insect immune system. Injection of dtx A during infection with the fever-causing M. acridum inhibited fever and was particularly effective when administered early on in infection. Furthermore, locusts injected with dtx A were more susceptible to M. acridum infection. Therefore engineering M. acridum isolates currently used for locust biocontrol, to express dtx A may improve efficiency of control by interfering with fever.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMetarhizium 3aSchistocerca gregaria 3aambient temperature 3abiological control 3afever 3afungi 3aimmune system 3alocusts 3alongevity 3apathogens 3athermoregulation 2aAnimals 2aBiological Control Agents 2aBody Temperature Regulationxdrug effects 2aDepsipeptidesxpharmacology 2aGrasshoppersxdrug effectsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aMale 2aMetarhizium 2aMycotoxinsxpharmacology 2aTemperature1 aCharnley, A.K.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2011 Oct., v. 57, no. 10 p.1341-1346dElsevier Ltdx0022-19107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03849naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002200171245011600193300001500309520185400324592002802178650001002206650001902216650000902235650001302244650001502257650001102272650001102283650001602294650001902310650002702329650000902356650001402365650001302379650001602392650001202408650001202420650002102432650005302453650001102506650006202517650000902579650004502588650003802633650005902671650000902730650001702739650004802756650004602804700002302850700002102873700002302894700002802917700002902945700002302974773008402997856008603081990002303167852000903190655001203199IND60091805020221118054621.0141103e20111124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009180502DNAL7 a220186922pmid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2011.09.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaralis, Filippos10aResveratrol ameliorates hypoxia/ischemia-induced behavioral deficits and brain injury in the neonatal rat brain  ap. 98-110.  aHypoxiaâischemia (HI) induced injury of the neonatal brain accounts for behavioral deficits concerning mainly neurological reflexes, sensorimotor functions and learning/memory disabilities that may evolve throughout development. The positive biological effects of resveratrol, a natural compound with anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory properties found mainly in red wine have been indicated recently. Aim of this study was to investigate the delayed outcome of early administration of resveratrol in an experimental model of hypoxicâischemic encephalopathy, by means of behavioral analysis and late neuropathological examination. Seven-day-old (P7) rats were separated into 3 groups: Group 1 underwent HI and treated with resveratrol. Group 2 (HI-treated) was subjected to HI and received same volume of saline. Group 3 (sham-operated) was the control group. A battery of behavioral tests was performed from days P8âP66, during which early reflexes (righting reflex, gait, geotaxis), sensorimotor (rope suspension, beam walking, rotarod) and learning/memory function (passive avoidance, Morris water-maze) were examined. Significant difference among the groups was observed in righting reflex, rotarod and water maze tests in which the resveratrol group almost reached the performance of the control animals. The other behavioral tests showed that control and resveratrol groups were better compared to HI, although not significant. Neuropathology study revealed a remarkable reduction of the infarct and preservation of myelination after resveratrol treatment, which was in most cases correlated with the better performance of the resveratrol group. These findings indicate that long-term neuroprotective effect of resveratrol on neonatal HI-induced gray and white matter damage might be associated with the preservation of behavioral functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3aencephalopathy 3agait 3ageotaxis 3ainfarction 3amemory 3amodels 3amyelination 3aneuropathology 3aneuroprotective effect 3arats 3ared wines 3areflexes 3aresveratrol 3awalking 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aBrain Injuriesxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aFemale 2aHypoxia-Ischemia, Brainxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aMale 2aMaze Learningxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMemoryxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aNeuroprotective Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aReflex, Rightingxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aStilbenesxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use.1 aSoubasi, Vassiliki1 aGeorgiou, Thomas1 aNakas, Christos T.1 aSimeonidou, Constantina1 aGuiba-Tziampiri, Olympia1 aSpandou, Evangelia0 tBrain research.g2011 Nov. 24, v. 1425 p.98-110dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2011.09.0443Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02066naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012600156300001800282520079700300592002801097650001301125650001901138650001301157650001301170650002801183650002101211650001801232650001301250650001801263650001301281650002501294650001301319700001401332700001701346700001801363700001501381700001601396700001501412773012201427856007401549852000901623655001201632IND60618172120221120090937.0181029e20180223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061817212DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra12180f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaoyun10aSynthesis of a novel COâ-based alcohol amine compound and its usage in obtaining a water- and solvent-resistant coating  ap. 8615-8623.  aA five-membered cyclo-carbonate, prepared by cycloaddition reaction from COâ and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether, was reacted with excessive diamine and formed a urethane group-containing new product.

The strengthened hydrogen bonding enlarged the cohesion of the polyurethane coatings and prohibited the solvents from permeating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3acarbon dioxide 3acoatings 3acohesion 3acycloaddition reactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3amanufacturing 3amoieties 3apolyurethanes 3asolvents 3astrength (mechanics) 3aurethane1 aKe, Jiexi1 aWang, Junwei1 aKang, Maoqing1 aWang, Feng1 aZhao, Yuhua1 aLi, Qifeng0 tRSC advances.g2018 Feb. 23, v. 8, no. 16 p.8615-8623dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra12180f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002300171245010900194300001600303520171300319592002802032650002102060650001102081650001002092650001402102650001902116650001302135650001802148650002502166650001702191650002702208650004302235650000902278650002902287650001202316650005202328650003902380650000902419650003602428650005602464650000902520650001702529650001702546700002202563700002402585700002202609700002202631773008502653856008602738990002302824852000902847655001202856IND60091805120221118054748.0141103e20111124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009180512DNAL7 a220355672pmid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2011.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Ana F.B.10aShort-term, moderate exercise is capable of inducing structural, bdnf-independent hippocampal plasticity  ap. 111-122.  aExercise is known to improve cognitive functions and to induce neuroprotection. In this study we used a short-term, moderate intensity treadmill exercise protocol to investigate the effects of exercise on usual markers of hippocampal synaptic and structural plasticity, such as synapsin I (SYN), synaptophysin (SYP), neurofilaments (NF), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), glutamate receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR2/3, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and real-time PCR were used. We also evaluated the number of cells positive for the proliferation marker 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), the neurogenesis marker doublecortin (DCX) and the plasma corticosterone levels. Adult male Wistar rats were adapted to a treadmill and divided into 4 groups: sedentary (SED), 3-day exercise (EX3), 7-day exercise (EX7) and 15-day exercise (EX15). The protein changes detected were increased levels of NF68 and MAP2 at EX3, of SYN at EX7 and of GFAP at EX15, accompanied by a decreased level of GluR1 at EX3. Immunohistochemical findings revealed a similar pattern of changes. The real-time PCR analysis disclosed only an increase of MAP2 mRNA at EX7. We also observed an increased number of BrdU-positive cells and DCX-positive cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus at all time points and increased corticosterone levels at EX3 and EX7. These results reveal a positive effect of short-term, moderate treadmill exercise on hippocampal plasticity. This effect was in general independent of transcriptional processes and of BDNF upregulation, and occurred even in the presence of increased corticosterone levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadults 3abrain 3acognition 3acorticosterone 3aexercise 3aglutamic acid 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aneurogenesis 3aneuroprotective effect 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factorxbiosynthesis 2aHippocampusxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aNeuronal Plasticityxphysiology 2aPhysical Conditioning, Animalxmethodsxphysiology. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTime Factors1 aReal, Caroline C.1 aRodrigues, Alice C.1 aAlves, Adilson S.1 aBritto, Luiz R.G.0 tBrain research.g2011 Nov. 24, v. 1425 p.111-122dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2011.10.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007100168300001600239520089100255592002801146650001401174650001101188650001701199650001201216650002601228650001001254650001101264650001301275650001901288650002201307700002501329773011901354856008201473852000901555655001201564IND60619881520221117231531.0181102e195903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061988152DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517559029003062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteele, Richard10aDensity Changes in Cellulose Treated With Urea-Formaldehyde Resins  ap. 228-234.  aDensity changes produced in cotton and rayon fabrics by treatment with four thermo setting resin precondensates have been determined in density gradient columns. With the assumption that the density of resin cured in vitro corresponds to its density in the fiber, the results indicate that the predominant effect is fiber swelling, with very little resin being deposited in void spaces not previously accessible to the solvent mixture in the gradient column. Scouring the treated fabric to remove reaction residues lowers the density, indicating that the fiber structure does not collapse, presumably because it is stabilized by the reacted resin. The effect of resin concentration on moisture regain was also determined with these samples. The results are consistent with the changes in mechanical properties observed for cross-linking and non-cross-linking resins on cotton and rayon.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3acotton 3acrosslinking 3afabrics 3amechanical properties 3arayon 3aresins 3asolvents 3atextile fibers 3aurea formaldehyde1 aSchiwall, Raymond P.0 tTextile research journal.g1959 Mar., v. 29, no. 3 p.228-234dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517559029003063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01786naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013300155300001800288520084000306592002801146650001901174650002101193650003201214650001601246650001301262650001701275773012101292856007401413852000901487655001201496IND60618172220221120090958.0181029e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061817222DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra12184a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAizawa, T.10aFabrication of porosity-controlled polyethylene terephthalate porous materials using a COâ-assisted polymer compression method  ap. 3061-3068.  aThe objective of this study is to fabricate porosity-controlled polyethylene terephthalate porous materials using a COâ-assisted polymer compression (CAPC) method. In a previous study, the CAPC method was used to fabricate porous polymer materials by compressing fabric sheets in the presence of COâ. However, the controllability of the porosity was not clear in the previous study. In this study, it is shown that the porosity of porous polymer materials could be easily controlled by adjusting the operating conditions of the CAPC method, using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nonwoven fabric sheets. Using mercury porosimetry, a decrease in the porosity induced by compression accompanied by a decrease in the pore size is demonstrated.

DH-1 generated by adaptive laboratory evolution  ap. 234.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Methane, a main component of natural gas and biogas, has gained much attention as an abundant and low-cost carbon source. Methanotrophs, which can use methane as a sole carbon and energy source, are promising hosts to produce value-added chemicals from methane, but their metabolic engineering is still challenging. In previous attempts to produce lactic acid (LA) from methane, LA production levels were limited in part due to LA toxicity. We solved this problem by generating an LA-tolerant strain, which also contributes to understanding novel LA tolerance mechanisms. RESULTS: In this study, we engineered a methanotroph strain Methylomonas sp. DH-1 to produce D-lactic acid (D-LA) from methane. LA toxicity is one of the limiting factors for high-level production of LA. Therefore, we first performed adaptive laboratory evolution of Methylomonas sp. DH-1, generating an LA-tolerant strain JHM80. Genome sequencing of JHM80 revealed the causal gene watR, encoding a LysR-type transcription factor, whose overexpression due to a 2-bp (TT) deletion in the promoter region is partly responsible for the LA tolerance of JHM80. Overexpression of the watR gene in wild-type strain also led to an increase in LA tolerance. When D form-specific lactate dehydrogenase gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ATCC 8293 was introduced into the genome while deleting the glgA gene encoding glycogen synthase, JHM80 produced about 7.5-fold higher level of D-LA from methane than wild type, suggesting that LA tolerance is a critical limiting factor for LA production in this host. D-LA production was further enhanced by optimization of the medium, resulting in a titer of 1.19Â g/L and a yield of 0.245Â g/g CHâ. CONCLUSIONS: JHM80, an LA-tolerant strain of Methylomonas sp. DH-1, generated by adaptive laboratory evolution was effective in LA production from methane. Characterization of the mutated genes in JHM80 revealed that overexpression of the watR gene, encoding a LysR-type transcription factor, is responsible for LA tolerance. By introducing a heterologous lactate dehydrogenase gene into the genome of JHM80 strain while deleting the glgA gene, high D-LA production titer and yield were achieved from methane.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016M3D3A01913245cNational Research Foundation of Korea0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides 3aMethylomonas 3abiogas 3acarbon 3aenergy 3aevolution 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglycogen (starch) synthase 3ahosts 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alactic acid 3ametabolic engineering 3amethane 3amethanotrophs 3anatural gas 3apromoter regions 3asequence analysis 3atoxicity 3atranscription factors 3avalue added1 aKim, SuJin,1 aKim, Wonsik1 aKim, Sungil1 aCha, Seungwoo1 aMoon, Hankyeol1 aHur, Dong Hoon1 aKim, Seon-Young1 aNa, Jeong-Geol1 aLee, Jin Won1 aLee, Eun Yeol1 aHahn, Ji-Sook0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2019 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.234-234dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-019-1574-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007000168300001800238500001900256520135000275592002801625650002301653650002201676650001501698650001501713650002201728650001201750650001701762650002601779650001801805650001101823650001901834650001101853650001301864650001801877650002601895650001401921650002101935650001001956650001501966650002101981700002202002700002102024700002002045700001502065700001802080700002502098773016302123856008202286852000902368655001202377IND60701177720221120125603.0200707e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070117772DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-020-02718-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, E.

Milled ryegrass straw (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), treated straw, and the biochar produced from the straw with chemical activation with sodium hydroxide solution were used as adsorbent materials. To obtain the biochar, the pyrolysis was performed in a tubular reactor with nitrogen flow at 623Â K. The characterization of all the adsorbents was realized analyzing the real density, bulk density, particle diameter, proximate analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. Kinetic studies and adsorption isotherms were evaluated with models fit predicted in the literature. The biochar showed a well-developed porous structure. In the treated straw, there occurred a degradation of compounds such as hemicelluloses and lignin, which gave the modification in the surface of the material. For the kinetic studies, the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and Avrami models presented a good fit. For the adsorption isotherms, the Sips model provided the maximum adsorption capacity to the milled straw (28.7Â mg/g) and treated straw (67.19Â mg/g). The most promising results were obtained by the treated straw, with high efficiency in the removal of the methylene blue dye from the solution, reaching values higher than 99%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium multiflorum 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abiochar 3abulk density 3aenvironmental science 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3aproximate composition 3apyrolysis 3asodium hydroxide 3astraw 3atechnology 3athermogravimetry1 ados Santos, V.

Cytokines have been widely assessed as potential biomarkers in this disease, but none of the cytokines studied has evidenced a sufficient specificity or sensitivity to be routinely employed in clinical practice. In this pilot study, we profiled 17 immune mediators in the plasma of 29 consecutively recruited patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, during the first 24h following admission to the ICU, by using a Bio-Plex Human Cytokine 17-Plex Panel (Bio-Rad). Patients were 66.1year old in average. Twelve patients of our cohort died during hospitalization at the ICU, eight of them in the first 72h due to multiorganic dysfunction syndrom (MODS). Levels in plasma of three pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1) and of an immunosuppressive one (IL-10) were higher in those patients with fatal outcome. We developed a combined score with those cytokines showing to better predict mortality in our cohort based on the results of Cox regression analysis. This way, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were included in the score. Patients were split into two groups based on the percentile 75 (P75) of the plasma levels of these three interleukins. Those patients showing at least one interleukin value higher than P75 were given the value â1â. Those patients showing IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 levels below P75 were given the value â0â. Hazard ratios for mortality at day 3 and day 28th obtained with the combined score were 2â3-fold higher than those obtained with the individual interleukins values. In conclusion, we have described a combined cytokine score associated with a worse outcome in patients with sepsis, which may represent a new avenue to be explored for guiding treatment decisions in this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3adeath 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3amortality 3apatients 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aseptic shock 2aAged 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsximmunology 2aFemale 2aHospitalizationxstatistics & numerical data 2aHumans 2aInflammation Mediatorsximmunology 2aInterleukinsximmunology 2aKaplan-Meier Estimate 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPrognosis 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aRegression Analysis 2aSepsisximmunologyxmortality. 0aSpainxepidemiology.1 aBobillo, Felipe1 aIglesias, VerÃ³nica,1 aAlmansa, Raquel1 aRico, LucÃ­a1 aGandÃ­a, Francisco1 aResino, Salvador1 aTamayo, Eduardo1 ade Lejarazu, Raul Ortiz1 aBermejo-Martin, JesÃºs F.0 tCytokine.g2012 Mar., v. 57, no. 3 p.332-336dElsevier Ltdx1043-46667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.12.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02024naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005600155245005900211500002200270520090200292592002801194650002401222650002001246650001801266650001201284650002501296653002501321653003801346653005001384700006001434700001501494773007801509856009001587852000901677655001201686IND60674950020221122041140.0191031e20191020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067495002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2019.1056722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1618-466010aMethodology of Dry and Wet Compressibility Measurement  aPre-press version  aThis paper describes a methodology to obtain and analyse data in composite reinforcement fabric compaction tests in dry and saturated conditions using a standard electromechanical test machine and an indirect thickness measurement method.The main goal is the identification of machine compliance sources and the understanding of its effects in typical compression tests and compression with relaxation stage tests. This methodology was used in the first international compressibility benchmark exercise promoted by NPL (National Physics Laboratory, UK) in the years 2017 and 2018. The methodology accounts for the test setup compliance and evaluates errors in fabric thickness measurements in the range of tens of microns especially during the relaxation phase. Overall, the setup compliance and data analysis strategy proved to have a significant effect on the data if not properly accounted for.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3acompressibility 3adata analysis 3afabrics 3asaturated conditions 0a(A) Fabrics/textiles 0a(E) Resin transfer moulding (RTM) 0aCompressibility of dry and wet reinforcements1 aLomov, Stepan V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8194-49131 aIvens, Jan0 tComposites.g2019 Oct. 20, dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2019.1056723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012900167300001600296520147800312592002801790650002701818650002801845650001301873650001201886650001801898650002001916650003101936650002901967650003801996650000902034650001502043650001102058650004302069650001902112650005202131650002202183650002902205650002602234650001702260650000902277700001602286700001302302700001502315700002102330700001102351700002502362700001702387773010502404856008402509852000902593655001202602IND60084000820221121123834.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008400082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resmic.2011.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Jinbo10aGenome analysis and characterization of zinc efflux systems of a highly zinc-resistant bacterium, Comamonas testosteroni S44  ap. 671-679.  aA novel and multiple metal(loid)-resistant strain Comamonas testosteroni S44 with a high ZnÂ²âº resistance level (10Â mM) was isolated. To understand the molecular basis for the high zinc resistance, whole genome sequencing was performed and revealed a large number of genes encoding putative metal(loid) resistance proteins, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events that may have occurred to adapt to a metal(loid)-contaminated environment. In particular, 9 putative ZnÂ²âº transporters [4 znt operons encoding putative ZnÂ²âº-translocating P-type ATPases and 5 czc operons encoding putative RND-driven (resistance, nodulation, cell division protein family)] tripartite protein complexes were identified. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the four zntA-like genes were all induced by ZnÂ²âº, while czcA genes were either ZnÂ²âº-induced or downregulated by ZnÂ²âº. Furthermore, a zntR1A1 operon encoding a ZntR-type regulator and a P-type ATPase was studied in detail. The zntR1 deletion strain (S44ÎzntR1) displayed intermediate resistance to ZnÂ²âº (6Â mM) and accumulated more intracellular ZnÂ²âº. Reporter gene expression assays indicated that ZntR1 responded to ZnÂ²âº, CdÂ²âº and PbÂ²âº, with ZnÂ²âº being the best inducer. Gene transcription analysis indicated that ZntR1 was a regulator for transcription of zntA1, while other putative ZntR-type regulators may also regulate the transcription expression of zntA1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aComamonas testosteroni 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abacteria 3acadmium 3acell division 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3ainterspersed repetitive sequences 3alead 3anodulation 3aoperon 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areporter genes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atransporters 3azinc1 aLi, Dongmei1 aLi, Hang1 aHe, Minyan1 aMiller, Susan J.1 aYu, Lu1 aRensing, Christopher1 aWang, Gejiao0 tResearch in microbiology.g2011 Sept., v. 162, no. 7 p.671-679dElsevier Masson SASx0923-25087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2011.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03802naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245012900196300001600325500001900341500002000360520206200380592002802442596005202470596005902522596005902581650001902640650002802659650002902687650000902716650002102725650000902746650001502755650000902770700001402779700005702793700001702850700001802867700001602885700001602901700001702917700001802934700005602952700006803008700001703076773012103093856007303214852000903287655001203296IND60720682920221122230119.0201216e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072068292DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.154102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Zhisheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6242-242610aElevated atmospheric CO2 reduces yieldâscaled N2O fluxes from subtropical rice systems: Six siteâyears field experiments  ap. 327-339.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIncreasing levels of atmospheric COâ are expected to enhance crop yields and alter soil greenhouse gas fluxes from rice paddies. While elevated COâ (ECO2) effects on CHâ emissions from rice paddies have been studied in some detail, little is known how ECO2 might affect NâO fluxes or yieldâscaled emissions. Here, we report on a multiâsite, multiâyear inâsitu FACE (freeâair COâ enrichment) study, aiming to determine NâO fluxes and crop yields from Chinese subtropical rice systems as affected by ECO2. In this study, we tested various N fertilization and residue addition treatments, with rice being grown under either ECO2 (+200Â Î¼mol/mol) or ambient control. Across the six siteâyears, rice straw and grain yields under ECO2 were increased by 9%â40% for treatments fertilized with â¥150Â kgÂ N/ha, while seasonal NâO emissions were decreased by 23%â73%. Consequently, yieldâscaled NâO emissions were significantly lower under ECO2. For treatments receiving insufficient fertilization (â¤125Â kgÂ N/ha), however, no significant ECO2 effects on NâO emissions were observed. The mitigating effect of ECO2 upon NâO emissions is closely associated with plant N uptake and a reduction of soil N availability. Nevertheless, increases in yieldâscaled NâO emissions with increasing N surplus suggests that N surplus is a useful indicator for assessing NâO emissions from rice paddies. Our findings indicate that with rising atmospheric COâ soil NâO emissions from rice paddies will decrease, given that the farmersâ N fertilization is usually sufficient for crop growth. The expected decrease in NâO emissions was calculated to compensate 24% of the simultaneously observed increase in CHâ emissions under ECO2. This shows that for an agronomic and environmental assessment of ECO2 effects on rice systems, not only CHâ emissions, but also NâO fluxes and yieldâscaled emissions need to be considered for identifying most climateâfriendly and economically viable options for future rice production.  aPublisher supplied data  aZDBSâLYâDQCOO7cChinese Academy of Sciences  a41977282cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41675144cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenvironmental assessment 3aface 3agreenhouse gases 3arice 3arice straw 3asoil1 aWang, Rui1 aZheng, Xunhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4138-74701 aMei, Baoling1 aZhou, Zaixing1 aXie, Baohua1 aDong, Haibo1 aLiu, Chunyan1 aHan, Shenghui1 aXu, Zhongjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7515-95721 aButterbachâBahl, Klaus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9499-65981 aZhu, Jianguo0 tGlobal change biology.g2021 Jan., v. 27, no. 2 p.327-339dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.154103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003500148245010300183300001600286520135500302592002801657653002801685653002201713653001201735653002301747653001901770700003601789700002601825773012601851856008401977852000902061655001202070IND60128856620221122020936.0151116e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012885662DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-2585-41.4.5452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, Fernando de Freitas10aAntennal Sensilla of the New World Screwworm Fly, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Diptera: Calliphoridae)  ap. 545-551.  aAntennal sensilla of the Cochliomyia hominivorax were studied by scanning electron microscopy. Thirteen subtypes of sensilla were identified in the fly antenna. In the antennal funiculus, nine subtypes were found: one trichoid, three basiconic, and five coeloconic. Among these, olfactory sensilla were morphologically recognized. Long bristle sensilla presenting various sizes and distribution patterns were observed in the scape and pedicel. In this segment, two other types of tricoid sensilla were still observed. The three antennal segments were shown to be coved by smaller spinules of the microtrichia type. No type of sensillum was seen in the aristas of C. hominivorax. Consistent differences between the sexes in typology, topography, and quantity of antennal sensilla were verified. The great variety of sensillary subtypes, presenting wall pores and/or grooves, found in the funiculus of C. hominivorax, indicates the olfaction should play an important role in this species behavior and communication. The data of the current study, besides corroborating in the amplification of the morphologic and ultrastructural knowledge of C. hominivorax, can foment future electrophysiological studies for the development of volatile semiochemicals, to be uses as attractants in traps, as a new alternative to monitoring and/or controlling this fly.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCochliomyia hominivorax 0ascrewworm myiasis 0aantenna 0aolfactory sensilla 0aultrastructure1 aPimenta, Paulo Filemon Paolucci1 aLinardi, Pedro Marcos0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2004 July, v. 41, no. 4 p.545-551dEntomology Dept., B.P.

The highest mean ETA rates were determined for water bodies (658 mm/year) and wetlands (622 mm/year). Forests have higher values than agricultural areas, and the lowest rates belong to artificial surfaces. Mean annual runoff is the largest on artificial surfaces (89 mm/year), and it decreases on the other land cover types. For climate change impact analysis a Budyko-model was used in spatially-distributed mode. The parameter of the Budyko-model (Î±) was calculated for pixels without surplus water. For the extra-water affected pixels a linear model with Î²-parameter (actual evapotranspiration / panevapotranspiration) was used. These parameters (Î± and Î²) can be used for evaluating future ETA and R in spatially-distributed mode. According to the predictions, the mean annual evapotranspiration may increase about 27 mm while the runoff may decrease to the one third to the present amount by end of the century  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aclimate change 3aevapotranspiration 3aforests 3alinear models 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3arunoff 3asurface water 3awetlands 3aHungary 0aevapotranspiration / runoff / land cover / Budyko-model / climate change 0aevapotranszspiracio / lefolyas / felszinboritas / Budyko-modell / klimavaltozas1 aKalicz, PÃ©ter1 aBrolly, GÃ¡bor BÃ©la1 aCsÃ³ka, Gergely1 aCzimber, KornÃ©l1 aGribovszki, ZoltÃ¡n0 tActa silvatica & lignaria Hungarica.g2014 Dec. 30, v. 10, no. 2 p.115-129dDe Gruyter Openx1787-064X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aslh-2014-00093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01909naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245013800162300001400300520094900314592002801263650002001291650001401311650002701325650001301352650001301365650002501378650001501403773010501418856007501523852000901598655001201607IND60637543120221120041151.0190419e20130823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063754312DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1982.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElkner, Krystyna14aThe influence of different moisture contents and nitrogen levels on the formation of empty cavities in cucumbers (Cucumis sativus L.)  ap. 61-68.  aEmpty cavities were found already in very young cucumber fruits with diameter 1.5 cm. As the fruit develops the empty cavities augment and the number of fruits showing this defect increases. Low soil moisture and high nitrogen fertilization favour the formation of empty cavities. Their origination and changes were traced with anatomical methods in the course of fruit development. As a most plausible cause of their origination the author considers the enlargement of only part of the cells of the suture between the two (or three) carples. Due to this uneven enlargement of neighbouring cells strong mechanical tension probably arises amoung them, leading to the formation of ruptures separating these cells, consequently causing the separation of the carpel edges. Besides that, some of the cells of the suture which have markedly enlarged, often burst which also contributes to the formation of an empty cavity and enlarges its dimensions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis sativus 3acucumbers 3afertilizer application 3afruiting 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asoil water0 tActa agrobotanica.g, v. 35, no. 1 p.61-68dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:14720x2300-357X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/aa.1982.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002000188245011800208300001200326506007600338520200300414592002802417596002502445506003702470650002702507650002302534650002502557650001502582650001002597650001602607650001402623650002202637651001202659700001902671700002602690700002202716700001802738700002302756700002802779700002002807700002202827700001802849700002502867700002302892773011302915856008203028852000903110655001203119IND60671498520221207074246.0211015e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067149852DNAL7 a315510742pmid7 aPMC67574172pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-019-3720-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourquia, Maria10aUpdate of the species checklist of Culicoides Latreille, 1809 biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) of Morocco  ap. 459.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Investigations of Culicoides fauna, including inventories, were carried out in Morocco at different periods after the country had faced major bluetongue and African horse sickness outbreaks. However, no comprehensive reference publication has provided a clear overview of the Culicoides species diversity. This study reviewed available data on Culicoides biting midge species in Morocco from 1968 to 2015 (published and grey literature in French and English) in order to revise the current checklist, in light of state of the art taxonomic and systematic knowledge, and confirmed the checklist with morphological and molecular identifications of specimens collected from the region of Rabat. METHODS: Literature related to Culicoides collections in Morocco was collated. Authors were contacted to obtain raw data and additional information for the collections. Fresh Culicoides material was collected and examined from two sites around Rabat, the capital of Morocco. Each collected individual was examined and morphologically identified, if possible, to the species level. In addition, molecular identification was performed to separate closely related species, to confirm difficult morphological identifications and to confirm new species records. RESULTS: A total of 6121 individuals of Culicoides spp. were collected and analyzed and at least 17 species were identified: C. cataneii/C. gejgelensis, C. circumscriptus, C. fagineus, C. festivipennis, C. imicola, C. jumineri, C. kingi, C. longipennis, C. montanus, C. newsteadi, C. obsoletus, C. paolae, C. parotti, C. puncticollis, C. sahariensis, C. scoticus and C. subfagineus. Seven species were confirmed using phylogenetic analyses. Two new species records for Morocco are reported: C. paolae and C. subfagineus. CONCLUSIONS: The Moroccan fauna of Culicoides now includes 54 valid species. Further work would certainly increase this total, as one of the clades we identified was not affiliated to any described and valid species.  aPublisher supplied data  a36867VHcPHC Toubkal0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican horse sickness 3aCulicoides imicola 3aCulicoides obsoletus 3abluetongue 3afauna 3ainventories 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3aMorocco1 aGarros, Claire1 aRakotoarivony, Ignace1 aGardÃ¨s, Laetitia1 aHuber, Karine1 aBoukhari, Intissar1 aDelÃ©colle, Jean-Claude1 aBaldet, Thierry1 aMignotte, Antoine1 aLhor, Youssef1 aKhallaayoune, Khalid1 aBalenghien, Thomas0 tParasites & vectors.g2019 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.459-459dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-019-3720-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245016200172300001600334520115100350592002801501653001401529653002501543653002501568653001401593653001301607700001501620700001501635700002501650700001901675773012601694856008401820852000901904655001201913IND60128856820221121232313.0151116e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012885682DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-2585-41.4.5612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwono-ambene, H.

To date, the An. nili group includes the species Anopheles nili s.s. and its pale-winged variant known as the ââCongo form,ââ Anopheles somalicus and Anopheles carnevalei. Larval and adult mosquito collections in the forest region of Campo, in southern Cameroon, uncovered an additional morphological variant provisionally called ââOveng formââ that was subsequently found to be genetically distinct from the other members of the An. nili group. In this study, we provide further biological data that characterizes this new taxon and justifies elevation to specific rank. We propose calling this new species Anopheles ovengensis, after its geographical origin. We present a morphological description of the adult female and fourth instars and original data on the biology, ecology, and role as a human malaria vector of this new species in its type location. We provide dichotomous keys for identification of adult females and fourth instars that can be used at least in tropical areas of west and central Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 0abionomics 0aAnopheles ovengensis 0aAnopheles nili group 0aCulicidae 0aCameroon1 aKengne, P.1 aSimard, F.1 aAntonio-Nkondjio, C.1 aFontenille, D.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2004 July, v. 41, no. 4 p.561-568dEntomology Dept., B.P.

This separation hinders mother-infant attachment and the establishment of breastfeeding. Currently, little is known about Chinese mothersâ experiences breastfeeding their preterm infants, or their support needs. The aim of this study was to develop an understanding of mothersâ experiences breastfeeding a hospitalized preterm infant and the support needed to establish a milk supply during the period separation from their infants. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted in Beijing in 2017. A total of 11 Chinese mothers were individually interviewed while separated from their infants. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis involving a seven-step protocol identified key themes. RESULTS: Mothers of preterm infants reported physically and mentally challenging breastfeeding experiences during the period they were separated from their babies. They viewed expressing breast milk as integral to their maternal role, even though some found expressing breastmilk exhausting. With little professional support available, the mothers depended upon nonprofessionals to establish breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified the difficulties mothers experienced establishing a milk supply while separated from their preterm infants, and the importance of access to health professional support.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3adescriptive studies 3ainfants 3ainterviews 3amilk 3amothers 3apremature birth 3aqualitative analysis 3aChina1 aBrandon, Debra1 aLu, Hong1 aCong, Xiaomei0 tInternational breastfeeding journal.g2019 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.45-45dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001833x1746-43587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13006-019-0242-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01425naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245010500159300001400264520044200278592002800720650001800748650000900766650002100775650001900796650001400815650001300829650001900842650000900861650001100870700001700881773010500898856007501003852000901078655001201087IND60637543320221120054505.0190419e20130823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063754332DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1982.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHegazi, E.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most important pathogen causing severe lower respiratory tract infections. Here we present a novel surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enzyme-catalyzed immunoassay of RSV by employing peroxidase substrate 3, 3â²â5, 5â²-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as Raman molecule. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) attached to the detection antibody in a novel sandwich immunoassay catalyzes the oxidation of TMB by H2O2 to give a radical cation (TMBâº), which could be easily adsorbed on the negatively charged surface of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) through electrostatic interaction, inducing the aggregation of AgNPs and thus giving a strong SERS signal. A linear relationship was obtained between the Raman intensity and the amount of RSV in the range from 0.5 to 20pg/mL, and the minimum detectable concentration of this SERS-based enzyme immunoassay was 0.05pg/mL, which was 20 times lower than that found in the colorimetric method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acatalytic activity 3acations 3acolorimetry 3aearly diagnosis 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenzyme immunoassays 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananosilver 3aoxidation 3apathogens 3aperoxidase 3arespiratory tract diseases 3ascreening 3aviruses 0aEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 0aSurface-enhanced Raman scattering 0aRespiratory syncytial virus 0a3, 3â²â5, 5â²-Tetramethylbenzidine1 aZhen, Shu Jun1 aWan, Xiao Yan1 aGao, Peng Fei1 aHuang, Cheng Zhi0 tTalanta.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 148 p.308-312dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.10.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245006800213300001400281506007600295520118700371592002801558506003701586650001801623650001601641650002601657650002301683650001601706650002901722650001201751650001901763650002601782650002501808650002601833650002301859650001701882700006201899700006101961773010902022856008202131852000902213655001202222IND60674950920221207102250.0200210e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067495092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2019.10.0072doi7 aPMC69089672pmcid7 a317438412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBozhÃ¼yÃ¼k, Kenan AJ10aEngineering enzymatic assembly lines to produce new antibiotics  ap. 88-96.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNumerous important therapeutic agents, including widely-used antibiotics, anti-cancer drugs, immunosuppressants, agrochemicals and other valuable compounds, are produced by microorganisms. Many of these are biosynthesised by modular enzymatic assembly line polyketide synthases, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, and hybrids thereof. To alter the backbone structure of these valuable but difficult to modify compounds, the respective enzymatic machineries can be engineered to create even more valuable molecules with improved properties and/or to bypass resistance mechanisms. In the past, many attempts to achieve assembly line pathway engineering failed or led to enzymes with compromised activity. Recently our understanding of assembly line structural biology, including an appreciation of the conformational changes that occur during the catalytic cycle, have improved hugely. This has proven to be a driving force for new approaches and several recent examples have demonstrated the production of new-to-nature molecules, including anti-infectives. We discuss the developments of the last few years and highlight selected, illuminating examples of assembly line engineering.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagrochemicals 3aantibiotics 3aantineoplastic agents 3acatalytic activity 3aengineering 3aimmunosuppressive agents 3aligases 3amicroorganisms 3anonribosomal peptides 3apolyketide synthases 3aresistance mechanisms 3astructural biology 3atherapeutics1 aMicklefield, Jason1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8951-48731 aWilkinson, Barrie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7646-71740 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2019 Oct., v. 51 p.88-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2019.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01571naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007600165300001500241520064300256592002800899650001300927650003100940650001500971650001500986650001701001650001001018700001401028700001401042773011001056856008201166852000901248655001201257IND60674951020221120040221.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067495102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2019.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yong-Xin10aReductionist synthetic community approaches in root microbiome research  ap. 97-102.  aSynthetic community (SynCom) approaches can provide functional and mechanistic insights into how plants regulate their microbiomes, and how the microbiome in turn influences plant growth and health.

However, the detection of furfural involves the employment of expensive instruments and/or time-consuming laboratorial operations. In this paper, we proposed a convenient electrochemical method to make the detection. The quantification of furfural was realized by extraction of furfural from oil phase to aqueous phase followed by reductive detection of furfural with differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) at a mercury electrode. This method is very sensitive and the limit of detection, corresponding to furfural contained in oil, is estimated to be 0.03Î¼ggâ»Â¹. Furthermore, excellent linearity can be obtained in the range of 0â10Î¼ggâ»Â¹. These features make the method very suitable for the determination of furfural in real situation. A fully automated instrument that can perform the operations of extraction and detection was developed, and this instrument enables the whole measurement to be finished within eight minutes. The methodology and the instrument were tested with real samples, and very favorable agreement between results obtained with this instrument and HPLC indicates that the proposed method along with instrument can be employed as a facile tool to diagnose the health status of aged transformers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afurfural 3ahealth status 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainsulating materials 3amercury 3aoils 0aDifferential pulse voltammetry 0aFurfural 0aInsulation oil 0aAutomated instrument1 aHuang, Xinjian1 aWang, Lishi0 tTalanta.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 148 p.412-418dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.10.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245011400151300001600265500002000281500001500301520103800316592002801354650002201382650001701404650001301421650002501434650002701459650002601486650001501512650001201527650001901539650001501558651001201573653002201585773013101607852000901738856007201747655001201819IND2321041220221121063343.0190314e200012  sw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232104122DNAL7 a10.2307/32365582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraae, B.J.14aThe effect of landscape fragmentation and forest continuity on forest floor species in two regions of Denmark  ap. 881-892.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-05  aForest species composition was recorded in 82 forests in the Himmerland and Hornsherred regions in Denmark and analysed with respect to isolation (distance to other forests and areas of forest), forest continuity (older or younger than 200 yr), soil pH, tree species composition and seed dispersal groups. Continuity and isolation measures were correlated with forest species richness in Hornsherred. Myrmecochorous, autochorous, anemoballistic and endozoochorous species were markedly fewer in recent than in ancient forests. In Himmerland, patterns were much weaker and few significant correlations were found between forest species richness or different seed dispersal groups and continuity or isolation of the forests. Differences between the two regions may result from less intensive land use, a more humid climate and a smaller species pool with less species with short distance dispersal in Himmerland. Landscape fragmentation therefore appears to limit forest speciesârecolonization more in Hornsherred than in Himmerland.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeciduous forests 3aforest trees 3atree age 3aspatial distribution 3ageographical variation 3abotanical composition 3alandscapes 3asoil pH 3aseed dispersal 3aunderstory 3aDenmark 0aspecies diversity0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2000 Dec., v. 11, no. 6 p.881-892dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2307/32365583Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03260naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010000173300001600273520198900289592002802278650000902306650002002315650002002335650001202355650001202367650001102379650002402390650001302414650001502427650001402442650003302456650002102489650001402510650002402524650001702548650001402565650001302579651001102592700002502603700002102628773009602649856004802745852000902793655001202802IND50065991920221120090718.0130427e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006599192DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-012-9294-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, F. A., Jr.10aSoil attributes and leaf nitrogen estimating sugar cane quality parameters: Brix, pol and fibre  ap. 270-289.  aThe area of sugar cane production in Brazil has substantially increased in the last few years due to the high demand for ethanol. It is estimated that the actual area, which is approximately 8Â Mha, will increase to as much as 15Â Mha in the next 10Â years. In addition to enlarging the boundaries and installing new industrial units, sugar cane expansion demands better use of production areas and improvement of both yield and quality, combined with a reduction of production costs. Thus, models that can describe the behaviour of sugar cane quality parameters could be important in understanding the effects of soil and plant attributes on these parameters. The objective of this work was to fit mathematical models to the sugar cane Brix, pol and fibre parameters using physical soil attributes, chemical soil attributes and leaf nitrogen as predictors from the previous year. This work was carried out in an area of 10Â ha located in Araras, SP, Brazil, from November 2008 until July 2011 in the first (plant cane), second (first ratoon) and third (second ratoon) cycles of the crop. The chemical soil attributes analysed were the macronutrients and micronutrients, and the soil physical attribute analysed was the soil texture. The variables used in the models were chosen using principal component analysis (PCA), and the fit of the models was made as the mean of multiple regressions. The results were compared using kriging to map the Brix, pol and fibre with the true and estimated values. The Brix, pol and fibre models presented R Â² values of 0.17, 0.06 and 0.18, respectively, for the first ratoon of the crop and 0.23, 0.19 and 0.52, respectively, for the second ratoon. These results allowed the estimation of Brix, pol and fibre with estimation errors less than 1Â % for the first and second ratoons. The PCA approach identified soil organic matter, phosphorus and potassium as the soil attributes that had the higher variance of the dataset during the years studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrix 3acrop production 3adata collection 3aethanol 3akriging 3aleaves 3amathematical models 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproduction costs 3aratooning 3asoil organic matter 3asoil texture 3asugarcane 3avariance 3aBrazil1 aMagalhÃ£es, P.

Both also exhibit similar network features. Recent technological advances, especially in electron microscopy, now allow us to determine synaptic circuits and identify pathways cell-by-cell, as part of the flyâs connectome. Genetic tools provide the means to identify synaptic components, as well as to record and manipulate neuronal activity, adding function to the connectome.

Aggregation was also related to the proportion of fly-resistant and fly-susceptible cattle in a herd. Herds were grouped according to their degree of horn fly aggregation. Low aggregation herds included larger framed Angus, Horned Hereford, Polled Hereford, and Red Poll breeds. Moderate aggregation occurred with Brahman, Charolais, small-framed Angus, mixed cows, and Hereford ÃÃ Charolais cross. High aggregation occurred with Chianina and mixed herds. Relationships between the sample means and variances varied among aggregation groups. A resampling approach was used to determine the influence of random sampling of a herd on the proportion of horn fly population estimates within fixed percentages of the true mean. The proportion of sample means within Â±Â± 5, 10, 15, and 20% of the true means varied with the proportion of the herd sampled, the mean and variance of fly density, and herd size. Recommendations for obtaining sample size to estimate fly density within a fixed percentage of the true mean are given.  aPublisher supplied data 0ahorn fly 0aaggregation 0asampling 0afly-resistant 0afly-susceptible1 aSteelman, C.

With the growing awareness that rare sequence variants may be important in human quantitative variation, heritability and association study designs involving large pedigrees will increase in frequency due to the greater chance of observing multiple copies of rare variants among related individuals. Therefore, it is important to have statistical genetic test procedures that utilize all available information for extracting evidence regarding genetic association. Optimal testing for marker/phenotype association involves the exact calculation of the likelihood ratio statistic which requires the repeated inversion of potentially large matrices. In a whole genome sequence association context, such computation may be prohibitive. Toward this end, we have developed a rapid and efficient eigensimplification of the likelihood that makes analysis of family data commensurate with the analysis of a comparable sample of unrelated individuals. Our theoretical results which are based on a spectral representation of the likelihood yield simple exact expressions for the expected likelihood ratio test statistic (ELRT) for pedigrees of arbitrary size and complexity. For heritability, the ELRT iswhere hÂ² and Î»gáµ¢ are, respectively, the heritability and eigenvalues of the pedigree-derived genetic relationship kernel (GRK). For association analysis of sequence variants, the ELRT is given bywhere hâ Â², hq Â², and háµ£ Â² are the total, quantitative trait nucleotide, and residual heritabilities, respectively. Using these results, fast and accurate analytical power analyses are possible, eliminating the need for computer simulation. Additional benefits of eigensimplification include a simple method for calculation of the exact distribution of the ELRT under the null hypothesis which turns out to differ from that expected under the usual asymptotic theory. Further, when combined with the use of empirical GRKsâestimated over a large number of genetic markersâour theory reveals potential problems associated with nonpositive semidefinite kernels. These procedures are being added to our general statistical genetic computer package, SOLAR.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomputer simulation 3acomputers 3agenetic analysis 3aheritability 3ahumans 3amathematical theory 3amodels 3apedigree 3aphenotype 3aquantitative traits 3aseeds 3avariance1 aDiego, Vincent P.1 aDyer, Thomas D.1 aAlmeida, MÃ¡rcio,1 aPeralta, Juan1 aKent, Jack W., Jr.cJr.1 aWilliams, Jeff T.1 aAlmasy, Laura1 aGÃ¶ring, Harald H.H.0 tAdvances in Genetics.g2013, v. 81 p.1-31dElsevier Science & Technologyx0065-26607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-407677-8.00001-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007900173300001600252520157200268592002801840650001501868650001401883650001101897650001301908650003201921650000901953650002101962650001201983650001001995650001102005650001802016650001202034650001002046650003002056650001402086650001402100650002202114650003302136650001302169650001602182700001902198700002502217700002102242773010402263856008402367852000902451655001202460IND60084001820221121155542.0141101e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008400182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resmic.2011.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapafotiou, George10aRegulation of Wolbachia ankyrin domain encoding genes in Drosophila gonads  ap. 764-772.  aThe maternally inherited obligatory intracellular bacterium Wolbachia is a reproductive parasite of many insect species. Wolbachia evades the host immune system, uses the mitotic apparatus to ensure infection of daughter cells, migrates through the host to the gonads and causes reproductive phenotypes, most commonly cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), i.e. incompatibility of sperm from infected males and eggs from uninfected females. Due to the interconnected facts that Wolbachia is not exÂ vivo culturable and that no established transformation system exists, virtually nothing is known about Wolbachia-host interactions at the macromolecular level. Intriguingly, the Wolbachia genome codes for an unusually high number of ankyrin repeat (ANK) proteins. ANKs mediate proteinâprotein interactions in many different contexts. More common in eukaryotes, they also occur in prokaryotes. Some intracellular pathogenic bacteria export ANK effector proteins to the host cytoplasm. This makes the Wolbachia ANK genes candidates for mediating interactions with host cells. We quantified expression of ANK genes of Wolbachia strain wMel in adult gonads and detected host sex-specific regulation of two wMel ANK genes in the gonads in two different backgrounds. Regulation was tissue-specific and independent of host background. We further analyzed expression of their homologues in strains wAu and wRi and found regulation only in wAu. Regulation was tissue-specific and there was no correlation between regulation of these genes and the ability of a strain to induce CI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aWolbachia 3aadults 3abacteria 3acytoplasmic incompatibility 3aeggs 3aeukaryotic cells 3afemales 3agenes 3agonads 3aimmune system 3ainsects 3amales 3amitotic spindle apparatus 3aparasites 3aphenotype 3aprokaryotic cells 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins 3aspermatozoa1 aOehler, Stefan1 aSavakis, Charalambos1 aBourtzis, Kostas0 tResearch in microbiology.g2011 Oct., v. 162, no. 8 p.764-772dElsevier Masson SASx0923-25087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2011.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04057naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100003100167245011000198300001400308520227400322592002802596650001202624650001902636650001002655650001002665650001902675650001402694650001302708650001202721650001702733650001802750650001302768650000902781650003502790650003702825650002102862650001102883650003802894650001102932650002002943650002202963650003202985650002803017650000903045650002603054650001403080650002603094650004203120700002603162700001903188700002003207700002403227773007803251856008203329990002303411852000903434655001203443IND60094340620221117184023.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009434062DNAL7 a222662752pmid7 a10.1016/j.cyto.2011.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapitanoviÄ Vidak, Helena14aThe association between proinflammatory cytokine polymorphisms and cerebral palsy in very preterm infants  ap. 57-64.  aCerebral palsy (CP) is a nonprogressive motor disorder caused by white matter damage in the developing brain and is often accompanied with cognitive and sensory disabilities. The risk of CP is higher among infants born preterm than in more mature infants. Intrauterine infection/inflammation, activation of the cytokine network and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in neonatal blood or in amniotic fluid to which the preterm infant is exposed, has been identified as the most common cause of preterm delivery, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) and CP. The aim of our study was to evaluate the possible association of four TNFÎ± promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (â1031 T/C, â857 C/T, â308 G/A and â238 G/A), two IL1Î² SNPs (â511 C/T and +3954 C/T) and one IL6 (â174 C/G) polymorphism with susceptibility to CP in very preterm infants. Statistically significant association between TNFÎ± â1031 T/C high expression genotypes (TC and CC) (OR, 2.339; p=0.016) as well as between TNFÎ± â1031 C high expression allele (OR, 2.065; p=0.013) and risk of CP was observed. In addition, statistically significant association was found between TNFÎ± TC, CC, GG, GG â1031/â857/â308/â238 genotypes combination (OR, 3.286; p=0.034) and risk of CP. Statistically significant association between IL1Î² TT, CC â511/+3954 genotypes combination and risk of CP (OR, 4.000; p=0.027) was also found. In CP patients with cystic PVL (cPVL) statistically significant association was found between TNFÎ± â1031 T/C high expression genotypes (TC and CC) (OR, 2.361; p=0.038), IL1Î² â511 C/T high expression genotype TT (OR, 3.215; p=0.030) as well as IL1Î² â511 T high expression allele (OR, 1.956; p=0.019) and risk of CP. Statistically significant association was also found in patients with cPVL between TNFÎ± TC, CC, GG, GG â1031/â857/â308/â238 genotypes combination (OR, 4.107; p=0.024), as well as IL1Î² TT, CC â511/+3954 genotypes combination (OR, 7.333; p=0.005) and risk of CP. Our results suggest the role of TNFÎ± and IL1Î² polymorphisms which have previously been associated with higher circulating levels of these cytokines in genetic susceptibility to white matter damage and consequently CP in very preterm infants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aamniotic fluid 3ablood 3abrain 3acerebral palsy 3acognition 3agenotype 3ainfants 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3apatients 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aCerebral Palsyxbloodxgenetics. 2aChild, Preschool 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHumans 2aInfant, Newborn 2aInfant, Premature 2aInterleukin-1betaxgenetics 2aInterleukin-6xgenetics 2aMale 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPregnancy 2aRetrospective Studies 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxgenetics1 aCatela IvkoviÄ, Tina1 aJokiÄ, Mladen1 aSpaventi, Radan1 aKapitanoviÄ, Sanja0 tCytokine.g2012 Apr., v. 58, no. 1 p.57-64dElsevier Ltdx1043-46667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.12.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245008200209300001400291520129500305592002801600650002301628650001901651650001201670650002001682650001101702650001201713650003201725650000901757650002001766650000901786650001401795650001801809650001801827650001401845650002001859653002001879653002201899653002001921653001701941700001901958700002201977700001801999700002102017773009302038856008702131852000902218655001202227IND60591420820221120211712.0190408e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059142082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvseike, Ole1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1748-347010aMeat inspection and hygiene in a Meat Factory Cell â An alternative concept  ap. 32-39.  aThe Meat Factory Cell (MFC) concept differs from conventional abattoirs by partly working in cell stations instead of production lines. It combines and merges elements of today's separate processes and disciplines, namely âslaughterâ and âmeat primal cuttingâ, and âdisassemblesâ the carcass from outside-in where limbs, neck, back and loin are removed before internal organs. The aim of this work is to qualitatively assess future meat inspection and hygiene of pork carcasses in the MFC. A holistic assessment of the carcass parts is needed to interpret the significance of findings on separate parts. The MFC offers some opportunities for targeted inspection with cutting edge diagnostic technology. Improved hygiene is expected from the MFC concept due to the fact that limbs, neck and loin are removed first and are not subject to faecal contamination from intestinal content. The MFC provides opportunities for customized chilling regime for different parts, targeted decontamination or pathogen killing processing, which should contribute to safer meat products and less energy consumption. We expect that the MFC approach will potentially fulfill the principles of Codex alimentarius and will improve public health compared to conventional slaughter and meat inspection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCodex Alimentarius 3acold treatment 3acutting 3adecontamination 3aenergy 3ahygiene 3alivestock and meat industry 3ameat 3ameat inspection 3aneck 3apathogens 3apig carcasses 3apublic health 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 0aMeat inspection 0aMeat Factory Cell 0aRisk assessment 0aMeat hygiene1 aPrieto, Miguel1 aTorkveen, Kristin1 aRuud, Cecilie1 aNesbakken, Truls0 tFood control.g2018 Aug., v. 90 p.32-39dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100013300147245010200280520135100382592002801733650002401761650001601785650002201801650001101823650001901834650001901853650001001872650003001882650001401912653001301926653001201939653000801951653000901959653000901968653000801977653002201985653001602007653002702023700002102050700001702071700001902088700013502107700013302242700013502375773011602510856008202626852000902708655001202717IND60674951420221120033822.0191121e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067495142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2019.1074182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunch, Garret1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3397-8059 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3397-8059 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3397-805910aOnline measurement of CO2 and total gas production in parallel anaerobic shake flask cultivations  aOnline measurements of off-gas streams are often crucial for studying bioconversion processes. However, for anaerobic processes, options for online off-gas analysis are typically restricted to lab-scale bioreactors or larger systems, while gas measurements at smaller scales typically do not discriminate between different gases. In this work, a method for online measurement of CO2 and total gas production in anaerobic fermentations at the shake flask scale is described, extending capabilities of a previously reported device developed for aerobic processes to anaerobic bioprocesses. The novel design allows anaerobic fermentations to be performed in multiple parallel vessels, all of which collect online gas signals. The online gas signals are used to calculate the transfer rates, allowing near real-time visualization of the progress of eight fermentations operating in parallel. Conditions such as carbon source depletion, inhibition of growth, and exhaustion of a single carbon source in a dual-substrate fermentation can all be clearly distinguished. The combination of online signals and offline analysis allowed for carbon balances to be performed with high degrees of closure. The new design allows for higher throughput screening of anaerobic bioprocesses, an area lacking in small-scale options with off-gas analysis capabilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioreactors 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aculture flasks 3agases 3aliquid state fermentation 3ascreening 0aanaRAMOS 0a1,3 PDO 0aCTR 0aTGTR 0aRGTR 0aHTR 0aOnline monitoring 0aShake flask 0aAnaerobic fermentation1 aSchulte, Andreas1 aMann, Marcel1 aDinger, Robert1 aRegestein, Lars1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1258-7171 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1258-7171 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1258-71711 aRehmann, Lars1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3463-6405 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3463-6405 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3463-64051 aBÃ¼chs, Jochen,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2012-3476 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2012-3476 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2012-34760 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 153 p.107418-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2019.1074183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015800172300001600330520138100346592002801727650001001755650001601765650001301781650002301794650001201817650003901829650001601868650001301884650002101897650001901918650001201937650004401949650000701993650001502000650001302015650003002028650001402058650001302072653003402085653002402119653002102143653004802164653002202212700001702234773009202251856008502343852000902428655001202437IND60606488520221120071715.0180726e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060648852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.10.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Yadvendra10aHighly selective colorimetric and fluorometric chemosensor for cyanide on silica gel and DMSO/H2O (7:3 v/v) mixed solvent and its imaging in living cells  ap. 257-263.  aThe chemosensor 2,3-bis((E)-((2-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)methylene)amino)maleonitrile (1) has been synthesized using 2-hydroxy-1-napthaldehyde and 2,3-diaminomaleonitrile and characterized. Sensor 1 exhibits selective binding with CNâ» in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/H2O (7:3 v/v) and DMSO/aqueous Tris (Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) buffer (7:3 v/v, 10mM, pH 7.2) media with significant changes in its UVâvisible and fluorescence spectra. Titration of 1-Zn(II) complex with CNâ» ion in DMSO/aqueous Tris buffer (7:3 v/v, 10mM, pH 7.2) regenerates the free sensor 1, as supported by UVâvisible spectra. Â¹H NMR titration of 1 with CNâ in (CD3)2SO confirms the hydrogen-bonding interaction between the two OH groups of the former and the latter in bidentate manner. Sensor 1 impregnated on silica gel thin layer chromatography (TLC) strip followed by dipping in anion solutions in DMSO/H2O (7:3 v/v) generates yellow to red spectacular colour change with CNâ» ion selectively which can be exploited as potential tool for ready-made detection of toxic CNâ» ion in environmental and analytical chemistry. Similar visual change in colour for 1 is observed selectively with CNâ» also when both of them are taken in DMSO/H2O (7:3 v/v) solution. Sensor 1 is used as an imaging reagent for detection of the cellular uptake of CNâ» ion in Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK-21) cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3acyanides 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adipping 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorometry 3ahamsters 3ahydrogen bonding 3aimage analysis 3akidneys 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3asilica gel 3asolvents 3athin layer chromatography 3atitration 3atoxicity 0aCyanide selective chemosensor 0aNaphthol derivative 0aHydrogen-bonding 0aCyanide sensing on solid silica gel surface 0aLive cell imaging1 aGhosh, Tamal0 tTalanta.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 148 p.257-263dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.10.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245005100177300001400228520175400242592002801996650002602024650002102050650002802071650002202099650002902121650003002150650001302180650001702193650002502210650001502235650001102250650001302261650001702274650001202291650001002303650001202313650001802325650001202343650002102355650003602376650001402412650002402426773009502450856009002545852000902635655001202644IND60111749020221121165318.0150809s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011174902DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-407677-8.00002-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFree, Stephen J.10aFungal Cell Wall Organization and Biosynthesis  ap. 33-82.  aThe composition and organization of the cell walls from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Neurospora crassa, and Cryptococcus neoformans are compared and contrasted. These cell walls contain chitin, chitosan, Î²-1,3-glucan, Î²-1,6-glucan, mixed Î²-1,3-/Î²-1,4-glucan, Î±-1,3-glucan, melanin, and glycoproteins as major constituents. A comparison of these cell walls shows that there is a great deal of variability in fungal cell wall composition and organization. However, in all cases, the cell wall components are cross-linked together to generate a cell wall matrix. The biosynthesis and properties of each of the major cell wall components are discussed. The chitin and glucans are synthesized and extruded into the cell wall space by plasma membrane-associated chitin synthases and glucan synthases. The glycoproteins are synthesized by ER-associated ribosomes and pass through the canonical secretory pathway. Over half of the major cell wall proteins are modified by the addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. The cell wall glycoproteins are also modified by the addition of O-linked oligosaccharides, and their N-linked oligosaccharides are extensively modified during their passage through the secretory pathway. These cell wall glycoprotein posttranslational modifications are essential for cross-linking the proteins into the cell wall matrix. Cross-linking the cell wall components together is essential for cell wall integrity. The activities of four groups of cross-linking enzymes are discussed. Cell wall proteins function as cross-linking enzymes, structural elements, adhesins, and environmental stress sensors and protect the cell from environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aCandida albicans 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3aNeurospora crassa 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3aadhesins 3abiosynthesis 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3achitin 3achitosan 3acrosslinking 3aenzymes 3afungi 3aglucans 3aglycoproteins 3amelanin 3aoligosaccharides 3apost-translational modification 3aribosomes 3astructural proteins0 tAdvances in Genetics.g2013, v. 81 p.33-82dElsevier Science & Technologyx0065-26607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-407677-8.00002-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001400141245012100155300001600276520133800292592002801630650001101658650001901669650001501688650001601703650001301719650001001732650002101742650001501763650001101778650002101789700002201810773010701832856007501939852000902014655001202023IND60637544020221120054508.0190419e20130823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063754402DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1982.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasak, A.10aChemical defoliation of apple rootstocks and the influence of rootstocks type on the defoliation of 'Jonathan' scion  ap. 153-166.  aThe following substances were used to defoliate apple rootstock instead of hand defoliation before digging out: KI, CuSO4 Â· 5H2O, Mg(ClO3)2< Â· H2O, ethephon (Ethrel 68-250 and CKB 1131), preparation N252, and the mixtures: ethephon (Ethrel) with copper sulphate, or with gibberellic acid, morphactin (EMD) with ethephon, and morphactin with ethephon and copper sulphate. Among the inorganic defoliants tested, only Mg(ClO3)2 Â· H2O gave satisfactory results in defoliating apple rootstocks. When applied at the end of September this chemical did not decrease winter hardiness of the rootstocks. Ethrel and the preparation CKB 1131,caused satisfactory defoliation, but when used in optimal concentrations for defoliation they decreased the winter hardiness of plants. The mixture of ethephon with copper sulphate in which both components were used in low concentrations also appeared highly effective. Ethephon in low concentration mixed with EMD caused only partial defoliation of the rootstocks. Addition of gibberellic acid did not improve the effectiveness of ethephon. Preparation N252 in a concentration of 0.15% effectively defoliated the rootstocks and did not cause a subsequent decrease of frost hardiness in the conditions of this experiment. The response of 'Jonathan' scions to defoliants was modified by the rootstock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3acopper sulfate 3adefoliants 3adefoliation 3aethephon 3afrost 3agibberellic acid 3arootstocks 3ascions 3awinter hardiness1 aJankiewicz, L.

With sensory detection thresholds in the low ngLâ»Â¹ range, modest concentrations of these compounds can profoundly impact the aroma quality of foods and beverages, and high levels can lead to consumer rejection. The wine industry routinely analyzes the most prevalent methoxypyrazine, 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IBMP), to aid in harvest decisions, since concentrations decrease during berry ripening. In addition to IBMP, three other methoxypyrazines IPMP (2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine), SBMP (2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine), and EMP (2-ethyl-3-methoxypyrazine) have been identified in grapes and/or wine and can impact aroma quality. Despite their routine analysis in the wine industry (mostly IBMP), accurate methoxypyrazine quantitation is hindered by two major challenges: sensitivity and resolution. With extremely low sensory detection thresholds (~8â15ngLâ»Â¹ in wine for IBMP), highly sensitive analytical methods to quantify methoxypyrazines at trace levels are necessary. Here we were able to achieve resolution of IBMP as well as IPMP, EMP, and SBMP from co-eluting compounds using one-dimensional chromatography coupled to positive chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Three extraction techniques HS-SPME (headspace-solid phase microextraction), SBSE (stirbar sorptive extraction), and HSSE (headspace sorptive extraction) were validated and compared. A 30min extraction time was used for HS-SPME and SBSE extraction techniques, while 120min was necessary to achieve sufficient sensitivity for HSSE extractions. All extraction methods have limits of quantitation (LOQ) at or below 1ngLâ»Â¹ for all four methoxypyrazines analyzed, i.e., LOQâs at or below reported sensory detection limits in wine. The method is high throughput, with resolution of all compounds possible with a relatively rapid 27min GC oven program.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3agrapes 3aheadspace analysis 3ainsects 3aionization 3amicroorganisms 3aodors 3aovens 3apyrazines 3aripening 3asolid phase microextraction 3atandem mass spectrometry 3avolatile compounds 3awine industry 3awines 0aMethoxypyrazines 0aWine 0aGrape 0aAroma 0aIBMP 0aIPMP 0aHS-SPME 0aHSSE 0aSBSE1 aWylie, Philip L.1 aEbeler, Susan E.0 tTalanta.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 148 p.336-345dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.10.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04067naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100002100189245006800210300001400278500001500292520196100307592002802268650002802296650002502324650001202349650001102361650002702372650002102399650001702420650001802437650002802455650001102483650001002494650002702504650002902531650002502560650001402585650001302599650001802612650002802630650001702658650003502675650001402710650002902724650002802753650006202781650004002843650001102883650002402894650002502918650004102943650003002984650003903014650003703053653001503090700002703105700002003132700002503152773007803177856008203255990002303337852000903360655001203369IND60094340820221117184044.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009434082DNAL7 a222662732pmid7 aPMC40910362pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cyto.2011.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeyyala, Rebecca10aOral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses  ap. 65-72.  a2019-12-06  aOral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. However, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. This report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. Monoinfection biofilms were developed with Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. Biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, OKF4, for up to 24h. Gro-1Î±, IL1Î±, IL-6, IL-8, TGFÎ±, Fractalkine, MIP-1Î±, and IP-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. P. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines, except MIP-1Î±. Generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited Gro-1Î±, TGFÎ±, and Fractalkine production, while F. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in IL-1Î±, IL-6, IL-8, and IP-10. A. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10. The oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. The results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. Moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus sanguinis 3aanaerobic conditions 3abiofilm 3ahumans 3aActinomyces naeslundii 3aepithelial cells 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aFusobacterium nucleatum 3amodels 3amouth 3aStreptococcus gordonii 3aPorphyromonas gingivalis 3aStreptococcus oralis 3areceptors 3abacteria 3ainterleukin-8 2aActinomycesxphysiology 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aCell Line 2aChemokinesxbiosynthesis 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesis 2aEpithelial Cellsxdrug effectsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aFusobacterium nucleatumxphysiology 2aHumans 2aMouthxmicrobiology 2aPlanktonxphysiology 2aPorphyromonas gingivalisxphysiology 2aStreptococcusxphysiology 2aStreptococcus gordoniixphysiology 2aStreptococcus oralisxphysiology 0achemokines1 aKirakodu, Sreenatha S.1 aNovak, Karen F.1 aEbersole, Jeffrey L.0 tCytokine.g2012 Apr., v. 58, no. 1 p.65-72dElsevier Ltdx1043-46667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.12.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011800156520168900274592002801963650002101991650002102012650002602033650001702059650002302076650002602099650001302125650001502138650001302153650002202166700001702188700002102205700001902226700001502245700001702260700001602277700001802293773012102311856007302432852000902505655001202514IND60751539120221121065816.0210925e20210917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075153912DNAL7 a10.3390/f120912682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yufeng 10aMolecular Identification and Antifungal Properties of Four Thaumatin-like Proteins in Spruce (Picea likiangensis)  aThaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) are involved in the plant defense response against pathogens, and most of them exhibit antifungal activity. However, the role of TLPs in pathogen-induced defense responses in spruce is not fully understood. In this study, four TLP genes encoding thaumatin-like protein, designated as PlTLP1â4, were isolated and identified from Picea likiangensis needles. Sequence analysis showed that PlTLP1, PlTLP3, and PlTLP4 contained 16 conserved cysteine residues, while PlTLP2 had only 10 conserved cysteine residues. qPCR analysis showed that PlTLPs were expressed in all tissues tested, PlTLP1, PlTLP3, and PlTLP4 had the highest expression levels in young fruits, while PlTLP2 had the highest expression levels in roots. In addition, the expression levels of four PlTLPs were significantly upregulated during infection by Lophodermium piceae. Four recombinant PlTLPs expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited obvious Î²-1,3-glucanase activity. The antifungal activity assay showed that four recombinant PlTLPs had significant inhibitory effects on the mycelial growth of L. piceae, Fusarium proliferatum, Botrytis cinerea, and Roussoella doimaesalongensis. Microscopic observation revealed that the recombinant PlTLP1â4 induced the morphological changes of the mycelia of L. piceae, and the recombinant PlTLP2 and PlTLP3 induced the morphological changes of the mycelia of F. proliferatum and R. doimaesalongensis, while all the recombinant PlTLPs had no obvious negative effect on the morphology of B. cinerea mycelium. These results suggest that PlTLP genes may play an important role in the defense response of P. likiangensis against L. piceae invasion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aEscherichia coli 3aFusarium proliferatum 3aLophodermium 3aPicea likiangensis 3aantifungal properties 3acysteine 3amicroscopy 3amycelium 3asequence analysis1 aLiu, Lijuan 1 aAsiegbu, Fred O.1 aYang, Chunlin 1 aHan, Shan 1 aYang, Shuai 1 aZeng, Qian 1 aLiu, Yinggao 0 tForests.g2021 Sept. 17, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120912683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04415naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100003400186245011300220300001200333506007600345520195300421592002802374506003702402650001802439650002202457650002402479650003102503650001602534650002502550650002302575650000902598650001902607650001302626650002402639650001202663650001502675650001402690650001502704650002002719650002402739650004002763650002302803650004502826650005102871650001202922650002202934650003402956650004202990650001103032650003103043650001103074650005903085650005403144650002203198650001503220650003603235650005203271650003003323700002203353700002203375700002703397700002303424700002103447773011203468856008003580852000903660655001203669IND50062597420221207134455.0190823e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006259742DNAL7 aPMC35497722pmcid7 a231531782pmid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-5-2642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTchankouo-Nguetcheu, Stephane10aInfection by chikungunya virus modulates the expression of several proteins in Aedes aegypti salivary glands  ap. 264.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Arthropod-borne viral infections cause several emerging and resurging infectious diseases. Among the diseases caused by arboviruses, chikungunya is responsible for a high level of severe human disease worldwide. The salivary glands of mosquitoes are the last barrier before pathogen transmission. METHODS: We undertook a proteomic approach to characterize the key virus/vector interactions and host protein modifications that occur in the salivary glands that could be responsible for viral transmission by using quantitative two-dimensional electrophoresis. RESULTS: We defined the protein modulations in the salivary glands of Aedes aegypti that were triggered 3 and 5 days after an oral infection (3 and 5 DPI) with chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Gel profile comparisons showed that CHIKV at 3 DPI modulated the level of 13 proteins, and at 5 DPI 20 proteins. The amount of 10 putatively secreted proteins was regulated at both time points. These proteins were implicated in blood-feeding or in immunity, but many have no known function. CHIKV also modulated the quantity of proteins involved in several metabolic pathways and in cell signalling. CONCLUSION: Our study constitutes the first analysis of the protein response of Aedes aegypti salivary glands infected with CHIKV. We found that the differentially regulated proteins in response to viral infection include structural proteins and enzymes for several metabolic pathways. Some may favour virus survival, replication and transmission, suggesting a subversion of the insect cell metabolism by arboviruses. For example, proteins involved in blood-feeding such as the short D7, an adenosine deaminase and inosine-uridine preferring nucleoside hydrolase, may favour virus transmission by exerting an increased anti-inflammatory effect. This would allow the vector to bite without the bite being detected. Other proteins, like the anti-freeze protein, may support vector protection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aChikungunya virus 3aadenosine deaminase 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aarboviruses 3abiochemical pathways 3acell communication 3agels 3ahuman diseases 3aimmunity 3ainfectious diseases 3ainsects 3ametabolism 3apathogens 3aproteomics 3asalivary glands 3astructural proteins 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3avirus transmission 2aAedesxmetabolismxphysiologyxvirology. 2aAlphavirus Infectionsxtransmissionxvirology. 2aAnimals 2aChikungunya Fever 2aChikungunya virusxphysiology 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aFemale 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aHumans 2aInsect Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aInsect Vectorsxmetabolismxphysiologyxvirology. 2aMass Spectrometry 2aProteomics 2aRNA, Viralxanalysisxgenetics. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSalivary Glandsxvirology1 aBourguet, Edouard1 aLenormand, Pascal1 aRousselle, Jean-Claude1 aNamane, Abdelkader1 aChoumet, Valerie0 tParasites & vectors.g2012 Dec., v. 5, no. 1 p.264-264dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-5-2643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245018400171300001600355520141500371592002801786650001501814650001601829650001301845650001101858650004301869650001101912650001201923650001101935650002501946650001601971653002001987653002902007653004302036653004002079653001602119700002202135773009202157856008502249852000902334655001202343IND60606488720221120061013.0180726e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060648872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.10.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVosough, Maryam10aMatrix-free analysis of selected benzodiazepines in human serum samples using alternating trilinear decomposition modeling of fast liquid chromatography diode array detection data  ap. 454-462.  aThis paper describes the development and validation of a simple and efficient bioanalytical procedure for simultaneous determination of alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam in human serum samples using high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode-array detection, regarding a fast elution methodology in 4min. Briefly, this method consists of a simple liquid extraction step of serum samples followed by HPLC analysis on a C18 column. After confirming the absence of matrix effect, an external standard methodology has been applied for quantification purposes. Due to the presence of serum endogenous components as uncalibrated components in the sample, the second-order calibration based on alternating trilinear decomposition has been applied on a set of absorbance matrices collected as a function of retention time and wavelengths. Acceptable resolution and quantification results were achieved in the presence of matrix interferences and the second-order advantage was fully exploited. The average recoveries for alprazolam, clonazepam and diazepam were 89.1%, 96.3% and 94.7% and relative standard deviation values for intra- and inter-day precision were equal or lower than 8.1% and 9.4%, respectively. The developed method enabled us to determine the analytes in the various serum samples in the presence of overlapped profiles, while keeping experimental time and extraction step at the minimum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3ablood serum 3adiazepam 3adiodes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aliquids 3amodels 3astatistical analysis 3awavelengths 0aBenzodiazepines 0aSecond-order calibration 0aHigh performance liquid chromatography 0aAlternating trilinear decomposition 0aHuman serum1 aIravani, Negar J.0 tTalanta.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 148 p.454-462dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.10.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03864naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005300139245008300192300001600275500001900291500002000310520204200330592002802372596007502400596007502475596002402550596003002574596005902604596005902663650001702722650001902739650001602758650001602774650000902790650001602799650002102815650001502836650000902851650001602860650002202876650001602898700006302914700005302977700001603030700001603046700001703062700005203079773012103131856007303252852000903325655001203334IND60720684120221121060947.0201216e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072068412DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.153932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Ting1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9387-485210aCurrent rice models underestimate yield losses from shortâterm heat stresses  ap. 402-416.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCrop production will likely face enormous challenges against the occurrences of extreme climatic events projected under future climate change. Heat waves that occur at critical stages of the reproductive phase have detrimental impacts on the grain yield formation of rice (Oryza sativa). Accurate estimates of these impacts are essential to evaluate the effects of climate change on rice. However, the accuracy of these predictions by crop models has not been extensively tested. In this study, we evaluated 14 rice growth models against four year phytotron experiments with four levels of heat treatments imposed at different times after flowering. We found that all models greatly underestimated the negative effects of heat on grain yield, suggesting that yield projections with these models do not reflect food shocks that may occur under shortâterm extreme heat stress (SEHS). As a result, crop model ensembles do not help to provide accurate estimates of grain yield under heat stress. We examined the functions of grainâsetting rate response to temperature (TRF_GS) used in eight models and showed that adjusting the effective periods of TRF_GS improved the model performance, especially for models simulating accumulative daily temperature effects. For TRF_GS which uses daily maximum temperature averaged for the effective period, the models provided better grain yield estimates by using maximum temperatures averaged only when daily maximum temperatures exceeded the base temperature (Tbâââ). An alternative method based on heatingâdegree days and stageâdependent heat sensitivity parameters further decreased the prediction uncertainty of grain yield under heat stress, where stageâdependent heat sensitivity was more important than heat dose for model improvement under SEHS. These results suggest the limitation of the applicability of existing rice models to variable climatic conditions and the urgent need for an alternative grainâsetting function accounting for the stageâdependent heat sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019YFA0607404cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a31725020cNational Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars  aB16026c111 Project  cChina Scholarship Council  a32021004cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31571566cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aOryza sativa 3aclimate change 3acrop models 3agrain yield 3aheat 3aheat stress 3amodel validation 3aprediction 3arice 3atemperature 3athermosensitivity 3auncertainty1 aHasegawa, Toshihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8501-56121 aLiu, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5046-70291 aTang, Liang1 aLiu, Leilei1 aCao, Weixing1 aZhu, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1884-24040 tGlobal change biology.g2021 Jan., v. 27, no. 2 p.402-416dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.153933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01923naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002300156245006700179300001300246520096800259592002801227650001501255650001501270650001901285650001501304650001501319650001401334650001401348650001901362700002301381773009401404856009001498852000901588655001201597IND60111749220221121165345.0150809s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011174922DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-407676-1.00001-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoodarzi, Aaron A.14aThe Repair and Signaling Responses to DNA Double-Strand Breaks  ap. 1-45.  aA DNA double-strand break (DSB) has long been recognized as a severe cellular lesion, potentially representing an initiating event for carcinogenesis or cell death. The evolution of DSB repair pathways as well as additional processes, such as cell cycle checkpoint arrest, to minimize the cellular impact of DSB formation was, therefore, not surprising. However, the depth and complexity of the DNA damage responses being revealed by current studies were unexpected. Perhaps the most surprising finding to emerge is the dramatic changes to chromatin architecture that arise in the DSB vicinity. In this review, we overview the cellular response to DSBs focusing on DNA repair pathways and the interface between them. We consider additional events which impact upon these DSB repair pathways, including regulated arrest of cell cycle progression and chromatin architecture alterations. Finally, we discuss the impact of defects in these processes to human disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3acarcinogenesis 3acell cycle 3acell death 3achromatin 3aevolution 3ahuman diseases1 aJeggo, Penelope A.0 tAdvances in Genetics.g2013, v. 82 p.1-45dElsevier Science & Technologyx0065-26607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-407676-1.00001-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010000167300001600267520159300283592002801876650002701904650002601931650001901957650001201976650001201988650002002000650001402020650001402034700002302048700002202071700001902093773010402112856008402216852000902300655001202309IND60084002220221121054415.0141101e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008400222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resmic.2011.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPires, Diana10aUse of newly isolated phages for control of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and ATCC 10145 biofilms  ap. 798-806.  aPseudomonas aeruginosa is a relevant opportunistic pathogen involved in nosocomial infections that frequently shows low antibiotic susceptibility. One of its virulence factors is associated with the ability to adhere to surfaces and form virulent biofilms. This work describes the isolation and characterization of lytic phages capable of infecting antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa strains. In addition, characterization of P.Â aeruginosa biofilms and the potential of newly isolated phages for planktonic and biofilm control was accessed. According to the results, the isolated phages showed different spectra of activity and efficiency of lysis. Four broad lytic phages were selected for infection of planktonic cells; however, despite their broad range of activity, two of the selected phages failed to efficiently control planktonic cultures. Therefore, only two phages (phiIBB-PAA2 and phiIBB-PAP21), highly capable of causing strong biomass reduction of planktonic cells, were tested against 24Â h biofilms using a m.o.i. of 1. Both phages reduced approximately 1â2 log the biofilm population after 2Â h of infection and reduction was further enhanced after 6Â h of biofilm infection. However, biofilm cells of P. aeruginosa PAO1 acquired resistance to phiIBB-PAP21; consequently, an increase in the number of cells after 24Â h of treatment was observed. Conversely, phage phiIB-PAA2 for P. aeruginosa ATCC10145 continued to destroy biofilm cells, even after 24Â h of infection. In these biofilms, phages caused a 3 log reduction in the number of viable counts of biofilm cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteriophages 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3across infection 3apathogens 3avirulence1 aSillankorva, Sanna1 aFaustino, Alberta1 aAzeredo, Joana0 tResearch in microbiology.g2011 Oct., v. 162, no. 8 p.798-806dElsevier Masson SASx0923-25087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2011.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245011900153300001800272520129400290592002801584650001901612650001101631650002901642650001301671650001901684650001301703650002601716650001301742650001801755650001101773700002601784700001901810773012401829856007501953852000902028655001202037IND60534820320170606000000.0160803e20130205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053482032DNAL7 a10.1021/es304053h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Biao10aIntegrated Carbon and Chlorine Isotope Modeling: Applications to Chlorinated Aliphatic Hydrocarbons Dechlorination  ap. 1443-1451.  aWe propose a self-consistent method to predict the evolution of carbon and chlorine isotope ratios during degradation of chlorinated hydrocarbons. The method treats explicitly the cleavage of isotopically different CâCl bonds and thus considers, simultaneously, combined carbonâchlorine isotopologues. To illustrate the proposed modeling approach we focus on the reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated ethenes. We compare our method with the currently available approach, in which carbon and chlorine isotopologues are treated separately. The new approach provides an accurate description of dual-isotope effects regardless of the extent of the isotope fractionation and physical characteristics of the experimental system. We successfully applied the new approach to published experimental results on dehalogenation of chlorinated ethenes both in well-mixed systems and in situations where mass-transfer limitations control the overall rate of biodegradation. The advantages of our self-consistent dual isotope modeling approach proved to be most evident when isotope fractionation factors of carbon and chlorine differed significantly and for systems with mass-transfer limitations, where both physical and (bio)chemical transformation processes affect the observed isotopic values.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3achlorinated hydrocarbons 3achlorine 3adechlorination 3aethylene 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3amass transfer 3amodels1 aHaderlein, Stefan B.,1 aRolle, Massimo0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Feb. 05, v. 47, no. 3 p.1443-1451dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes304053h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245010300165300001400268520090700282592002801189650002101217650001501238650001601253650001501269650001901284650001201303650001401315650001501329650001401344650002101358650001501379650001601394650001201410651001201422653007001434700001901504700002101523700002101544773011101565856007801676852000901754655001201763IND60519728820221118195456.0160510e20151230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051972882DNAL7 a10.1515/aslh-2015-00072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzÅcs, Levente,10aParasitoid complex of leaf miner Pyllonorycter comparella (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae) in Hungary  ap. 91-98.  aBetween 2011 and 2014, 1,154 mines of Phyllonorycter comparella (Duponchel) were collected at 12 locations in Hungary and were put into single-mine rearing containers.

It is advantageous to avoid their complete oxidation to COâ and produce chemicals with higher commercial value along with moderate energy extraction. We explored three different phases of nickel phosphide (NiââPâ, NiâP, and NiâPâ) for the electro-oxidation of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol. NiââPâ exhibits excellent activity (210 mA cmâ»Â² at 1.72 V vs. RHE), durability, and mass activity (â¼4.2 A mgâ»Â¹), outperforming the state-of-the-art catalysts. We compared the reaction mechanisms and concluded that except ethylene glycol, the various alcohols are oxidized following a similar reaction mechanism, both on NiââPâ and on NiâP. The high selectivity of the reaction and the large suppression of further oxidation to COâ are a marker of a preferred bidentate adsorption configuration that conveys a specific OâH activation reaction path. The catalysts show excellent activity towards alcohol oxidation and durability, likely thanks to the mild conditions required for the process, which allow the formation of a regenerating thin active layer of oxidized nickel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3adurability 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aethanol 3aethylene glycol 3aglycerol 3aisopropyl alcohol 3aliquids 3amethanol 3anickel 3aoxidation 3aphosphides 3areaction mechanisms1 aMondal, Biswajit1 aRoy, Shubasis1 aShalom, Menny1 aSadan, Maya Bar0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Apr. 12, v. 10, no. 15 p.8238-8244dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta00863g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245016800166520137700334592002801711650001101739650002301750650002101773650001801794650001601812650001201828650002401840650002401864650002401888650002001912650001501932650001501947650001101962650002401973650001401997650001502011651001002026700002802036700001802064700002802082700002902110773013002139856007402269852000902343655001202352IND60751718820221119063653.0210925e20210917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075171882DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131837262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta-Saura, JosÃ© M.10aEmpirical Models for Spatio-Temporal Live Fuel Moisture Content Estimation in Mixed Mediterranean Vegetation Areas Using Sentinel-2 Indices and Meteorological Data  aLive fuel moisture content (LFMC) is an input factor in fire behavior simulation models highly contributing to fire ignition and propagation. Developing models capable of accurately estimating spatio-temporal changes of LFMC in different forest species is needed for wildfire risk assessment. In this paper, an empirical model based on multivariate linear regression was constructed for the forest cover classified as shrublands in the central part of the Valencian region in the Eastern Mediterranean of Spain in the fire season. A sample of 15 non-monospecific shrubland sites was used to obtain a spatial representation of this type of forest cover in that area. A prediction model was created by combining spectral indices and meteorological variables. This study demonstrates that the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) extracted from Sentinel-2 images and meteorological variables (mean surface temperature and mean wind speed) are a promising combination to derive cost-effective LFMC estimation models. The relationships between LFMC and spectral indices for all sites improved after using an additive site-specific index based on satellite information, reaching a RÂ²âdâ±¼ = 0.70, RMSE = 8.13%, and MAE = 6.33% when predicting the average of LFMC weighted by the canopy cover fraction of each species of all shrub species present in each sampling plot.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acost effectiveness 3aempirical models 3afire behavior 3afire season 3aforests 3afuel moisture index 3ameteorological data 3aregression analysis 3arisk assessment 3asatellites 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3asurface temperature 3awildfires 3awind speed 3aSpain1 aBalaguer-Beser, Ãngel 1 aRuiz, Luis A.1 aPardo-Pascual, Josep E.1 aSoriano-Sancho, JosÃ© L.0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Sept. 17, v. 13, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131837263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012500158300001800283520175400301592002802055650001602083650002602099650002202125650001602147650001302163650001502176700001702191700001502208700001602223700001702239700001902256700001302275700001202288773014302300856007502443852000902518655001202527IND60773417020221119204332.0220414e20220412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077341702DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ta00959e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Qinglian10aHighly efficient organic solar cells with superior deformability enabled by diluting the small molecule acceptor content  ap. 8293-8302.  aDeveloping efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) with strong mechanical deformability is important to be addressed to ensure their operational reliability in wearable electronics. However, it is challenging to achieve mechanically robust polymer/small molecule OSCs with an efficiency over 17% due to the abundant brittle donor/acceptor (D/A) interface. Decreasing the small molecule content can reduce the brittle D/A interface area to enhance deformability, but it may also cause discontinuous electron-conducting regions and thus deteriorate photovoltaic performance. Here, we incorporate a polymer donor (D18) into a binary PTQ10cm-BTP-PhC6 system at a constant PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 ratio of 1â:â1.2 to minimize the D/A interfacial area and modulate phase separation, and subsequently fabricate mechanically reliable OSCs with high efficiency. The large incorporation of D18 molecules increases the crystallinity of m-BTP-PhC6 molecules because of the poor interaction between D18 and the two host materials, affording sufficient pathways for efficient charge percolation at a large D/A ratio. More importantly, highly aggregated m-BTP-PhC6 molecules help to minimize the D/A interfacial area, enabling ternary films with better deformability than their binary counterparts. As a result, ternary OSCs with a large D/A ratio of 1.5â:â1.2 exhibit a high efficiency of 17.3% with a crack-onset strain (COS) of 8.8%, which significantly outperforms their binary counterparts with an efficiency of 13.8% and a COS of 4.4%. Diluting the content of small molecules and controlling intermolecular interaction through the introduction of the second polymer donor represents a promising strategy to fabricate efficient OSCs with superior deformability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrittleness 3achemical interactions 3acrystal structure 3aelectronics 3apolymers 3aseparation1 aXue, Jingwei1 aZhao, Heng1 aLin, Baojun1 aBi, Zhaozhao1 aSeibt, Susanne1 aZhou, Ke1 aMa, Wei0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Apr. 12, v. 10, no. 15 p.8293-8302dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta00959e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245006000211300001900271520103300290592002801323653003201351653001501383653001301398653002501411700002901436700001901465700002001484700001601504700001701520700002001537700002401557700002401581700002801605700003201633773008301665856008201748852000901830655001201839IND60557850820221119202532.0161103e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055785082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cels.2016.09.0022doi7 aPMC50925392pmcid7 a276930232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuraro, MauroÂ J.12aA Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas of the Human Pancreas  ap. 385-394.e3.  aTo understand organ function, it is important to have an inventory of its cell types and of their corresponding marker genes. This is a particularly challenging task for human tissues like the pancreas, because reliable markers are limited. Hence, transcriptome-wide studies are typically done on pooled islets of Langerhans, obscuring contributions from rare cell types and of potential subpopulations. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automated platform that uses FACS, robotics, and the CEL-Seq2 protocol to obtain the transcriptomes of thousands of single pancreatic cells from deceased organ donors, allowing inÂ silico purification of all main pancreatic cell types. We identify cell type-specific transcription factors and a subpopulation of REG3A-positive acinar cells. We also show that CD24 and TM4SF4 expression can be used to sort live alpha and beta cells with high purity. This resource will be useful for developing a deeper understanding of pancreatic biology and pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus.  aPublisher supplied data 0asingle-cell transcriptomics 0asequencing 0apancreas 0aislets of Langerhans1 aDharmadhikari, Gitanjali1 aGrÃ¼n, Dominic1 aGroen, Nathalie1 aDielen, Tim1 aJansen, Erik1 avanÂ Gurp, Leon1 aEngelse, MartenÂ A.1 aCarlotti, Francoise1 adeÂ Koning, EelcoÂ J.P.1 avanÂ Oudenaarden, Alexander0 tCell Systems.g2016 Oct. 26, v. 3 p.385-394.e3dElsevier Inc.x2405-47127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2016.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005200152245012300204520150600327592002801833650001301861650001201874650000901886650003001895650002101925650001601946650001301962650001101975650002101986650001102007650001802018653002002036653002702056653002602083653002302109653002802132700001802160773010702178856008702285852000902372655001202381IND60757279920221120030415.0211213e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075727992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1188262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNing, An1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6530-446514aThe synergistic effects of methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and methanesulfinic acid (MSIA) on marine new particle formation  aMarine aerosols have significant impacts on the global radiation balance and climate. New particle formation (NPF) is an essential source of aerosol formation. Sulfur-containing acids (sulfuric acid (SA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), and methanesulfinic acid (MSIA)) oxidized from ocean-emitted dimethyl sulfide (DMS), have been identified as nucleation precursors in marine NPF. Given their homology, these sulfur species are likely to contribute jointly to the NPF. However, the joint effects of such sulfur acids on NPF and the nucleating mechanism remain unknown. Hence, the first quaternary SA-MSA-MSIA-DMA nucleation system was systematically investigated under different conditions using density functional theory (DFT) combined and Atmospheric Cluster Dynamic Code (ACDC). The results indicate that MSA and MSIA can synergistically enhance the formation rates of SA-dimethylamine (DMA) clusters, especially in regions with low temperatures, sparse SA and DMA. In the mid-latitude oceans, MSA and MSIA can jointly promote nucleation by forming SA-MSA-DMA and SA-MSIA-DMA clusters like âdivision of cooperationâ. While in the cold polar regions, MSA and MSIA can synergistically enhance clustering via forming stable MSA-MSIA-based clusters like âhand in handâ. The proposed quaternary SA-MSA-MSIA-DMA mechanism manifests itself more effectively in the nucleation process, and such a multi-component nucleation model may help us to understand the frequent marine NPF more comprehensively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aclimate 3acold 3adensity functional theory 3adimethyl sulfide 3aenvironment 3alatitude 3amodels 3aphase transition 3asulfur 3asulfuric acid 0aMarine aerosols 0aNew particle formation 0aQuaternary nucleation 0aSynergistic effect 0aSulfur-containing acids1 aZhang, Xiuhui0 tAtmospheric environment.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 269 p.118826-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1188263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03630naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245026600158300001800424520209400442592002802536650002502564650002202589650002202611650001602633650001702649650002102666650002102687650001302708650001102721650002302732650001702755650001602772650001902788650003702807700002402844700002702868700001902895700001702914700001602931700002002947773012102967856007503088852000903163655001203172IND60559195020221120153957.0161129e20140807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055919502DNAL7 a10.1021/jp503938b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Surajit10aUnique Influence of Cholesterol on Modifying the Aggregation Behavior of Surfactant Assemblies: Investigation of Photophysical and Dynamical Properties of 2,2â²-Bipyridine-3,3â²-diol, BP(OH)2 in Surfactant Micelles, and Surfactant/Cholesterol Forming Vesicles  ap. 9329-9340.  aThe binding and rotational properties of an excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) fluorophore, 2,2â²-bipyridine-3,3â²-diol, BP(OH)â has been investigated in alkyltrimethylammonium bromide containing (CâTAB, n = 12, 14, and 16) micelles and alkyltrimethylammonium bromide/cholesterol (CâTAB (n = 14 and 16)/cholesterol) forming vesicles using fluorescence-based spectroscopy techniques. The formation of thermodynamically stable unilamellar self-assemblies of alkyltrimethylammonium bromide/cholesterol are characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. Individually, aqueous solutions of all these alkyltrimethylammonium bromide form micelles after certain surfactant concentration (critical micelle concentration, cmc) of surfactant, whereas cholesterol molecules are insoluble in water. But with the variation of the cholesterol-to-surfactant molar ratio (Q = [cholesterol]/[surfactant]), uniform distribution of vesicular aggregates in aqueous solution can be obtained. The micelle-to-vesicle transition of surfactant solution upon addition of cholesterol also influences the steady state emission profile, fluorescence lifetime, and rotational dynamics of BP(OH)â molecule. The diketo tautomer of BP(OH)â molecule gets stabilized as the concentration of surfactant increases in aqueous solution. Fluorescence lifetime and rotational time constant of the BP(OH)â molecule are also influenced by the variation of alkyl chain length of surfactant molecule. The emission quantum yield (Î¦) is also found to be sensitive with surfactant concentration, variation in chain length of surfactants, and it saturates after the cmc of surfactants. The rigid and restricted microenvironment of vesicle bilayer enhance the lifetime and also rotational relaxation of BP(OH)â significantly. The rotational behavior of BP(OH)â in surfactant/cholesterol self-assemblies is also explained by using analytical parameters related to time-resolved anisotropy following two-step process and wobbling in a cone models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregation behavior 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical elements 3acholesterol 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3aspectroscopy 3asurfactants 3athermodynamics 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aKuchlyan, Jagannath1 aRoychowdhury, Subhajit1 aBanik, Debasis1 aKundu, Niloy1 aRoy, Arpita1 aSarkar, Nilmoni0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Aug. 07, v. 118, no. 31 p.9329-9340dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp503938b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001800171245009600189300001400285520171300299592002802012650001802040650002002058650002002078650001602098650001002114650001302124650001502137650003902152650002202191650002202213650001502235650001902250650000902269650001402278650001202292650001202304650002002316650003602336650005102372650002702423650003702450650003502487650000902522650000902531650001702540650004402557700001602601700001502617700001702632700001502649700001802664773008202682856008602764990002302850852000902873655001202882IND60091802020221118054630.0141103e20111108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009180202DNAL7 a219785482pmid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2011.08.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Hongmei10aChronic deep brain stimulation of the lateral habenula nucleus in a rat model of depression  ap. 32-38.  aIn the present study, we aim to determine the antidepressant effects of chronic deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the lateral habenula nucleus (LHb) in a rat model of depression and to explore the potential mechanism of DBS induced improvement of depressive symptoms. To establish the rat depression model, animals were repeatedly exposed to a set of chronic mild stressors for four consecutive weeks. The open-field and sucrose consumption tests were used as measures of depression. For DBS treatment, rats were stereotaxically implanted with electrodes into the LHb and stimulated over a course of 28d. A separate positive control group was given pharmacotherapy with clomipramine hydrochloride. Open-field testing was used to determine behavioral changes following DBS treatment. Monoamine concentrations in blood and brain tissues were determined by fluorescence spectrophotometry. This study demonstrates that DBS of the LHb region significantly improved depressive-like symptoms in the rat model. These improvements manifested as elevated numbers of crossings and rearings during the open-field test in DBS-treated depressed rats compared to controls. In addition, concentrations of monoamines including norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT) in blood serum and brain tissues were also increased by DBS of the LHb. Therefore, significant improvements in all outcomes were detected following chronic DBS treatment. These results indicate that long-term DBS treatment of the LHb region effectively improved depressive symptoms in rats, likely as a result of elevated monoamine levels. LHb DBS may therefore provide a valuable therapeutic strategy for the clinical treatment of depression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantidepressants 3abehavior change 3ablood serum 3abrain 3adopamine 3aelectrodes 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3along term effects 3amental depression 3amonoamines 3anorepinephrine 3arats 3aserotonin 3asucrose 2aAnimals 2aChronic Disease 2aDeep Brain Stimulationxmethods 2aDepressive Disorderxphysiopathologyxtherapy. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aElectrodes, Implantedxstandards 2aHabenulaxphysiologyxsurgery. 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aStereotaxic Techniquesxinstrumentation1 aWang, Yanan1 aHuang, Min1 aLin, Weihong1 aWang, Shao1 aZhang, Baimin0 tBrain research.g2011 Nov. 8, v. 1422 p.32-38dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2011.08.0413Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005300152245007900205520175100284592002802035650001202063650001602075650001302091650001002104650001102114650002302125650001102148650001602159651001402175651002602189651001102215653002802226653001002254653001302264653001302277700001602290773010702306856008702413852000902500655001202509IND60757280020221119004430.0211213e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075728002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1188412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0343-947610aSurface ozone interannual variability, trends, and extremes in CCMI models  aTropospheric ozone exhibits variations at interannual to decadal timescales tied closely to climate variability. The fidelity of current-generation global chemistry-climate models (CCMs) in representing observed variations and extremes of troposphere ozone is an important aspect of model abilities to predict ozone but has not been comprehensively assessed. Here we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art CCMs participating in the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative phase 1 (CCMI-1) in simulating the interannual variability (IAV), decadal trends, and extremes of surface ozone during 1990â2010Â at northern mid-latitudes. We find that current CCMs tend to underestimate observed ozone IAV over the U.S., Europe, and East Asia in both spring and summer and fail to capture the springtime ozone trends in the eastern U.S. (EUS) and Europe. Specified-dynamics simulations constrained by reanalysis data outperform the free-running simulations with CCMs in terms of IAV and decadal trends of surface ozone. Observations show large surface ozone IAV in summer over the EUS, Europe, and East Asia (standard deviationÂ =Â 3â6Â ppbv or relative standard deviationÂ =Â 8â15%) while all models substantially underestimate observed IAV by a factor of 2â3. Analysis in these populous/polluted regions unveils that the models significantly underestimate ozone extreme anomalies during heatwaves/droughts by 2â9Â ppbv (17â55%) over the EUS and by 7â10Â ppbv (42â59%) over Europe during the past two decades. These underestimates in summertime extreme anomalies contribute to the model biases in surface ozone IAV. Future model developments are needed to improve the ability of current CCMs to predict ozone extremes during heatwaves and droughts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aenvironment 3alatitude 3aozone 3aspring 3astandard deviation 3asummer 3atroposphere 3aEast Asia 3aEastern United States 3aEurope 0aInterannual variability 0aTrend 0aExtremes 0aHeatwave1 aCui, Yu Yan0 tAtmospheric environment.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 269 p.118841-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1188413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008100166300001800247520105000265592002801315650001601343650001401359650002201373650001101395650000901406650001201415650001901427700002201446773012201468856008201590852000901672655001201681IND60619877720221123013808.0181102e195812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061987772DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517558028012062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFortess, Fred10aFactors Influencing the Dyeing of Acetate Fibers With Disperse Nonionic Dyes  ap. 1009-1021.  aA basic understanding of any textile dyeing process is concerned with those factors , which influence the distribution of dye molecules between an external phase, primarily aqueous, and the fiber phase.

We first studied a single hydrodynamic focusing (SHF) device, which uses a central stream in which lipids dispersed in ethanol are injected and hydrodynamically compressed by the two aqueous streams. The ethanol diffusion from the inner stream to the aqueous stream encourages the formation of the liposomes. To intensify the mass diffusion and increase the surface area between the two fluids, a second device was designed with double hydrodynamic focusing (DHF). We investigated the influence of fluid flow velocity (Vf), Flow Rate Ratio (FRR) and total lipid concentration (Câáµ¢â) on the particle size of the CLs produced. The DHF microfluidic device had the ability of using higher Vf values than the SHF device, which resulted in a higher productivity level. Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) experiments were performed to structurally characterize the cationic liposomes produced by both microfluidic devices. The SAXS results revealed that both devices produce unilamellar cationic liposomes with a very small fraction of multilamellar liposomes; this finding is in agreement with the observations made in the analysis of the liposomes using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The biological efficacies of the cationic liposomes produced by both microfluidic devices were examined in vitro in HeLa cells, which confirmed their potential for gene delivery and vaccine therapy applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3achemical engineering 3aethanol 3agenes 3ahydrodynamics 3alipid content 3alipids 3aparticle size 3astreams 3asurface area 3atherapeutics 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aAoki, Nayla T.1 aGasperini, Antonio A.M.1 aOliveira, Cristiano L.P.1 aAzzoni, Adriano R.1 aCavalcanti, Leide P.1 ade la Torre, Lucimara G.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 June 15, v. 226 p.423-433dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.04.0533Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245013900153300002000292520168600312592002801998650002702026650002402053650002002077650002302097650001002120650001702130650001502147650001102162650001302173650002802186650000902214650001402223650001402237650002602251650001402277650001702291650001002308700001702318700001802335700001802353700001802371700001302389700001602402700001202418773012402430856007402554852000902628655001202637IND60618169220221121025741.0181029e20180412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061816922DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra12072a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Min10aBio-guided isolation of plant growth regulators from allelopathic plant-Codonopsis pilosula: phyto-selective activities and mechanisms  ap. 13649-13655.  aNatural pesticides are the subject of growing interest, as the overuse of synthetic pesticides severely threatens the safety of humans and the eco-environment. Allelopathic plants can release plentiful secondary metabolites as natural plant growth regulators to affect the growth of neighboring plants. Bio-guided isolation of the aerial waste part of typical allelopathic plant-Codonopsis pilosula led to six active compounds being produced, including ginsenoside Rgâ (1), ginsenoside Re (2), luteolin (3), luteolin-5-O-glucoside (4), ginsenoside Rbâ (5) and lobetyolin (6). Ginsenosides and luteolin-5-O-glucoside were firstly found in Codonopsis. Phyto-activity tests showed that all compounds showed inhibiting effects toward C. pilosula, and compounds 2, 4, 5 and 6 were also inhibitors of Amaranthus retroflexus. By contrast, the compounds promoted the seedling growth of wheat, rice and Setaria viridis. At certain concentrations, compounds 1, 4, 5 and 1, 2, 4 could observably promote the growth of wheat and rice seedlings, respectively, exceeding Setaria viridis. The different effects toward the two weeds might be related to the different ROS levels induced by the compounds. The ROS amounts in the root tips of S. viridis were as low as those in the control test, and the ROS content in the root tips increased with aggravation of the inhibition effect. In summary, successful isolation of phyto-selective chemicals from allelopathic plants may provide a promising method for natural herbicide screening. The compounds isolated could potentially be applied as inhibitors of dicotyledon weeds and promoters of monocotyledon crops for weed management in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus retroflexus 3aCodonopsis pilosula 3aSetaria viridis 3aactive ingredients 3acrops 3aginsenosides 3aherbicides 3ahumans 3aluteolin 3aplant growth substances 3arice 3aroot tips 3ascreening 3asecondary metabolites 3aseedlings 3aweed control 3awheat1 aLiu, Jingkun1 aYan, Zhiqiang1 aLi, Xiuzhuang1 aYang, Xiaoyan1 aJin, Hui1 aSu, Anxiang1 aQin, Bo0 tRSC advances.g2018 Apr. 12, v. 8, no. 25 p.13649-13655dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra12072a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245017800157520224200335592002802577650001702605650002302622650001502645650003102660650001102691650001402702650001902716650002902735650001902764650002202783650001602805650001502821650001502836650002102851650001502872651001002887700001602897700001602913700001702929700002202946700001302968773013002981856007403111852000903185655001203194IND60751719120221119063917.0210925e20210908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075171912DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131835672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Xinyao 10aComparing Three Remotely Sensed Approaches for Simulating Gross Primary Productivity over Mountainous Watersheds: A Case Study in the Wanglang National Nature Reserve, China  aLight Use Efficiency (LUE), Vegetation Index (VI)-based, and process-based models are the main approaches for spatially continuous gross primary productivity (GPP) estimation. However, most current GPP models overlook the effects of topography on the vegetation photosynthesis process. Based on the structures of a two-leaf LUE model (TL-LUE), a VI-based model (temperature and greenness, TG), and a process-based model (Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator, BEPS), three models, named mountain TL-LUE (MTL-LUE), mountain TG (MTG), and BEPS-TerrainLab, have been proposed to improve GPP estimation over mountainous areas. The GPP estimates from the three mountain models have been proven to align more closely with tower-based GPP than those from the original models at the site scale, but their abilities to characterize the spatial variation of GPP at the watershed scale are not yet known. In this work, the GPP estimates from three LUE models (i.e., MOD17, TL-LUE, and MTL-LUE), two VI-based models (i.e., TG and MTG), and two process-based models (i.e., BEPS and BEPS-TerrainLab) were compared for a mountainous watershed. At the watershed scale, the annual GPP estimates from MTL-LUE, MTG, and BTL were found to have a higher spatial variation than those from the original models (increasing the spatial coefficient of variation by 6%, 8%, and 22%), highlighting that incorporating topographic information into GPP models might improve understanding of the high spatial heterogeneity of the vegetation photosynthesis process over mountainous areas. Obvious discrepancies were also observed in the GPP estimates from MTL-LUE, MTG, and BTL, with determination coefficients ranging from 0.02â0.29 and root mean square errors ranging from 399â821 gC mâ»Â²yrâ»Â¹. These GPP discrepancies mainly stem from the different (1) structures of original LUE, VI, and process models, (2) assumptions associated with the effects of topography on photosynthesis, (3) input data, and (4) values of sensitive parameters. Our study highlights the importance of considering surface topography when modeling GPP over mountainous areas, and suggests that more attention should be given to the discrepancy of GPP estimates from different models.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aconservation areas 3aecosystems 3agross primary productivity 3amodels 3amountains 3aphotosynthesis 3aradiation use efficiency 3aremote sensing 3aspatial variation 3atemperature 3atopography 3avegetation 3avegetation index 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aLi, Ainong 1 aJin, Huaan 1 aBian, Jinhu 1 aZhang, Zhengjian 1 aNan, Xi 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Sept. 08, v. 13, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131835673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012900163300001800292520120800310592002801518650002301546650001901569650003801588650001001626650002101636650002201657650002601679650001101705650001801716650001801734650002301752650001401775700001801789700002701807700001901834773012101853856007501974852000902049655001202058IND60559195220221120153941.0161129e20140807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055919522DNAL7 a10.1021/jp504104a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhargava, Priyanshu10aNature of the Charged Headgroup Determines the Fusogenic Potential and Membrane Properties of Lithocholic Acid Phospholipids  ap. 9341-9348.  aPhospholipids play a crucial role in many cellular processes ranging from selective membrane permeability, to membrane fission and fusion, to cellular signaling. Headgroups of phospholipids determine the membrane properties and fusogenicity of these lipids with target cell membranes. We studied the fusogenic and membrane properties of phospholipids possessing unnatural charged headgroups with model membranes using laurdan based membrane hydration studies, DPH based membrane fluidity, and differential scanning calorimetry. We unravel that fusogenicity, membrane hydration, and fluidity of membranes are strongly contingent on the nature of the phospholipid charged headgroup. Our studies unraveled that introduction of bulky headgroups like dimethylamino pyridine induces maximum membrane hydration and perturbations with high fusogenicity as compared to small headgroup based phospholipids. These phospholipids also have the capability of high retention in DPPC membranes. Hydration and fluidity of these phospholipid-doped DPPC membranes are contingent on the nature of the charged headgroup. This study would help in future design of phospholipid based nanomaterials for effective drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell communication 3acell membranes 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrugs 3alithocholic acid 3amembrane fluidity 3amembrane permeability 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3aphospholipids 3aphysical chemistry 3apyridines1 aSingh, Manish1 aSreekanth, Vedagopuram1 aBajaj, Avinash0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Aug. 07, v. 118, no. 31 p.9341-9348dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp504104a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011900161300001600280500002000296520163100316592002801947650002601975650001902001650001102020650001602031650000902047650001202056650002302068650001202091650001202103650001102115650001102126650001402137650001002151650001302161650001702174650001002191650000902201650001402210650001102224650001702235650001202252650000902264650002202273650001402295700001702309700001802326700002002344773013202364856007302496852000902569655001202578IND60588441920221119135013.0180117e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058844192DNAL7 a10.1111/jen.124612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNascimento, A.

These effects are more pronounced in grass species, especially with soilâapplied Si. This study investigated the effects of Si application on rice resistance to Spodoptera frugiperda development and plant vegetative growth. Effects of Si on rice were assessed via soil and foliar applications and compared with untreated plants (control). Si was soilâ and foliarâapplied as 1% silicic acid solution at a dosage equivalent to 1.4 tÂ Si per ha. After application, leaf material was collected from Siâtreated and untreated plants and placed in Petri dishes with individual S.Â frugiperda neonate larvae, where development was followed to adult emergence and biological parameters recorded. Vegetative growth parameters recorded in rice plants were the height, chlorophyll content, fresh and dry weights of shoots, and shoot Si content. No effects of Si application were observed on the durations of larval and pupal stages, larval and pupal survival, and sex ratio of S.Â frugiperda. Insects fed leaves from Siâtreated plants exhibited lower leaf consumption, larval and pupal weights, longevity of males and females, number of eggs, and egg viability. The negative effects were correlated with higher rice Si content. Si application to rice increased plant height, chlorophyll content and dry weight. Our study demonstrates that foliarâapplied Si is as efficient as soilâapplied Si in negatively affecting S.Â frugiperda development and providing beneficial effects on rice plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3aabiotic stress 3aadults 3achlorophyll 3aeggs 3afemales 3afoliar application 3agrasses 3ainsects 3alarvae 3aleaves 3alongevity 3amales 3aneonates 3aplant height 3apupae 3arice 3asex ratio 3ashoots 3asilicic acid 3asilicon 3asoil 3avegetative growth 3aviability1 aAssis, F.

Some novel biomarkers have been reported that can determine the gastrointestinal and renal injury caused by a high dose of NSAIDs or other toxic substances. This study was aimed at determining the changes in gastrointestinal (TFF2 and HYP), renal (NGAL and KIM-1) and cardiac (cTn-I, CK-MB) injury markers after the use of increasing intravenous doses of TA in sheep. TA was administered intravenously to groups of six sheep each, at the dose levels of 0 (Group 0, i.e., G0), 2 (G2), 4 (G4), 8 (G8) and 16 (G16) mg/kg. The concentrations of the studied biomarkers were measured at 3, 9, 18 and 36 h after administration of TA. The TFF2 and NGAL concentrations in G16 were found to be significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the other groups except for G8 at different sampling times. HYP concentration in G16 was observed to be significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that in all other groups at 36 h. KIM-1 level in G16 was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in all other groups at different sampling times. An increase in the renal markers, KIM-1 and NGAL, in G8 was observed before any change in plasma creatinine and urea. The cardiac marker cTn-I in G16 was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in other groups at different sampling times. The results showed that the novel biomarkers (HYP, TFF2, NGAL, and KIM-1) can be used to determine gastric and renal injury in sheep.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood plasma 3acreatinine 3agastrointestinal system 3aintravenous injection 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3asheep 3atoxic substances 3aurea 0aBiomarkers 0acardiac 0agastrointestinal 0ainjury 0arenal 0atolfenamic acid1 aCorum, Orhan1 aAtik, Orkun1 aDurna Corum, Duygu1 aAltan, Feray1 aOk, Mahmut1 aUney, Kamil0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2019 Mar., v. 67, no. 1 p.87-97dAkadÃ©miai KiadÃ³wJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/004.2019.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245010900179300001800288520127700306592002801583650001801611650001301629650001401642650001101656650001301667650001501680650001901695650001301714650001401727650001001741650002201751650001401773650001201787650001901799650000901818650002501827650002001852650001601872650002701888700002701915700004001942700003701982700008002019773016602099856008302265852000902348655001202357IND60684365120221120084733.0200827e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068436512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-07209-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSampaio, Carolina Ferreira10aImpairment of testicular development in rats exposed to acephate during maternal gestation and lactation  ap. 5482-5488.  aAcephate is an organophosphate insecticide that disrupts the endocrine system and impairs the male reproductive system. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether exposure to acephate during maternal gestation and lactation histologically damages the testes of male Wistar rats in adulthood. For this study, adult Wistar rats were divided into the following groups: ACE-mother, (2.5Â mg/kg/bw, gestational day (GD) 7 to postnatal day (PND) 21) and oil-mother (corn oil (control), GD 7 to PND 21). The male offspring (PND 90) were euthanized, and the prostates and testes were collected and weighed. The testes were utilized for histopathological analyses and to determine the sperm count. A spermatogenesis kinetic analysis revealed an increased number of seminiferous tubules in stages IâVI in the ACE-mother group. Additionally, we observed a decrease in the epithelium and the diameters of the evaluated seminiferous tubules and in the number of Sertoli cells in the group exposed to acephate. The sperm count analysis showed no difference between the groups. We conclude that maternal exposure to the pesticide acephate did not affect testicular function, but led to the impairment of testicular development and morphology of the tissue in adulthood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSertoli cells 3aacephate 3aadulthood 3aadults 3acorn oil 3aepithelium 3ahistopathology 3akinetics 3alactation 3amales 3amaternal exposure 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3aprostate gland 3arats 3aseminiferous tubules 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatozoa 3atesticular development1 aPrates, Kelly ValÃ©rio1 aSiervo, GlÃ¡ucia Eloisa Munhoz Lion1 aMathias, Paulo CÃ©zar de Freitas1 aFernandes, Glaura Scantamburlo Alves1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6043-11310 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Feb., v. 27, no. 5 p.5482-5488dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07209-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245007700161300001800238520108100256592002801337650002001365650001901385650001201404650001401416650000901430650001101439650002001450650001601470650002201486650002501508650001901533650001901552773012101571856007501692852000901767655001201776IND60559195320221120154003.0161129e20140807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055919532DNAL7 a10.1021/jp504140z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchez, Isaac C.10aDimensionless Thermodynamics: A New Paradigm for Liquid State Properties  ap. 9386-9397.  aEquations of state in the van der Waals genre suggest that saturated liquids should adhere to the following corresponding states principle (CSP): saturated liquids at the same reduced density (ÏR = Ï/Ïc) have comparable dimensionless thermodynamic properties. This CSP is shown to be applicable to a variety of thermodynamic properties that include entropy of vaporization, cohesive energy density, thermal expansion coefficient, isothermal compressibility, thermal pressure coefficient, compressibility factor, temperature coefficient of the vapor pressure, heat capacity difference, and surface tension. For two classes of liquids, all properties rendered dimensionless by the proper choice of scaling variables superpose to form âmaster curvesâ that illustrate the CSP. Using scaled particle theory, an improved van der Waals model is developed whose results are compared with existing experimental thermodynamic data in dimensionless form. Properly expressing thermodynamic properties in dimensionless form acts to consolidate and harmonize liquid state properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompressibility 3aenergy density 3aentropy 3aequations 3aheat 3amodels 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3athermal expansion 3avan der Waals forces 3avapor pressure 3avolatilization0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Aug. 07, v. 118, no. 31 p.9386-9397dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp504140z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013800154300001400292500002000306520186600326592002802192650002002220650002802240650002202268650002102290650000902311650001402320650002302334650002202357650001102379650001102390650002802401650001402429650001302443650002202456650000902478650002302487650001102510651001702521651001202538700001702550773013002567856007302697852000902770655001202779IND60588442020221119134433.0180117e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058844202DNAL7 a10.1111/jen.124262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaub, B.10aDeveloping a biocontrol strategy to protect stored potato tubers from infestation with potato tuber moth species in the Andean region  ap. 78-88.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHeavy infestations of stored potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers by the two potato tuber moth species Symmetrischema tangolias (Gyen) and Tecia solanivora (Povolny) frequently occur in Andean potatoâgrowing regions of Ecuador. The aim of the study was to develop a biological control strategy for both species using powder formulations made of inert substances, Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) granulovirus (PhopGV) and Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner subsp. kurstaki (Btk). The LCââ of PhopGV on T.Â solanivora was 0.33Â LE/L, and Btk caused 82.7% mortality at a concentration of 100Â g/L in bioassays. The efficacy of talcum, kaolin, calcium carbonate and sand ranged between 76.2% and 98.7%. Calcium carbonate was highly effective to control both species; however, its efficacy was affected by the relative humidity and dropped to 55.4% at relative humidity of 100%. PhopGV at concentrations of five larvae equivalents (LE) per kg kaolin and Btk at a concentration of 60Â g Btk/kg talcum caused 95.7% and 88.1% mortality of T.Â solanivora, respectively. In storage experiments, the efficacy of calcium carbonate alone and in combination with PhopGV (20 LE/kg) and Btk (15Â g/kg) caused 95.0â99.8% mortality of T.Â solanivora in all treatments and reduced infestation on potato tubers by 83.6%â91.0%. In the case of S.Â tangolias, Btk significantly increased mortality to 96.5% compared with calcium carbonate alone and reduced tuber infestation by 83.4%. Storage of potato tubers in thin layers enhanced the efficacy of the calcium carbonate treatment compared with storage in bags. It was concluded that calcium carbonate alone seems to be appropriate for the control of T.Â solanivora, and an addition of 15Â g Btk/kg would improve the control of S.Â tangolias. It is suggested to test these new formulations under onâfarm storage conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetabaculovirus 3aPhthorimaea operculella 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aTecia solanivora 3abags 3abioassays 3abiological control 3acalcium carbonate 3akaolin 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3apotatoes 3arelative humidity 3asand 3astorage conditions 3atubers 3aAndes region 3aEcuador1 aKroschel, J.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2018 Feb., v. 142, no. 1-2 p.78-88dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57792x0931-20487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jen.124263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245013200195300001600327500001500343520152600358592002801884650000901912650001101921650001101932650002201943650002001965650000901985650002901994650001902023650002002042650001002062650001602072650002002088650002902108650002702137650002102164650002302185650002502208650001002233650002602243650001802269650002002287650002802307650002802335650002502363650003902388650002002427653001002447700002302457700001902480700002202499773009702521856005502618852000902673655001202682IND4478221720221120043914.0120815e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447822172DNAL7 a224690012pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05014.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoremykin, Vadim V.14aThe mitochondrial genome of Malus domestica and the importâdriven hypothesis of mitochondrial genome expansion in seed plants  ap. 615-626.  a2019-12-06  aMitochondrial genomes of spermatophytes are the largest of all organellar genomes. Their large size has been attributed to various factors; however, the relative contribution of these factors to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) expansion remains undetermined. We estimated their relative contribution in Malus domestica (apple). The mitochondrial genome of apple has a size of 396â947âbp and a one to nine ratio of coding to nonâcoding DNA, close to the corresponding average values for angiosperms. We determined that 71.5% of the apple mtDNA sequence was highly similar to sequences of its nuclear DNA. Using nuclear gene exons, nuclear transposable elements and chloroplast DNA as markers of promiscuous DNA content in mtDNA, we estimated that approximately 20% of the apple mtDNA consisted of DNA sequences imported from other cell compartments, mostly from the nucleus. Similar markerâbased estimates of promiscuous DNA content in the mitochondrial genomes of other species ranged between 21.2 and 25.3% of the total mtDNA length for grape, between 23.1 and 38.6% for rice, and between 47.1 and 78.4% for maize. All these estimates are conservative, because they underestimate the import of nonâfunctional DNA. We propose that the import of promiscuous DNA is a core mechanism for mtDNA size expansion in seed plants. In apple, maize and grape this mechanism contributed far more to genome expansion than did homologous recombination. In rice the estimated contribution of both mechanisms was found to be similar.  aPublisher supplied data 3arice 3aapples 3agrapes 3amitochondrial DNA 3achloroplast DNA 3acorn 3ahomologous recombination 3anuclear genome 3aMalus domestica 3aexons 3atransposons 3agenetic markers 2aMagnoliopsidaxgenetics. 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aDNA, Chloroplast 2aDNA, Mitochondrial 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aExons 2aGenome, Mitochondrial 2aGenome, Plant 2aMalusxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Virusesxgenetics 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aSeedsxgenetics 0agenes1 aLockhart, Peter J.1 aViola, Roberto1 aVelasco, Riccardo0 tplant journal.g2012 Aug., v. 71, no. 4 p.615-626dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05014.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245012100203300001800324506007600342520182100418592002802239506003702267650001502304650002602319650001302345650001102358650001102369650002202380700002202402700002702424773012102451856007502572852000902647655001202656IND60558929920221207143534.0161120e20130822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055892992DNAL7 a10.1021/jp406725a2doi7 aPMC37850122pmcid7 a238553492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Prabhat K.,13aAn Ionâs Perspective on the Molecular Motions of Nanoconfined Water: A Two-Dimensional Infrared Spectroscopy Study  ap. 9775-9784.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe vibrational population relaxation and hydration shell dynamics of the symmetric tricyanomethanide (TCM) anion are investigated in a sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate reverse micelle as a function of the water pool radius. Two-dimensional infrared (IR) spectroscopy in combination with linear absorption and ultrafast IR pumpâprobe spectroscopy is utilized in this study. Spectroscopic measurements show that the anion has two bands in the 2160â2175 cmâÂ¹ region, each with its own spectroscopic signatures. Analysis of the vibrational dynamics shows that the two vibrational bands are consistent with the anion located either at the interface or in the water pool. The sensitivity of the TCM anion to the environment allows us to unequivocally monitor the vibrational and hydration dynamics of the anion in those two different environments. A TCM anion located at the interface does not show any significant variation of the vibrational dynamics with the water pool size. On the contrary, the TCM anion inside the water pool exhibits a large and nonlinear variation of the vibrational lifetime and the frequencyâfrequency correlation time with the pool radius. Moreover, for the solvated anion in water pools of 49 Ã in radius (Wâ = 30), the vibrational lifetime reaches the values observed for the anion in bulk water while the frequencyâfrequency correlation time shows a characteristic time higher than that observed in the bulk. In addition, for the first time a model is developed and used to explain the observed nonlinear variation of the spectroscopic observables with the pool size. This model attributes the changes in the vibrational dynamics of the TCM anion in the water pool to the slow and radius-dependent water dynamics present in the confined environment of a reverse micelle.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amicelles 3amodels 3asodium 3aspectral analysis1 aKuroda, Daniel G.1 aHochstrasser, Robin M.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Aug. 22, v. 117, no. 33 p.9775-9784dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp406725a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012700163300001800290500001900308520150800327592002801835650002401863650001101887650002501898650002201923650003001945650001701975650001301992650001902005650001302024650003302037650001302070650001102083653003002094653003302124653002302157653003002180653002502210653003402235700001702269700001902286700002302305700001502328700001502343700001402358700001402372773016302386856008202549852000902631655001202640IND60700880320221121093726.0200705e20180108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070088032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.1942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiew, C.W.10aSolution structure analysis of the periplasmic region of bacterial flagellar motor stators by small angle X-ray scattering  ap. 1614-1619.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe bacterial flagellar motor drives the rotation of helical flagellar filaments to propel bacteria through viscous media. It consists of a dynamic population of mechanosensitive stators that are embedded in the inner membrane and activate in response to external load. This entails assembly around the rotor, anchoring to the peptidoglycan layer to counteract torque from the rotor and opening of a cation channel to facilitate an influx of cations, which is converted into mechanical rotation. Stator complexes are comprised of four copies of an integral membrane A subunit and two copies of a B subunit. Each B subunit includes a C-terminal OmpA-like peptidoglycan-binding (PGB) domain. This is thought to be linked to a single N-terminal transmembrane helix by a long unstructured peptide, which allows the PGB domain to bind to the peptidoglycan layer during stator anchoring. The high-resolution crystal structures of flagellar motor PGB domains from Salmonella enterica (MotBCâ) and Vibrio alginolyticus (PomBCâ) have previously been elucidated. Here, we use small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). We show that unlike MotBCâ, the dimeric conformation of the PomBCâ in solution differs to its crystal structure, and explore the functional relevance by characterising gain-of-function mutants as well as wild-type constructs of various lengths. These provide new insight into the conformational diversity of flagellar motor PGB domains and experimental verification of their overall topology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella enterica 3aStator 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3acrystal structure 3again-of-function mutation 3aion channels 3apeptides 3apeptidoglycans 3aresearch 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3atopology 3atorque 0aBacterial flagellar motor 0aSmall angle X-ray scattering 0aStructural biology 0aMacromolecular assemblies 0aBacterial chemotaxis 0aPeptidoglycan binding protein1 aHynson, R.M.1 aGanuelas, L.A.1 aShah-Mohammadi, N.1 aDuff, A.P.1 aKojima, S.1 aHomma, M.1 aLee, L.K.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Jan. 08, v. 495, no. 2 p.1614-1619dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.1943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009600161300001800257520192100275592002802196650004402224650001502268650002202283650001502305650002102320650001102341650004402352650001302396650001602409650001902425700002202444700002402466700002402490773012102514856007502635852000902710655001202719IND60559195420221120154022.0161129e20140807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055919542DNAL7 a10.1021/jp50420742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRÄjawanta Kaura,10aSelf-Association Behavior of a Novel Nonproteinogenic Î²-Strand-Mimic in an Organic Solvent  ap. 9199-9208.  aThe self-association behavior of a newly characterized Î²-strand-mimic, presented by an achiral nonproteinogenic model system Boc-Î³-Abz-NHMe (1: Boc = tert-butyloxycarbonyl; Î³-Abz = Î³-aminobenzoic acid; NHMe = N-methylamide), have been investigated using Â¹H NMR and FT-IR absorption spectroscopy, in combination with computational ab initio calculations. The concentration dependence of Â¹H NMR chemical shifts of the amide-NHs in CDClâ exhibited noncooperative behavior of self-association, whereas the variable temperature Â¹H NMR chemical shifts data of the amide-NHs, i.e., temperature-coefficient (ÎÎ´/ÎT) values, could be accounted for by significant enhancement of self-association, i.e., aggregates higher than dimers. In the absence of NâHÂ·Â·Â·O intramolecular H-bond in 1, the intense FT-IR absorption bands in informative amide-A region, i.e., NâH stretches at â¼3465 and 3438 cmâÂ¹ in chloroform solution, could be interpreted in terms of intermolecular H-bonding. The ab initio quantum mechanical calculations performed on two discrete isolated antiparallel H-bonded duplexes with a face-to-face and an edge-to-edge aromaticâaromatic interaction provided strong support for their relative importance to stabilize favorable dimeric structures. The thermodynamic parameters deduced from vanât Hoff plots, constructed from variable temperature Â¹H NMR data of the amide-NHs in CDClâ, also substantiated the effectiveness of aromaticâaromatic interactions for dimer formation and higher-order self-association. In view of the enormous structural importance of Î²-strand-like building blocks in peptide design, we highlight intrinsic self-associating potentials of the readily available Î³-Abz moiety, besides the fact that such planar secondary structural mimics are presumed to offer greater prospective for constructing peptidomimetics and therapeutically relevant small molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3achemical elements 3achloroform 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aRamesh, Muthusamy1 aBharatam, Prasad

Aims: The present study was designed to evaluate the role of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the regulation of Notch signalling in rodent seminiferous epithelium. Methods: We explored the effects (1) of pharmacological inhibition of the hypothalamus&#x2013;pituitary&#x2013;gonadal (HPG) axis and FSH replacement in pubertal rats, and (2) of photoinhibition of HPG axis followed by FSH substitution in seasonally breeding rodents, bank voles, on Notch pathway activity. Experiments on isolated rat Sertoli cells exposed to FSH were also performed. Gene and protein expressions of Notch pathway components were analysed using RT-qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence. Key results: Distribution patterns of Notch pathway proteins in bank vole and rat seminiferous epithelium were comparable; however, levels of activated Notch1 and Notch3, hairy/enhancer of split 1 (HES1) and hairy/enhancer of split-related with YRPW motif 1 (HEY1) in bank voles were dependent on the length of the photoperiod. In response to FSH similar changes in these proteins were found in both species, indicating that FSH is a negative regulator of Notch pathway activity in seminiferous epithelium. Conclusions: Our results support a common mechanism of FSH action on Notch pathway during onset and recrudescence of spermatogenesis in rodents. Implications: Interaction between FSH signalling and Notch pathway in Sertoli cells may be involved in spermatogenic activity changes of the testes occurring during puberty or photoperiod shift in continuously and seasonally breeding rodents, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClethrionomys glareolus 3aWestern blotting 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agenes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aphotoinhibition 3apuberty 3arats 3aseminiferous epithelium 3aspermatogenesis 0aendocrinology 0agene expression 0aimmunocytochemistry/immunohistochemistry 0aNotch pathway 0aphotoperiod 0aSertoli cell 0asignal transduction 0atestis1 aKaminska, Alicja1 aBrzoskwinia, Malgorzata1 aPardyak, Laura1 aPawlicki, Piotr1 aSzpregiel, Izabela1 aBilinska, Barbara1 aHejmej, Anna0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2022, v. 34, no. 7 p.560-575dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl47095x1031-36137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD212373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245017400170300001400344520142400358592002801782650001401810650002301824650001401847650001901861650001601880650001501896650002901911650001001940650001501950650002401965650002101989650000902010650001302019650001802032653003002050653002402080653001502104653002002119653002102139700001502160700001702175700001802192700001702210700001402227700001702241773009502258856008502353852000902438655001202447IND60554435120221122173447.0161024e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055443512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Chunjuan10aUHPLCâESIâMS/MS determination and pharmacokinetic study of two alkaloid components in rat plasma after oral administration of the extract of Corydalis bungeana Turcz  ap. 59-66.  aCorynoline and acetycorynoline are active compounds of Corydalis bungeana Turcz. with various pharmacological effects such as sedation, anti-leptospira and liver injury protection effects. A specific, simple and sensitive UHPLCâESIâMS/MS method was developed and validated for the pharmacokinetic study of corynoline and acetycorynoline in rat plasma. Corynoline and acetycorynoline were extracted from plasma samples by liquidâliquid extraction. The analysis was carried out on an Agilent SB-C18 column (1.8Î¼m, 50mmÃ2.1mm) with the mobile phase of acetonitrileâ0.1% formic acid (80:20, v/v). The detection was performed on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode via electrospray ionization (ESI) source in positive mode. The current UHPLCâESIâMS/MS assay was validated for linearity, intra-day and inter-day precisions, accuracy, extraction recovery and stability. The lower limits of quantification were 0.10ng/mL for corynoline and 0.353ng/mL for acetycorynoline. Intra-day and inter-day precision were less than 12.3% and accuracy ranged from 0.18% to 14.9%. The mean extraction recoveries of analytes and internal standard (IS) from rat plasma were all more than 76.2%. This validated method was successfully applied to pharmacokinetic study in rats after oral administration of corynoline, acetycorynoline and the extract of Corydalis bungeana Turcz.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorydalis 3aactive ingredients 3aalkaloids 3achromatography 3aformic acid 3aionization 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3aliver 3amonitoring 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3asedation 3aspectrometers 0aCorydalis bungeana Turcz. 0aUHPLCâESIâMS/MS 0aCorynoline 0aAcetycorynoline 0aPharmacokinetics1 aXiao, Yang1 aWang, Zhibin1 aWang, Shuhong1 aChen, Lijuan1 aWu, Lijun1 aLiu, Gaofeng0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2014 June 01, v. 960 p.59-66dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03602naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245013300173300001800306520151400324592002801838596009001866596007801956596008302034650001602117650002002133650001902153650001602172650003002188650002002218650001002238650002402248650002302272650002102295650001802316650001602334650002402350650000902374650001802383650001302401650002102414700002102435700003202456700002802488700003802516700002802554700002902582700001702611700004102628700003802669700005902707773016602766856008302932852000903015655001203024IND60684365520221120100533.0200827e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068436552DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-07322-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodoy, Aline Andrade10aAssessment of the ecotoxicity of the pharmaceuticals bisoprolol, sotalol, and ranitidine using standard and behavioral endpoints  ap. 5469-5481.  aThe pharmaceuticals bisoprolol (BIS), sotalol (SOT), and ranitidine (RAN) are among the most consumed pharmaceuticals worldwide and are frequently detected in different aquatic ecosystems. However, very few ecotoxicity data are available in the literature for them. To help fill these data gaps, toxicity tests with the algae Raphidocelis subcapitata, the macrophyte Lemna minor, the cnidarian Hydra attenuata, the crustacean Daphnia similis, and the fish Danio rerio were performed for assessing the ecotoxicity of these pharmaceuticals. Standard, as well as non-standard endpoint, was evaluated, including the locomotor behavior of D. rerio larvae. Results obtained for SOT and RAN showed that acute adverse effects are not expected to occur on aquatic organisms at the concentrations at which these pharmaceuticals are usually found in fresh surface waters. On the other hand, BIS was classified as hazardous to the environment in the acute III category. Locomotor behavior of D. rerio larvae was not affected by BIS and RAN. A disturbance on the total swimming distance at the dark cycle was observed only for larvae exposed to the highest test concentration of 500Â mgÂ Lâ»Â¹ of SOT. D. similis reproduction was affected by BIS with an ECââ of 3.6 (0.1â34.0) mgÂ Lâ»Â¹. A risk quotient (RQ) of 0.04 was calculated for BIS in fresh surface water, considering a worst-case scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first chronic toxicity data with BIS on non-target organisms.  aPublisher supplied data  a88881.132858/2016-01cCoordenaÃ§Ã£o de AperfeiÃ§oamento de Pessoal de NÃ­vel Superior  aUID/AMB/50017/2019cMinistÃ©rio da CiÃªncia, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior  aLaw 57/2017, of July 19cMinistÃ©rio da CiÃªncia, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior 3aDanio rerio 3aDaphnia similis 3aHydra vulgaris 3aLemna minor 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 3aadverse effects 3aalgae 3aanimal reproduction 3aaquatic ecosystems 3achronic toxicity 3aecotoxicology 3amacrophytes 3anontarget organisms 3arisk 3asurface water 3aswimming 3atoxicity testing1 aDomingues, InÃªs1 ade Carvalho, Luciano Bastos1 aOliveira, Ãdria Caloto1 ade Jesus Azevedo, Carina Cristina1 aTaparo, Jeniffer Marins1 aAssano, PatrÃ­cia Kushim1 aMori, Vivien1 ade Almeida Vergara Hidalgo, VitÃ³ria1 aNogueira, AntÃ³nio JosÃ© ArsÃ©nia1 aKummrow, FÃ¡bio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2977-01080 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Feb., v. 27, no. 5 p.5469-5481dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07322-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245011800153300001600271500002000287520099400307592002801301650002401329650002201353650002801375650003001403650001401433650000901447650001201456650001501468650001001483650001201493650001501505700001701520700001401537700001601551773013201567856007301699852000901772655001201781IND60588442420221119134413.0180117e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058844242DNAL7 a10.1111/jen.124142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, J.10aSuitability assessment of three Trichogramma species in the control of Mythimna separata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 131-140.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMythimna separata (Walker) is a serious cosmopolitan pest. Trichogramma species have been used worldwide as biological control agents of lepidopteran pests. However, no data on the control efficiency of Trichogramma species on this pest have been reported. We evaluated the suitability of M.Â separata eggs for three Trichogramma species, Trichogramma dendrolimi Matsumura, T.Â ostriniae Pang et Chen and T.Â japonicum Ashmead, and compared the suitability with that of Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton) eggs. The parasitism rate, development time, emergence rate, female proportion, body size and egg load of female offspring indicated that the M.Â separata egg is a suitable host for the three Trichogramma species. On the other hand, the nonâemergence rate and the relationship between egg load and body size reflected that M.Â separata eggs are less suitable for the three Trichogramma species than C.Â cephalonica eggs. Egg resorption occurred in T.Â japonicum 4Â days after emergence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorcyra cephalonica 3aMythimna separata 3aTrichogramma dendrolimi 3abiological control agents 3abody size 3aeggs 3afemales 3aparasitism 3apests 3aprogeny 3aresorption1 aHua, H.âQ.1 aZhang, F.1 aLi, Y.âX.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2018 Feb., v. 142, no. 1-2 p.131-140dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57792x0931-20487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jen.124143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245015400164300001400318520115800332592002801490650001701518650001001535650001801545650002601563650001501589650002601604650002901630650001301659650001501672650002101687650000901708650002901717653002101746653000901767653001501776653001501791653001501806700001701821700001101838700001301849700002001862700002201882700001301904700001801917700001801935700001801953773009501971856008502066852000902151655001202160IND60554435220221122173405.0161024e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055443522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Juan10aDetermination and pharmacokinetic study of the novel anti-tumor candidate drug DG-7 in rat plasma by liquid chromatographyâtandem mass spectrometry  ap. 14-18.  aDG-7 (11,14-dihydroxy-7,20-epoxy-20-O-derivative of ent-kaurene diterpenoid) is a novel anti-tumor candidate drug. A sensitive and specific liquid chromatographyâtandem mass spectrometry (LCâMS/MS) method was developed and validated for the quantification of DG-7 in rat plasma. An aliquot of 50Î¼L plasma sample was prepared by liquidâliquid extraction with ethyl acetate. Chromatographic separation was accomplished on a Waters XTerra C18 column (2.1mmÃ150mm, 5Î¼m) with an isocratic elution system consisting of methanol and water. Detection was performed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode. The optimized fragmentation transitions for MRM were m/z 590.1âm/z 260.0 for DG-7 and m/z 180.3âm/z 110.1 for phenacetin (internal standard). The method was linear over the concentration range of 5â2500ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precisions were less than 7.9% and the accuracy was within Â±9.0%. The mean recovery of DG-7 ranged from 76.8% to 79.2%.

Long-term fermented soybean pastes (LFSPs) are made by fermentation with naturally-occurring microorganisms for several months, whereas short-term fermented soybean pastes (SFSPs) are produced by shorter-time fermentation inoculated with a starter culture. Here, we demonstrate that administration of LFSP, but not SFSP, protects high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice against non-alcohol fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance. LFSP suppressed body weight gain in parallel with reduction in fat accumulation in mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) and the liver via modulation of MAT lipolysis and hepatic lipid uptake. LFSP-treated mice also had improved glucose tolerance and increased adiponectin levels concomitantly with enhanced AMPK activation in skeletal muscle and suppressed expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in skeletal muscle and the liver. LFSP also attenuated HFD-induced gut permeability and lowered serum lipopolysaccharide level, providing an evidence for its probiotic effects, which was supported by the observation that treatment of a probiotic mixture of LFSP-originated Bacillus strains protected mice against HFD-induced adiposity and glucose intolerance. Our findings suggest that the intake of LFSP, but not SFSP, offers protection against NAFLD and insulin resistance, which is an effect of long-term fermentation resulting in elevated contents of active ingredients (especially flavonoids) and higher diversity and richness of Bacillus probiotic strains compared to SFSP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3aadipose tissue 3aadiposity 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3acytokines 3afatty liver 3afermentation 3aflavonoids 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ahigh fat diet 3ainsulin resistance 3alipolysis 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3apermeability 3aprobiotics 3aprotective effect 3aresearch 3askeletal muscle 3asoybean paste 3asoybeans 3astarter cultures 0aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease 0aFermented soybean paste 0aLong-term fermentation1 aKim, Bobae1 aPark, Haryung1 aJi, Yosep1 aHolzapfel, Wilhelm1 aKim, Do-Young1 aHyun, Chang-Kee0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Jan. 08, v. 495, no. 2 p.1744-1751dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009300163300001600256520126500272592002801537650001301565650001601578650001101594650001301605650001601618650002701634650001201661650001801673650001701691650001201708650003901720700001701759700002001776700001501796700001801811700001801829773012801847856008101975852000902056655001202065IND4469505320221116214230.0141112e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446950532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2012.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBougatef, Ali10aRecovery and physicochemical properties of smooth hound (mustelus mustelus) skin gelatin  ap. 248-254.  aGelatin was extracted from the skin of smooth hound after pre-treatment with acetic and citric acids.

The hydroxyproline yields of gelatins extracted for 24ÃÂ h with acetic acid and with SHCAP were 17.34% and 56.82%, respectively. While the serine content recorded for the smooth hound skin gelatin (SHSG) extracted with SHCAP was higher than that of halal bovine gelatin (HBG) (36 versus 29 residues per 1000 residues), hydroxyproline and proline (202 residues per 1000 residues) contents were slightly lower (219 residues per 1000 residues). The gel strength of the gelatin gel from SHSG (211ÃÂ g) was lower than that of HBG (259ÃÂ g) (pÃÂ <ÃÂ 0.05). Compared to HBG (pÃÂ <ÃÂ 0.05), SHSG was noted to exhibit lower emulsifying, foaming, and fat-binding properties but similar emulsifying stability. SDS-PAGE revealed that SHSG showed high band intensity for the major protein components, especially ÃÂ±- and ÃÂ²-components, which was comparable to that of standard calf skin collagen type I. In conclusion gelatin extracted from smooth hound skin has good quality and can be used in the food industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMustelus 3aacetic acid 3acalves 3acollagen 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3afoaming 3afood industry 3agel strength 3agelatin 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis1 aBalti, Rafik1 aSila, AssaÃÂ¢d1 aNasri, Rim1 aGraiaa, Ghada1 aNasri, Moncef0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2012 Oct., v. 48, no. 2 p.248-254dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012500172500001900297520173500316592002802051650001302079650002102092650001102113650001902124650001802143650001502161650001902176650000902195650002202204651002002226653003302246653003002279653001202309653001502321653001102336700001702347700002002364700001602384700001502400700001502415700001702430773010602447856008702553852000902640655001202649IND60733419520221123031635.0210423e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073341952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1183892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Yongcheng14aThe abundance and characteristics of atmospheric microplastic deposition in the northwestern South China Sea in the fall  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAtmospheric microplastics have been widely reported and detected in remote mountain areas and oceans, indicating that they can be transported over long distances through the atmosphere. Regional transport and deposition processes of atmospheric microplastics have a significant impact on the source and sink patterns, as well as the flux mechanisms of microplastics in terrestrial and marine environments. However, few studies have been conducted on the deposition of atmospheric microplastics. Thus, in this study, we collected atmospheric microplastic samples from the northwestern South China Sea and estimated that in the fall the dry deposition of atmospheric microplastics into the ocean was 1.4Â ÃÂ 10Â³Â t, which had a greater contribution than riverine inputs of microplastics in this region, suggesting that atmospheric microplastics are non-negligible sources of marine plastic litter with high environmental risk. Additionally, we reported on the abundance (0.035Â Â±Â 0.015 n/mÂ³), morphological characteristics, composition, and sources of atmospheric microplastics in the northwestern South China Sea. Smaller-sized microplastics had a high abundance that decreased with increased proximity from the coast. Most of the detected microplastics were fibers, which accounted for approximately two-thirds of the total quantity. The spectral analysis detected seven polymer types, and polyester was predominant (29%). Combined with the cluster analysis of the backward trajectories of airflow, we demonstrated that the airflow affecting the northwestern South China Sea originated mainly from the northeast, potentially carrying microplastics from cities located in southeastern Chinese provinces to the South China Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3acluster analysis 3acoasts 3adry deposition 3amicroplastics 3apolyesters 3ariparian areas 3arisk 3aspectral analysis 3aSouth China Sea 0aNorthwestern South China Sea 0aAtmospheric microplastics 0aAirflow 0aDeposition 0aSource1 aZou, Xinqing1 aWang, Chenglong1 aFeng, Ziyue1 aWang, Ying1 aFan, Qinya1 aChen, Hongyu0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 May 15, v. 253 p.118389-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1183893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245008100206300001600287506007600303520080500379592002801184506003701212650002201249650001101271650002601282650001601308650002301324653001101347653003501358653000901393653001401402653004101416653003101457700001701488700001801505700001601523700002601539700001201565700006801577700001901645700002101664700006201685700002501747773012101772856008201893852000901975655001201984IND60528648120221207124002.0160716e20160226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052864812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.01.1722doi7 aPMC55536232pmcid7 a268282692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Sascha14aThe solution structure of the kallikrein-related peptidases inhibitor SPINK6  ap. 103-108.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aKallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) are crucial for epidermal barrier function and are involved in the proteolytic regulation of the desquamation process. Elevated KLK levels were reported in atopic dermatitis. In skin, the proteolytic activity of KLKs is regulated by specific inhibitors of the serine protease inhibitor of Kazal-type (SPINK) family. SPINK6 was shown to be expressed in human stratum corneum and is able to inhibit several KLKs such as KLK4, -5, -12, -13 and -14. In order to understand the structural traits of the specific inhibition we solved the structure of SPINK6 in solution by NMR-spectroscopy and studied its interaction with KLKs. Thereby, beside the conserved binding mode, we identified an alternate binding mode which has so far not been observed for SPINK inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aatopic dermatitis 3ahumans 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteolysis 3aserine proteinases 0aSPINK6 0aKallikrein-related peptidase 4 0aKLK4 0aStructure 0aModel protease â inhibitor complex 0aNuclear magnetic resonance1 aFischer, Jan1 aSpudy, BjÃ¶rn1 aKerkow, Tim1 aSÃ¶nnichsen, Frank D.1 aXue, Li1 aBonvin, Alexandre M.J.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7369-13221 aGoettig, Peter1 aMagdolen, Viktor1 aMeyer-Hoffert, Ulf1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2305-14281 aGrÃ¶tzinger, Joachim0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Feb. 26, v. 471 p.103-108dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.01.1723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024004000135040001800175100002000193245012800213300001400341520159900355592002801954650001101982650002001993650001602013650001502029650001502044650001002059650001802069650004702087650003202134650000902166650001102175650002602186650004302212650001102255650004002266650003102306650000902337650004702346650001802393650004402411650003202455650004902487650003002536650002402566650001602590700002702606700002202633773008302655856008602738990002302824852000902847655001202856IND60091803220221118054627.0141103e20111114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009180322DNAL7 a220000802pmid7 aPMC32053002pmcid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2011.09.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoss, Robert S.14aThe hippocampus is functionally connected to the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex during context dependent decision making  ap. 53-66.  aMany of our everyday actions are only appropriate in certain situations and selecting the appropriate behavior requires that we use current context and previous experience to guide our decisions. The current study examined hippocampal functional connectivity with prefrontal and striatal regions during a task that required participants to make decisions based on the contextual retrieval of overlapping sequential representations. Participants learned four sequences comprised of six faces each. An overlapping condition was created by having two sequences with two identical faces as the middle images. A non-overlapping condition contained two sequences that did not share any faces between them. Hippocampal functional connectivity was assessed during the presentation period and at the critical choice, where participants had to make a contextually dependent decision. The left hippocampus showed significantly increased functional connectivity with dorsal and ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex during the presentation period of the overlapping compared to the non-overlapping condition after participants knew the sequences. At the critical choice point of the overlapping condition, the left hippocampus showed stronger functional connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex. These functional connectivity results suggest that the hippocampus may play a role in decision making by predicting the possibilities of what might come next, allowing orbitofrontal and striatal regions to evaluate the expected choice options in order to make the correct action at the choice point.  aPublisher supplied data 3acortex 3adecision making 3ahippocampus 3aprediction 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBrain Mapping 2aCorpus Striatumxblood supplyxphysiology. 2aDecision Makingxphysiology 2aFace 2aFemale 2aFunctional Laterality 2aHippocampusxblood supplyxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aMagnetic Resonance Imaging 2aMale 2aNeural Pathwaysxblood supplyxphysiology. 2aOxygenxblood 2aPattern Recognition, Visualxphysiology 2aPhotic Stimulationxmethods 2aPrefrontal Cortexxblood supplyxphysiology. 2aReaction Timexphysiology 2aStatistics as Topic 2aYoung Adult1 aSherrill, Katherine R.1 aStern, Chantal E.0 tBrain research.g2011 Nov. 14, v. 1423 p.53-66dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2011.09.0383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011200153300001600265520092200281592002801203650002601231650001201257650003301269650002301302650001301325650001501338650001301353650002101366650002001387650002201407650001601429700002001445700001501465700001201480700002101492700001301513700002001526773011901546856007401665852000901739655001201748IND60618170220221121003100.0181029e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061817022DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra12101f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Bo10aSynthesis and properties of soluble aromatic polyimides from novel 4,5-diazafluorene-containing dianhydride  ap. 194-205.  aA series of organo-soluble, high glass transition temperature (Tg), and low dielectric constant aromatic polyimides containing 4,5-diazafluorene in the polymer chain were synthesized from a novel dianhydride monomer, 9,9-di[4-(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)phenyl]-4,5-diazafluorene dianhydride.

While most systems are based on an assessment of logsâ external characteristics, there is an implicit assumption that doing so captures important information on the underlying processes of internal decomposition. However, the validity of this remains largely untested. We explored the relationship between decay-class and internal state of decomposition in logs of Eucalyptus obliqua in the lowland wet eucalypt forests of Southern Tasmania, Australia. We examined rotten-wood samples from a large population of logs across a wide range of diameters. From this we determined that smaller-diameter (<60cm: regrowth-sized) logs differ from larger-diameter (>60cm: mature-sized) logs in their pathways of internal decomposition. Decomposition in regrowth-sized logs is characterised by greater activity of surface rots, with white rot-types predominating. Decomposition in mature-sized logs is more concentrated in the interior of the log, with brown rot-types tending to dominate. These differences probably both reflect and help shape the communities of organisms inhabiting logs of different origins. Despite these differences, regrowth and mature-sized logs show the same general progression of internal decomposition across the five decay-classes, to the extent that each class represents logs that have lost a predictable proportion of their original mass. We conclude that a decay-class system that is restricted to a single dimension, such as the five-class system used for E. obliqua, will be quite able to capture the main trajectory of biomass loss, but will not be able to characterise the complexity of the ecological processes giving rise to this loss. Studies that employ single-dimension decay classes, and which aggregate decay-class data across logs, can be given added ecological meaning by first partitioning logs into diameter-classes that reflect the underlying differences in the maturity of the trees giving rise to the logs. For E. obliqua logs, a cut-off diameter of 60cm offers an appropriate distinction between regrowth-aged and mature-aged trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus obliqua 3abiomass 3aecology 3aforests 3alowlands 3aregrowth 3atrees 3aTasmania1 aStamm, Lee1 aWardlaw, Timothy J.0 tForest ecology and management.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 262, no. 4 p.692-700dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2011.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245018600171300001400357520163300371592002802004650001202032650001602044650001602060650001102076650001502087650002902102650001302131650004102144650001502185650001802200650002902218653001502247653001502262653001802277653001502295653001702310653002202327700001402349700001802363700001302381700001402394773009502408856008502503852000902588655001202597IND60554435820221122173436.0161024e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055443582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Juanjuan10aEnantioselective and sensitive determination of carvedilol in human plasma using chiral stationary-phase column and reverse-phase liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 92-97.  aA liquid chromatographyâtandem mass spectrometry method to quantify carvedilol enantiomers in human plasma was developed and validated as a measure of compliance in clinical research. Carvedilol enantiomers were extracted from human serum (0.5mL) via liquidâliquid extraction with methyl tert-butyl ether (2.5mL). Carvedilol-related compound C served as the internal standard. The analyte and internal standard were separated on a Sino-Chiral AD column (150Ã4.6mm, 5Î¼m, amylose tris-3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate coated on silica-gel) using isocratic elution with mobile phases of methanol, water and diethylamine (94:6:0.01, v/v). The total run-time was 10.5min. Carvedilol enantiomers were quantified using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in multiple-reaction-monitoring mode using positive electrospray ionisation. The mass transitions monitored for quantitation were carvedilol (m/z 407â222) and carvedilol-related compound C (m/z 497â222). The limits of quantification for the S- and R-carvedilol enantiomers in plasma were both 0.08ng/mL. The method was validated in the linear range of 0.08â50ng/mL with acceptable inter- and intra-assay precision and accuracy and stability suitable for routine laboratory practice. The method was successfully applied to samples taken from research volunteers treated with carvedilol sustained-release tablet 18mg. Cmax and AUClast were 9.1Â±5.1ng/mL and 59.4Â±39.6ngh/mL for R-carvedilol, 4.0Â±2.3ng/mL and 24.7Â±15.0ngh/mL for S-carvedilol, respectively. tmax and t1/2 were 4.6Â±1.9h and 9.6Â±4.5h for R-carvedilol, and 4.7Â±1.0h and 10.7Â±5.7h, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3ablood serum 3aenantiomers 3ahumans 3aionization 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amethanol 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asilica gel 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aCarvedilol 0aEnantiomer 0aChiral column 0aLCâMS/MS 0aHuman plasma 0aMethod validation1 aTian, Lei1 aHuang, Yiling1 aYan, Yan1 aLi, Yishi0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2014 June 01, v. 960 p.92-97dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245005500166300001800221500001100239520084000250592002801090596006601118596010601184650002201290650002001312650002101332650001401353650001801367650001901385650001901404650001501423650001201438650001101450650002501461700002801486700002401514700003401538773016601572856008301738852000901821655001201830IND60684366320221123001348.0200827e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068436632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-07415-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasudi, Ahmad10aMagnetite-based catalysts for wastewater treatment  ap. 4664-4682.  aReview  aThe increasing number and concentration of organic pollutants in water stream could become a serious threat in the near future. Magnetite has the potential to degrade pollutants via photocatalysis with a convenient separation process. This study discusses in detail the control size and morphology of magnetite nanoparticles, and their composites with co-precipitation, hydrothermal, sol-gel, and electrochemical route. Further photocatalytic enhancement with the addition of metal and porous support was proposed. This paper also discussed the technology to extend the lifetime of recombination through an in-depth explanation of charge transfer. The possibility to use waste materials as catalyst support was also elucidated. However, magnetite-based photocatalysts still require many improvements to meet commercialization criteria.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. 5F031 (FRGS)cMinistry of Higher Education Malaysia  aIncentive SchemecMalaysia Japan International Institute of Technology, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia 3acommercialization 3acoprecipitation 3aelectrochemistry 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3astreams 3awastes 3awastewater treatment1 aHarimisa, Grace Erlinda1 aGhafar, Nawal Abdul1 aJusoh, Nurfatehah Wahyuny Che0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Feb., v. 27, no. 5 p.4664-4682dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07415-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245006700199300001800266506007600284520113400360592002801494506003701522650001101559650002001570650001901590650001001609650001101619650002301630650002401653700002401677700001901701700001601720700002101736700002201757700002201779700002001801773012101821856007501942852000902017655001202026IND60558930820221207062214.0161120e20130829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055893082DNAL7 a10.1021/jp403802c2doi7 aPMC37705322pmcid7 a237507132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lee-Ping10aSystematic Improvement of a Classical Molecular Model of Water  ap. 9956-9972.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe report the iAMOEBA (âinexpensive AMOEBAâ) classical polarizable water model. The iAMOEBA model uses a direct approximation to describe electronic polarizability, in which the induced dipoles are determined directly from the permanent multipole electric fields and do not interact with one another. The direct approximation reduces the computational cost relative to a fully self-consistent polarizable model such as AMOEBA. The model is parameterized using ForceBalance, a systematic optimization method that simultaneously utilizes training data from experimental measurements and high-level ab initio calculations. We show that iAMOEBA is a highly accurate model for water in the solid, liquid, and gas phases, with the ability to fully capture the effects of electronic polarization and predict a comprehensive set of water properties beyond the training data set including the phase diagram. The increased accuracy of iAMOEBA over the fully polarizable AMOEBA model demonstrates ForceBalance as a method that allows the researcher to systematically improve empirical models by efficiently utilizing the available data.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmoeba 3adata collection 3aelectric field 3agases 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3asystem optimization1 aHead-Gordon, Teresa1 aPonder, Jay W.1 aRen, Pengyu1 aChodera, John D.1 aEastman, Peter

The results showed that the two sites, SnA and SnP, were statistically different from each other for all the microbiological and chemical parameters investigated except Na+ and moisture content. Higher values of MBC (575.67 Î¼g gâ»Â¹), BSR (9.71 Î¼g COâ gâ»Â¹ soil hâ»Â¹), DHA (332.76 Î¼g formazan gâ»Â¹ dayâ»Â¹) and phosphatase activity (0.161 Î¼mol PNP gâ»Â¹ hrâ»Â¹) were observed for the SnP soil. Great heterogeneity was found in SnP in terms of microbiological properties, whereas the SnA plots showed more homogeneous microbiological activity due to ploughing. 75.34% of variance was explained by principal component one (PC1), which significantly separated SnA and SnP, especially on the basis of soil MBC and PâOâ.

Frequently, multiple dehalorespiring bacteria are present at contaminated sites, particularly when bioaugmentation is applied. The ecological interactions between different dehalorespiring populations can-along with hydrodynamic and other environmental factors-affect their activity and thus the rates and extent of dehalorespiration. An integrated experimental and modeling approach was used to evaluate the ecological interactions between two hydrogenotrophic, dehalorespiring strains. A dual Monod model of dehalorespiration provided a good fit to the chlorinated ethene concentrations measured in a coculture of Dehalococcoides mccartyi 195 and Dehalobacter restrictus growing on tetrachloroethene (PCE) and excess Hâ in a continuous-flow reactor. Inhibition of dehalorespiration by chlorinated ethenes was previously observed in cultures containing Dehalococcoides or Dehalobacter strains. Therefore, inhibition coefficients were estimated for Dhc. mccartyi 195 and Dhb. restrictus. The inhibition effects of PCE and TCE on VC dechlorination by Dhc. mccartyi 195, and of VC on PCE and TCE dechlorination by Dhb. restrictus, were compounded when these strains were grown in coculture, and dehalorespiring population abundance and survival could be accurately predicted only by incorporating these complex interactions into the dual Monod model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDehalobacter restrictus 3aDehalococcoides mccartyi 3abacteria 3abioaugmentation 3acoculture 3adechlorination 3aethylene 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3asolvents 3atetrachloroethylene1 aBecker, Jennifer G.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Feb. 05, v. 47, no. 3 p.1518-1525dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es30345823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04257naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006100188245010500249300001100354500001400365506007600379520241000455592002802865596004202893596007402935506003703009650001303046650001203059650002103071650000903092650001703101650001203118650001403130650001403144650001303158650001703171650001503188650002603203650001603229650001503245650002603260650001303286650001803299650002503317650001103342700002203353700001703375700002003392700002303412700002003435773012203455856008103577852000903658655001203667IND60671496220221207084051.0200507e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067149622DNAL7 a10.1186/s12711-019-0497-z2doi7 aPMC67641412pmcid7 a315581502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoekes, Harmen P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9359-594110aInbreeding depression due to recent and ancient inbreeding in Dutch HolsteinâFriesian dairy cattle  ap. 54.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Inbreeding decreases animal performance (inbreeding depression), but not all inbreeding is expected to be equally harmful. Recent inbreeding is expected to be more harmful than ancient inbreeding, because selection decreases the frequency of deleterious alleles over time. Selection efficiency is increased by inbreeding, a process called purging. Our objective was to investigate effects of recent and ancient inbreeding on yield, fertility and udder health traits in Dutch HolsteinâFriesian cows. METHODS: In total, 38,792 first-parity cows were included. Pedigree inbreeding ([Formula: see text]) was computed and 75Â k genotype data were used to compute genomic inbreeding, among others based on regions of homozygosity (ROH) in the genome ([Formula: see text]). RESULTS: Inbreeding depression was observed, e.g. a 1% increase in [Formula: see text] was associated with a 36.3Â kg (SEâ=â2.4) decrease in 305-day milk yield, a 0.48Â day (SEâ=â0.15) increase in calving interval and a 0.86 unit (SEâ=â0.28) increase in somatic cell score for day 150 through to 400. These effects equalled ââ0.45, 0.12 and 0.05% of the trait means, respectively. When [Formula: see text] was split into generation-based components, inbreeding on recent generations was more harmful than inbreeding on more distant generations for yield traits. When [Formula: see text] was split into new and ancestral components, based on whether alleles were identical-by-descent for the first time or not, new inbreeding was more harmful than ancestral inbreeding, especially for yield traits. For example, a 1% increase in new inbreeding was associated with a 2.42Â kg (SEâ=â0.41) decrease in 305-day fat yield, compared to a 0.03Â kg (SEâ=â0.71) increase for ancestral inbreeding. There were no clear differences between effects of long ROH (recent inbreeding) and short ROH (ancient inbreeding). CONCLUSIONS: Inbreeding depression was observed for yield, fertility and udder health traits. For yield traits and based on pedigree, inbreeding on recent generations was more harmful than inbreeding on distant generations and there was evidence of purging. Across all traits, long and short ROH contributed to inbreeding depression. In future work, inbreeding depression and purging should be assessed in more detail at the genomic level, using higher density information and genomic time series.  aPublisher supplied data  a677353cH2020 Research and Innovation  aKB-34-013-002cDutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3aalleles 3acalving interval 3acows 3adairy cattle 3adensity 3aevolution 3afrequency 3agenomics 3ahomozygosity 3ainbreeding 3ainbreeding depression 3ainformation 3amilk yield 3aparity (reproduction) 3apedigree 3asomatic cells 3atime series analysis 3audders1 aVeerkamp, Roel F.1 aBijma, Piter1 ade Jong, Gerben1 aHiemstra, Sipke J.1 aWindig, Jack J.0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2019 Dec., v. 51, no. 1 p.54-54dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x0999-193X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-019-0497-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003600139245007200175520179300247592002802040650002102068650003002089650001702119650001502136650001102151650001702162650002402179650001202203650001802215650002202233650002602255650001302281650001402294650002502308650001302333650001302346650001602359700003002375700003102405700003302436700003802469700003102507773012102538856007302659852000902732655001202741IND60751536020221122011849.0210925e20210914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075153602DNAL7 a10.3390/f120912402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarÃ§al, Maria Fernanda Magioni10aPredictive Models to Estimate Carbon Stocks in Agroforestry Systems  aThis study aims to assess the carbon stock in a pasture area and fragment of forest in natural regeneration, given the importance of agroforestry systems in mitigating gas emissions which contribute to the greenhouse effect, as well as promoting the maintenance of agricultural productivity. Our other goal was to predict the carbon stock, according to different land use systems, from physical and chemical soil variables using the Random Forest algorithm. We carried out our study at an Entisols Quartzipsamments area with a completely randomized experimental design: four treatments and six replites. The treatments consisted of the following: (i) an agroforestry system developed for livestock, (ii) an agroforestry system developed for fruit culture, (iii) a conventional pasture, and (iv) a forest fragment. Deformed and undeformed soil samples were collected in order to analyze their physical and chemical properties across two consecutive agricultural years. The response variable, carbon stock, was subjected to a boxplot analysis and all the databases were used for a predictive modeling which in turn used the Random Forest algorithm. Results led to the conclusion that the agroforestry systems developed both for fruit culture and livestock, are more efficient at stocking carbon in the soil than the pasture area and forest fragment undergoing natural regeneration. Nitrogen stock and land use systems are the most important variables to estimate carbon stock from the physical and chemical variables of soil using the Random Forest algorithm. The predictive models generated from the physical and chemical variables of soil, as well as the Random Forest algorithm, presented a high potential for predicting soil carbon stock and are sensitive to different land use systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuartzipsamments 3aagricultural productivity 3aagroforestry 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aexperimental design 3aforests 3afruit growing 3agreenhouse effect 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aland use 3alivestock 3anatural regeneration 3anitrogen 3apastures 3asoil carbon1 aSouza, Zigomar Menezes de1 aTavares, Rose Luiza Moraes1 aFarhate, Camila Viana Vieira1 aOliveira, Stanley Robson Medeiros1 aGalindo, Fernando Shintate0 tForests.g2021 Sept. 14, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120912403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01752naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245008000161300001600241520094200257592002801199650001501227650001201242650001301254650001301267700001501280773012201295856004801417852000901465655001201474IND50066760320221117070332.0131018e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006676032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-013-0491-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Yue10aAmmonia adsorption on graphene and graphene oxide: a first-principles study  ap. 403-411.  aMotivated by the recent realization of graphene sensor to detect gas molecules that are harmful to the environment, the ammonia adsorption on graphene or graphene oxide (GO) was investigated using first-principles calculation. The optimal adsorption and orientation of the NHâ molecules on the graphene surfaces were determined, and the adsorption energies (E b) as well as the Mulliken charge transfers of NHâ were calculated. The E b for the graphene are small and seem to be independent of the sites and orientations. The surface epoxy or hydroxyl groups can promote the adsorption of NHâ on the GO; the enhancement of the E b for the hydroxyl groups is greater than that for the epoxy groups on the surface. The charge transfers from the molecule to the surfaces also exhibit the same trend. The BrÃ¶nsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites could stably exist on the GO with surface hydroxyl groups and on the basal, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3aepoxides 3agraphene1 aLi, Junhua0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2013 June, v. 7, no. 3 p.403-411dSpringer-Verlagx2095-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-013-0491-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245004600175300001600221520117300237592002801410650002101438650001001459650002301469650001101492650001101503650001301514650001301527650001001540700002001550700002101570700001701591773009701608856009001705852000901795655001201804IND60111746120221121134207.0150809s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011174612DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-387690-4.00007-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Luoying14aThe Genetics of the Human Circadian Clock  ap. 231-247.  aDaily rhythms of behavioral and physiological processes are believed to arise from endogenous circadian clocks. Unlike model organisms, genetic studies of human behavioral traits present extra challenges due to many factors such as the heterogeneous genetic background and environmental influences. Identifying molecular components of the human circadian clock were not possible until the recognition of Mendelian circadian traits in human subjects in recent years. Characterizing these rare Mendelian traits therefore established the foundation for identification of the genetic components for human circadian and sleep mechanisms. This line of investigation has proven fruitful and provided new insights into these pathways. Genetic association studies have also offered many possible genetic contributions to these mechanisms. Studies of these genes/proteins in conjunction with modeling human mutations in model organisms afford the opportunity to unravel the molecular mechanisms which in time will lead to pharmacological interventions that may not only help modify these behavioral traits but also may prove effective for treating other sleep-related disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircadian rhythm 3agenes 3agenetic background 3ahumans 3amodels 3amutation 3aproteins 3asleep1 aJones, Chris R.1 aPtacek, Louis J.1 aFu, Ying-Hui0 tAdvances in Genetics.g2011, v. 74 p.231-247dElsevier Science & Technologyx0065-26607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-387690-4.00007-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245027500159300001300434520094800447592002801395650002201423650001601445650001101461650001901472650002001491650001601511650001301527650002201540650000901562650001901571650001501590700001501605700001901620773010601639856007501745852000901820655001201829IND60637540820221117184036.0190419e20130823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063754082DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1983.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWojcieska, U.10aWpÅyw miedzi na dynamikÄ przyrostu suchej masy roÅlin i niektÃ³re procesy fizjologiczne u sÅonecznika (Helianthus annuus L.)

Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) was grown in pots with peat enriched with mineral elements with the excluding of Cu. Copper was applied immediately after plant germination in doses of 0, 5 and 125 mg Cu per pot. In the form of CuSO4. During the vegetation period the following determinations were made: (a) dynamics of the increase of plant dry matter and of the assimilative surface, (b) chlorophyll content, (c) nitrate reductase activity and (d) intensity of photosynthesis and photosynthetic activity. The results indicate that copper deficit restricts the process of photosynthesis and the dynamics of dry mass increment. Differences in copper dosage did not have an immediate influence on the chlorophyll content and nitrate reductase activity, only rather an intermediate effect through the influence on the process of ageing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3achlorophyll 3acopper 3acopper sulfate 3aenzyme activity 3agermination 3aminerals 3anitrate reductase 3apeat 3aphotosynthesis 3avegetation1 aWolska, E.1 aRuszkowska, M.0 tActa agrobotanica.g, v. 36, no. 1-2 p.5-16dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:14720x2300-357X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/aa.1983.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011700171300001600288520131800304592002801622653002701650653002201677653001701699653002401716653001601740700002201756700002401778700001801802700002301820773012501843856008401968852000902052655001202061IND60128854120221123043555.0151116e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012885412DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-2585-41.3.3332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdillo, Frances E.10aSurvivorship and Distribution of Immature Anopheles gambiae s.l.

Giles immature stages in three habitats (rock pools, swamp, and puddles) in Banambani village, Mali, West Africa, during the mid-rainy season of 2000. Horizontal life tables were constructed for immatures in the laboratory. Times spent in the various immature stages were determined, and laboratory survival was measured. Vertical life tables were obtained from each habitat. We found large day-to-day variation for age class composition within habitats across days. The swamp samples had small but statistically significant different distributions in some instar stages compared with rock pools and puddles as affected by precipitation history. There were obviously unstable age distributions in the swamp and puddles and to some extent in rock pools. There were more individuals in some later age classes than in earlier ones. The daily survival estimates using an exponential decay model were 0.807 in rock pools, 0.899 in the swamp, 0.818 in puddles, and 0.863 in the overall village. Possible reasons for the departure from stable age distribution were cannibalism, predation and other complex interactions, rainfall effects, sampling bias, and differences in physicochemical properties of the water in the habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAnopheles gambiae s.l. 0aexponential decay 0asurvivorship 0alarval distribution 0alife tables1 aTourÃ©Ã©, Yeya T.1 aLanzaro, Gregory C.1 aDolo, Guimogo1 aTaylor, Charles E.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2004 May, v. 41, no. 3 p.333-339dEntomology Dept., B.P.

Labile Cu was determined in water and sediment by using diffusive gradient in thin films. No labile Cu being detected from CuO NPs; the observed effects in invertebrates exposed to CuO NPs were mainly attributed to the toxicity of nanoparticulate rather than dissolved Cu toxicity. Bioaccumulation of CuO NPs was observed in both species. Biomarkers were examined at different levels of biological organization: biochemical markers of defense and damage, biomarkers of genotoxicity (comet assay), and behavioral biomarkers (feeding and burrowing). Behavioral biomarkers, antioxidant defenses (catalase, glutathion S-transferase, metallothionein), and genotoxicity are the most sensitive tools to highlight the effect of soluble or nanoparticulate metal forms. Concerning other biomarkers of defense (superoxide dismutase, lactate dehydrogenase, laccase) and damage (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, acetylcholinesterase, acid phosphatase), no significant effects were detected. This experiment shows the suitability of mesocosms for studying the environmental effects of nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScrobicularia plana 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aacid phosphatase 3aantioxidant activity 3abioaccumulation 3abiomarkers 3aburrowing 3acatalase 3acomet assay 3acupric oxide 3agenotoxicity 3aglutathione transferase 3ainvertebrates 3alaccase 3alactate dehydrogenase 3ametallothionein 3ananoparticles 3asediments 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances1 aM.

However, given the low temporal resolution of polar-orbiting satellites and late launch time of geostationary satellites, the application of remote sensing aerosol optical depth (AOD) data in hourly PMâ.â spatial distribution prediction is greatly limited, which brings uncertainty to short-term PMâ.â exposure research. This study introduces the PMâ.â concentration predicted by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 3â¯km AOD data and the PMâ.â concentration of monitoring stations into a spatiotemporal autoregressive (STAR) model to generate hourly PMâ.â spatial distribution and quantify the short-term dynamic change process of PMâ.â. The monitoring data in the BeijingâTianjinâHebei (JingJinJi) region of 2014 were used to test the model performance. Time-based 10-fold cross-validation (CV) RÂ² was 0.82, and the root-mean-square prediction error (RMSE) was 37.37â¯Î¼g/mÂ³. The CV RÂ² and RMSE were higher by 0.04 and lower by 3.4â¯Î¼g/mÂ³ than the STAR model without monitoring station PMâ.â concentration as predictors, which indicated that the monitoring station PMâ.â concentration could improve the performance of the model. Hourly performance statistics results showed that the model's accuracy increased when the time was closer to the MODIS transit time compared with that at other hours. The farther away from the MODIS transit time, the greater the monitoring stations' PMâ.â concentration improved the performance of the model. The predicted results of the spatial distribution of PMâ.â showed that the spatial distribution of the average PMâ.â concentration in each hour varied greatly in JingJinJi, and the maximum difference reached 30â¯Î¼g/mÂ³. The model in this paper not only demonstrates high prediction accuracy but also provides high spatiotemporal resolution of PMâ.â for short-term PMâ.â exposure studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 3apollution 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3auncertainty 3aChina 0aPM2.5 0aMODIS AOD 0aSpatiotemporal autoregressive model 0aHourly PM2.5 spatial distribution1 aSun, Wenbin1 aZheng, Kangning1 aRen, Xiangyu1 aHan, Peiwen0 tAtmospheric environment.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 222 p.117089-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.1170893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245015900171300001800330520137800348592002801726596005701754596006201811650001301873650001701886650000901903650002801912650002301940650001201963650002201975650001501997650001602012700006002028700001702088700002102105700001802126700002202144773011302166856008302279852000902362655001202371IND60675170820221120024857.0210102e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067517082DNAL7 a10.1007/s12562-019-01345-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamaoka, Hideyoshi10aAnnual and seasonal changes in the assemblage of planktonic copepods and appendicularians in Funka Bay before and after intrusion of Coastal Oyashio Water  ap. 1077-1087.  aAnnual and seasonal changes in the abundance and the assemblage of planktonic copepods and appendicularians were clarified in Funka Bay. Zooplankton samples were obtained by vertical hauls with a NORPAC net (0.10-mm mesh aperture) from December to May over a 4-year period (2014â2017). Temporal fluctuations of mean abundance of copepods were small from December 2013 to May 2014 under the low water temperature condition (maximum 1.55 times difference between adjacent survey periods), while those were large in other 3 years (1.60â1.93 times). Maximum mean abundance of appendicularians in 2014 (6.0âÃâ10â´Â ind./mÂ²) was lower than those in 2015â2017 (8.6âÃâ10â´â1.4âÃâ10âµÂ ind./mÂ²). Less saline (â¤â33.3) and cold Coastal Oyashio Water (COW) intruded in early February 2014, late February 2015, and late March 2016 and 2017. Phytoplankton blooms occurred in March of all 4Â years. Copepods and appendicularians increased nearer periods of phytoplankton bloom than after COW intrusion. In the results of canonical correspondence analysis, the assemblage of copepods and appendicularians gradually changed from small-sized and warm-water species to large-sized and cold-water ones. Northwesterly wind speed had an effect equal to COW intrusion (82% of COW intrusion) to the change in taxonomic compositions of copepods and appendicularians.  aPublisher supplied data  a25450269cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a16K07834cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JP) 3aCopepoda 3aalgal blooms 3acold 3acorrespondence analysis 3aseasonal variation 3asurveys 3awater temperature 3awind speed 3azooplankton1 aTakatsu, Tetsuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1693-61481 aSuzuki, Kota1 aKobayashi, Naoto1 aOoki, Atsushi1 aNakaya, Mitsuhiro0 tFisheries science.g2019 Nov., v. 85, no. 6 p.1077-1087dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3867080x0919-92687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-019-01345-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245001500174300001200189520127100201592002801472650001501500650001401515650001601529650001301545650001101558650002201569650002001591650001301611700003801624773009301662856009001755852000901845655001201854IND60111746320221121134143.0150809s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011174632DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-380858-5.00016-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuber, Robert10aAggression  ap. 1-6.  aAggression ranks among the most misunderstood concepts in all the behavioral sciences. It is commonly viewed by the general public as an aberrant form of behavior, with situations of conflict pictured as unfavorable and stressful circumstances, brought about by amoral urges, in critical need of the cognitive control, and with negative consequences for all involved. This chapter focuses on the study of aggression. A comprehensive understanding of how biology, behavior, and environment intersect is paramount in the study of human violence and aggression.Studies of aggression, its motives, and its causes are of central interest to a wide range of academic disciplinesâbehavioral genetics, evolution, neuroscience, psychology, sociology, and criminology, to name just a few. Despite the wealth of empirical and theoretical attention, it is remarkable that a comprehensive synthesis of aggression has stubbornly remained elusive. As with any other characteristic, natural selection is assumed to enhance aggression's overall effectiveness. High ranking individuals are likely to display a favorable combination of strength, along with ability to titer their levels of aggression, to pick fights that are winnable, and to only compete in those that are worth it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3acognition 3acriminology 3agenetics 3ahumans 3anatural selection 3aneurophysiology 3aviolence1 aBrennan, Patriciaq(Patricia A.),0 tAdvances in Genetics.g2011, v. 75 p.1-6dElsevier Science & Technologyx0065-26607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-380858-5.00016-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003200139245014100171520121900312592002801531650002301559650001101582650002401593650001201617650001501629650001501644650001001659650001701669651001001686700002301696700002601719700002401745700002001769700002401789773012101813856007301934852000902007655001202016IND60751536320221122025331.0210925e20210914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075153632DNAL7 a10.3390/f120912432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues-Eklund, Gabriela 10aSample-Based Estimation of Tree Cover Change in Haiti Using Aerial Photography: Substantial Increase in Tree Cover between 2002 and 2010  aRecent studies have used high resolution imagery to estimate tree cover and changes in natural forest cover in Haiti. However, there is still no rigorous quantification of tree cover change accounting for planted or managed trees, which are very important in Haitiâs farming systems. We estimated net tree cover change, gross loss, and gross gain in Haiti between 2002 and 2010 from a stratified random sample of 400 pixels with a systematic sub-sample of 25 points. Using 30 cm and 1 m resolution images, we classified land cover at each point, with any point touching a woody plant higher than 5 m classified as tree crown. We found a net increase in tree crown cover equivalent to 5.0 Â± 2.3% (95% confidence interval) of Haitiâs land area. Gross gains and losses amounted to 9.0 Â± 2.1% and 4.0 Â± 1.3% of the territory, respectively. These results challenge, for the first time with empirical evidence, the predominant narrative that portrays Haiti as experiencing ongoing forest or tree cover loss. The net gain in tree cover quantified here represents a 35% increase from 2002 to 2010. Further research is needed to determine the drivers of this substantial net gain in tree cover at the national scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3acanopy 3aconfidence interval 3aforests 3aland cover 3atree crown 3atrees 3awoody plants 3aHaiti1 aHansen, Matthew C.1 aTyukavina, Alexandra 1 aStehman, Stephen V.1 aHubacek, Klaus 1 aBaiocchi, Giovanni 0 tForests.g2021 Sept. 14, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120912433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003600150245019400186300001600380520131300396592002801709650002901737650002701766650003801793650003001831650001301861650002001874650001001894650002001904650002101924650001801945650001101963650001101974650001101985650001001996650001402006650001602020650001502036700002102051700003102072700002402103700002202127700002702149773009702176856008402273852000902357655001202366IND60083999320221118023132.0141101e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008399932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resmic.2011.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade los Reyes-GavilÃ¡n, Clara G.10aAdhesion of bile-adapted Bifidobacterium strains to the HT29-MTX cell line is modified after sequential gastrointestinal challenge simulated in vitro using human gastric and duodenal juices  ap. 514-519.  aAccording to the FAO/WHO, in vitro criteria for selection of probiotics for food application consist of testing survival when confronted with gastrointestinal tract (GIT) challenge and the ability to colonize the colon. We used a model that simulated GIT transit using sequential immersion in gastric and duodenal juices of human origin to evaluate survival of bile-adapted Bifidobacterium strains. Bifidobacterium animalis tolerated gastric juice, whereas Bifidobacterium longum showed poor survival under these conditions. In contrast, B. animalis strains were more sensitive to duodenal juice than B. longum. The percentage of survival after GIT transit simulation (GITTS), determined both by plate counts and fluorescent probes, was significantly higher for bile-adapted strains than for corresponding parental ones. This suggests that use of bile-adapted strains is a suitable approach for increasing survival of bifidobacteria under the harsh conditions of the upper GIT. However, the bile resistance phenotype was not related to improvement of adhesion capacity, after GITTS, of the intestinal cell line HT29-MTX which constitutively produces mucus. This work shows that sequential GITTS with human juices modified the in vitro adhesion properties of the strains challenged with colonocyte-like cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium animalis 3aBifidobacterium longum 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadhesion 3abile resistance 3acolon 3aduodenal juices 3afluorescent dyes 3agastric juice 3ahumans 3ajuices 3amodels 3amucus 3aphenotype 3aplate count 3aprobiotics1 aSuÃ¡rez, Adolfo,1 aFernÃ¡ndez-GarcÃ­a, MarÃ­a1 aMargolles, Abelardo1 aGueimonde, Miguel1 aRuas-Madiedo, Patricia0 tResearch in microbiology.g2011 June, v. 162, no. 5 p.514-519dElsevier SASx0923-25087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2011.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245008100175300001800256520100700274592002801281650002701309650001601336650001501352650002501367650001601392650002101408650000901429650001201438650002201450650002901472650000701501650002901508650001601537650001101553700002901564700003901593700002901632700002601661700002501687700004101712700003101753700003301784700002901817700003001846700003101876700002601907773013001933856008202063852000902145655001202154IND60608232320221117052315.0180904e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060823232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-018-1473-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaves, Renata Pinheiro10aMeristiella echinocarpa lectin (MEL): a new member of the OAAH-lectin family  ap. 2629-2638.  aA new lectin from the marine red alga Meristiella echinocarpa (MEL) was isolated and biochemically characterized. MEL is a monomeric protein of 28Â kDa with specificity for yeast mannan. Hemagglutination activity of MEL was stable between pHÂ 5 and 10, temperatures up to 50Â Â°C, and neither EDTA nor divalent ions affected it. The complete amino acid sequence of MEL was determined through a combination of tandem mass spectrometry and DNA cloning. As a new member of the OAAH-lectin family, the primary structure of MEL consists of 267 amino acid residues distributed in four tandem repeat domains, sharing at least 48% of identity. Theoretical secondary structure of MEL was composed of 3% Î±-helix, 40% Î²-sheet, 19% Î²-turn, and 38% coil. Melting temperatures of the lectin in the absence and presence of mannan were 54 and 61Â Â°C, respectively. Furthermore, MEL was able to recognize and agglutinate pathogenic bacterial strains, such as multidrug-resistant Salmonella and Vibrio alginolyticus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aMeristiella 3aSalmonella 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3aamino acids 3ahemagglutination 3aions 3alectins 3amolecular cloning 3amultiple drug resistance 3apH 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atemperature 3ayeasts1 ada Silva, Suzete Roberta1 ada Silva, JoÃ£o Pedro Freire Alves1 aCarneiro, RÃ´mulo Farias1 ade Sousa, Bruno Lopes1 aAbreu, Jade Oliveira1 ade Carvalho, FÃ¡tima Cristiane Teles1 aRocha, Cintia Renata Costa1 aFarias, Wladimir Ronald Lobo1 ade Sousa, Oscarina Viana1 aSilva, AndrÃ© Luiz Coelho1 aSampaio, Alexandre Holanda1 aNagano, Celso Shiniti0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2018 Aug., v. 30, no. 4 p.2629-2638dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-018-1473-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245004300178300001600221520093500237592002801172650001501200650001301215650002801228650001101256650002201267650001901289650001301308650001401321650001601335700002101351773009701372856009001469852000901559655001201568IND60111746620221121134203.0150809s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011174662DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-380858-5.00005-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYanowitch, Rachel14aThe Neurochemistry of Human Aggression  ap. 151-169.  aVarious data from scientific research studies conducted over the past three decades suggest that central neurotransmitters play a key role in the modulation of aggression in all mammalian species, including humans. Specific neurotransmitter systems involved in mammalian aggression include serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA, and neuropeptides such as vasopressin and oxytocin. Neurotransmitters not only help to execute basic behavioral components but also serve to modulate these preexisting behavioral states by amplifying or reducing their effects. This chapter reviews the currently available data to present a contemporary view of how central neurotransmitters influence the vulnerability for aggressive behavior and/or initiation of aggressive behavior in social situations. Data reviewed in this chapter include emoiric information from neurochemical, pharmaco-challenge, molecular genetic and neuroimaging studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3adopamine 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3ahumans 3aneurotransmitters 3anorepinephrine 3aoxytocin 3aserotonin 3avasopressin1 aCoccaro, Emil F.0 tAdvances in Genetics.g2011, v. 75 p.151-169dElsevier Science & Technologyx0065-26607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-380858-5.00005-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111024002100151040001800172072000900190100001500199245010900214300001800323500002400341520119000365650001601555650001601571650001601587650003101603650001501634650001301649650001801662650001601680650002001696650002601716700001701742700002501759700002101784700002301805700001801828700002101846700001801867773010001885852000901985856011201994856009002106930003302196945002502229946001302254961001302267655001202280IND4432933720221123020636.0100220e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443293372DNAL7 a200930232pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.12.0932doi7 a10113/408612hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aXu, Qingyi10aCharacterization of a soybean oil-based biosurfactant and evaluation of its ability to form microbubbles  ap. 3711-3717.  aIncludes references  aThis paper characterizes the physico-chemical properties of the soybean oil-based polymeric surfactant, Palozengs R-004 (hereafter referred to as R-004). The surface activity of R-004 is comparable to the reported activities of biosurfactants produced by microorganisms and higher than some of the conventional synthetic surfactants. The surface tension of Milli-Q water was reduced to a minimum value of roughly 30mN/m at a concentration of about 0.07wt.%. R-004 exhibited a unique aggregation behavior: small aggregates (pre-micelles) were formed at very low concentrations. Zeta-potential measurements showed that the micelles of R-004 are negatively charged due to the presence of carboxylic groups. The ability of R-004 to form and stabilize microbubbles was evaluated and was found to be greatly affected by filtration while remaining independent of R-004 concentration over the concentration range studied (0.05-0.5wt.%). These results suggest that a very low level of surfactant can be used to produce microbubbles without affecting their properties. Our results suggest the possibility of using soybean oil-based surfactants to food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic applications. 3asoybean oil 3asurfactants 3abiopolymers 3aphysicochemical properties 2aFiltration 2aMicelles 2aParticle Size 2aSoybean Oil 2aSurface Tension 2aSurface-Active Agents1 aLiu, Zengshe1 aNakajima, Mitsutoshi1 aIchikawa, Sosaku1 aNakamura, Nobutaka1 aRoy, Poritosh1 aOkadome, Hiroshi1 aShiina, Takeo0 tBioresource technology.g2010 May, v.  101, no.  10 p.3711-3717dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/408613Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.12.0933Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/04/21  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02814naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100002300157245006500180500011500245500002400360500001500384520124100399650001401640650001201654650002201666650001601688650001001704650001801714650001601732650001601748650001501764650001401779653002401793653001901817653003201836653001701868653001201885653002101897653002801918700001601946773011801962852000902080856011102089930003302200945002502233946001302258961001302271655001202284IND4399443820221123023406.0071228s2007    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND439944382DNAL7 a10113/88662hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aX100 0aL6001 aBrown-Brandl, T.M.10aDevelopment and Validation of an Animal Susceptibility Model  aPaper presented at the 2007 ASABE Annual International Meeting, held June 17-20, 2007, Minneapolis, Minnesota.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn individual animal's stress level is the summation of stresses from three areas: the environment, animal, and management. A model was developed to predict the susceptibility of an individual animal to heat stress. The model utilizes a hierarchal knowledge-based fuzzy inference system with 11 animal characteristics (color, sex, species, temperament, hair thickness, previous exposure, age, condition score, previous cases of pneumonia, previous other health issues, and current health) to predict susceptibility to heat stress and certainty of the prediction The model was validated using data collected on 192 cattle over a 3-year period. Sixty-four heifers of four different breeds (Angus, Charolais, and two cross-breeds [Marc I and Marc III]) were assigned to one of eight outdoor pens in each of three years (2004, 2005, and 2006). The correlation of susceptibility to growth rate, condition score change, respiration rate, and panting score provided the basis for validation. Respiration rate and panting score were significantly higher in the higher categories of susceptibility than the lower categories of susceptibility. Recommendations for further studies include validating the model using a more varied group of animals. 3aCharolais 3aheifers 3asimulation models 3afuzzy logic 3aAngus 3aanimal stress 3abeef cattle 3aheat stress 3acrossbreds 3abreathing 0amathematical models 0aMarc III breed 0aAnimal Susceptibility Model 0aMarc I breed 0apanting 0arespiration rate 0afuzzy inference systems1 aJones, D.D.0 tPaper.g2007, , no.  074081aAmerican Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

Ten homologous linkage groups in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) were identified using orthologous expressed sequence tag polymorphism (ESTP) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers. The comparative mapping revealed extensive synteny and colinearity between genomes of the Pinaceae, consistent with the hypothesis of conservative chromosomal evolution in this important plant family. This study reports the first comparative map in forest trees at the family taxonomic level and establishes a framework for comparative genomics in Pinaceae.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus taeda 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3achromosome mapping 3agenetic markers 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aexpressed sequence tags 3alinkage groups 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosome Mapping 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenomicsxmethods 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPinaceaexgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSyntenyxgenetics 0aexpressed sequence tag polymorphism 0acomparative mapping 0asequence tagged sites1 aTroggio, M.1 aBrown, G.R.1 aJermstad, K.D.1 aNeale, D.B.0 tGenetics.g2004 Sept., v.  168, no.  1 p.447-461x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.104.0283813Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/157923Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080606b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/06/06  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03843naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168072000900177100001900186245011800205300001800323500002400341520180300365650001702168650002002185650002302205650003602228650002002264650002702284650001602311650001202327650002102339650003702360650004802397650001102445650004102456650001702497650000902514650003102523650001402554650005602568650002902624650003002653650001902683653003202702700002402734700001602758700001602774700001602790773008902806852000902895856011202904856009303016930003303109945002503142946001303167961001303180655001203193IND4368008120221119075703.0050329e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436800812DNAL7 a155371582pmid7 a10113/103122hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF600 0aL600 0aL0011 aBlackmer, J.L.10aBehavioral response of Lygus hesperus to conspecifics and headspace volatiles of alfalfa in a Y-tube olfactometer  ap. 1547-1564.  aIncludes references  aThe western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus Knight, feeds and develops on a variety of weeds in the spring, with later generations moving to alfalfa and cotton where severe damage to reproductive structures can occur. A synthetic attractant for monitoring or mass-trapping L. hesperus, or the identification of potential attractants for natural enemies, would be useful tools for integrated pest management programs. Studies investigated the response of naive and experienced fifth-instar and adult L. hesperus to odors associated with conspecifics and alfalfa, Medicago sativa L. Fifth-instar L. hesperus responded to all plant/insect combinations, whereas female L. hesperus only responded preferentially to vegetative and flowering alfalfa where conspecifics had fed for 24-72 hr, and to vegetative alfalfa where conspecifics were added approximately 30 min before the test began. Males were not attracted to headspace volatiles from any of the alfalfa treatments. Analysis of headspace volatiles showed that (E)-2-hexanal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, Î±-pinene, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, (E)-2-hexenyl acetate, limonene, (Z)-ocimene, (E)-Î²-ocimene, linalool, (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, and (E, E)-Î±-farnesene are emitted from both vegetative and flowering alfalfa. Indole and (3E, 7E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene were only detected in flowering alfalfa. Damage to alfalfa by L. hesperus increased emissions of (Z)-ocimene, (E)-Î²-ocimene, (E)-Î²-caryophyllene, and (E, E)-Î±-farnesene, while Î²-pinene, myrcene, methyl salicylate, and (3E, 7E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene were only detected from damaged plants. Thus, individual or mixtures of these alfalfa volatiles may be useful as attractants for capturing nymphs and adult females of L. hesperus in the field. 3ainsect pests 3aMedicago sativa 3avolatile compounds 3achemical constituents of plants 3ainsect behavior 3aplant-insect relations 3ahost plants 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFeeding Behaviorxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aHemipteraxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aInsecticides 2aMale 2aMedicago sativaxchemistry 2aOdorants. 2aOils, Volatilexadministration & dosagexchemistry. 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aVolatilization 0aherbivore-induced volatiles1 aRodriguez-Saona, C.1 aByers, J.A.1 aShope, K.L.1 aSmith, J.P.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2004 Aug., v.  30, no.  8 p.1547-1564x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/103123Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0098-0331/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080516b20080606c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/06/28  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03048naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024001900127024002100146040001800167072000900185072000900194072000900203100001900212245015300231300001800384500002400402500001500426520083500441650002701276650002201303650003201325650001001357650001901367650003701386650002001423650002301443650002201466650002301488650001801511650002701529650002001556650001901576650001201595650002501607650002301632650003301655650001701688650003701705650004401742650003701786650003801823653003701861700001801898700001701916700001501933700001401948773011101962852000902073856011202082856008602194930003302280945002502313946001102338961001302349655001202362IND4391918020221118230948.0070529e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439191802DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-007-0530-42doi7 a173568632pmid7 a10113/439152hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aF8311 aMiranda, L.

Microsatellite markers linked to this Pm gene were identified and their most likely order was Xcfd7, 10.3 cM, Xgdm43, 8.6 cM, Xcfd26, 11.9 cM, Pm gene. These markers and the Pm gene were assigned to chromosome 5DL by means of Chinese Spring Nullitetrasomic (Nulli5D-tetra5A) and ditelosomic (Dt5DL) lines. A detached leaf test showed a distinctive disease reaction to six pathogen isolates among the NCD3 Pm gene, Pm2 (5DS) and Pm34 (5DL). An allelism test showed independence between Pm34 and the NCD3 Pm gene. Together, the tests provided strong evidence for the presence of a novel Pm gene in NCD3, and this gene was designated Pm35. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aAegilops tauschii 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3awheat 3apowdery mildew 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. tritici 3afoliar diseases 3achromosome mapping 3aTriticum aestivum 3adisease resistance 3aintrogression 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3agenetic markers 3aplant proteins 2aAlleles 2aAscomycotaxgenetics 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenes, Plant 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPoaceaexgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aTriticumxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 0aErysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici1 aMurphy, J.

Samples that could be both maintained under cooled conditions after collection and promptly processed consistently yielded Rhizoctonia solani, 11 isolates of which anastomosed with AG-4, one with AG-2-1 and one isolate was determined to be binucleate. Comparative virulence among the isolates was analyzed using nonparametric survival analysis for interval-censored data. This analysis indicated that there were significant differences among the isolates. These findings provide further evidence that both root-attacking insects and soilborne pathogens are associated with the lower density of a perennial invasive species in its native range. Prioritization of prospective biocontrol agents should include the ability to engage in insect/plant pathogen synergisms. The application of nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation to interval-censored data for the assessment of comparative virulence among several strains of a plant pathogen is more accessible than calculation of the area under the disease progress curve. 3aLepidium draba 3anoxious weeds 3aweed control 3abiological control 3afungal diseases of plants 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apathogenicity 3ainsect pests 3aroot galls 3aplant damage 3asoil-borne diseases 3ainvasive species 3asynergism 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aSwitzerland 3aAustria 3aHungary 3aFrance 0aroot-attacking insects1 aCaesar, TheCan1 aMaathuis, Marloes H.0 tBiological control.g2010 Feb., v.  52, no.  2 p.140-144x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/385443Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2009.10.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/02/02  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03675naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003800134024002500172024004000197024002300237040001800260100002400278245013600302500001900438520164500457650000802102650002002110650001202130650000802142650002402150650002202174650001102196650001302207650000902220650002102229650001802250650001502268650001402283650000902297650001002306650001102316650000902327650000802336650000802344650002902352650001802381650002002399650001302419650001402432650001002446700005902456700001902515700002002534700002102554700001402575773007802589774014402667856009602811856008802907961000902995852000903004655001203013IND60701979920221214223516.0200717e20200522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070197992DNAL7 a10113/70197992hdl7 a3674652aris7 a10.1371/journal.pone.02330772doi7 a4310712aris_accn_no7 a3020-43000-033-00D2aris_project_no7 a3674652seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRojas, Lina Aguirre10aComparative transcriptomics of Diuraphis noxia and Schizaphis graminum fed wheat plants containing different aphid-resistance genes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe molecular bases of aphid virulence to aphid crop plant resistance genes are poorly understood. The Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia, (Kurdjumov), and the greenbug, Schizaphis graminum Rondani, are global pest of cereal crops. Each species damages barley, oat, rye and wheat, but S. graminum includes fescue, maize, rice and sorghum in its host range. This study was conducted to compare and contrast the transcriptomes of S. graminum biotype I and D. noxia biotype 1 when each ingested phloem from leaves of varieties of bread wheat, Triticum aestivum L., containing no aphid resistance (Dn0), resistance to D. noxia biotype 1 (Dn4), or resistance to both D. noxia biotype 1 and S. graminum biotype I (Dn7). Gene ontology enrichments, k-means analysis and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that plants containing the Dn7 gene from rye had stronger effects on the global transcriptional profiles of S. graminum and D. noxia relative to those fed Dn4 plants. S. graminum responds to ingestion of phloem sap from Dn7 plants by expression of unigenes coding for proteins involved in DNA and RNA repair, and delayed tissue and structural development. In contrast, D. noxia displays a completely different transcriptome after ingesting phloem sap from Dn4 or Dn7 plants, consisting of unigenes involved primarily in detoxification, nutrient acquisition and structural development. These variations in transcriptional responses of D. noxia and S. graminum suggest that the underlying evolutionary mechanism(s) of virulence in these aphids are likely species specific, even in cases where the Dn7 gene exhibits some level of cross resistance. 3aDNA 3aDiuraphis noxia 3aFestuca 3aRNA 3aSchizaphis graminum 3aTriticum aestivum 3abarley 3abiotypes 3acorn 3across resistance 3agene ontology 3ahost range 3aingestion 3aoats 3apests 3aphloem 3arice 3arye 3asap 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 3avirulence 3awheat1 aScully, Erin D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8315-56191 aEnders, Laramy1 aTimm, Alicia E.1 aSinha, Deepak K.1 aSmith, C.0 tPloS one.g2020 May 22, v. 15, no. 5wJournal:jnl4277198x1932-62037nnas0 tDe novo transcriptome assembly of Schizaphis gramium Biotype I feeding on wheat.dAg Data Commonsidataset7nnaso10.15482/USDA.ADC/1517669 23datasetzDataset available in Ag Data Commonsuhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/151766940uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.02330773Available from publisher's Web site  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle04646naa a2200877 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092024002100133040001800154072000900172072000900181100001900190245011600209300001800325500002400343500001500367520208700382650001302469650002502482650001502507650001102522650001602533650001402549650001502563650002202578650001702600650001602617650001602633650002702649650002102676650001402697650002302711650001102734650001802745650001302763650001102776650002202787650003002809650001202839650001502851650003002866650002202896650002302918650001102941650002302952650001402975650002702989650001603016650001303032651001903045651001303064653002003077653001503097700002003112700002203132700002503154700002403179700001903203700002203222700001803244700002403262700002003286700002003306700002103326773011503347852000903462856011203471856009103583930003303674945002503707946001103732961001303743655001203756IND4433840620221118180859.0100313e20100401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443384062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.01.0062doi7 a10113/400342hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP2001 aWhitall, David10aPollutant fate and spatio-temporal variability in the Choptank river estuary: Factors influencing water quality  ap. 2096-2108.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aRestoration of the Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the United States, is a national priority. Documentation of progress of this restoration effort is needed. A study was conducted to examine water quality in the Choptank River estuary, a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay that since 1998 has been classified as impaired waters under the Federal Clean Water Act. Multiple water quality parameters (salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a) and analyte concentrations (nutrients, herbicide and herbicide degradation products, arsenic, and copper) were measured at seven sampling stations in the Choptank River estuary. Samples were collected under base flow conditions in the basin on thirteen dates between March 2005 and April 2008. As commonly observed, results indicate that agriculture is a primary source of nitrate in the estuary and that both agriculture and wastewater treatment plants are important sources of phosphorus. Concentrations of copper in the lower estuary consistently exceeded both chronic and acute water quality criteria, possibly due to use of copper in antifouling boat paint. Concentrations of copper in the upstream watersheds were low, indicating that agriculture is not a significant source of copper loading to the estuary. Concentrations of herbicides (atrazine, simazine, and metolachlor) peaked during early-summer, indicating a rapid surface-transport delivery pathway from agricultural areas, while their degradation products (CIAT, CEAT, MESA, and MOA) appeared to be delivered via groundwater transport. Some in-river processing of CEAT occurred, whereas MESA was conservative. Observed concentrations of herbicide residues did not approach established levels of concern for aquatic organisms. Results of this study highlight the importance of continued implementation of best management practices to improve water quality in the estuary. This work provides a baseline against which to compare future changes in water quality and may be used to design future monitoring programs needed to assess restoration strategy efficacy. 3aatrazine 3awastewater treatment 3awatersheds 3asummer 3aagriculture 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3awater temperature 3asaline water 3ametolachlor 3adegradation 3apoint source pollution 3adissolved oxygen 3aestuaries 3atemporal variation 3abasins 3awater quality 3asimazine 3acopper 3aagricultural land 3agroundwater contamination 3aarsenic 3apollutants 3abest management practices 3aspatial variation 3aenvironmental fate 3arivers 3aherbicide residues 3abase flow 3aecological restoration 3achlorophyll 3anitrates 3aChesapeake Bay 3aMaryland 0awater pollution 0aherbicides1 aHively, W.

Analytical and botanical features are presented here for only 12 of the more promising species. Samples of the 100 species were analyzed for yields of oils, polyphenols, hydrocarbons, and crude proteins. Classes of oil constituents were identified. Contents of fatty acids and unsaponifiable matter of saponified oils were determined. Hydrocarbons were analyzed for the presence of rubber and gutta (polyisoprenes). Polyisoprenes were analyzed for average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. Impressive yields of oil and/or polyphenol were extracted from Asclepias linaria, Juglans major, Ligustrum japonicum, Mimosa biuncifera, Mortonia scabrella, Olea europaea, and Rhus choriophylla. Of these, O. europaea and L. Japonicum of the Oleaceae are rapid-growing, evergreen species with low to moderate moisture requirements and very good adaptability to pollarding. 3aarid zones 3asemiarid zones 3arenewable resources 3awoody plants 3achemical constituents of plants 3aindustrial crops 3aArizona 0acharacterization1 aMason, C.T.

To better understand the effects of fire in the Chihuahuan desert, gas exchange characteristics of two dominant grass species, Bouteloua eriopoda and Aristida purpurea, and soil nitrogen availability were studied in response to prescribed fire at the Jornada Experimental Range in southern New Mexico. Burned and unburned plant individuals were measured before and after fire. Rates of net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were highest in burned individuals, with those of A. purpurea exceeding B. eriopoda. Soil nitrogen supply rates increased compared to unburned controls. Similar to other grasslands where fire is common, physiological characteristics of vegetation responded positively. These adaptations indicate that fire may be beneficial in the preservation and restoration of native grasses. 3ainterspecific variation 3agrasses 3astomatal conductance 3afire ecology 3anitrogen 3agas exchange 3anutrient availability 3aecophysiology 3adeserts 3aAristida purpurea 3axerophytes 3asoil fertility 3aprescribed burning 3aphotosynthesis 3aBouteloua eriopoda 3aNew Mexico 0aspecies differences 0aChihuahuan Desert1 aSnyder, K.A.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2008 Nov., v.  72, no.  11 p.1989-1996x0140-19637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/225793Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2008.06.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090115b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/17  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03616naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024001900127024002000146040001800166072000900184072000900193100001800202245008000220300001600300500002400316520173000340650001902070650001702089650001602106650001402122650002702136650001202163650001902175650002202194650002502216650001902241650002602260650002702286650002202313650001402335650002702349650001402376650002602390650002002416651001102436651002502447653003502472700001602507700001602523700002102539700001702560700001902577700001602596773006702612852000902679856011102688856008502799930003302884945002502917946001102942961001302953655001202966IND4399823720221123040339.0080111e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439982372DNAL7 a10.1017/S00166723030061772doi7 a129299092pmid7 a10113/88702hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF3001 aAradhya, M.K.10aGenetic structure and differentiation in cultivated grape, Vitis vinifera L  ap. 179-192.  aIncludes references  a222 cultivated (Vitis vinifera) and 22 wild (V. vinifera ssp. sylvestris) grape accessions were analysed for genetic diversity and differentiation at eight microsatellite loci. A total of 94 alleles were detected, with extensive polymorphism among the accessions. Multivariate relationships among accessions revealed 16 genetic groups structured into three clusters, supporting the classical eco-geographic grouping of grape cultivars: occidentalis, pontica and orientalis. French cultivars appeared to be distinct and showed close affinity to the wild progenitor, ssp. sylvestris from south-western France (Pyrenees) and Tunisia, probably reflecting the origin and domestication history of many of the old wine cultivars from France. There was appreciable level of differentiation between table and wine grape cultivars, and the Muscat types were somewhat distinct within the wine grapes. Contingency Ï2 analysis indicated significant heterogeneity in allele frequencies among groups at all loci. The observed heterozygosities for different groups ranged from 0Â·625 to 0Â·9 with an overall average of 0Â·771. Genetic relationships among groups suggested hierarchical differentiation within cultivated grape. The gene diversity analysis indicated narrow divergence among groups and that most variation was found within groups ([similar]85%). Partitioning of diversity suggested that the remaining variation is somewhat structured hierarchically at different levels of differentiation. The overall organization of genetic diversity suggests that the germplasm of cultivated grape represents a single complex gene pool and that its structure is determined by strong artificial selection and a vegetative mode of reproduction. 3aVitis vinifera 3atable grapes 3awine grapes 3acultivars 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aalleles 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3agenetic polymorphism 3aheterozygosity 3agenetic relationships 3ageographical variation 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aVitisxgenetics 3aEurope 3aMediterranean region 0aVitis vinifera ssp. sylvestris1 aDangl, G.S.1 aPrins, B.H.1 aBoursiquot, J.M.1 aWalker, M.A.1 aMeredith, C.P.1 aSimon, C.J.0 tGenetical research.g2003 June, v.  81, no.  3 p.179-1927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/88703Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00166723030061773Available from publisher's Web site  a20080115b20080202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/01/15  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02608naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193100002400202245017000226300001800396500002400414520050200438650001300940650002000953650002200973650002200995650001501017650001401032650002001046650002101066650002301087650001701110650000901127650002801136650002301164650001901187650001801206650001901224650004301243650001501286651001801301653002301319700002201342700002301364700003101387700002001418700002401438700001901462700002101481700001901502773012101521852000901642856011201651856008501763930003301848945002501881946001301906961001501919655001201934IND4430262520221120040240.0091222e20091215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443026252DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.235.12.14122doi7 a10113/385472hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL100 0aQ202 0aD5001 aTrampel, Darrell W.12aA federal and state transport plan for movement of eggs and egg products from commercial egg production premises in a high-pathogenicity avian influenza control area  ap. 1412-1419.  aIncludes references  aThe article focuses on the Federal and State Transport (FAST) Eggs Plan.

Records were available for 11,793 BS calvings, 3431 BS-sired crosses, 65,293 JE calvings, and 7090 JE-sired crosses. Evaluations were performed for each breed using only purebred calvings and using both purebred and crossbred calvings. In the latter evaluations, the sire-maternal grandsire model used for the routine evaluation of Holstein (HO) CE was modified to include a fixed breed composition effect to account for differences between purebred and crossbred calvings. Jersey cows had very little calving difficulty (0.5 to 0.7%) and JE bulls had a very small range of evaluations, suggesting that a routine JE evaluation would be of little value. Results from the BS evaluations suggest a routine evaluation would provide BS breeders with a useful tool for genetic improvement. Further examination of data showed that many BS calvings were in mixed herds with HO calvings. As a result, a joint evaluation for BS and HO bulls was developed. The BS data showed that there is similar genetic variability as found in the HO population, which suggests implementation of a routine evaluation including BS CE would be of value. It appears BS bulls may produce daughters with superior maternal calving ability compared with HO. Validation of the joint evaluation was performed by comparing results with the routine HO evaluation. Holstein solutions from the joint evaluation were comparable to results from the routine HO-only evaluation.

In this study, we grew cotton fibers in vitro, with ovules dissected at day zero post anthesis as the expiant source, in the presence of three herbicides that inhibit cellulose biosynthesis. Cultures were sampled for electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry 1-2 days after beginning the treatments. After dichlobenil treatment, the fibers were much shorter than the controls and assumed a variety of abnormal shapes, from shortened versions of the control fiber to nearly spherical. The inner layers of the fiber wall often contained juxtaposed electron-translucent and -transparent areas; this layer reacted strongly with antibodies to callose. Cellulase-gold labeling in these newly developed fibers grown in the presence of dichlobenil was present at only about 3% of the control labeling. After treatment with either isoxaben or flupoxam, the fibers assumed spherical shapes and frequently (more than 60% of fibers) exhibited a new cell plate within the fiber, indicating that cell division had occurred, a process that rarely occurred in the controls. Unlike the dichlobenil-treated fibers, fibers grown in the presence of isoxaben or flupoxam contained an extensive accumulation of chiefly deesterified pectins, replacing the entire wall with an elaborated version of the pectin sheath found in control cotton fibers. These data indicate that all three herbicides are effective disrupters of cellulose biosynthesis and cause radical changes in cell wall structure and composition. Moreover, these data indicate that the composition of the walls may influence indirectly cell cycle kinetics, keeping these fiber cells in a more meristematic mode. 3aflupoxam 3acallose 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aisoxaben 3adichlobenil 0aamide herbicides 0afuzz1 aTurley, R.B.0 tProtoplasma.g2001, v.  216, no.  1/2 p.80-93x0033-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/296853Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF026801353Available from publisher's Web site  a20090604b20090703c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03446naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024001900134040001800153072000900171100001700180245012000197300001200317500002400329520187600353650002302229650003302252650004202285650002402327650003002351650001002381650001802391650001502409650002502424653003702449653004002486653002202526700002402548700001402572773009702586852000902683856011002692856009202802930003302894945002502927946001102952961001302963655001202976IND4386885220221119124023.0070116e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438688522DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2006.01488.x2doi7 a10113/9632hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8321 aSchaad, N.W.12aA high throughput membrane BIO-PCR technique for ultra-sensitive detection of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola  ap. 1-8.  aIncludes references  aMolecular-based methods such as PCR have greatly improved detection of bacteria in environmental samples. However, the sensitivity of PCR is not high when compared to agar plating assays, and inhibitors from plants are often a problem. Pre-enriching bacteria on agar media (BIO-PCR) can increase the sensitivity of PCR by more than 100% and reduce the effects of inhibitors. To further increase the sensitivity and also reduce the labour needed for BIO-PCR, a high throughput 96-well membrane BIO-PCR technique is described for ultra-sensitive detection of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (PSP) (syn. P. phaseolicola) in washings of seeds and leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris, using available classical PCR primers and newly designed real-time primers and probe. The primers and probe, designed from a tox-argK chromosomal cluster of the PSP-specific phaseolotoxin gene, were confirmed to be specific to PSP. Samples (1Â·2 mL) were filtered under vacuum in 96-well membrane plates. After incubating on soft agar medium for 48-52 h, each well is washed with 200 Î¼L of sterile water and used immediately for nested (two-step) PCR or real-time PCR or stored at -20Â°C. Results of assaying spiked seed washings showed that classical PCR was unable to detect PSP at mean concentrations of 40 colony forming units (cfu) mLâ»Â¹. BIO-PCR detected PSP in five out of six samples at 40 mean cfu mLâ»Â¹ but none at mean concentrations of 4Â·2 and 0Â·4 mean cfu mLâ»Â¹. In contrast, membrane BIO-PCR detected the bacterium in all six samples tested containing as few as 0Â·4 mean cfu mLâ»Â¹. The sensitivity of detection from leaf washings was lower but the results were similar, classical and BIO-PCR were negative from all three levels of inoculum while membrane BIO-PCR detected three out of three samples at 80 mean cfu mLâ»Â¹ and one out of three at 40 mean cfu mLâ»Â¹. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abacterial diseases of plants 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 3amicrobial detection 3apolymerase chain reaction 3agenes 3aphaseolotoxin 3afiltration 3aartificial membranes 0anested polymerase chain reaction 0areal-time polymerase chain reaction 0avacuum filtration1 aBerthier-Schaad, Y.1 aKnorr, D.0 tPlant pathology.g2007 Feb., v.  56, no.  1 p.1-8dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/9633Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2006.01488.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/07/17  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04765naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159100001800168245017600186300001800362500002400380520249800404650001502902650001602917650004802933650002102981650001603002650001303018650002503031650002603056650002803082650001703110650001403127650001203141650001103153650004603164650002203210650003103232650005003263650003803313650002403351650001103375650002503386650002303411650007403434650004703508650002403555650001703579700001703596700001603613700002003629700001703649700001703666700001603683700003803699773012303737852000903860856011203869930003303981945002504014946001304039961001504052655001204067IND4384422520221117193304.0061016e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438442252DNAL7 a170330022pmid7 a10113/225712hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aQ2011 aLombard, J.E.10aEvaluation of Environmental Sampling and Culture to Determine Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis Distribution and Herd Infection Status on US Dairy Operations  ap. 4163-4171.  aIncludes references  aThe objectives of this study were to determine the distribution of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) in the environment and assess the relationship between the culture status of MAP in the farm environment and herd infection status. The National Animal Health Monitoring System's Dairy 2002 study surveyed dairy operations in 21 states. One component of the study involved collection and culturing of environmental samples for MAP from areas on farms where manure accumulated from a majority of a herd's cows. Operations were selected for inclusion based on perceived risk factors for MAP infection identified in a previously administered questionnaire. Individual animal and environmental samples were collected and used to determine the efficiency of environmental sampling for determination of herd infection status. Individual animal fecal, serum, and milk samples were used to classify herds as infected or not infected based on the presence of at least one test-positive animal in the herd. A total of 483 environmental samples (approximately 5 per farm) were collected, and 218 (45.1%) were culture-positive for MAP. A similar percentage of environmental cultures collected from all designated areas were positive [parlor exits (52.3%), floors of holding pens (49.1%), common alleyways (48.8%), lagoons (47.4%), manure spreaders (42.3%), and manure pits (41.5%)]. Of the 98 operations tested with the environmental sample culture, 97 had individual serum ELISA results, 60 had individual fecal culture results, and 34 had individual milk ELISA results. Sixty-nine of the 98 operations (70.4%) had at least one environmental sample that was culture-positive. Of the 50 herds classified as infected by fecal culture, 38 (76.0%) were identified by environmental culture. Two of the 10 operations classified as not infected based on individual animal fecal culture were environmental culture-positive. Of the 80 operations classified as infected based on serum ELISA-positive results, 61 (76.3%) were identified as environmental-positive, whereas 20 of the 28 (71.4%) operations identified as infected based on milk ELISA were detected by environmental sampling. Environmental sample culturing is less costly than individual animal sampling, does not require animal restraint, and identified more than 70% of infected operations. Environmental sampling is another diagnostic tool that veterinarians and dairy producers can use to determine herd infection status for MAP. 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aparatuberculosis 3aherd health 3asampling 3adisease transmission 3adairy farm management 3abacterial contamination 3amilk quality 3apollution 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aDairyingxmethods 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aEpidemiologic Methodsxveterinary 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aManurexmicrobiology 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosisxisolation & purification 2aParatuberculosisxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aSerumxmicrobiology 2aTime Factors1 aWagner, B.A.1 aSmith, R.L.1 aMcCluskey, B.J.1 aHarris, B.N.1 aPayeur, J.B.1 aGarry, F.B.1 aSalmÄn, Muá¸¥ammad,cá¸Äká¹­ar0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Nov., v.  89, no.  11 p.4163-4171dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/225713Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090115b20090206c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/11/10  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle02999naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024001900127024002100146040001800167072000900185072000900194100002000203245008800223300001400311500002400325500001500349520098300364650001801347650002701365650002401392650002201416650001801438650002201456650001501478650001501493650001901508650001201527650003801539650002301577650003401600650001501634650001801649650001901667650001301686650003201699651001401731651001401745653001701759653003001776653003001806653002201836653002301858653001501881700002301896700001801919773009901937852000902036856011202045856008502157930003302242945002502275946001302300961001202313655001202325IND4399228420221120222337.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439922842DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-007-9011-42doi7 a178468302pmid7 a10113/322582hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK200 0aX2001 aWebb, Trevor J.10aForest Value Orientations in Australia: An Application of Computer Content Analysis  ap. 52-63.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThis article explores the expression of three forest value orientations that emerged from an analysis of Australian news media discourse about the management of Australian native forests from August 1, 1997 through December 31, 2004. Computer-coded content analysis was used to measure and track the relative importance of commodity, ecological and moral/spiritual/aesthetic forest value orientations. The number of expressions of these forest value orientations followed major events in forest management and policy, with peaks corresponding to finalization of Regional Forest Agreements and conflicts over forest management. Over the time period analyzed, the relative share of commodity value orientation decreased and the shares of the ecological and moral/spiritual/aesthetic value orientations increased. The shifts in forest value orientations highlight the need for native forests to be managed for multiple values and the need for continued monitoring of forest values. 3aforest policy 3aattitudes and opinions 3ainformation sources 3acomputer analysis 3adata analysis 3atimber production 3amass media 3aaesthetics 3aforest ecology 3aforests 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDatabases, Factual 2aForestryxeconomicsxmethods. 2aMass Media 2aPolicy Making 2aPublic Opinion 2aSoftware 2aTreesxgrowth & development 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0anews stories 0aComputer content analysis 0aForest value orientations 0aforest management 0aconflicting values 0anewspapers1 aBengston, David N.1 aFan, David P.0 tEnvironmental management.g2008 Jan., v.  41, no.  1 p.52-63dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/322583Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-007-9011-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/08/12  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03265naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092024002100133040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190072000900199100002000208245008300228300001500311500002400326520156500350650001701915650002001932650002101952650004801973650002002021650001602041650002902057650002502086650002302111650002202134650002602156650002202182650002602204650001702230650002202247650001602269700001802285700001802303773009402321852000902415856011202424856009102536930003302627945002502660946001102685961001502696655001202711IND4385194520221117193157.0061113e20060717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438519452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2006.02.0022doi7 a10113/225722hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aE200 0aX100 0aX2001 aDorshorst, N.C.10aDecision analysis model for paratuberculosis control in commercial dairy herds  ap. 92-122.  aIncludes references  aA previous economic test-and-cull decision analysis model has been strengthened and updated with current epidemiologic information. Created using Excel and PrecisionTree software, the model incorporates costs and benefits of herd management changes, diagnostic testing, and different management actions based on test results to control paratuberculosis in commercial dairy herds. This novel "JD-Tree" model includes a herd management decision node (four options), a test/no test decision node (two options), a diagnostic test choice decision node (five options), test result chance nodes (four levels of possible results), and test action decision nodes (three options; cull, manage, no action). The model culminates in a chance node for true infection status. Outcomes are measured as a net cost-benefit value to the producer. The model demonstrates that improving herd management practices to control infection spread (hygiene) is often more cost-effective than testing; not all herds should test as part of a paratuberculosis control program. For many herds, low-cost tests are more useful than more sensitive, higher cost tests. The model also indicates that test-positive cows in early stages of infection may be retained in the herd to generate farm income, provided they are managed properly to limit infection transmission. JD-Tree is a useful instructional tool, helping veterinarians understand the complex interactions affecting the economics of paratuberculosis control and to define the accuracy and cost specifications of better diagnostic tests. 3adairy cattle 3acattle diseases 3aparatuberculosis 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3adisease control 3adairy herds 3adecision support systems 3aproduction economics 3aeconometric models 3acomputer software 3adairy farm management 3adisease diagnosis 3acost benefit analysis 3amilk quality 3aculling (animals) 3aherd health1 aCollins, M.T.1 aLombard, J.E.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2006 July 17, v.  75, no.  1-2 p.92-122x0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/225723Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2006.02.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090115b20090206c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/11/30  aNon-US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle03764naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131072000900149072000900158100002300167245011000190300001800300500002400318520222700342650001502569650002002584650002302604650001802627650002102645650003002666650001202696650002302708650000902731650004602740650002102786650001102807650002002818650001402838650002102852650001702873700001802890700002102908700001902929773008202948852000903030856011103039930003303150945002503183946001303208961001303221655001203234IND4369592620221121100243.0050505e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436959262DNAL7 a158296702pmid7 a10113/19652hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aW0001 aMisselbrook, T.

This study collected urine and feces from dairy cows from selected crude protein (CP) treatments of 2 lactation studies. In the first trial, collections were made from cattle fed a diet with high (19.4%) or low (13.6%) CP content (HCP and LCP, respectively). In the second trial, collections were made from cattle fed diets in which the forage legume component was alfalfa (ALF) or birdsfoot trefoil with a low (BFTL) or high (BFTH) concentration of condensed tannins (CT). A system of small laboratory chambers was used to measure NHâ emissions over 48 h from applications of equal quantities of urine and feces to cement (simulating a barn floor) and from applications of slurries, made by combining feces and urine in the proportions in which they were excreted for each treatment, to soil. Reducing dietary CP content resulted in less total N excretion and a smaller proportion of the excreted N being present in urine; urine N concentration was 90% greater for HCP than LCP. Surprisingly, NHâ emissions from the barn floor were similar in absolute terms despite the great differences in urine urea-N concentrations, presumably because urease activity was limiting. Cumulative emissions from fresh slurries applied to soil represented 18% of applied N for both HCP and LCP. Following storage at 20Â°C for 2 wk, cumulative emissions from LCP were much lower than for HCP, representing 9 and 25% of applied N, respectively. Emissions were also lower when expressed as a proportion of slurry total ammoniacal N (TAN) content (24 and 31%, respectively) because of treatment differences in slurry pH. Increasing CT content of the dietary forage legume component resulted in a shift in N excretion from urine to feces. Cumulative NHâ emissions from the barn floor were greater for ALF than for BFTL or BFTH. Emissions from fresh and stored slurries were in proportion to slurry TAN contents, with approximately 35% of applied TAN being lost for all treatments. Emissions expressed as a proportion of total N applied were consistently lower for BFTH than for ALF. 3adairy cows 3adietary protein 3aLotus corniculatus 3acattle manure 3aland application 2aAmmoniaxanalysisxurine. 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDiet 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aFecesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aHousing, Animal 2aLactation 2aManurexanalysis 2aTime Factors1 aPowell, J.

The genus Helianthus comprises 51 species (14 annual and 37 perennial), all native to North America. However, wild sunflowers have been inadvertently and intentionally introduced into several countries where they have become naturalized, most notably in Australia, Argentina, and southern Europe. The distribution of the wild naturalized sunflower species in Australia occurs primarily within the states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria), South Australia, and West Australia. Since these species have been naturalized in Australia, the possibility exists that they may have traits distinct from their North American progenitors due to the different environments, diseases and insect pests. Currently there are no collections of wild sunflower from Australia in the USDA-ARS National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) sunflower germplasm collection. This germplasm would greatly increase the available genetic diversity for these species from outside of North America. The objective of this exploration was to collect achenes (3,000 achenes per population) from as many populations as possible of H. annuus and H. debilis, and make them available for future research and improvement of cultivated sunflower. The Australian exploration took place from February 22 through March 14, 2007. It covered 10,000 km in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and West Australia. Five days were spent exploring WA. In spite of the extreme drought, 14 populations of naturalized H. annuus were collected. Six days were spent exploring South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. These states were especially hard hit with drought, but 21 populations of naturalized wild H. annuus were collected. An exploration to Queensland, which was also suffering from extreme drought, resulted in the collection of two populations of wild naturalized H. annuus and two populations of H. debilis ssp. cucumerifolius. The germplasm collected will be evaluated for oil concentration and fatty acid composition, as well as screened for various diseases and insects as a potential source of genes for the improvement of cultivated sunflower. The origin of the naturalized populations of wild sunflower in Australia is still open for discussion. The species found there are commonly grown in gardens as ornamental flowers. It is also possible that the seed was inadvertently introduced in imported forages, or possibly mixed in bird seed. Currently, the time of the introduction of the wild species into Australia is not known. Future genetic population studies may help to answer that question. 3aHelianthus annuus 3aHelianthus debilis 3awild plants 3aphytogeography 3ageographical distribution 3aspecies diversity 3aplant exploration and collection 3aAustralia1 aGulya, T.1 aKong, G.1 aThompson, S.1 aMitchell, J.0 tProceedings / Sunflower research workshop.g2008, , no.  307nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/166313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080708b20080801c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/07/08  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04414naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196100002000205245011400225300001600339500002400355520280800379650001803187650001903205650001903224650001703243650001203260650001703272650002103289650002203310650002103332650002303353650002503376650002303401651001103424653003503435700001603470700001303486773009403499852000903593856011203602856008903714930003303803945002503836946001103861961001203872655001203884IND4392113820221118181058.0070605e20070531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439211382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2007.03.0192doi7 a10113/400252hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK250 0aK100 0aX100 0aF3001 aSchroeder, T.A.10aPatterns of forest regrowth following clearcutting in western Oregon as determined from a Landsat time-series  ap. 259-273.  aIncludes references  aThe rate at which forest vegetation re-establishes dominance after clearcut harvesting can impact many ecological processes, such as erosion/ sedimentation, nutrient and water cycling, carbon storage potential, wildlife habitat, and trophic interactions. Although knowing a forest stand's current state of succession is useful, a clearer understanding of the impact forest harvesting has on the aforementioned ecological processes can be achieved with a more dynamic characterization of the successional process. To more fully model the continuous nature of forest regrowth following clearcut harvesting we extrapolated percent tree cover data collected by the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Forest Inventory and Analysis program to a cross-normalized Landsat time-series using a date-invariant regression modeling approach. Using three periods of mapped clearcuts we extracted and classified the extrapolated percent tree cover data into four regrowth classes (little to no, slow, moderate and fast). These forest regrowth classes were used to develop frequency distributions describing the landscape patterns of postharvest forest recovery for two ecological provinces in western Oregon. The patterns of forest regrowth observed over the three clearcut periods indicated a much higher percentage of fast regrowth in the Coastal Range Province and a much higher percentage of little to no regrowth in the Western Cascade Province. For both ecological provinces we observed the propensity for faster regrowth on north facing aspects, shallow slopes and at low elevations. The forest regrowth classes and the frequency distributions indicated that a wide range of successional stages could be found in both ecological provinces 18 years after clearcutting. The extension of forest regrowth trajectories to the spectral space of Landsat provided an opportunity to use CART statistical analysis to more fully investigate the climatic and topographic drivers influencing the rate of postharvest forest regrowth. Based on the Kappa statistic, predictions from both CART models were in "fair" to "moderate" agreement with the test samples. Both classification trees yielded ecologically interpretable insights into the environmental attributes influencing forest regrowth rates after clearcutting. In both ecological provinces, elevation followed by potential relative radiation (PRR) explained the largest amount of variation in forest regrowth rates. To gauge the effectiveness of predicting more generalized postharvest forest regrowth rates we combined the four forest regrowth classes into two general "fast" and "slow" categories. Based on the Tau statistic, the CART models correctly classified 12% (CRP) and 26% (WCP) more combined test samples than classification of the four regrowth classes. 3aforest growth 3aimage analysis 3aremote sensing 3aclearcutting 3aLandsat 3aspatial data 3avegetation cover 3aforest succession 3aforest inventory 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 3astatistical models 3aOregon 0avegetation change trajectories1 aCohen, W.B.1 aYang, Z.0 tForest ecology and management.g2007 May 31, v.  243, no.  2-3 p.259-273x0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/400253Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2007.03.0193Available from publisher's Web site.  a20100331b20100403c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/06/07  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03672naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159100001900168245010800187300001600295500002400311520181000335650001702145650002102162650002802183650001502211650001602226650001702242650001202259650003002271650001602301650001102317650003402328650002802362650002402390650000902414650001402423650002802437650002702465650003002492650002902522650004002551653002902591653002202620653002402642700002002666773008702686852000902773856011202782856009302894930003302987945002503020946001303045961001203058655001203070IND4367699820221122063801.0050316e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436769982DNAL7 a152602182pmid7 a10113/103042hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aK0011 aSullivan, B.T.10aSemiochemicals from fungal associates of bark beetles may mediate host location behavior of parasitoids  ap. 703-717.  aIncludes references  aIn laboratory olfactometer bioassays, females of two hymenopteran parasitoid species, Roptrocerus xylophagorum (Ratzeburg) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) and Spathius pallidus (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), were attracted to odors from bark or bolts of loblolly pine, Pinus taeda L., colonized by bluestain fungi (genus Ophiostoma) associated with the parasitoids' bark beetle hosts. Mock-inoculated bolts and bark were less attractive or unattractive in these bioassays. Bark infested with host larvae that lacked their fungal and other normal microbial associates was attractive to R. xylophagorum females, but was less so than bark infested with larvae possessing their normal complement of associated microbes. In contrast, in oviposition bioassays, R. xylophagorum females spent approximately equal time searching, made similar numbers of oviposition attempts, parasitized similar percentages of hosts, and laid similar numbers of eggs in bark fragments infested with either associate-free or associate-bearing host larvae. Furthermore, in field bioassays using bluestain-inoculated or mock-inoculated loblolly pine bolts as sources of attractants, the numbers of parasitoids attracted by the two treatments did not differ significantly and the two treatments were less attractive than bolts naturally infested with bark beetle larvae. Whereas our laboratory olfactometer data suggest that bark beetle fungal associates may enhance attraction of some parasitoids, our bioassays with associate-free hosts indicate that associate-produced are not required for short-range host location and parasitization. In addition, our field trials indicated that long-range attraction of parasitoids to the host-fungi-tree complex is not caused simply by an interaction between bluestain fungi and tree tissues. 3abark beetles 3aIps grandicollis 3atritrophic interactions 3aOphiostoma 3aparasitoids 3ahost seeking 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxmicrobiology. 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aFungixchemistryxphysiology. 2aHymenopteraxphysiology 2aLarvaxmicrobiology 2aMale 2aOdorants. 2aOvipositionxphysiology 2aPheromonesxphysiology 2aPinus taedaxmicrobiology 2aPlant Barkxmicrobiology 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxphysiology 0aRoptrocerus xylophagorum 0aSpathius pallidus 0afungal colonization1 aBerisford, C.W.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2004 Apr., v.  30, no.  4 p.703-717x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/103043Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0098-0331/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080229b20080301c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/05/02  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03562naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170072000900179100002100188245010400209300001600313500002400329520197600353650001502329650001702344650003102361650002202392650002602414650002902440650003102469650003202500650001002532650001202542650001002554700002002564700001802584700002102602700002602623700002502649773008802674852000902762856011202771856008902883939003302972945002503005946001303030961001303043655001203056IND4449399520221120230552.0110216e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444939952DNAL7 a10.1016/S0014-4894(03)00139-52doi7 a10113/480712hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL8221 aMorimoto, Motoko10aAscaris suum: cDNA microarray analysis of 4th stage larvae (L4) during self-cure from the intestine  ap. 113-121.  aIncludes references  aThere is spontaneous cure of a large portion of Ascaris suum 4th-stage larvae (L4) from the jejunum of infected pigs between 14 and 21 days after inoculation (DAI). Those L4 that remain in the jejunum continue to develop while those that have moved to the ileum are eventually expelled from the intestines. Although increases in intestinal mucosal mast cells and changes in local host immunity are coincidental with spontaneous cure, the population of L4 that continue to develop in the jejunum may counteract host protective mechanisms by the differential production of factors related to parasitism. To this end, a cDNA library was constructed from L4 isolated from pig jejunum at 21 DAI, and 93% of 1920 original clones containing a single amplicon in the range 400â1500 bp were verified by gel electrophoresis and printed onto glass slides for microarray analysis. Fluorescent probes were prepared from total RNA isolated from: (1) 3rd stage-larvae from lung at 7 DAI, (L3); (2) L4 from jejunum at 14 DAI (L4-14-J); (3) L4 from jejunum at 21 DAI (L4-21-J); (4) L4 from ileum at 21 DAI (L4-21-I, and; (5) adults (L5). Cy3-labeled L3, L4-14-J, L4-21-I and L5 cDNA, and Cy5-labeled L4-21-J cDNA were simultaneously used to screen the printed arrays containing the L4-21-J-derived cDNA library. Several clones showed consistent differential gene expression over two separate experiments and were grouped into 3 distinct transcription patterns. The data showed that sequences from muscle actin and myosin, ribosomal protein L11, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the flavoprotein subunit of succinate dehydrogenase were highly expressed in L4-21-J, but not in L4- 21-I; as were a collection of un-annotated genes derived from a worm body wall-hypodermis library, and a testes germinal zone tissue library. These results suggest that only actively developing A. suum L4 are destined to parasitize the host and successfully neutralize host protective responses. 3aascariasis 3aAscaris suum 3aanimal parasitic nematodes 3acomplementary DNA 3amicroarray technology 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression regulation 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aswine 3ajejunum 3aileum1 aZarlenga, Dante1 aBeard, Hunter1 aAlkharouf, Nadim1 aMatthews, Benjamin F.1 aUrban, Joseph F.

The monoacid triglyceride II (CyCyCy) was interesterified with triolein (OOO) to obtain mixtures of diacid triglycerides: III (OOCy), IV (OCyO), V (OCyCy), and VI (CyOCy). The interesterification mixtures were separated by preparative HPLC into two 'critical pairs' of isomeric triglycerides. Triglycerides III-VI were synthesized and a 13C-NMR method was developed to estimate 'critical pairs'. CFA-triglycerides were characterized by IR, NMR, HPLC and capillary GLC, and their relative rates of hydrolysis by lipase were compared. Although tricyclin (II) was completely resistant to lipolysis, triglycerides III and VI hydrolyzed significantly slower than triolein, and the 'critical pairs' hydrolyzed as readily as triolein. Therefore, partial CFA-triglycerides formed in heat-abused fats can undergo lipolysis and likely be absorbed like normal dietary fats. 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3alipolysis 3atriolein 3asynthesis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxchemical synthesis 2aIndicators and Reagents 2aIsomerism 2aKinetics 2aLipasexmetabolism 2aLipolysis 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aSpectrophotometry, Infrared 2aTriglyceridesxchemical synthesis 0atriacylglycerols 0acharacterization 0aesters1 aFrankel, E.N.1 aBrooks, D.D.1 aWeisleder, D.0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g1986 Aug., v.  41, no.  1 p.65-80x0009-30847nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/238773Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03651naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193072000900202072000900211100001900220245013600239300001400375500002400389500001500413520164600428650001902074650002502093650002102118650001802139650001702157650001402174650001402188650002602202650001802228650002502246650002402271650001602295650001002311650001502321650001502336653001602351653003402367653001902401653002502420700002102445700002402466700002302490700002202513700001702535700002002552700001902572773008502591852000902676856011202685856008502797930003302882945002502915946001302940961001202953655001202965IND4401842020221116140755.0080223e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440184202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-007-9105-02doi7 a10113/322492hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF300 0aK001 0aX100 0aF821 0aK8001 aCook, Bruce D.10aUsing Light-Use and Production Efficiency Models to Predict Photosynthesis and Net Carbon Exchange During Forest Canopy Disturbance  ap. 26-44.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aVegetation growth models are used with remotely sensed and meteorological data to monitor terrestrial carbon dynamics at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Many of these models are based on a light-use efficiency equation and two-component model of whole-plant growth and maintenance respiration that have been parameterized for distinct vegetation types and biomes. This study was designed to assess the robustness of these parameters for predicting interannual plant growth and carbon exchange, and more specifically to address inconsistencies that may arise during forest disturbances and the loss of canopy foliage. A model based on the MODIS MOD17 algorithm was parameterized for a mature upland hardwood forest by inverting COâ flux tower observations during years when the canopy was not disturbed. This model was used to make predictions during a year when the canopy was 37% defoliated by forest tent caterpillars. Predictions improved after algorithms were modified to scale for the effects of diffuse radiation and loss of leaf area. Photosynthesis and respiration model parameters were found to be robust at daily and annual time scales regardless of canopy disturbance, and differences between modeled net ecosystem production and tower net ecosystem exchange were only approximately 2 g C m-Â² d-Â¹ and less than 23 g C m-Â² y-Â¹. Canopy disturbance events such as insect defoliations are common in temperate forests of North America, and failure to account for cyclical outbreaks of forest tent caterpillars in this stand could add an uncertainty of approximately 4-13% in long-term predictions of carbon sequestration. 3acarbon dioxide 3aprimary productivity 3aphotorespiration 3aforest canopy 3agas exchange 3aequations 3aleaf area 3aenvironmental factors 3agrowth models 3acarbon sequestration 3aMalacosoma disstria 3adefoliation 3alight 3aalgorithms 3aprediction 0aMODIS model 0acarbon utilization efficiency 0aphotosynthesis 0avegetation structure1 aBolstad, Paul V.1 aMartin, Jonathan G.1 aHeinsch, Faith Ann1 aDavis, Kenneth J.1 aWang, Weiguo1 aDesai, Ankur R.1 aTeclaw, Ron M.0 tEcosystems.g2008 Feb., v.  11, no.  1 p.26-44dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/322493Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-007-9105-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/08/12  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02222naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169100001900178245010400197300001400301500002400315520080000339650002201139650001301161650001501174650001301189650003101202650002301233650001201256650001601268650001401284650002401298650002101322700001701343773012301360852000901483856011201492856008801604930003301692945002501725946001301750961001301763655001201776IND4432214420221120062323.0100202s1989    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443221442DNAL7 a10.1016/0305-0491(89)90009-62doi7 a10113/385292hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8101 aMcMurtry, J.P.10aDevelopment of an avian calcitonin radioimmunoassay using synthetic chicken calcitonin as immunogen  ap. 49-51.  aIncludes references  a1.

Goettel.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of temperature on the production, survival and infectivity of zoospores of an Argentinean isolate of Leptolegnia chapmanii was determined under laboratory conditions. Production of zoospores of L. chapmanii in vitro and in vivo upon first and fourth instars larvae of the mosquito Aedes aegypti was studied at three different temperatures. Zoospores from infected larvae were infective to mosquito larvae for 51, 12, and 5 consecutive days when maintained at 25, 35, and 10 Â°C, respectively. Maximum zoospore production in infected fourth-instar larvae was 9.6 Â± 1.4 x 104 zoosp/larva at 48 h at 25 Â°C. The average number of zoospores produced by individual fourth-instar Ae. aegypti larvae infected with L. chapmanii was 3.57 Â± 0.46 x 105 zoospores during 6 consecutive days at 25 Â°C. Zoospore production in vitro was also affected by temperature with a maximum of zoospores (n = 47,666/ml) produced at 25 Â°C. When zoospores produced in vitro were used as inoculum against Ae. aegypti larvae at 25 Â°C, larval mortality was recorded for 5 consecutive weeks. The encystment process for zoospores took 17-20 min; the germination of cysts (excystment) occurred 5 min after exposure in water to mosquito larvae. The minimal time of contact between zoospores and mosquito larvae to develop infection was two minutes. Infection took place by zoospore attachment onto and then penetration through the larval cuticle or by ingestion of cysts as was confirmed by histological studies. Temperature directly affected infectivity and production of zoospores in vivo and in vitro although L. chapmanii zoospores tolerate a wide range of temperatures. 3aSaprolegniales 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3azoospores 3asporulation 3aviability 3apathogenicity 3ainfection 3aAedes aegypti 3alarvae 3amortality 3atemperature 3aencystment 3aexcystation 3aspore germination 2aAedesxmicrobiology 2aAnimals 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aInfectionsxmicrobiology. 2aLarvaxmicrobiology 2aLife Cycle Stagesxphysiology 2aLongevityxphysiology 2aPest Control, Biological 2aSaprolegniaxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aSpores, Fungalxgrowth & development1 aLopez Lastra, C.C.1 aBecnel, J.J.1 aHumber, R.A.1 aGarcia, J.J.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2008 July, v.  98, no.  3 p.314-319x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/180363Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2008.04.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20080819b20080905c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/08/15  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04153naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003400117024002500151024004100176024002300217040001800240100001600258245010400274520264600378650003803024650001703062650002203079650001703101650001703118650001003135650002303145650002403168650002003192650002103212650001703233650001603250650003303266650002003299650001303319650001603332650001203348651001503360700005903375700002303434773009403457856008403551961001503635852000903650655001203659IND60770956020221122060750.0220321e20210818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077095602DNAL7 a10113/77095602hdl7 a10.3389/fpls.2021.7132772doi7 a4382772aris_accn_no7 a2034-43000-041-000D2aris_project_no7 a3831732seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfifi, Maha14aThe Complexity of modulating anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway by deficit irrigation in table grapes  aDeficit irrigation (DI) is one of the cultural practices that has been used to improve grape coloration, however, the result is not always satisfactory. Weather conditions, especially temperature, plays a crucial role in regulating anthocyanin pathway and it can play a role in the success of the DI technique. In the present study, we attempted to investigate the anthocyanin biosynthesis in 'Scarlet Royal' table grapes grown under two climate conditions in California (San Joaquin and Coachella valleys) and subjected to different deficit irrigation strategies. Our goal was to identify potential regulatory factors that might lead to applied treatments to be used in improving red color in grapes, especially under warm climate conditions. In both locations, deficit irrigation at veraison induced anthocyanin accumulation and enhanced red color in berries at harvest time. However, anthocyanin accumulation was lower under the warmer condition of the Coachella Valley compared to the San Joaquin Valley. The lower level of anthocyanin was associated with lower level of the expression of key genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis such as flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) and myb-related regulatory gene (MYBA1). Gene expression analysis revealed the association of ABA biosynthesis gene 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED1), 1 aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (ACO3), a major gene in ethylene biosynthesis, and the gibberellic acid (GA) catabolic gene GA2 oxidase in the induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis. An increase in the chalcone synthase gene (CHS2) was observed in response to deficit irrigation treatments in both sites; however, its expression was higher in Coachella Valley after ending the deficit treatment, suggesting the involvement of the environmental stress in elevating the level of the CHS2 transcripts. Coachella Valley is characterized by high temperatures during the day and night in contrast to the less extreme temperatures of the San Joaquin Valley. This data was also supported by the fact that antioxidant gene expression and enzyme activities showed a lower level in the Coachella Valley compared to the San Joaquin Valley. The present data suggested that the lack of red coloration could be at least partially due to the lower level of the antioxidant activities resulting in accelerated anthocyanin degradation and impaired anthocyanin biosynthesis. It seems that under challenging warmer conditions several factors are required to optimize anthocyanin accumulation by deficit irrigation, including an active antioxidant system, proper light perception and hormonal balance. 3a9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant genes 3aantioxidants 3abiosynthesis 3acolor 3adeficit irrigation 3aethylene production 3agene expression 3agibberellic acid 3aharvest date 3amajor genes 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aregulator genes 3aripening 3atemperature 3aweather 3aCalifornia1 aObenland, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1652-623X1 aEl-Kereamy, Ashraf0 tFrontiers in plant science.g2021 Aug. 18, v. 12 p.713277-wJournal:2199x1664-462X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.7132773Available from publisher's Web site  aUSDAbUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle04762naa a2200901 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111024002100150040001800171072000900189072000900198072000900207072000900216100002100225245018300246300001600429500002400445500001500469520174100484650001602225650001802241650002302259650003502282650001602317650002402333650001502357650002802372650002602400650001302426650002602439650000902465650002002474650001602494650001802510650002602528650000902554650002002563650001802583650002102601650001002622650002502632650001202657650001602669650003302685650002802718650004202746650004302788650005302831650002502884650000902909650005602918650003102974650007303005650000903078650004303087650003903130650003903169650003103208650002203239650000903261650005403270650005703324653001903381700002203400700001903422773011303441852000903554856011203563856008903675930003303764945002503797946001303822961001303835655001203848IND4434205920221123003529.0100319e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443420592DNAL7 a193690522pmid7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.01.0022doi7 a10113/408572hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX380 0aX3851 aHadley, Kevin B.10aDietary zinc reduces osteoclast resorption activities and increases markers of osteoblast differentiation, matrix maturation, and mineralization in the long bones of growing rats  ap. 297-303.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe nutritional influence of zinc on markers of bone extracellular matrix resorption and mineralization was investigated in growing rats. Thirty male weanling rats were randomly assigned to consume AIN-93G based diets containing 2.5, 5, 7.5, 15 or 30 Î¼g Zn/g diet for 24 days. Femur zinc increased substantially as zinc increased from 5 to 15 Î¼g/g diet and modestly between 15 and 30 Î¼g/g (P<.05). By morphological assessment, trabecular bone increased steadily as dietary zinc increased to 30 Î¼g/g. Increasing dietary zinc tended to decrease Zip2 expression nonsignificantly and elevated the relative expression of metallothionen-I at 15 but not 30 Î¼g Zn/g diet. Femur osteoclastic resorption potential, indicated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and carbonic anhydrase-2 activities decreased with increasing dietary zinc. In contrast to indicators of extracellular matrix resorption, femur tartrate-resistant acid and alkaline phosphatase activities increased fourfold as dietary zinc increased from 2.5 to 30 Î¼g Zn/g. Likewise, 15 or 30 Î¼g Zn/g diet resulted in maximum relative expression of osteocalcin, without influencing expression of core-binding factor Î±-1, collagen Type 1 alpha-1, or nuclear factor of activated T cells c1. In conclusion, increased trabecular bone with additional zinc suggests that previous requirement estimates of 15 Î¼g Zn/g diet may not meet nutritional needs for optimal bone development. Overall, the up-regulation of extracellular matrix modeling indexes and concomitant decrease in resorption activities as dietary zinc increased from 2.5 to 30 Î¼g/g provide evidence of one or more physiological roles for zinc in modulating the balance between bone formation and resorption. 3aosteocalcin 3aT-lymphocytes 3ametalloproteinases 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aosteoblasts 3abone mineralization 3abiomarkers 3aepidemiological studies 3anutrient deficiencies 3acollagen 3anutrient requirements 3arats 3abone resorption 3aosteoclasts 3aanimal growth 3acarbonate dehydratase 3azinc 3ametallothionein 3aanimal models 3adietary minerals 3afemur 3aalkaline phosphatase 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkers. 2aBone Developmentxphysiology 2aBone Matrixxphysiology 2aBone Resorptionxprevention & control 2aCalcification, Physiologicxphysiology 2aCation Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Differentiation 2aDiet 2aFemurxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGrowth Platexanatomy & histologyxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aMale 2aMetallothioneinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOsteocalcinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOsteoclastsxcytologyxphysiology. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aTibiaxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aZincxadministration & dosagexanalysisxphysiology. 0abone formation1 aNewman, Samuel M.1 aHunt, Janet R.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2010 Apr., v.  21, no.  4 p.297-303dElsevier Sciencex0955-28637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/408573Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.01.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/20  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03402naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111024002000142040001800162072000900180072000900189072000900198100001300207245012700220300001800347500002400365500001500389520149200404650001301896650001501909650002001924650001601944650001601960650001701976650001701993650002602010650001902036650001502055650001602070650002002086650001402106650001202120650001502132650001302147650004702160650006702207650001702274653002202291700001502313700001502328700001402343700001502357773010702372852000902479856008102488856011102569930003302680945002502713946001302738961001302751655001202764IND4397255620221123023556.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439725562DNAL7 a179545972pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2006-004672doi7 a10113/88552hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aQ103 0aQ2031 aChao, K.10aHyperspectral-Multispectral Line-Scan Imaging System for Automated Poultry Carcass Inspection Applications for Food Safety  ap. 2450-2460.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA hyperspectral-multispectral line-scan imaging system was developed for differentiation of wholesome and systemically diseased chickens. In-plant testing was conducted for chickens on a commercial evisceration line moving at a speed of 70 birds per minute. Hyperspectral image data was acquired for a calibration data set of 543 wholesome and 64 systemically diseased birds and for a testing data set of 381 wholesome and 100 systemically diseased birds. The calibration data set was used to develop the parameters of the imaging system for conducting multispectral inspection based on fuzzy logic detection algorithms using selected key wavelengths. Using a threshold of 0.4 for fuzzy output decision values, multispectral classification was able to achieve 90.6% accuracy for wholesome birds and 93.8% accuracy for systemically diseased birds in the calibration data set and 97.6% accuracy for wholesome birds and 96.0% accuracy for systemically diseased birds in the testing data set. By adjusting the classification threshold, 100% accuracy was achieved for systemically diseased birds with a decrease in accuracy for wholesome birds to 88.7%. This adjustment shows that the system can be feasibly adapted as needed for implementation for specific purposes, such as paw harvesting operations or prescreening for food safety inspection. This line-scan imaging system is ideal for directly implementing multispectral classification methods developed from hyperspectral image analysis. 3achickens 3abutchering 3ameat inspection 3acalibration 3afuzzy logic 3achicken meat 3ameat quality 3ahyperspectral imagery 3ameat carcasses 3aautomation 3afood safety 3adecision making 2aAbattoirs 2aAnimals 2aAutomation 2aChickens 2aFood Inspectionxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assistedxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aTime Factors 0aspectral analysis1 aYang, C.C.1 aChen, Y.R.1 aKim, M.S.1 aChan, D.E.0 tPoultry science.g2007 Nov., v.  86, no.  11 p.2450-2460dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2006-004673Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/88553Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080115b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/25  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04032naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111024002100146040001800167072000900185100001300194245018100207300001600388500002400404500001500428520176300443650001702206650001602223650002002239650002402259650001902283650001702302650001502319650002602334650000802360650001402368650002202382650001802404650001802422650004102440650003002481650003802511650001402549650002902563650004002592650002702632650002402659650001302683650002002696650002002716650002302736650001702759650001902776651001202795651001202807653002202819700001702841700002002858700001302878700001802891773009902909852000903008856008503017856011203102930003303214945002503247946001303272961001303285655001203298IND4408644020221119103212.0080808e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440864402DNAL7 a185762172pmid7 a10.1080/036012308020620182doi7 a10113/180382hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH0001 aOu, L.T.10aComparison of surface emissions and subsurface distribution of cis- and trans-1,3-dichloropropene and chloropicrin in sandy field beds covered with four different plastic films  ap. 376-381.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThe purpose of this study was to conduct a field study at a Florida field site on surface emissions and subsurface distribution of cis-and trans-1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) and chloropicrin (CP) in raised beds injected with Telone C35 with four replications. A total of 16 beds were applied with Telone C35 by chisel injection and covered with four different plastic films, 4 beds for each film. Each bed was installed with five 20-cm long soil pore air probes and a surface air collection pan at arbitrarily locations along the length of each bed for sampling soil pore air and surface air, respectively, for analysis of the three biologically active compounds, cis- and trans-1,3-D and CP. We found that average concentrations of the three compounds at 20-cm depth among the beds covered with four different plastic films generally were not statistically different. Among the four beds covered with the same plastic film, average concentrations of the three compounds were statistically different only in the four metallic PE covered beds at 5 and 24 hours after injection. Volatilization rates of the three compounds among the beds covered with four different plastic films, with the exception of CP at 48 hours after injection, were not statistically different. It appeared that initial upward diffusion and volatilization flux were influenced by solar radiation.

In three experiments, 5047 weed seeds were removed from cover crop mulch plots compared to 1860 seeds from standard production plots, and within treatments, predation increased significantly with decreasing seed size. Predation of beet armyworm pupae was 33% greater in cover crop mulch compared to conventional production plots. Fire ants were the main predator of weed seed and pest insects. In the two bell pepper experiments, weed cover per square meter was 31.8% less in standard production than in cover crop mulch plots. The mean number of invertebrates (other than fire ants) captured in pitfall traps was 5.8 Â± 0.1 plot-1 versus 3.8 Â± 0.8 plot-1 for cover crop and conventional treatments, respectively. There were 5734 fire ants captured in mulched cover crop plots compared to 1278 in conventional production plots. There was no significant difference in crop yield among treatments. The results suggest fire ants were more abundant where there was mulched cover and were important predators of weed seed and pest insects in killed cover crop plots and that cover crop mulches in summer pepper and fall collard production are potentially viable alternatives to black plastic mulch and soil fumigation. 3asweet peppers 3aSolenopsis invicta 3acrop yield 3apopulation dynamics 3asoil fumigation 3aweed control 3aCapsicum annuum 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aplant pests 3ainsect pests 3aBrassica oleracea var. viridis 3acole crops 3aweeds 3amethyl bromide 3amulches 3apredatory insects 3acollard greens 3acover crops 3aburied seeds 3anatural enemies 0avegetable crops1 aMarino, P.C.1 aJackson, D.M.1 aHarrison, H.F.1 aKeinath, A.P.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2006 July, v.  115, no.  1-4 p.97-104x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/96293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2005.12.0213Available from publisher's Web site  a20080207b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/02/23  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03070naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130100001400139245017500153300001400328500002400342500001500366520145900381650001701840650003301857650002501890650003001915650001201945650002001957650002201977650002101999650001602020650002702036650002102063650002002084651001002104653001902114653001902133653001702152700001402169700001802183700001202201700001202213700002402225773007602249852000902325856011102334930003302445945002502478946001302503961001202516655001202528IND4377259520221121034236.0060117e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437725952DNAL7 a10113/18042hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF9001 aSun, J.H.10aSurvey of phytophagous insects and foliar pathogens in China for a biocontrol perspective on kudzu, Pueraria montana var. lobata (Willd.)

Diseases of kudzu were also surveyed in southern China. A total of 116 phytophagous insect species in 31 families and 5 orders were collected from kudzu in China, in six feeding guilds: foliage, sap, stem, terminal, seed and root feeders. The impact of foliage feeders varied from site to site and year to year, and over the course of the growing season. The mean percent defoliation of kudzu over all plots and years was 13.3 +/- 1.9%, but ranged as high as 34%. Two insect species fed on shoots and clipped off terminals. Infestation of new shoots was high, with nearly half of all shoots clipped. Nearly half of the vines showed damage from stem borers, again varying through the season. Two species of insects attacked kudzu roots, mainly the cerambycid beetle Paraleprodera diophthalma (Pascoe), which caused considerable damage to both small (young, <3.4 cm diameter) and large (older, >6 cm diameter) roots. Insects also caused substantial seed damage. Imitation rust, caused by Synchytrium minutum = S. puerariae (P. Henning) Miyabe, was the most commonly observed disease of kudzu. Several of these species have potential as biological control agents for kudzu in the US. 3aweed control 3aPueraria montana var. lobata 3aphytophagous insects 3abiological control agents 3asurveys 3afoliar diseases 3aspecies diversity 3afeeding behavior 3adefoliation 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3ainvasive species 3anatural enemies 3aChina 0ainvasive weeds 0afeeding guilds 0aplant damage1 aLiu, Z.D.1 aBritton, K.O.1 aCai, P.1 aOrr, D.1 aHough-Goldstein, J.0 tBiological control.g2006 Jan., v.  36, no.  1 p.22-31x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/18043Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/03/20  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03031naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092024002100126040001800147072000900165072000900174100001300183245011500196300001600311500002400327520153200351650002601883650002101909650001001930650002301940650002701963650001101990650003002001650002802031650001402059650001702073650002002090650002902110650003202139700002502171773006402196852000902260856011202269856008402381930003302465945002502498946001302523961001302536655001202549IND4448688720221119041233.0110203e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444868872DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-04-10-01192doi7 a10113/501382hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF2001 aChen, Yu10aPhenotypic Characterization of Potato Late Blight Resistance Mediated by the Broad-Spectrum Resistance Gene RB  ap. 263-270.  aIncludes references  aThe potato gene RB, cloned from the wild potato species Solanum bulbocastanum, confers partial resistance to late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans. In order to better characterize this partial resistance phenotype, we have compared host resistance responses mediated by RB with those mediated by the S. demissum-derived R gene R9, which confers immunity to P. infestans carrying the corresponding avirulence gene avrR9. We found that both RB and R9 genes were capable of eliciting a hypersensitive cell death response (HR). However, in RB plants, the pathogen escaped HR lesions and continued to grow beyond the inoculation sites. We also found that callose deposition was negatively correlated with resistance levels in tested plants. Transcription patterns of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes PR-1 basic, PR-2 acidic, and PR-5 indicated that P. infestans inoculation induced transcription of these defense-related genes regardless of the host genotype; however, transcription was reduced in both the susceptible and partially resistant plants later in the infection process but remained elevated in the immune host. Most interestingly, transcription of the HRassociated gene Hin1 was suppressed in both Katahdin and RB-transgenic Katahdin but not in R9 4 days after inoculation. Together, this suggests that suppression of certain defense-related genes may allow P. infestans to spread beyond the site of infection in the partially resistant host despite elicitation of hypersensitive cell death. 3aSolanum bulbocastanum 3aSolanum demissum 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3aPhytophthora infestans 3ablight 3afungal diseases of plants 3ahypersensitive response 3aphenotype 3apathogenesis 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3ahost-pathogen relationships1 aHalterman, Dennis A.0 tPhytopathology.g2011 Feb., v.  101, no.  2 p.263-2707nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/501383Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-04-10-01193Available from publisher's Web site  a20110915b20111007c00000000  aINDdRHFe2011/09/15  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02485naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100002000140245013200160300001600292500002400308520124600332650003101578650001901609650001901628650001201647650002301659650002001682650002001702650001101722650001601733650002201749651001301771773008801784856011201872930003301984945002502017946001102042961001302053852000902066655001202075IND4439868020221119003059.0100714s2007    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443986802DNAL7 a10113/438972hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aBunce, James A.10aEffects of elevated carbon dioxide on photosynthesis and productivity of alfalfa in relation to seasonal changes in temperature  ap. 243-252.  aIncludes references  aAlfalfa was grown at ambient and elevated (ambient + 350 ppm) carbon dioxide concentrations at Beltsville, Maryland, using open top chambers in field plots. Periodic harvests and measurements of leaf photosynthesis were used to test the hypothesis that the stimulation of yield and photosynthesis by elevated carbon dioxide would increase with temperature. There was no correlation between the relative or the absolute stimulation of yield at elevated carbon dioxide and the mean temperature during the re-growth interval. Short-term elevation of carbon dioxide for leaves of ambient-grown plants at different times of year increased their photosynthesis by an average of 1.5 fold, but there was no significant correlation between the relative stimulation of photosynthesis and temperature. Measurements of effects of short-term temperature treatments on the photosynthetic response to carbon dioxide showed that, unusually, photosynthetic rates measured at elevated carbon dioxide were not limited by carboxylation capacity but by maximum rates of electron transport. The limitation of photosynthesis by maximum electron transport rates caused the lack of temperature effects on the stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated carbon dioxide. 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3acarbon dioxide 3aphotosynthesis 3aalfalfa 3aseasonal variation 3aMedicago sativa 3agrowth chambers 3aleaves 3atemperature 3aelectron transfer 3aMaryland0 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2007, v.  13, no.  3-4 p.243-2527nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/438973Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101014b20101108c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/10/14  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092024002100126040001800147072000900165072000900174100001900183245014600202300001600348500002400364520123400388650001101622650001001633650001201643650000701655650001501662650002501677650001701702650001701719650001501736650002101751653001601772700001801788700002301806773007201829852000901901856008401910856011201994930003302106945002502139946001302164961001302177655001202190IND4448991820221119040540.0110208e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444899182DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM-04-10-00592doi7 a10113/501412hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aRose, Devin J.10aInfluence of jet cooking and pH on extraction and molecular weight of Î²-glucan and arabinoxylan from barley (Hordeum vulgare Prowashonupana)  ap. 607-611.  aIncludes references  aFood processing conditions may affect the extractability and molecular weight of Î²-glucans and arabinoxylans in cereal products. This can dramatically affect the functional and physiological properties of the final products. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to explore the effects of jet cooking on the content, extractability, and molecular weights of these polymers in barley flour from a high Î²-glucan, waxy barley genotype, Prowashonupana. Barley flours were jet cooked without pH adjustment or after adjusting to pH 7, 9, or 11. Jet cooking without pH adjustment increased the extractability of Î²-glucans from 15.4 to 38.0% when extracted with water at 30Â°C. As pH during jet cooking increased, the extractability further increased to 63.5% at pH 11. Arabinoxylan extractability was only substantially affected when the pH of jet cooking was alkaline (extractability increased from 11.4 to 48.5% when jet cooked at pH 11). Jet cooking without pH adjustment resulted in slight increases in peak molecular weights for both polymers (Î²-glucan increased from 420,000 to 443,000; arabinoxylan increased from 119,000 to 125,000); higher pH values during jet cooking resulted in minor decrease in molecular weights. 3abarley 3aflour 3acooking 3apH 3aalkalinity 3acarbohydrate content 3aarabinoxylan 3abeta-glucans 3aextraction 3amolecular weight 0ajet cooking1 aKim, Sanghoon1 aInglett, George E.0 tCereal chemistry.g2010 , v.  87, no.  6 p.607-611x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM-04-10-00593Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/501413Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110915b20111007c00000000  aINDdRHFe2011/09/15  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02630naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024001900127024002100146040001800167072000900185072000900194072000900203100001600212245009200228300001600320500002400336520077000360650001901130650001501149650001701164650002001181650002001201650001001221650002001231650002901251650005201280650002601332650001201358650003201370650002001402650004101422650003101463650005301494650005201547650002701599653005501626773009301681852000901774856011201783856008501895930003301980945002502013946001302038961001302051655001202064IND4384201820221121055057.0061010e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438420182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2006.04.0042doi7 a167377102pmid7 a10113/283802hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL830 0aL002 0aL2001 aEvans, J.D.10aBeepath: An ordered quantitative-PCR array for exploring honey bee immunity and disease  ap. 135-139.  aIncludes references  aHoney bees and other insects face many important parasites and pathogens against which they have evolved behavioral, morphological, physiological, and immune-based defenses.

It is shown that this array can accurately measure host and pathogen transcript abundance, providing a new tool for assessing the environmental and genetic components behind honey bee immunity. By using common platforms and chemistries (e.g., SYBR-Green intercalating dye), quantitative-PCR arrays such as the one described should have diverse uses in invertebrate pathology. 3aApis mellifera 3ahoney bees 3abee diseases 3aentomopathogens 3ainsect immunity 3agenes 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3amicroarray technology 2aAnimals 2aBeesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Insectxgeneticsximmunology. 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysisxmethods 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aimmune genesquantitative polymerase chain reaction0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2006 Oct., v.  93, no.  2 p.135-139x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/283803Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2006.04.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090425b20090508c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/10/18  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02893naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001500149245007600164300001600240500021900256500002400475520162900499650001702128650002102145650001002166650002502176650001902201653002302220773007302243852000902316856011202325930003302437945002502470946001102495961001302506655001202519IND4380801520221118181509.0060608e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438080152DNAL7 a10113/400202hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS2001 aWang, S.Y.10aAntioxidant capacity of berry crops, culinary herbs and medicinal herbs  ap. 461-473.  aPaper presented at the XXVI International Horticultural Congress on Asian Plants with Unique Horticultural Potential: Genetic Resources, Cultural Practices, and Utilization held August 11-17, 2002, Toronto, Canada.  aIncludes references  aHerbs and berry crops have been shown to contain high levels of antioxidant compounds. These antioxidants are capable of performing a number of functions including acting as free radical scavengers, peroxide decomposers, singlet and triplet oxygen quenchers, enzyme inhibitors, and synergists. The different antioxidant components found in herbs and berry crops provide protection against harmful free radicals and have been associated with lower incidence and mortality rates of cancer and heart disease, in addition to a number of other health benefits. Herbs have been used for many purposes including medicine, nutrition, flavourings, beverages, and industry. Since prehistoric times, herbs have been the basis for nearly all medicinal therapy until synthetic drugs were developed in the Nineteenth Century. Today herbs are still found in 40 percent of prescription drugs. Culinary herbs also have been grown and used for their ability to enhance and complement the flavours of a wide variety of foods. Even though a variety of herbs are known to be remarkable sources of phenolic compounds, data on the composition and antioxidant activities of herbs and berry crops are insufficient. We found herbs and berry crops to contain a number of healthful phytochemicals such as vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene, flavonoids, phenolic acids and are an effective and potential source of natural antioxidants. The results from this presentation will be useful to plant breeders, other researchers, and the general public who are interested in the antioxidant potentials of various herbs and berry crops as dietary supplements. 3asmall fruits 3amedicinal plants 3aherbs 3aantioxidant activity 3aphytochemicals 0aliterature reviews0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Dec., , no. 620 p.461-473x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/400203Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100331b20100403c00000000  aINDdARSe2006/06/30  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02450naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001700149245006900166300001400235500002400249520115200273650000901425650001501434650001801449650001701467650001201484650002101496650001901517650001701536650001501553651001201568653002501580700001901605700001701624700002201641700002201663773008801685852000901773856011201782930003301894945002501927946001301952961001501965655001201980IND4458084620221122093156.0110519s2010    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND445808462DNAL7 a10113/493662hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL820 0aP0101 aWitmer, Gary10aChallenges and Unique Solutions to Rodent Eradication in Florida  ap. 23-28.  aIncludes references  aOnce established, invasive rodents cause significant impacts to island flora and fauna, including species extinctions. There have been numerous efforts to eradicate invasive rodents from islands worldwide, with many successes. For a number of reasons, many invasive vertebrates have become established in Florida, including several rodent species. We have implemented rodent eradication efforts on two Florida islands. Using the successful eradication strategy developed for Buck Island, U.S. Virgin Islands, we have attempted the eradication of roof rats from Egmont Key off Tampa Bay. We also are attempting to eradicate Gambian giant pouched rats from Grassy Key in the Florida Keys. On Egmont Key, we used a grid of bait stations containing diphacinone rodenticide bait blocks and hand tossing of bait blocks into thickets. On Grassy Key, we used a grid of bait stations containing a zinc phosphide bait along with intensive live-trapping. We discuss the eradication planning, efforts to minimize nontarget animal losses, and follow-up activities. We also discuss some of the difficulties encountered in each of these two different situations. 3arats 3aCricetomys 3aRattus rattus 3apest control 3aislands 3ainvasive species 3azinc phosphide 3arodenticides 3abait traps 3aFlorida 0aCricetomys gambianus1 aEisemann, John1 aHall, Parker1 aAvery, Michael L.1 aDuffiney, Anthony0 tProceedings - Vertebrate Pest Conference.g2010, , no.  24 p.23-28x0507-67737nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/493663Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110718b20110805c00000000  aINDdGAYe2011/07/18  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle03090naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001500177245013500192300001800327500002400345500001500369520184500384650001902229650002802248650001402276650001202290650002102302653001702323700001602340700001802356773010102374852000902475856011202484930003302596945001302629946001302642961001302655655001202668IND2043036920221119155638.0941103e199410  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204303692DNAL7 a163494152pmid7 a10113/253002hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX300 0aF600 0aP1201 aSaha, B.C.10aProduction, purification, and properties of a thermostable beta-glucosidase from a color variant strain of Aureobasidium pullulans  ap. 3774-3780.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA color variant strain of Aureobasidium pullulans (NRRL Y-12974) produced beta-glucosidase activity when grown in liquid culture on a variety of carbon sources, such as cellobiose, xylose, arabinose, lactose, sucrose, maltose, glucose, xylitol, xylan, cellulose, starch, and pullulan. An extracellular beta-glucosidase was purified 129-fold to homogeneity from the cell-free culture broth of the organism grown on corn bran. The purification protocol included ammonium sulfate treatment, CM Bio-Gel A agarose column chromatography, and gel filtrations on Bio-Gel A-0.5m and Sephacryl S-200. The beta-glucosidase was a glycoprotein with native molecular weight of 340,000 and was composed of two subunits with molecular weights of about 165,000. The enzyme displayed optimal activity at 75 degrees C and pH 4.5 and had a specific activity of 315 micromoles.min-1.mg of protein-1 under these conditions. The purified beta-glucosidase was active against p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside, cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose, cellohexaose, and celloheptaose, with Km values of 1.17, 1.00, 0.34, 0.36, 0.64, 0.68, and 1.65 mM, respectively. The enzyme activity was competitively inhibited by glucose (Ki = 5.65 mM), while fructose, arabinose, galactose, mannose, and xylose (each at 56 mM) and sucrose and lactose (each at 29 mM) were not inhibitory. The enzyme did not require a metal ion for activity, and its activity was not affected by p-chloromercuribenzoate (0.2 mM), EDTA (10 mM), or dithiothreitol (10 mM). Ethanol (7.5%, vol/vol) stimulated the initial enzyme activity by 15%. Glucose production was enhanced by 7.9% when microcrystalline cellulose (2%, wt/vol) was treated for 48 h with a commercial cellulase preparation (5 U/ml) that was supplemented with the purified beta-glucosidase (0.21 U/ml) from A. pullulans. 3alignocellulose 3aAureobasidium pullulans 3acellulose 3abiomass 3abeta-glucosidase 0apurification1 aFreer, S.N.1 aBothast, R.J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 Oct., v.  60, no.  10 p.3774-3780x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/253003Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03897naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111024002100151040001800172072000900190072000900199100002100208245017400229300001600403500002400419500001500443520130400458650002601762650002201788650002001810650001801830650001101848650002001859650002101879650002401900650001201924650003001936650001001966650004401976650002202020650001202042650001602054650001502070650006002085650002402145650005702169650007102226650002302297650002202320650002802342650001402370650003802384650002502422650005102447650002702498650003402525650004502559653002202604653003402626700002602660700002602686700002802712773010402740852000902844856009002853856011202943930003303055945002503088946001303113961001303126655001203139IND4439273920221118230850.0100701e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443927392DNAL7 a193857052pmid7 a10.1080/07391102.2009.105072892doi7 a10113/439002hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX320 0aX3401 aSujatha, Kabilan10aSequence analysis, structure prediction, and functional validation of phaC1/phaC2 genes of Pseudomonas sp.

PHA synthase is responsible for catalyzing the formation of Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), but its structural information is limited. Hence, this study focuses to predict 3D model for phaC1 and phaC2 genes of field-soil strain Pseudomonas sp. LDC-25 and to validate the functional properties through in vitro studies. The phaC1/phaC2 genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The sequence analysis showed > 90% homology to phaC loci and presence of alpha/beta hydrolase fold, but phaC2 loci of LDC-25 exhibits variation in the conserved residue (Ser is replaced by Ala). Threading approach demonstrated that Carboxylesterase (d1tqha) can be used as the modeling template. The predicted models showed the presence of conserved residues at 122 (G), 205 (S), and 236 (S). In vitro studies also supported that PHA accumulation ability was less in Pseudomonas sp. LDC-25 compared to other field isolate, Pseudomonas sp. LDC-5. FT-IR spectrum showed PHA specific peaks at 1735.62 cm(-1). Results of this study would help to detect the functional domains of the protein in order to elucidate their structure/function characteristics with special emphasis on invariant conserved residues. 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3asequence analysis 3aprotein folding 3asoil bacteria 3aserine 3abioaccumulation 3acarboxylesterase 3aconserved sequences 3aalanine 3apolymerase chain reaction 3agenes 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3amolecular cloning 3astrains 3aPseudomonas 3aprediction 2aAcyltransferasesxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCarboxylic Ester Hydrolasesxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolyhydroxyalkanoatesxmetabolism 2aProtein Conformation 2aPseudomonasxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 0aprotein structure 0apolyhydroxyalkanoate synthase1 aMahalakshmi, Ayyasamy1 aSolaiman, Daniel K.Y.1 aShenbagarathai, Rajaiah0 tJournal of biomolecular structure & dynamics.g2009 June, v.  26, no.  6 p.771-779x0739-11027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2009.105072893Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/439003Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101014b20101108c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/10/08  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01784naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001700149245008300166300001600249500011800265500002400383500001500407520060100422650001401023650001501037650001901052653001601071700002001087700001301107773007401120852000901194856011201203930003301315945002501348946001301373961001201386655001201398IND4384569320221119163252.0061020e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438456932DNAL7 a10113/365812hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK250 0aX1001 aFinley, A.O.10aApplying an Efficient k-Nearest Neighbor Search to Forest Attribute Imputation  ap. 130-135.  aIn the special issue: Hot Springs Conference on Forest Growth and Yield / edited by C.J.

The search algorithm can be easily incorporated into routines that optimize feature subsets or weights, values of k, distance decomposition coefficients, and mapping. 3aequations 3aalgorithms 3aforest surveys 0amethodology1 aMcRoberts, R.E.1 aEk, A.R.0 tForest science.g2006 Apr., v.  52, no.  2 p.130-135x0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/365813Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091209b20100101c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/12/12  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle04696naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002000134040001800154072000900172072000900181100001800190245014400208300001600352500016600368500002400534500001500558520269000573650001203263650002703275650001303302650001003315650003103325650003603356650001503392650001403407650002203421650002303443650001603466650002103482650001803503650002003521650001903541650004403560650001303604653003303617653001903650653002803669700001603697773009903713852000903812856011103821856009203932930003304024945002504057946001104082961001304093655001204106IND4396139120221120180132.0071019e20071001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439613912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2007.06.0022doi7 a10113/88482hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aR200 0aL8101 aMorgavi, D.P.13aAn historical overview of field disease outbreaks known or suspected to be caused by consumption of feeds contaminated with Fusarium toxins  ap. 201-212.  aIn the special issue: Fusarium and their toxins: Mycology, occurrence, toxicity, control and economic impact / edited by D.P.

Today, mycotoxins and mouldy feedstuffs are known causes of animal disease. Symptoms are often subtle and there can be many equally non-definitive contributing factors; for example, environmental stress, exposure to multiple mycotoxins and infectious agents, and nutrient/vitamin deficiencies. Thus, it is often difficult to establish cause-effect relationships with contaminated feedstuffs. The Fusarium toxins of greatest concern are deoxynivalenol (DON), fumonisins, and zearalenone. For each, mould-contaminated feed was implicated as the cause of animal disease long before the toxins were identified. In the field, changes in performance or behaviour and increased susceptibility to infectious disease are possible subtle signs of exposure to mycotoxins in feed. Because most cases of toxicity present non-specific clinical signs, cases of suspected mycotoxicosis often remain unreported. Nonetheless, for DON, fumonisin and zearalenone there are signs that are highly suggestive of exposure. For DON a commonly observed effect is feed refusal which has been reported in cattle, pigs and chickens; however, pigs appear to be the most sensitive. Although DON is not considered to be acutely toxic to farm animals, it is considered to be a major cause of economic loss due to reduced performance. In pigs, the reduction in feed intake occurs relatively soon after consuming feeds containing greater than 1 mg deoxynivalenol/kg and emesis at >10 mg/kg. Field outbreaks of mouldy maize-induced equine leukoencephalomalacia (ELEM) have been reported since 1891 and in 1988 pure fumonisin was shown to produce ELEM in a horse. ELEM syndrome is a fatal disease that apparently occurs only in equids. The length of exposure, level of contamination, individual animal differences, previous exposure, or pre-existing liver impairment may all contribute to the appearance of the clinical disease. Analysis of feeds from confirmed cases of ELEM indicates fumonisin B1 concentration greater than 10 mg/kg in the diet is associated with increased risk of ELEM. Another disease caused by fumonisin is porcine pulmonary edema syndrome. Zearalenone has been implicated in field outbreaks of reproductive problems, vulvovaginitis and anestrus in pigs. The primary effect of zearalenone is estrogenic and prepubertal female pigs are the most affected animal. The history of discovery of mycotoxin involvement in animal diseases serves as a warning that yet to be discovered mycotoxins could also be involved in current or future inexplicable animal production problems. 3ahistory 3areproductive disorders 3aetiology 3afeeds 3arespiratory tract diseases 3acentral nervous system diseases 3aaflatoxins 3alivestock 3adisease outbreaks 3afeed contamination 3azearalenone 3afeeding behavior 3aaflatoxicosis 3aanimal diseases 3adeoxynivalenol 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aFusarium 0aequine leukoencephalomalacia 0atrichothecenes 0aporcine pulmonary edema1 aRiley, R.T.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2007 Oct. 1, v.  137, no.  3-4 p.201-212x0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/88483Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2007.06.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080115b20080202c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/12/20  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04496naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003400117024002500151024004100176024002300217040001800240100002200258245014800280520276900428650003103197650001303228650002203241650001503263650001003278650003403288650001303322650002703335650001403362650001403376650002503390650002503415650003303440650001303473650001003486651001303496700002103509700003303530700002203563700002103585700006303606700002003669700002203689773009003711856008403801856004503885961001503930852000903945655001203954IND60770955520221122092031.0220321e20210924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077095552DNAL7 a10113/77095552hdl7 a10.3389/fpls.2021.6713232doi7 a4326242aris_accn_no7 a5020-21220-019-000D2aris_project_no7 a3829172seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMekonnen, Tilahun10aGenome-Wide Association Study reveals novel genetic loci for quantitative resistance to Septoria tritici blotch in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)  aSeptoria tritici blotch (STB) caused by the fungus Zymoseptoria titici poses serious and persistent challenges to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivation in Ethiopia and elsewhere in the world. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) is a promising and widely used technique to decipher genomic loci underlying phenotypic traits of interest. The present study was targeted to elucidate the population structure, linkage disequilibrium (LD), and genomic architecture of STB resistance in an association panel of 178 bread wheat accessions using 7,776 genome-wide scanned DArTSeq Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Moreover, the relations of STB resistance with other agronomic traits were explored. The association panel was phenotyped for STB resistance, phenology, yield and yield-related traits at three locations (Holetta, Kulumsa and Bekoji) in 2015 and 2016 growing seasons. Marker-trait associations were calculated using a FarmCPU algorithm implemented in GAPIT. The genotypes exhibited significant genetic variations to STB infestation with broad-sense heritabilities of 0.58 - 0.97 and 0.72 - 0.81 at individual and across environment levels, respectively, suggesting the presence of STB resistance alleles in the association panel with great possibility to improve the trait through selection. Population structure analysis detected two sub-groups (delta K = 2) with greater degree of genetic admixture. Principal component analysis also confirmed population stratification where the first two PCs captured the highest (65%) proportion of the total variance. LD analysis in 338,125 marker pairs confirmed the existence of significant (p = 0.01) linkage between 27.6% marker pairs. In all chromosomes, LD between SNPs declined within 2.26 - 105.62 Mbp, with an overall mean of 31.44 Mbp. GWAS identified 53 loci that were significantly (FDR <0.05) associated with STB resistance pointing to 33 putative QTL. Most of these putative QTL had a similar map position with already published Septoria resistance genes and QTL. However, 10 of the putative resistance loci did not overlap with previously published genes, and hence could be considered as novel. The identified marker-trait associations (MTAs) explained 2.7 - 13.2 % of the total phenotypic variation. Seven of the MTAs for agronomic traits co-mapped with putative QTL for Septoria resistance. Therefore, the present analysis discovered genomic loci underlying STB resistance and important agronomic traits in bread wheat that could be helpful for marker assisted selection in wheat breeding programs. The finding provides new insight into the phenotype-to-genotype relationships for in bread wheat in Africa where the application of high- throughput molecular tools in plant breading is rare. 3aMycosphaerella graminicola 3aSeptoria 3aTriticum aestivum 3aalgorithms 3afungi 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aphenology 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3apopulation structure 3aprincipal component analysis 3avariance 3awheat 3aEthiopia1 aSneller, Clay H.1 aHaileselassie, Teklehaimanot1 aZiyomo, Catherine1 aBekele, Abeyo G.1 aGoodwin, Stephen B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5708-97291 aLule, Dagnachew1 aTesfaye, Kassahun0 tFrontiers in plant science.g2021  24, v. 12 p.671323-wJournal:2199x1664-462X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.6713233Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7709555  aUSDAbUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03716naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196100002000205245011700225300001600342500002400358500001500382520157800397650001201975650002801987650002102015650001602036650002702052650002202079650003202101650001402133650002302147650002102170650002102191650002502212650002102237650001202258650002002270650001902290650001602309650002502325650001502350653001702365653001702382653001602399653003802415653002202453653002702475700002002502700002502522700002302547700002102570700002402591773009902615852000902714856011202723856008802835930003302923945002502956946001102981961001402992655001203006IND4409862020221117074104.0080905e20081015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440986202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.03.0052doi7 a10113/196062hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aL832 0aQ2031 aGolden, Neal J.10aReview of induced molting by feed removal and contamination of eggs with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis  ap. 215-228.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aAs laying hens age, egg production and quality decreases. Egg producers can impose an induced molt on older hens that results in increased egg productivity and decreased hen mortality compared with non-molted hens of the same age. This review discusses the effect of induced molting by feed removal on immune parameters, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE) invasion and subsequent production of SE-contaminated eggs. Experimental oral infections with SE show molted hens are more susceptible to SE infection and produce more SE-contaminated eggs in the first few weeks post-molt compared with pre-molt egg production. In addition, it appears that molted hens are more likely to disseminate SE into their environment. Molted hens are more susceptible to SE infection by contact exposure to experimentally infected hens; thus, transmission of SE among molted hens could be more rapid than non-molted birds. Histological examination of the gastrointestinal tracts of molted SE-infected hens revealed more frequent and severe intestinal mucosal lesions compared with non-molted SE-infected hens. These data suggest that induced molting by feed deprivation alters the normal asymptomatic host-pathogen relationship. Published data suggest the highest proportion of SE-positive eggs is produced within 1-5 weeks post-molt and decreases sharply by 6-10 weeks and dissipates to the background level for non-molted hens by 11-20 weeks. Appropriate treatment measures of eggs produced in the fist 5 weeks post-molting may decrease the risk of foodborne infections to humans. 3aelderly 3abacterial contamination 3alesions (animal) 3alaying hens 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aimmunosuppression 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ahistology 3afood contamination 3apoultry diseases 3afeed deprivation 3adisease transmission 3adisease severity 3amolting 3aimmune response 3aegg production 3ahen feeding 3abacterial infections 3astarvation 0aproductivity 0afeed removal 0aold animals 0aimmunosuppression (physiological) 0aegg contamination 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aMarks, Harry H.1 aColeman, Margaret E.1 aSchroeder, Carl M.1 aBauer, Nathan E.1 aSchlosser, Wayne D.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2008 Oct. 15, v.  131, no.  3-4 p.215-228dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/196063Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.03.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20081002b20081101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/10/02  aNon-US  aUSDA/FSIS 7aarticle02639naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100001700157245015300174300001600327500002400343520114100367650002301508650001101531650001301542650002101555650002501576650002501601650001401626650003501640650002001675650002901695650002001724650001201744650001301756653003201769653003301801700001901834700001601853773006001869852000901929856011101938930003302049945002502082946001302107961001302120655001202133IND4373158120080301044500.0050810s2005    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND437315812DNAL7 a10113/96232hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL200 0aL0011 aCoates, B.S.10aTwo differentially expressed ommochrome-binding protein-like genes (obp1 and obp2) in larval fat body of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis  ap. 459-473.  aIncludes references  aOmmochrome-binding proteins function in coloration and detoxification pathways by transporting tryptophan metabolites, and increase in hemolymph concentration prior to diapause. Two ommochrome-binding protein genes from the European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis (HÃ¼bner) (Onobp1 and Onobp2; GenBank accession nos. AY819651 to AY819655 and AY862870) were isolated. Relatedness to OBPencoding genes was suggested by peptide similarity, phylogenetic reconstruction, and expression data. 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms between obp1 and 23 polymorphisms between obp2 alleles were identified, and resultant genomic markers were inherited in a Mendelian fashion. RT-PCR showed fat body specific Onobp1 and Onobp2 transcription. The Onobp1 transcript was RT-PCR amplified from fat body of 5th instars, whereas Onobp2 was expressed in fat body of 4th and 5th instars, and peaked in 5th instar wandering and 1 week old diapausing larvae. Expression suggests gene duplicates are maintained by change in temporal expression.

This conversion appears to be inducible by (+/-)-geosmin and not by d-camphor. 3aRhodococcus (bacteria) 3acamphor 3ageosmin 3abiodegradation 3aoxidation 3abiotransformation 3astrains 3aPseudomonas 3aoff odors 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiotransformation 2aNaphtholsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aStereoisomerism 2aTerpenesxmetabolism 0aterpenoids 0aRhodococcus wratislaviensis1 aSandusky, Peter0 tBiodegradation.g2010 Feb., v.  21, no.  1 p.71-79dSpringer Netherlandsx0923-98207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10532-009-9282-y3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/438893Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101014b20101108c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/10/14  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02940naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002000120040001800140072000900158100002000167245009000187300001800277500002400295520147100319650002101790650002301811650003001834650002301864650001401887650001901901650001701920650001001937650001101947650002101958650001601979650002101995651001502016653001802031653002202049700001702071773007602088852000902164856007802173856011102251930003302362945002502395946001302420961001302433655001202446IND4378696520221119080300.0060313e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437869652DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-10972doi7 a10113/13182hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8321 aBaumgartner, K.10aPersistence of Xylella fastidiosa in riparian hosts near Northern California vineyard  ap. 1097-1102.  aIncludes references  aThe spread of Pierce's disease (PD) from riparian hosts to grapevines in California's north-coastal grape-growing region is a function of the proportion of Graphocephala atropunctata (blue-green sharpshooters [BGSSs]) that acquire Xylella fastidiosa from infected plant tissue. Riparian hosts that do not maintain sufficient 'X. fastidiosa populations for acquisition may not be significant inoculum reservoirs. We examined X. fastidiosa populations in systemically infected riparian hosts (California blackberry, California grapevine, elderberry, Himalayan blackberry, periwinkle) at two coastal locations (Mendocino and Napa) with two methods of quantitation (culturing and real-time polymerase chain reaction) from 2003 to 2004. In summer and autumn, X. fastidiosa populations were above the threshold for BGSS acquisition in periwinkle, Himalayan blackberry, and California grapevine at both locations. The only X. fastidiosa-positive plants detected in spring at both locations were periwinkle and Himalayan blackberry, suggesting that these species may contribute to long-term survival of X. fastidiosa. California blackberry and elderberry may not be important reservoirs of X. fastidiosa, given that very few plants of either species maintained infections. Higher X. fastidiosa populations in California grapevine, Himalayan blackberry, and periwinkle in Napa, relative to plants in Mendocino, may partially explain the higher PD incidence in Napa vineyards. 3aPierce's disease 3aXylella fastidiosa 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aseasonal variation 3avineyards 3aRubus plicatus 3ablackberries 3aVitis 3agrapes 3aSambucus cerulea 3aVinca major 3aRubus armeniacus 3aCalifornia 0aRubus ursinus 0aVitis californica1 aWarren, J.G.0 tPlant disease.g2005 Oct., v.  89, no.  10 p.1097-1102x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-10973Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/13183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070730b20070802c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/25  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02115naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002000149245006600169300001700235500001100252500001500263520063600278650002000914650001600934650002400950650001400974650002400988650002501012650002201037650002101059650002101080650001801101653002301119653003101142653002901173653002001202700001701222700001701239700001701256700001801273700001601291773007301307852000901380856011201389930003301501945002501534946001301559961001301572655001201585IND7900257920221119155616.0790307e197811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND790025792DNAL7 a10113/252932hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ124 0aQ5041 aHofreiter, B.T.10aNovel modification of cornstarch by immobilized alpha-amylase  ap. 995-1006.  a5 ref.  a2019-12-05  aLimited hydrolyses of cornstarch in 2 or 10% dispersions with resin-bound .alpha.-amylase (Bacillus subtilis) provided modified starches of high molecular weight in yields up to 93%, with a significantly reduced tendency to retrograde.

Wide spacing of furrows had very little effect, while wheel compaction reduced the average water intake during seasonal irrigation; tractor-wheel compaction from multiple field operations increased average dry soil bulk densities. Irrigated furrows were compacted as a separate tractor pass prior to the preplant irrigation, and effects remained through the growing season. The reduced water intake with furrow compaction did not affect corn grain yields. Alternating compacted and noncompacted furrows permits flexibility in irrigating for a range in water intake, depending on water use rates and profile soil water depletion. Irrigation of compacted furrows permits the use of a fixed pumping rate to irrigate a larger area by reducing profile drainage and increasing field application efficiency. 3afurrow irrigation 3asoil compaction 0awheel induced compaction 0awater intake1 aPringle, F.B.1 aJohnson, P.N.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1985 , v.  28, no.  2 p.502-506x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5213Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070626b20070702c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04307naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024001900127024002100146040001800167072000900185100001800194245015300212300001400365500002400379500001500403520213600418650002702554650002302581650002002604650001902624650001702643650003302660650002402693650001902717650002002736650002302756650001102779650001402790650002002804650001202824650001802836650003702854650003002891650001002921650005202931650002802983650001103011650003603022650002503058650003403083650001303117650003803130651001503168651002503183700001603208700001603224773009103240852000903331856011203340856008503452930003303537945002503570946001303595961001303608655001203621IND4384201220221121055129.0061010e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438420122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2006.04.0082doi7 a167747662pmid7 a10113/283762hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aArthurs, S.P.10aEvaluation of spray-dried lignin-based formulations and adjuvants as solar protectants for the granulovirus of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L)  ap. 88-95.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aCommercial formulations of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., granulovirus (CpGV) are limited by their short residual activity under orchard conditions in the Pacific Northwest. We evaluated spray-dried lignin-encapsulated formulations of CpGV for improved solar stability based on laboratory bioassays with a solar simulator and in field tests in an infested apple orchard. In laboratory tests, aqueous lignin formulations containing a high dosage of 3 x 10(10) occlusion bodies (OB)/L, with and without the additives titanium dioxide (TiO2) and sugar, provided significant solar protection of virus, i.e., mortality of codling moth exposed to lignin formulations that had been irradiated with 9.36 x 10(6) joules/m2 was 92-94%, compared with 66-67% from a glycerin-stabilized product (Cyd-XÂ®) or suspension of pure unformulated virus at the same rates. By comparison, a lower dosage of the lignin formulation (3 x 10(8) OB/L) did not provide significant solar protection. Equivalent dosage-dependent patterns in solar protection were observed in further tests with the lignin formulation, when an intermediate (3 x 10(9) OB/L) as well as the low dosage provided no solar protection. Equivalent rates of a blank lignin formulation (containing no virus) did not affect larval mortality, suggesting a protective effect of the lignin on the virus at the high rate. The use of several spray adjuvants, 'NuFilm-17Â®' and 'Organic BiolinkÂ®' (sticker-spreaders at 0.06% v/v), 'RaynoxÂ®' (sunburn protectant at 5% v/v), and 'TrilogyÂ®'(neem oil at 1% v/v) did not provide solar protection of a commercial CpGV preparation in laboratory tests. In season long orchard tests (Golden Delicious), the lignin formulation of CpGV applied at 6.57 x 10(12) OB/ha did not significantly improve control of codling moth or protection of fruit compared with Cyd-X at equivalent rates. Our studies show that lignin-based CpGV formulations provided solar protection at relatively high virus dosages. The testing of lignin formulations containing reduced virus concentrations may allow virus solar protection to be achieved at more economical rates. 3apesticide formulations 3aviral insecticides 3asolar radiation 3ainsect control 3aspray drying 3aCydia pomonella granulovirus 3apesticide adjuvants 3aphotostability 3aMalus domestica 3amicroencapsulation 3alignin 3amortality 3aCydia pomonella 2aAnimals 2aCarbohydrates 2aDisease Susceptibilityxvirology 2aDrug Compoundingxmethods 2aFruit 2aGranulovirusxpathogenicityxradiation effects. 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aLignin 2aMothsxpathogenicityxvirology. 2aPesticidesxtoxicity 2aRadiation Protectionxmethods 2aTitanium 2aUltraviolet Raysxadverse effects 0aWashington 0aNorthwestern States.1 aLacey, L.A.1 aBehle, R.W.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2006 Oct., v.  93, no.  2 p.88-95x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/283763Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2006.04.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090425b20090508c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/10/18  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02470naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072000900162100001500171245012300186300001800309500001200327520089400339650002001233650002201253650002201275650001301297650001801310650002301328650002801351650001301379650001401392650002501406650001901431650001701450650001601467650001601483650001301499653002601512700001701538700001901555773009201574852000901666856008101675856011201756930003301868945002501901946001301926961001301939655001201952IND8302737420221121055225.0830325e198212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND830273742DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/75.6.10932doi7 a10113/283772hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aReed, D.K.10aInsecticidal and antifeedant activity of neriifolin against codling moth, striped cucumber beetle, and Japanese beetle  ap. 1093-1097.  a11 ref.  aIn laboratory and greenhouse studies in the USA, neriifolin, a known cardiotonic glycoside isolated from seeds of yellow oleander (Thevetia thevetioides) acted as both a toxicant and feeding deterrent to Acalymma vittatum (F.).

Utilizing the knowledge and experience of local communities within national forests could better ameliorate forest ecosystems and provide proper management of these forest. 3anational forests 3aforest products industry 3alogging 3aUSDA Forest Service 3anatural resource management 3aUnited States1 aBrown, H.0 tJournal of forestry.g2007 , v.  105, no.  5 p.271-273x0022-12017nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/75053Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071205b20080102c00000000  aINDdARSe2007/09/27  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03040naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001600158245010600174300001600280500002400296500001500320520157100335650002201906650002201928650001301950650002101963650002101984650001502005650001902020650003002039650003402069650002402103651002902127653002402156653003002180653001502210700001702225700001702242773007002259852000902329856011202338930003302450945002502483946001302508961001302521655001202534IND4410551120221120144001.0080923e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441055112DNAL7 a10113/195972hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP210 0aW000 0aX1001 aThorp, K.R.10aSimulating the Long-Term Performance of Drainage Water Management Across the Midwestern United States  ap. 961-976.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aDrainage water management (DWM) has been proposed as a solution to reduce losses of nitrate (NO3) from subsurface drainage systems in the midwestern U.S.; however, tests of DWM efficacy have only been performed over short time periods and at a limited number of sites. To fill this gap, the RZWQM-DSSAT hybrid model, previously evaluated for a subsurface-drained agricultural system in Iowa, was used to simulate both conventional drainage (CVD) and DWM over 25 years of historical weather at 48 locations across the midwestern U.S. Model simulations were used to demonstrate how variability in both climate and management practices across the region affects the ability of DWM to reduce losses of NO3 in subsurface drainage. The regional average simulated reduction in drain flow was 151 mm yr-1 when using DWM instead of CVD, and the regional percent reduction over the long term was 53%. Reductions in drain flow were offset mainly by increases in surface runoff and evapotranspiration. Similarly for nitrogen (N), the regional average simulated reduction in NO 3 losses through subsurface drains was 18.9 kg N ha -1 yr -1 , and the regional percent reduction over the long term was 51%. Subsurface drain NO3 loss reductions were counterbalanced mainly by increases in stored soil N, denitrification, and plant N uptake. The simulations suggest that if DWM can be practically implemented throughout the region, particularly in the southern states, then substantial reductions in the amount of NO3 entering surface waters from agricultural systems can be expected. 3asimulation models 3apollution control 3anitrogen 3awater management 3anitrate nitrogen 3awater flow 3adrainage water 3anonpoint source pollution 3aRoot Zone Water Quality Model 3asubsurface drainage 3aMidwestern United States 0amathematical models 0adrainage water management 0adrain flow1 aJaynes, D.B.1 aMalone, R.W.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2008 , v.  51, no.  3 p.961-9767nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/195973Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081001b20081011c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/10/01  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02560naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130100001600139245015000155300001800305500002400323520112500347650002501472650002401497650002301521650002501544650001901569650002201588650001501610650001301625650001701638650002001655650001701675650000901692650001301701651001501714653003501729653003101764700001701795773006201812852000901874856011101883930003301994945002502027946001302052961001302065655001202078IND4366650920221118144604.0050114s2004    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436665092DNAL7 a10113/96122hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aBurks, C.S.10aSeasonal abundance of the navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella, in figs and the effect of peripheral aerosol dispensers on sexual communication  ap. 7173-7178.  aIncludes references  aWe used flight traps baited with unmated female navel orangeworm Amyelois transitella (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) to examine, over two growing seasons, seasonal changes in the abundance of males in fig orchards and the impact of release of 48 mg per ha per day of the pheromone component (Z,Z)-11,13-hexadecadienal from peripherally-located timed-release dispensers on the ability of males to find unmated females within 16-ha treatment plots. Material was placed out and mating disruption was commenced at the beginning of April in the first year, and at the beginning of July the second year. This technique effectively prevented males from finding females in female-baited traps placed throughout the plot. Navel orangeworm abundance was high in figs during the first and third flight, but lower in June and July during the second flight. Since Calimyrna figs are not susceptible to attack by navel orangeworm until mid-to-late July, these findings suggest that materials cost can be reduced by beginning treatment later. Implications for insect pest management in figs and other California crops are discussed. 3aAmyelois transitella 3apopulation dynamics 3aseasonal variation 3ainsect communication 3asex pheromones 3amating disruption 3adispensers 3atrapping 3ainsect traps 3apest monitoring 3aFicus carica 3afigs 3aorchards 3aCalifornia 0apheromone timed-release system 0afemale-baited flight traps1 aBrandl, D.G.0 tJournal of insect science.g2004, v.  4 p.7173-71787nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/96123Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20111103b20111202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/02/18  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03480naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100001800157245017400175300001800349500002400367500001500391520182800406650001602234650001302250650000902263650002702272650002102299650001602320650003302336650002802369650002302397650002202420650002502442650002002467651001002487651001502497653002102512653003402533653002402567653003402591700001602625700001902641773006202660852000902722856011102731930003302842945002502875946001302900961001302913655001202926IND4366651020221118145215.0050114s2004    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436665102DNAL7 a10113/96132hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL200 0aL0011 ade Leon, J.H.10aMolecular distinction between populations of Gonatocerus morrilli, egg parasitoids of the glassy-winged sharpshooter from Texas and California: Do cryptic species exist?  ap. 2977-2986.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTwo molecular methods were utilized to distinguish geographic populations of Gonatocerus morrilli (Howard) from Texas and California and to test the possibility that this species could exist as a species-complex. Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat-Polymerase Chain Reactions (ISSR-PCR) were performed with a 5'-anchored ISSR primer. Twenty-five markers were generated with four populations (40 individuals) of G. morrilli. Twenty-three were polymorphic and the percentage of polymorphic loci was 92%. Most markers could be considered diagnostic since there was no band sharing between the Texas and California populations. Such differences typically are not found unless the populations are reproductively isolated. Exact tests for population differentiation indicated significant differences in marker frequencies among the populations. Comparison of other genetic differentiation estimates, which evaluate the degree of genetic subdivision, demonstrated excellent agreement between GST and Î¸ values, 0.92 and 0.94, respectively, indicating that about 92 to 94% of the variance was distributed among populations. The average genetic divergence (D), as measured by genetic distance, was extremely high (Nei = 0.82 and Reynolds = 2.79). A dendrogram based on Nei's genetic distance separated the Texas and California populations into two clusters, respectively. Amplification of the Internal Transcribed Spacer-1 (ITS-1) region showed no size differences, whereas the ITS-2 DNA fragment varied in size between the two geographic populations. The ITS-2 fragment sizes were about 865 and 1099 base pairs for the California and Texas populations, respectively. The present study using the two molecular methods provides novel data critical to the glassy-winged sharpshooter/Pierce's disease biological control program in California. 3aparasitoids 3ataxonomy 3aloci 3ageographical variation 3agenetic distance 3aGonatocerus 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aHomalodisca vitripennis 3aDNA fingerprinting 3agenetic variation 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3aTexas 3aCalifornia 0apolymorphic loci 0ainternal transcribed spacer-2 0apopulation genetics 0ainternal transcribed spacer-11 aJones, W.A.1 aMorgan, D.J.W.0 tJournal of insect science.g2004, v.  4 p.2977-29867nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/96133Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20111103b20111202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/02/18  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02399naa a2200541 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001700099024002100116040001800137072000900155100001800164245007600182300001800258500002500276500001500301520081900316650001801135650001601153650003101169650001301200650001701213650002001230650002001250650002201270650001301292650001901305650002901324650001601353650001301369650002301382650001301405650003501418653002601453653001701479700001601496700001401512700001601526773009801542852000901640856011201649930003301761945002501794946001301819961001301832655001201845991622144970742620221118005340.0770101s19761010xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7691139292DNAL7 a8231562pmid7 a10113/296642hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aLagocki, J.W.10aKinetic analysis of the action of soybean lipoxygenase on linoleic acid  ap. 6001-6006.  aIncludes references.  a2019-12-05  aThe time course of the soybean lipoxygenase-catalyzed oxygenation of linoleic acid has been analyzed using a kinetic scheme based on two binding sites, compulsory product activation and competitive inhibition by substrate and by product.

Support for mandatory animal identification (which would include submission of ATR) across small-, medium-, and large-sized plant categories was 47 to 80, 25 to 43, 25 to 100, and 100% for cattle, swine, and sheep slaughtering and rendering plant operators, respectively, if industry had to pay for it, but increased to 65 to 90, 64 to 75, 50 to 100, and 100% if the government would pay for it. 3aslaughterhouses 3acattle 3aswine 3asheep 3aanimal identification 3aattitudes and opinions1 aPendell, D.L.1 aBelk, K.E.1 aTatum, J.D.1 aSofos, J.N.1 aMorris, D.L.0 tProfessional animal scientists.g2009 Dec., v.  25, no.  6 p.641-653x1080-74467nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/385183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDdDFXe2010/02/01  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle02602naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002000127040001800147072000900165072000900174100001800183245005200201300001800253500002400271500001500295520104300310650002201353650002001375650002301395650002101418650001201439650001601451650002101467650002601488650002101514650002201535650002101557650001801578653002301596653002101619653002901640653001001669700001801679773008601697852000901783856011101792856008501903930003301988945002502021946001302046961001302059655001202072IND4396034720221120180136.0071012e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439603472DNAL7 a10.1080/019041607015549972doi7 a10113/88432hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ700 0aJ5001 aBaligar, V.C.10aAgronomy and Physiology of Tropical Cover Crops  ap. 1287-1339.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCover crops are important components of a sustainable crop production system. They can be planted with plantation crops such as cacao, coffee, banana, rubber, and oil palm or in rotation with cash crops. Their use in a cropping system is mainly beneficial for soil and water conservation, recycling of nutrients, control of pests and improved microbiological activities. However, beneficial effects depend on the selection of appropriate cover crops and their management. Hence, understanding their agronomy and physiology is fundamental for their use in sustainable cropping systems. Growth and development of a crop (physiological aspects) is determined genetically as well as influenced by environmental variables. This information can be useful in improving production of these crops and, consequently, their incorporation in farming systems, wherever it is possible. There are hundreds of tropical cover crops and, therefore, it is not possible to include all of them in one article. Hence, selected cereals and legumes are included. 3asoil conservation 3aplant nutrition 3asoil water content 3afertilizer rates 3atropics 3acover crops 3aagronomic traits 3aenvironmental factors 3aplant morphology 3agenetic variation 3aplant physiology 3acrop rotation 0aliterature reviews 0acropping systems 0aplant cultural practices 0acrops1 aFageria, N.K.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2007 , v.  30, no.  7-9 p.1287-1339x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/88433Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041607015549973Available from publisher's Web site  a20080115b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/24  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02723naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002000130040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100001700204245013800221300001600359500002400375500001500399520103900414650001301453650001001466650001301476650002801489650002101517650002301538650003801561650002001599650003101619650001101650650001101661650002201672653001701694653002101711653002401732700001801756700001601774773008901790852000901879856011101888856008801999930003302087945002502120946001102145961001302156655001202169IND4383005620221122223016.0060822e20060831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438300562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2006.03.0172doi7 a10113/32242hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL600 0aL001 0aL8101 aPruett, J.H.10aIdentification and partial purification of serologically defined Boophilus microplus larval antigens by natural ectoparasite exposure  ap. 148-157.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aIn an effort to identify life-stage specific Boophilus microplus proteins that elicit a humoral response in cattle, soluble proteins were extracted from 10- to 14-day-old larvae and subsequently fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Several antigens were identified by Western blotting as potentially shared with other ixodid tick species since antibodies to these proteins were present in sera of calves not previously exposed to B. microplus. Six putative B. microplus-specific antigens were identified by antibodies in the sera of calves repeatedly exposed to B. microplus larvae. One of the antigens, a 19.1 kDa protein, was used in the development of a diagnostic kELISA for previous exposure to B. microplus. The 19.1 kDa protein did not have tryptic protease activity or inhibit bovine trypsin activity, but appeared to be allergenic in that a partially pure fraction elicited immediate-type hypersensitivity responses in calves previously exposed to B. microplus. 3aproteins 3aticks 3aantigens 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3ahumoral immunity 3aantibody detection 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmune response 3aimmediate hypersensitivity 3alarvae 3acalves 3atick infestations 0apurification 0anatural exposure 0aBoophilus microplus1 aUntalan, P.M.1 aDavey, R.B.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2006 Aug. 31, v.  140, no.  1-2 p.148-157x0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/32243Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2006.03.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20070914b20071002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/09/11  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02468naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092024002000126040001800146072000900164100001600173245009400189300001800283500002400301500001500325520100400340650002101344650001301365650002401378650001901402650002201421650001601443650001301459650001801472651001301490653001501503653001601518653001601534700001701550700001701567700001601584773008601600852000901686856011101695856008401806930003301890945002501923946001301948961001301961655001201974IND4396035820221120180328.0071012e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439603582DNAL7 a10.1080/01904160701555292doi7 a10113/88452hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ2001 aGinting, D.10aConstruction and Testing of a Simple and Economical Soil Greenhouse Gas Automatic Sampler  ap. 1441-1454.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aQuantification of soil greenhouse gas emissions requires considerable sampling to account for spatial and/or temporal variation. With manual sampling, additional personnel are often not available to sample multiple sites within a narrow time interval. The objectives were to construct an automatic gas sampler and to compare the accuracy and precision of automatic versus manual sampling. The automatic sampler was tested with carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes that mimicked the range of CO2 fluxes during a typical corn-growing season in eastern Nebraska. Gas samples were drawn from the chamber at 0, 5, and 10 min manually and with the automatic sampler. The three samples drawn with the automatic sampler were transferred to pre-vacuumed vials after 1 h; thus the samples in syringe barrels stayed connected with the increasing CO2 concentration in the chamber. The automatic sampler sustains accuracy and precision in greenhouse gas sampling while improving time efficiency and reducing labor stress. 3agreenhouse gases 3asampling 3aautomatic detection 3acarbon dioxide 3ameasuring devices 3acalibration 3asoil air 3agas emissions 3aNebraska 0aautomation 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aArnold, S.L.1 aArnold, N.S.1 aTubbs, R.S.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2007 , v.  30, no.  7-9 p.1441-1454x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/88453Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904160701555293Available from publisher's Web site  a20080115b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/25  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02539naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130100001500139245009800154300001600252500002400268500001500292520127700307650001401584650001901598650001701617650001801634650002201652650002301674650001501697650001201712650002401724650002201748650001401770653002501784700002001809773006001829852000901889856011101898930003302009945002502042946001302067961001302080655001202093IND4366657320221118144639.0050114s2004    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436665732DNAL7 a10113/96172hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8511 aLynn, D.E.10aNew cell lines from Ephestia kuehniella: Characterization and susceptibility to baculoviruses  ap. 497-502.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNew cell lines from embryos of Ephestia kuehniella were recently developed. Primary cultures were initiated in September 2002 from 2 to 4 day old eggs in either modified TC-100 or ExCell 400 medium. From these initial cultures, one, originally isolated in the Ex-Cell medium, produced sufficient cell growth to allow subcultivation and eventually led to the establishment of two cell strains, one that forms multicellular vesicles in suspension and one consisting of tightly attached epithelial-like cells. The strains were compared to an extract from E. kuehniella eggs by isozyme analysis and shown to be from the same species. Both strains were inoculated with various insect viruses, including nucleopolyhedroviruses from Autographa californica, Anagrapha falcifera, Anticarsa gemmatalis, Galleria mellonella, Heliothis armigera, Helicoverpa zea, Lymantria dispar, Plutella xylostella, and Rachoplusia ou. Both strains were highly susceptible to most of the nucleopolyhedroviruses (with the exception of the viruses from Helicoverpa zea and Lymantria dispar which did not show cytopathology to either cell strain) with large numbers of occlusion bodies produced in most of the inoculated cells. Our results suggest these new lines can be useful in biocontrol research. 3ascreening 3ainsect viruses 3acell culture 3aBaculoviridae 3acytopathogenicity 3adisease resistance 3acell lines 3astrains 3aEphestia kuehniella 3avirus replication 3ainfection 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus1 aFerkovich, S.M.0 tJournal of insect science.g2004, v.  4 p.497-5027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/96173Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20111103b20111202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/02/25  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01397naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092024002100117040001800138072000900156100001600165245004700181300001800228500001100246520021800257650001000475650001000485650001200495650001200507650001700519650001400536650001600550650002300566653002300589653002000612773006700632852000900699856011200708856007500820930003300895945002500928946000900953961001300962655001200975IND7910097820221119155951.0791206e197909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND791009782DNAL7 a10.2307/37592972doi7 a10113/252812hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aEllis, J.J.10aPreserving fungus strains in sterile water  ap. 1072-1075.  a9 ref.  aDetails are given of the results of trials with 66 taxonomic strs. of fungi stored for up to 20 months on cubes of agar, cut from young colonies, in sterile distilled water in screw-topped glass tubes at 25 deg C. 3afungi 3awater 3astorage 3astrains 3astorage time 3aviability 3amethodology 3aaseptic conditions 0afungi preservation 0adistilled water0 tMycologia.g1979 , v.  71, no.  5 p.1072-1075x0027-55147nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/252813Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/37592973Available from publisher's Web site  a20090305b00000000c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/03/04  aUSDA  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02432naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175100001600184245008700200300001400287500001200301500001500313520081700328650001201145650001701157650002501174650001501199650002201214650004301236650001801279650001101297650001201308650001301320650001101333650003601344650002101380650001601401650001401417650001701431653001901448653001401467653001301481700001501494773006701509852000901576856008501585856011201670930003301782945002501815946001301840961001301853655001201866IND8106880720221121064042.0810722e198101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND810688072DNAL7 a10.3146/i0095-3679-8-1-102doi7 a10113/283632hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aBanks, D.J.10aAnalysis of normal and mutant peanut chloroplast pigments by liquid chromatography  ap. 40-42.  a13 ref.  a2019-12-05  aChloroplast pigments in young and old leaves of the chlorophyll deficient mutants (a) lutescens, (b) aureus and (c) virescent and the normal groundnut cv.

Products with high water absorbency were obtained with equal weights of starch and total monomers when acrylamide:AASO//3H ratios ranged from 9:1 to 1:3. Neutralization of AASO//3H with sodium hydroxide before graft polymerization drastically reduced both the water solubility and absorbency of the final products. A reaction with granular starch was also carried out under simultaneous irradiation with a total monomer:starch ratio of 2:5 and with equal weights of the two monomers. Conversion of monomers to polymer was once again nearly quantitative. Graft copolymers with good water absorbency were also obtained by adding preirradiated starch to a water solution of acrylamide and AASO//3H, although only partial conversions of monomers to polymer were realized. The M//n of some of the synthetic polymers was also determined after removal of carbohydrate by enzymatic hydrolysis. 3apolymerization 3airradiation 3awater solubility 3awater 3aabsorption 3aacrylamides 3awheat starch 3acomposite polymers 3aabsorbents1 aBurr, R.C.1 aDoane, W.M.0 tJournal of applied polymer science.g1979 Nov. 1, v.  24, no.  9 p.2015-2023x0021-89957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/252823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/app.1979.0702409093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090304b00000000c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/03/04  aUSDA  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03925naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159100002000168245010000188300001600288500002400304520212500328650001502453650001402468650002202482650001502504650001802519650002302537650002502560650001602585650002302601650002402624650001202648650002402660650002402684650002302708650000902731650002402740650001102764650001802775650001402793650002002807650002002827650002802847650003802875650002602913650002202939650001102961650001302972650001302985773008402998852000903082856011203091930003303203945002503236946001303261961001303274655001203287IND4365502520221121131959.0041110e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436550252DNAL7 a147620792pmid7 a10113/102902hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aBroderick, G.A.10aEffect of low level monensin supplementation on the production of dairy cows fed alfalfa silage  ap. 359-368.  aIncludes references  aEffectiveness of low level monensin supplementation on N utilization in lactating dairy cows fed alfalfa silage was assessed using 48 multiparous Holsteins. Cows were fed a covariate diet [% of dry matter (DM): 56% alfalfa silage, 39% ground high moisture corn, 3% soybean meal, 1% ground corn, 1% vitamin-mineral supplements] for 2 wk, then grouped by days in milk into blocks of 4. Cows were randomly assigned within blocks to 1 of 4 diets that were fed for 10 wk: 1) control (covariate diet), 2) control plus 3% fish meal (replacing DM from high moisture corn), 3) monensin (10 mg/kg DM), and 4) monensin plus 3% fish meal. Diets 1 and 3 averaged 16.7% crude protein (25% from free AA in alfalfa silage); diets 2 and 4 averaged 18.5% crude protein. Monensin intake averaged 16 mg/d on diets 1 and 2 (due to contamination) and 248 mg/d on diets 3 and 4. There was no effect of fish meal or monensin on DM intake. However, weight gain and yield of milk, protein, and SNF increased with fish meal feeding, indicating metabolizable protein limited production. Feeding monensin increased blood glucose but reduced yield of 3.5% fat-corrected milk, milk fat content and yield, and milk protein content and yield. Apparent N efficiency was greatest on monensin (diet 3) but lowest on monensin plus fish meal (diet 4). Fish meal reduced blood glucose concentration and apparent N efficiency, and increased concentrations of milk and blood urea. Monensin increased ruminal propionate concentration and decreased concentration of acetate and butyrate and acetate:propionate in ruminally cannulated cows fed the experimental diets. However, these changes were small, suggesting that too little monensin was fed. Fish meal reduced ruminal total amino acid (AA) but monensin did not alter ruminal NH3 or total AA. Both fish meal and monensin increased NH3 formation from casein AA using ruminal inoculum from the cannulated cows. There was no evidence from this trial that feeding 250 mg of monensin per day to lactating cows improved N utilization by reducing ruminal catabolism of the large amounts of free AA in alfalfa silage. 3adairy cows 3afish meal 3adry matter intake 3amilk yield 3ablood glucose 3arumen fermentation 3anutrient utilization 3acow feeding 2aAcetatesxanalysis 2aAmmoniaxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aButyratesxanalysis 2aCaseinsxmetabolism 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDiet 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aFish Products 2aLactation 2aMedicago sativa 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aMonensinxadministration & dosage 2aPropionatesxanalysis 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSilage 2aSoybeans 2aZea mays0 tJournal of dairy science.g2004 Feb., v.  87, no.  2 p.359-368x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/102903Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080222b20080301c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/11/22  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02862naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100002300158245009900181300001400280500002400294500001500318520156900333650001801902650001701920650001401937650001301951650001501964650001601979650001501995650001702010650001802027650002702045651002402072653002002096773008502116852000902201856011202210930003302322945002502355946001102380961001302391655001202404IND4385040720221119002958.0061107e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438504072DNAL7 a10113/438852hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aF120 0aJ7001 aAnderson, Randy L.12aA planning tool for integrating crop choices with weed management in the Northern Great Plains  ap. 23-29.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCrop production in the Northern Great Plains is rapidly changing because of no-till practices; producers now grow a diversity of crops with winter wheat to increase production as well as to manage weeds. With the multitude of crops available, producers are asking for guidelines to sequence crops in rotations that help weed management. We developed a planning tool that lists various choices with crops when designing a rotation; the choices are arranged by impact on weed dynamics as quantied by research in the region. The tool includes choices among crops, such as varying crops with different life cycles, planting dates, or row spacing, and choices within an individual crop, such as varying cultivar or planting date. Choices among crops impact weeds the most, whereas choices within an individual crop are less effective and usually lead to lower crop yield. For example, rotations comprised of two cool-season crops followed by two warm-season crops can reduce weed populations six- to 12-fold. In contrast, replacing a standard-height cultivar with a taller cultivar that is more competitive with weeds, is often inconsistent for weed management, whereas crop yield may be less. Producers associated with the Northern Plains Sustainable Agricultural Society felt that the planning tool would encourage long-range planning as well as help integrate weed management with the design of cropping systems. The purpose of the tool is to encourage ecologically based weed management, which can reduce herbicide inputs by 50% for Northern Great Plains producers. 3aplanting date 3aweed control 3acultivars 3aplanning 3ano-tillage 3arow spacing 3acrop yield 3awinter wheat 3acrop rotation 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aGreat Plains region 0acrop production0 tRenewable agriculture and food systems.g2004 Mar., v.  19, no.  1 p.23-297nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/438853Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101014b20101108c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/10/14  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03554naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111024002000139040001800159072000900177072000900186072000900195100001700204245012800221300001600349500002400365500001500389520139200404650002201796650001301818650002301831650002801854650002501882650002501907650002001932650001301952650001801965650001001983650001201993650001402005650001202019650003202031650001802063650004502081650001002126650001102136650004402147650002802191650005302219650001202272650002802284650003002312653003402342653002502376653003302401700001702434700001702451773010602468852000902574856007802583856011102661930003302772945002502805946001302830961001302843655001202856IND4381045420221122223001.0060615e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438104542DNAL7 a165527692pmid7 a10.1002/arch.201162doi7 a10113/32232hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL200 0aL0011 aValles, S.M.10aGene structure and expression of the glutathione S-transferase, SiGSTS1, from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta  ap. 239-245.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe structural organization and developmental expression of a previously described glutathione S-transferase cDNA from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, were elucidated. The gene was previously named Solenopsis invicta, glutathione S-transferase, sigma class no. 1 (SiGSTS1). Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences showed that the gene was comprised of 5 exons and 4 introns. All of the introns possessed the 5'GT and 3'AG splicing sites characteristic of eukaryotes. The comparative CT method of quantitative-polymerase chain reaction was employed to examine the developmental expression of the SiGSTS1 transcript in monogyne and polygyne S. invicta. Polygyne queen and late instars exhibited 3.5- and 4.7-fold increased expression of SiGSTS1, respectively, compared with pupae. Early instars (13.1-fold) and workers (9.6-fold) exhibited the highest, and statistically significant, levels of expression of all polygyne developmental stages examined. A similar pattern of expression was observed for the monogyne social form. However, the queen showed the lowest expression level, followed by pupae (1.2-fold), late larvae (5.8-fold), early larvae (9.4-fold), and workers (10.1-fold). No differences were observed in the SiGSTS1 gene sequences between fire ant social forms. Although obviously developmentally expressed, the function of SiGSTS1 in S. invicta is not known. 3acomplementary DNA 3apolygyny 3aSolenopsis invicta 3aglutathione transferase 3adevelopmental stages 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amonogyny 3ainsect castes 3aexons 3aintrons 3afire ants 2aAnimals 2aAntsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistryxgenetics. 2aExons 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGenes, Insectxgenetics 2aGlutathione Transferasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aIntrons 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 0adevelopmental gene expression 0anucleotide sequences 0aglutathione transferase gene1 aPerera, O.P.1 aStrong, C.A.0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2006 Apr., v.  61, no.  4 p.239-245x0739-44627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.201163Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/32233Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070914b20071002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/07/26  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01886naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111024002000140040001800160100002000178245010200198300001600300500002500316520068200341650002101023650001701044650002401061650001201085650001501097650002001112653001501132700001901147773007601166852000901242856007901251856011101330930003301441946001301474961001301487655001201500IND9001950020221120164743.0900502e199002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900195002DNAL7 a166672982pmid7 a10.1104/pp.92.2.4622doi7 a10113/88342hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHardegree, S.P.10aEffect of polyethylene glycol exclusion on the water potential of solution-saturated filter paper  ap. 462-466.  aIncludes references.  aSolutions of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol are often used to control water potential in seed germination studies. There is an implicit assumption that the seed support materials do not alter the water potential of the osmotic solution. Filter paper, however, contains a hydrophylic volume fraction that is inaccessible to high molecular weight polymers. Water absorbed by filter paper filters was found to concentrate polyethylene glycol and lower water potential in solution-filter paper mixtures. The magnitude of this concentration effect is a function of the original concentration of polyethylene glycol and the ratio of solution volume to filter paper weight. 3aseed germination 3awater uptake 3apolyethylene glycol 3afilters 3aimbibition 3awater potential 0aregulation1 aEmmerich, W.E.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Feb., v.  92, no.  2 p.462-466x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.92.2.4623Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/88343Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080115b20080202c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03937naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003700133024002100170040001800191072000900209100001500218245007200233300001600305500002400321500001500345506007600360520168200436506003702118650002202155650002802177650002502205650000902230650000902239650001702248650002802265650002202293650001902315650003202334650002302366650003302389650002802422650001802450650002102468650001702489650001702506650001802523650002302541653002402564653001602588653003702604653001302641653001002654700001302664700001302677700001802690700001502708700002602723700001902749700001902768700001402787700001702801773006902818852000902887856008702896856011202983930003303095945002503128946001303153961001303166655001203179IND4374770020221207120828.0050927e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437477002DNAL7 a155140422pmid7 aPMC14488242pmcid7 a10.1534/genetics.104.0348272doi7 a10113/157612hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aMiftahudin10aAnalysis of expressed sequence tag loci on wheat chromosome group 4  ap. 651-663.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA total of 1918 loci, detected by the hybridization of 938 expressed sequence tag unigenes (ESTs) from 26 Triticeae cDNA libraries, were mapped to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) homoeologous group 4 chromosomes using a set of deletion, ditelosomic, and nulli-tetrasomic lines. The 1918 EST loci were not distributed uniformly among the three group 4 chromosomes; 41, 28, and 31% mapped to chromosomes 4A, 4B, and 4D, respectively. This pattern is in contrast to the cumulative results of EST mapping in all homoeologous groups, as reported elsewhere, that found the highest proportion of loci mapped to the B genome. Sixty-five percent of these 1918 loci mapped to the long arms of homoeologous group 4 chromosomes, while 35% mapped to the short arms. The distal regions of chromosome arms showed higher numbers of loci than the proximal regions, with the exception of 4DL. This study confirmed the complex structure of chromosome 4A that contains two reciprocal translocations and two inversions, previously identified. An additional inversion in the centromeric region of 4A was revealed. A consensus map for homoeologous group 4 was developed from 119 ESTs unique to group 4. Forty-nine percent of these ESTs were found to be homoologous to sequences on rice chromosome 3, 12% had matches with sequences on other rice chromosomes, and 39% had no matches with rice sequences at all. Limited homology (only 26 of the 119 consensus ESTs) was found between wheat ESTs on homoeologous group 4 and the Arabidopsis genome. Forty-two percent of the homoeologous group 4 ESTs could be classified into functional categories on the basis of blastX searches against all protein databases.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSouthern blotting 3ainterspecific variation 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3arice 3aloci 3aOryza sativa 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aTriticum aestivum 3acDNA libraries 3aphysical chromosome mapping 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Duplication 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenome, Plant 2aTriticumxgenetics 0aspecies differences 0achromosomes 0ahomoeologous group 4 chromosomes 0aunigenes 0agenes1 aRoss, K.1 aMa, X.F.1 aMahmoud, A.A.1 aLayton, J.1 aRodriguez Milla, M.A.1 aChikmawati, T.1 aRamalingam, J.1 aFeril, O.1 aPathan, M.S.0 tGenetics.g2004 Oct., v.  168, no.  2 p.651-663x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.104.0348273Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/157613Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080605b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/06/05  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03744naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166100001900175245009000194300001600284500002400300500001500324520192500339650001402264650002602278650001602304650001402320650001002334650001202344650002402356650002202380650002102402650001502423650001402438650002302452650001302475650002202488650002302510650001802533651001202551653001902563653001502582700002302597700001602620700002202636700002002658700002602678700002002704700002102724773008302745852000902828856008502837856011202922930003303034945002503067946001303092961001303105655001203118IND4422603820221116140158.0090701e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442260382DNAL7 a10.1080/154275209028052902doi7 a10113/322322hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aGlynn, Neil C.10aRepeatability between two intermediate sugarcane genotype selection stages in Florida  ap. 252-265.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aImproved yield and disease resistance on sand soils are priorities of the Canal Point (CP) sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) breeding and selection program. Analyses of historical phenotypic data can provide helpful information in guiding selection strategies to meet these priorities. Correlation analysis was used to examine repeatability of phenotypic data used to advance genotypes from an unreplicated single location clonal crop test (stage II) to the subsequent stage (stage III; two replicate, four location clonal crop experiment). Correlations between data for four traits measured in stage II and the corresponding data pooled across soil types for the same genotypes in stage III varied across 23 series of the CP program. Generally, when correlations were statistically significant (P < 0.05), correlation values were low (means; theoretical recoverable sucrose (TRS) r = 0.40, cane yield r = 0.27, and economic index r = 0.23). Similar trends were evident for correlations between data from stage II and stage III on muck soil and stage II and stage III on sand soil across 10 series of the CP program. A 10% reduction in the number of genotypes advanced to stage III over that period would have meant losing only 1 and 13 genotypes that had commercial potential on muck and sand soils, respectively (n = 1278). Correlations between the phenotypic data were significant only for stage III comparisons between TRS and cane yield, which were negatively associated on either soil type. These results indicate that changes in the advancement strategy from stage II are not required as advancing approximately 135 genotypes identifies almost all genotypes with the genetic potential to yield well on muck or sand soils in stage III. Increasing genotypes in stages prior to stage III and changing crossing strategies to improve identification of disease-resistant, high-yielding genotypes for sand soils is recommended. 3aHistosols 3aSaccharum officinarum 3asandy soils 3acultivars 3astems 3asucrose 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic stability 3aagronomic traits 3acrop yield 3asugarcane 3adisease resistance 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3aselection criteria 3asugar content 3aFlorida 0aplant breeding 0amuck soils1 aGilbert, Robert A.1 aGlaz, Barry1 aComstock, Jack C.1 aKang, Manjit S.1 aDeren, Christopher W.1 aTai, Peter Y.P.1 aMiller, Jimmy D.0 tJournal of crop improvement.g2009 , v.  23, no.  3 p.252-265x1542-75287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/154275209028052903Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/322323Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/07/16  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02097naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002000149245008700169300001400256500002400270520091900294650001901213650001801232650001401250650002001264650002601284650002501310650001401335700001501349700001901364700002101383773007801404856011201482930003301594945002501627946001301652961001301665852000901678655001201687IND4461624420221119040553.0110831e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446162442DNAL7 a10113/501242hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aE7001 aSimonton, James10aManufacturing vegetable oil based biodiesel: An engineering management perspective  ap. 57-64.  aIncludes references  aThe search for alternative fuels has increased over the past years. In an era of high government subsidies for alternative fuel production, engineering managers will be tasked with evaluating the economic benefits of these proposed alternatives. This research was an exploratory process that examined biodiesel manufacturing as a potential alternative for cottonseed oil mills that could furnish an outlet for their product if their current market shrinks. The analysis was performed as possible future investment by an existing company with a no debt scenario. The cost modeling indicates that under current market conditions, cottonseed oil is not a viable alternative to traditional fossil fuels. With the expected wholesale price of $0.91 per liter of bio-diesel and a production cost of $1.28 per liter, the current feaSibility of the operation is questionable without the inclusion of governmental subsidies. 3acottonseed oil 3avegetable oil 3abiodiesel 3afuel production 3acost benefit analysis 3aeconomic feasibility 3asubsidies1 aHolt, Greg1 aCollins, Terry1 aBeruvides, Mario0 tEngineering management journal.g2011 Sept., v.  23, no.  3 p.57-647nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/501243Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110913b20111007c00000000  aINDdGAYe2011/09/13  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092024001800136040001800154100001700172245007200189300001400261500002400275500001500299520073900314650001701053650002201070650002101092650001501113650002401128650003001152650001701182650004101199650001501240650002401255651001001279653001801289653001401307653002101321653001401342653002301356700001901379700001801398700001901416773010901435852000901544856009401553856010901647856007801756930003301834945001301867946001301880961001301893655001201906IND2090442120221118175748.0980514e199802  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209044212DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1752-1688.1998.tb05961.x2doi7 a10113/752hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArnold, J.G.10aLarge area hydrologic modeling and assessment.

The primary goal of the Great Plains Framework for Agricultural Resource Management (GPFARM) DSS is to provide farmers and ranchers with a strategic tool to evaluate long-term effects of management and resource allocation on economic and environmental sustainability. The software program incorporates three stand-alone components: a science simulation model, an economic analysis tool, and a WWW-based agricultural information system. The simulation model can be run with either historical or generated climate data. The economic analysis tool calculates costs and returns from either model simulation output or actual farm/ranch enterprise data. Evaluating and testing GPFARM is being accomplished in many ways and on various levels. This paper focuses on GPFARM on-farm/ranch testing in collaboration with producers in three states. Two levels of on-farm testing are being performed in order to validate GPFARM. In the first, referred to as enterprise testing, detailed whole farm or ranch enterprise data are collected on resources (e.g., soils), management practices, and economics. The information is entered into GPFARM, simulations are run, and system output is evaluated by cooperators. The second level of testing, referred to as scientific testing, involves collecting similar information as in enterprise testing. However, soil sampling and analysis are conducted at planting and harvest on select fields. In addition, crop yields (determined by yield monitors) are analyzed, and on-site precipitation is collected during the growing season. We conclude this paper with valuable lessons learned in working with cooperators and conducting on-farm/ranch testing of the GPFARM DSS. 3adecision support systems 3acomputer software 3aresource allocation 3asimulation models 3aeconomic analysis 3afarms 3aranching 3abusiness management 3ainformation sources 3acrop production 3arange management 3asoil management 3aenvironmental impact 3asustainable agriculture 0aGPFARM model1 aAscough, J.C.

Control efforts at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Nigeria, focus on developing integrated S. hermonthica management (ISM) options such as legume-cereal rotation, use of host-plant resistance, soil-based biological control exploiting enhancement of naturally occurring biotic soil suppressiveness, and use of acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicides as host-crop seed treatments. We investigated, in pots, if soybean crops with or without fertilizer (N, P, or NPK) and preceding a maize crop used as a bioassay enhanced biotic soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica, and if the ALS-inhibitor herbicides, imazaquin and nicosulfuron, used to control weeds in preceding crops constitute any risk to this biotic system. Factors tested included: (1) crop preceding bioassay maize (soybean [EMGOPA] versuss maize [8338-1]); (2) herbicide weed control in preceding crop (imazaquin in soybean and nicosulfuron in maize versus hand weeding); (3) fertilizer application to preceding crop (90 kg N ha-1, 40 kg P ha-1; 90 kg NPK; versus no fertilizer); (4) soil treatment before planting bioassay maize (pasteurized soil versus non-pasteurized soil). Effects of treatments on biotic suppressiveness were evaluated by comparing effects of treatments in non-pasteurized soil with those of the same treatments in pasteurized soil. Results indicated that biotic soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica existed naturally in the soil used and was enhanced by a preceding soybean crop and application of N, P or NPK fertilizers. Weed control using ALS-inhibiting herbicides in the preceding crops, particularly imazaquin applied in soybean, had a negative effect on natural soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica parasitism in maize. Results of this study further confirm the biotic nature of soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica, and stress its important role in ISM. Land-based management strategies for S. hermonthica control, such as legume crops in rotation to enhance soil N and fertilizer application appear to directly enhance soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica. Because ALS-inhibiting herbicides pose a risk to biotic soil suppressiveness, their use as a primary control measure for S. hermonthica control in Africa may not be a sustainable approach. 3asuppressive soils 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3aStriga hermonthica 3asoybeans 3aimazaquin 3acorn 3aacetolactate synthase 3aintegrated weed management 3acrop rotation 3anicosulfuron 3aWestern Africa 0aAfrica, Sub-Saharan. 0aherbicides1 aBerner, D.K.1 aEmechebe, A.M.1 aLagoke, S.T.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2004 Dec., v.  104, no.  3 p.453-463x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7503Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2004.01.0423Available from publisher's Web site  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDdDGXe2005/09/20  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03360naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133024002100175040001800196072000900214072000900223072000900232100001500241245010500256300001600361500009700377500002400474500001500498506007600513520083400589506003701423650001101460650001901471650002201490650002101512650001501533650001401548650002501562650002901587650001001616650002501626650001301651650002401664650002401688650002401712650001201736650002001748650001801768650001901786650002301805650001901828650001301847650003001860650002801890650002101918650002701939650003401966650002702000653001102027653001102038653002802049653002002077700001902097700001602116700001702132773011002149852000902259856009202268856011202360930003302472945002502505946001102530961001302541655001202554IND4384794520221207061224.0061029e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438479452DNAL7 a170696332pmid7 aPMC17611352pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2583.2006.00669.x2doi7 a10113/283602hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL002 0aL6001 aPeiren, N.10aGenomic and transcriptional analysis of protein heterogeneity of the honeybee venom allergen Api m 6  ap. 577-581.  aIn the special issue: The Honey Bee Genome / edited by L.

One such component, the minor allergen Api m 6, has been known to show amino acid variation but the genetic mechanism for this variation is unknown. Here we show that Api m 6 is derived from a single locus, and that substantial protein-level variation has a simple genome-level cause, without the need to invoke multiple loci or alternatively spliced exons. Api m 6 sits near a misassembled section of the honeybee genome sequence, and we propose that a substantial number of indels at and near Api m 6 might be the root cause of this misassembly. We suggest that genes such as Api m 6 with coding-region or untranslated region indels might have had a strong effect on the assembly of this draft of the honeybee genome.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3avenoms 3aApis mellifera 3acomplementary DNA 3aprotein isoforms 3ahoney bees 3aallergens 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3agenomics 3aantigenic variation 2aAllergensxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Plant 2aBase Sequence 2aBeesxgenetics 2aDNA, Complementary 2aGenome, Insect 2aGenomics 2aInsect Proteinsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Isoforms 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aindels 0agenome 0amolecular sequence data 0ahoney bee venom1 aGraaf, D.C. de1 aEvans, J.D.1 aJacobs, F.J.0 tInsect molecular biology.g2006 Oct., v.  15, no.  5 p.577-581dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2583.2006.00669.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/283603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090425b20090508c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/04/24  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01415naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100001900157245003100176500002400207500001500231520023200246650001200478650002100490650002100511650002200532650001600554650001400570650000900584651001800593653001600611653001800627653000900645700001800654773009700672852000900769856011100778930003300889945002500922946000900947961001300956655001200969IND4397595220221123022737.0071108e20031111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439759522DNAL7 a10113/64712hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aN200 0aF110 0aD5001 aPeterson, D.L.10aBin filler for fruit crops  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn apparatus for conveying/dispensing produce susceptible to damage upon impact.

In one study, different timings and combinations of autumn disking and glyphosate applications were evaluated following harvest of the preceding cotton or corn crop. Treatments implemented following corn harvest were inconsistent for annual winter weed control. Relative to the nontreated control, treatments that included disking or glyphosate at 5 wk after harvest (WAH) of cotton had lower cutleaf evening-primrose ground cover estimates and plant population densities, with the exception of glyphosate applied at 5 WAH in 2004. Critical establishment of cutleaf evening-primrose occurred in these studies around 5 wk after cotton harvest (first week of November), whereas post-corn harvest treatments were applied prior to cutleaf evening-primrose establishment. In the second study, pre-plant applications of 2,4-D in three tillage systems were evaluated for cutleaf evening-primrose growth. Application of 2,4-D effectively controlled cutleaf evening-primrose, leaving no green plants at the time of cotton planting. There were differences in the number of cutleaf evening-primrose remnant plants among both tillage and 2,4-D systems. Conventional tillage had fewer cutleaf evening-primrose plants than reduced tillages. Application of 2,4-D to both strip-tillage and no-tillage reduced cutleaf evening-primrose plant density by 70% or greater. Although there was no effect of tillage system on cotton yield, preplant applications of 2,4-D increased cotton growth and yield relative to nontreated controls. 2,4-D was an effective option for cutleaf evening-primrose control prior to cotton planting. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3aannual weeds 3aweed control 3awinter 3achemical control 3apesticide application 3aglyphosate 3a2,4-D 3acultural control 3adiscing 3aautumn 3aconventional tillage 3areduced tillage 3aOenothera laciniata0 tJournal of cotton science.g2010, v.  14, no.  2 p.113-118wJournal:jnl57674x1524-33037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/501313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110915b20111007c00000000  aINDdRHFe2011/09/15  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04028naa a2200529 a 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092024006100112040001800173072001700191100001300208245013500221500002400356500001500380520234900395650001502744650001602759650001702775650001402792650002502806650003202831650000802863650001202871650001302883650001402896650001202910650002102922650002302943653002502966653002502991653002003016653001303036653001603049700001703065700002003082773011803102852000903220856011103229856007403340930003303414945001303447946001303460961001303473655001203486IND2334031520221118145042.0030903s2003    azu|||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND233403152DNAL7 a10113/96012hdl7 a10.1672/1536-2442(2003)003%5B0001:AIBTPE%5D2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHu, J.S.10aAge-specific interaction between the parasitoid, Encarsia formosa and its host, the silverleaf whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Strain B)  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of hostage, the instar of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) parasitized, on the growth and development of Encarsia formosa (Gahan) was studied. E. formosa was able to parasitize and complete its life cycle no matter which instar of B. tabaci (Strain B), [also identified as B. argentifolii (Bellows and Perring)], was provided for oviposition, but parasitoid development was significantly slower when 1st or 2nd instar B. tabaci rather than 3rd or 4th instars were parasitized. Host age influenced the day on which E. formosa nymphs hatching from eggs was first observed. Mean embryonic development was significantly longer when 1st (5.4 days) rather than 2nd, 3rd or 4th instars (4.1, 3.4 and 3.5 days, respectively) were parasitized. The duration of the 1st instar parasitoid and the pupa, but not the 2nd or 3rd instar parasitoid, were also significantly greater when 1st instars were parasitized than when older host instars were parasitized. Interestingly, no matter which instar was parasitized, the parasitoid did not molt to the 3rd instar until the 4th instar host had reached a depth of about 0.23 mm (Stage 4-5) and had initiated the nymphal-adult molt and adult development. Histological studies revealed that whitefly eye and wing structures had either disintegrated or were adult in nature whenever a 3rd instar parasitoid was present. It appears, then, that the molt of the parasitoid to its last instar is associated with the host whitefly's nymphal-adult molt. However, the initiation of the host's final molt, while a prerequisite for the parasitoid's 2nd-3rd instar molt, did not necessarily trigger this molt. In contrast to its significant effect on various aspects of parasitoid development, host instar did not significantly influence the mean size of the parasitoid larva, pupa, or adult. Larval and pupal length and adult head width were similar for all parasitoids, regardless of which host instar was parasitized as was adult longevity. Adult parasitoid emergence was more synchronous when 2nd, 3rd and 4th instars were parasitized than when 1st instars were parasitized. Results are compared with those reported when the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum, was parasitized by E. formosa, and provide possible explanations for why T. vaporariorum is a more suitable host than B. tabaci for E. formosa. 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3ainsect pests 3alongevity 3aBemisia argentifolii 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aage 3ainstars 3aduration 3abody size 3amolting 3aEncarsia formosa 3ainsect development 0aparasitoid emergence 0adevelopmental stages 0aendoparasitoids 0ahost age 0aAleyrodidae1 aGelman, D.B.1 aBlackburn, M.B.0 tJournal of insect science.g2003, v. 3, no. 28aJournal of insect science (Online)wJournal:2179x1536-24427nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/96013Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672/1536-2442(2003)003%5B0001:AIBTPE%5D2.0.CO;2  a20080207b20080301c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02400naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178100001900187245007500206300001600281500002400297500001500321520098200336650001301318650001801331650001701349650002501366650001501391650001001406650001401416650001601430650004301446653001001489700002201499700001801521700001501539773007301554852000901627856011201636856008801748930003301836945002501869946001101894961001301905655001201918IND4408828720221119191527.0080811e198802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440882872DNAL7 a10.1016/0304-4238(88)90089-12doi7 a10113/180072hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aF6001 aDecoteau, D.R.10aPlastic mulch color effects on reflected light and tomato plant growth  ap. 169-175.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aEffects of plastic mulch color on upwardly reflected light and on the growth of tomato plants were investigated. Plants grown in sunlight over black polyethylene mulch had fewer axillary shoots (branches) and were taller than plants grown over white polyethylene mulch. The black surface reflected less total light and less blue light, but a higher ratio of far-red (FR) relative to red (R) light. In a controlled environment, tomato plants that were exposed to brief periods of FR at the end of the daily photosynthetic period were taller than those that received brief periods of R. The effect of FR on plant height could be reversed by R and implies phytochrome involvement. Differences in the light spectrum reflected from the plastic, and the similar differential responses to mulch color and light treatments, suggest that tomato plants grown in plastic mulch culture may respond to relatively small changes in light environment induced by the surface color of the mulch. 3atomatoes 3afar-red light 3aplant growth 3aplastic film mulches 3ablue light 3acolor 3ared light 3areflectance 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0alight1 aKasperbauer, M.J.1 aDaniels, D.D.1 aHunt, P.G.0 tScientia horticulturae.g1988 Feb., v.  34, no.  3-4 p.169-1757nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/180073Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-4238(88)90089-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080814b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/08/14  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03231naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110040001800130100001800148245012600166300001600292500002500308520164100333650000901974650001201983650001601995650001502011650000902026650001102035650001202046650001202058650003302070650002302103650002802126650001102154650002602165650002302191650002102214650003702235650003002272650002202302650000902324650001002333650002102343700001702364700001702381700001902398773008102417852000902498856011102507930003302618946001302651961001302664655001202677IND8702042220221120180243.0870423e198702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND870204222DNAL7 a35597462pmid7 a10113/88302hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaperna, T.J.10aAccumulation and metabolism of iron-dextran by hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and endothelial cells in the neonatal pig liver  ap. 312-320.  aIncludes references.  aTreatment of newborn pigs with supplemental iron is a common procedure utilized to prevent neonatal anemia. The aim of this study was to investigate the hepatic distribution and intracellular metabolism of iron-dextran, a widely used colloidal-iron-carbohydrate preparation. Piglets were injected intramuscularly with iron-dextran (50 mg Fe/kg body wt) at 1 d of age. Hepatocytes and sinusoidal cells (Kupffer cells and endothelial cells) were isolated from iron-treated and control (uninjected) piglets at 2, 6 and 11 d of age. The concentrations of iron, copper and zinc in isolated cells were determined by atomic-absorption spectroscopy. In addition, the quantities of ferritin-protein and ferritin-iron were measured by immunoelectrophoresis and ionexchange chromatography, respectively. At 2 d of age, the concentration (Î¼g/mg cell protein) of iron was 5-, 62- and 54-fold higher in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and endothelial cells, respectively, isolated from iron-treated piglets than from control piglets. Hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and endothelial cells accumulated ferritin in response to iron-dextran treatment. Higher concentrations of ferritin-protein and ferritin-iron were present in Kupffer cells and endothelial cells than in hepatocytes at all times after treatment with iron-dextran. The percentage of cellular iron that was associated with ferritin, however, was greater in hepatocytes than in sinusoidal cells. Iron accumulated by all three liver cell types was mobilized to extrahepatic sites. Slight alterations in zinc and copper status of liver cells were evident at 11 d of age as a result of iron treatment. 3airon 3adextran 3ahepatocytes 3ametabolism 3azinc 3acopper 3apiglets 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxmetabolism 2aCopperxmetabolism 2aEndotheliumxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFerritinsxmetabolism 2aHistocytochemistry 2aIronxmetabolism 2aIron-Dextran Complexxmetabolism 2aKupffer Cellsxmetabolism 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aSwine 2aZincxmetabolism1 aFailla, M.L.1 aSteele, N.C.1 aRichards, M.P.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1987 Feb., v.  117, no.  2 p.312-320x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/88303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080115b20080202c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02922naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001800149245012500167300001600292500002400308500001500332520157700347650001201924650002201936650001201958650001901970650001501989650001502004650001402019650002402033650001802057653002402075653001302099700002002112700002302132700002202155773007002177852000902247856011202256930003302368945002502401946001302426961001302439655001202452IND4410298220221120103856.0080917e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441029822DNAL7 a10113/195852hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aX1001 aRo, Kyoung S.10aProcess Model for Ammonia Volatilization from Anaerobic Swine Lagoons Incorporating Varying Wind Speeds and Gas Bubbling  ap. 259-270.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aAmmonia volatilization from treatment lagoons varies widely with the total ammonia concentration, pH, temperature, suspended solids, atmospheric ammonia concentration above the water surface, and wind speed. Ammonia emissions were estimated with a process-based mechanistic model integrating ammonia chemistry of the lagoon and interfacial transport characteristics between air and water. This improved model incorporated the effect of internal bubble production and continuously variable wind speed on ammonia volatilization measured at 10 m above the liquid surface (U 10 ). Model simulations were compared to ammonia emission rates measured simultaneously at three contrasting lagoon scenarios: non-treated lagoon (13,633 kg ha -1 year -1 ), partially pre-treated manure using solid-liquid separation (3,699 kg ha -1 year -1 ), and treated manure using combined solid-liquid separation with nitrogen and phosphorus removal from the liquid (1,311 kg ha -1 year -1 ). The simulations only using average U 10 with bubble enhancement or U 10 distributions without bubble enhancement produced fluxes 42% and 44% below observed fluxes, respectively. However, the simulated fluxes using the U 10 distributions along with bubble enhancement for the non-treated lagoon during warm seasons closely matched the observed fluxes (y = 1.04x, with R 2 = 0.76). Ammonia emissions would be significantly underpredicted if bubbling-enhanced mass transport was not taken into account during warm seasons, as demonstrated by the improved process model and evidenced by the observed fluxes. 3aammonia 3asimulation models 3abubbles 3avolatilization 3apig manure 3awind speed 3aemissions 3aanaerobic digestion 3awaste lagoons 0amathematical models 0abubbling1 aSzogi, Ariel A.1 aVanotti, Matias B.1 aStone, Kenneth C.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2008 , v.  51, no.  1 p.259-2707nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/195853Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081001b20081011c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/10/01  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03314naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072001700131072001700148072001700165100002000182245007300202300001500275500002400290500001500314520151600329650003201845650001401877650001501891650001901906650002001925650002501945650001701970650002401987650001202011650003202023650002702055650002202082650001802104650002302122650002002145650002502165650003202190650001802222651001202240651001002252651001502262653002202277653000902299700003402308700002202342773013102364852000902495856011202504930003302616945002502649946001302674961001302687655001202700IND4422271120221116140213.0090623e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442227112DNAL7 a10113/322292hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Beta corolliflora, shown in 1969 to impart a very high level of curly top resistance to sugarbeet into the BC2 generation, is a wild relative of cultivated sugarbeet that has not been utilized in breeding programs. The nature of curly top resistance from B. corolliflora seems to be reduced symptoms and resistance to viral accumulation. Field screening of 14 B. corolliflora accessions for resistance to curly top followed by PCR detection of BSCTV did not identify any accessions with phenotypic symptoms of curly top and 9 accessions did not have detectable virus. Clip cage inoculations followed by PCR detection of BSCTV and of related species, Beet mild curly top and Beet curly top viruses, were difficult to interpret due to small sample size but indicated that accessions BETA 408, BETA 414, BETA 528, BETA 690, and BETA 805, from Genebank Gatersleben, Foundation Liebniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research, Gatersleben, Germany had no visible curly top symptoms or evidence of virus accumulation. Results of a preference test showed that beet leafhoppers did not have a strong aversion to B. corolliflora and likely would have at least sampled the plants in the field. Therefore, field screening for resistance to curly top, at least in the early generations of an introgression program, should be successful. 3aBeet severe curly top virus 3acultivars 3asugar beet 3aplant breeding 3adisease vectors 3agermplasm evaluation 3ainsect pests 3aCirculifer tenellus 3ahybrids 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3ageographical variation 3agenetic variation 3apathogenicity 3adisease resistance 3aprogeny testing 3aBeet curly top virus 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aintrogression 3aGermany 3aIdaho 0aWashington 0aBeta corolliflora 0aBeta1 aStrausbaugh, C.

Global gene expression and metabolome approaches were used to investigate the responses of nodules from common bean plants inoculated with Rhizobium tropici CIAT899 grown under P-deficient and P-sufficient conditions. P-deficient inoculated plants showed drastic reduction in nodulation and nitrogenase activity as determined by acetylene reduction assay. Nodule transcript profiling was performed through hybridization of nylon filter arrays spotted with cDNAs, approximately 4,000 unigene set, from the nodule and P-deficient root library. A total of 459 genes, representing different biological processes according to updated annotation using the UniProt Knowledgebase database, showed significant differential expression in response to P: 59% of these were induced in P-deficient nodules. The expression platform for transcription factor genes based in quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that 37 transcription factor genes were differentially expressed in P-deficient nodules and only one gene was repressed. Data from nontargeted metabolic profiles indicated that amino acids and other nitrogen metabolites were decreased, while organic and polyhydroxy acids were accumulated, in P-deficient nodules. Bioinformatics analyses using MapMan and PathExpress software tools, customized to common bean, were utilized for the analysis of global changes in gene expression that affected overall metabolism. Glycolysis and glycerolipid metabolism, and starch and Suc metabolism, were identified among the pathways significantly induced or repressed in P-deficient nodules, respectively.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atranscription factors 3anitrogen fixation 3anutrient deficiencies 3agenetic improvement 3aroot nodules 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3ametabolome 3agenes 3aRhizobium tropici 3aphosphorus 3agene expression regulation 3ametabolomics 0abiochemical pathways1 aValdÃ©s-LÃ³pez, Oswaldo1 aRamÃ­rez A., Mario.1 aGoffard, Nicolas1 aWeiller, Georg1 aAparicio-Fabre, Rosaura1 aFuentes, Sara Isabel1 aErban, Alexander1 aKopka, Joachim1 aUdvardi, Michael K.1 aVance, Carroll P.0 tPlant physiology.g2009 Nov., v.  151, no.  3 p.1221-1238dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.109.1438423Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/480393Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a00000000b00000000c20110216  aINDdLYNe2011/02/25  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02492naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003500099024002100134040001800155072000900173100001900182245009800201300001400299500002500313520126100338650003101599650001201630650001601642700001901658700001801677700001701695700001701712773008901729852000901818856008501827856011201912930003302024945002502057946001102082961001302093655001202106991597303110742620221122234646.0771101s197705  xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7790974592DNAL7 a10.1099/00221287-100-1-592doi7 a10113/283502hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3501 aDeMarini, D.M.10aTransmission of PsV F and PsV S mycoviruses during conidiogenesis of Penicillium stoloniferum  ap. 59-64.  aIncludes references.  aLevels of fast and slow P. stoloniferum virus (PsV-F and PsV-S) were evaluated in single conidial isolates of P. stoloniferum NRRL5267. About 7% (3/43) of a random population of conidia from a culture of P. stoloniferum contained no PsV-F, while other conidia produced cultures with various levels of PsV-F. The greatest variation in PsV-F levels was observed in single conidial isolates from cultures that contained low to intermediate levels of virus, i.e., 11-25 .**GRAPHIC**. units/g dry wt of mycelium. The least variation was seen in isolates from a culture with a high PsV-F level (37 E260 units/g dry weight of mycelium). Two of the original 43 single conidial isolates contained no detectable PsV-F or PsV-S. Of the 2nd-generation single conidial isolates from an original PsV-S+ PsV-F- isolate, 6% failed to show detectable PsV-S. PsV-F levels of cultures remained constant throughout a series of transfers when the inoculum was a mixture of conidia and mycelium. The presence of PsV-F at different levels, or its complete absence, did not affect fungal biomass, conidium size, morphology or viability. The results are discussed in terms of how conidiogenesis may influence the transmission or persistence of PsV-F and PsV-S during morphogenesis. 3aPenicillium brevicompactum 3aconidia 3amycoviruses1 aKurtzman, C.P.1 aFennell, D.I.1 aWorden, K.A.1 aDetroy, R.W.0 tJournal of general microbiology.g1977 May, v.  100, no.  1 p.59-64x0022-12877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1099/00221287-100-1-593Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/283503Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090427b20090508c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/04/27  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02235naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072001700131100002800148245013300176300001400309500002400323520105400347650001301401650001201414650001401426650001901440650003301459650000901492650002601501653001301527653001901540773009901559852000901658856011201667930003301779945001301812946001101825961001301836655001201849IND2040462120221119155635.0940623e199401  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204046212DNAL7 a10113/252682hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The opaque (o) mutants included o1, o5, o9, o10, o11, h1, Oh43 fl1 and W64A fl1. In these opaque mutant maize kernels, the proportion (%) of alpha-zein, the major component of the alcohol-extractable storage proteins, resembled that present in normal maize lines. This is in contrast to the 50% reduction observed for opaque-2 (o2) mutants. Whereas the o2 genotype has been found to contain protein bodies of reduced number and size, those in the non-o2 opaque mutant kernels were of similar size to those in normal lines and were present in clusters in the endosperm. In non-o2 opaque mutants, the protein compositions of the endosperms resembled those of normal maize lines. Therefore, the number of protein bodies present in the endosperm and their zein compositions do not appear to be responsible for hardness in normal maize kernels. 3aZea mays 3amutants 3aendosperm 3aultrastructure 3ascanning electron microscopy 3azein 3aliquid chromatography 0aanalysis 0aopaque-2 maize0 tJournal of cereal science.g1994 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.57-64wJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/252683Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdDLB  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02506naa a2200565 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001700099024002100116024002100137040001800158072001700176100001400193245010600207300001600313500002500329500001500354506007600369520061900445506003701064650003001101650002701131650002601158650002001184650001701204650001901221650001901240650001301259650001401272650004001286650003101326650003101357650002201388650007201410650002901482653002601511653002601537700001701563700001501580700001501595773011301610852000901723856011201732930003301844945002501877946001301902961001301915655001201928991597303180742620221207055204.0771101s197704  xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7790991282DNAL7 a3261882pmid7 aPMC1707772pmcid7 a10113/283512hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In contrast to the parental type, smallcolony variants were shown to be resistant to a number of antibiotics, to acridine orange, and to phage which are virulent for the parent colony type. Sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation was similar in both colony types. A simple method for preservation of viable cells is described. The suitability of the method for providing reproducible inocula free from variant cell types is examined.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aXanthomonas campestris 3aantibiotic resistance 3aacridine orange 3acell culture 3abacteriophages 3acultured cells 3agenotype 3ainfection 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacteriological Techniques 2aDrug Resistance, Microbial 2aGenetic Variation 2aGram-Negative Aerobic Bacteriaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPreservation, Biological 0asmall colony variants 0abiological resistance1 aSandford, P.1 aHerman, A.1 aCadmus, M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1977 Apr., v. 33, no. 4 p.840-845wJournal:jnl7018x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/283513Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090425b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/04/24  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02527naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001700092024002100109040001800130072000900148100002100157245009500178300001600273500001200289500001500301520068300316650001200999650001301011650001001024650001001034650002301044650001101067650001001078650001501088650002101103650001401124650002101138650001301159650001901172650001901191650004401210650001201254650001301266650005301279650002301332650001301355650002901368650001101397650002401408650001901432650002701451653002501478653001701503700001901520700001501539700001501554773009101569852000901660856011201669930003301781945002501814946001301839961001301852655001201865IND7908839420221119155849.0791031e197910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND790883942DNAL7 a5163652pmid7 a10113/252692hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8101 aHaliburton, J.C.10aEquine leucoencephalomalacia (ELEM): a study of Fusarium moniliforme as an etiologic agent  ap. 348-351.  a16 ref.  a2019-12-05  aSigns and lesions characteristic of equine leucoencephalomalacia were produced in one of two donkeys given corn cultured with Fusarium moniliforme Sheldon.

Two six-week periods of folic acid supplementation of 400 .mu.g/d and 800 .mu.g/d were alternated with two periods without folate supplementation. Urinary and fecal losses of zinc measured during the last 18 days of each period were not significantly affected by folate supplements. Stable Zn-67 absorption from a labeled meal was not affected by the 400 .mu.g folic acid supplement. There was an apparent, but not  significant (P > 0.05), increase in Zn-67 absorption when 800 .mu.g of folic acid were fed. Mobilization of zinc into plasma during progressive maximal exercise was impaired when either folate supplement was fed. The amount of zinc mobilized seemed to be inversely related to the amount of folate fed. These data indicate that folic acid affects the movement of zinc between different body pools by mechanisms that are unclear. 3aurine 3afolic acid 3afeces 3anutrient balance 3anutrition risk assessment 3atest meals 3aexercise 3amen 3anutrient retention 3aintestinal absorption 3anutrient requirements 3avitamin supplements 3afood intake 3anutritional status 3amineral metabolism 3azinc 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3anutrient availability 3anutritional adequacy 3adietary minerals 0adiet1 aLukaski, Henry C.1 aJohnson, Phyllis E.0 tJournal of trace elements in experimental medicine.g1990, v.  3 p.319-326x1520-670X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/493333Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110718b20110805c00000000  aINDdPNNe2011/07/15  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03528naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092024002100128040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100001700194245011500211300001600326500002400342500001500366520169400381650002002075650001302095650002002108650001502128650002102143650001702164650002202181650002002203650001902223650001902242650002102261650001302282650002602295650003602321650002602357650001902383650001002402650002302412651002102435653001602456653002502472653001802497653001402515700002002529773007602549852000902625856008602634856011202720930003302832945001302865946001102878961001302889655001202902IND2198991720221119040552.0990528e199811  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219899172DNAL7 a10.1093/treephys/18.11.7392doi7 a10113/501182hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK001 0aF5001 aScagel, C.F.10aInfluence of ectomycorrhizal fungal inoculation on growth and root IAA concentrations of transplanted conifers  ap. 739-747.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe determined whether in vitro plant growth regulator production by mycorrhizal fungi is correlated with conifer seedling growth and root IAA concentrations. Container-grown seedlings of interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) were inoculated at seeding with ectomycorrhizal fungi having a high, moderate or low capacity to produce either IAA or ethylene in vitro. Inoculated seedlings were grown for one season in the nursery, harvested in November, cold stored over winter and then transplanted to either a nursery field or a forest site in the spring. Seedling morphology and endogenous IAA in roots were measured immediately after cold storage and again six and 12 months after transplanting. Morphological responses to inoculation varied among different mycorrhizal fungi. Free IAA concentration of roots was increased in some inoculation treatments for all conifer species. In seedlings transplanted to a nursery field, in vitro ethylene-producing capacity of the ectomycorrhizal fungi was highly correlated with more morphological features than in vitro IAA-producing capacity. Both IAA- and ethylene-producing capacity were significantly correlated with more morphological features in seedlings transplanted to a forest site than in seedings transplanted to a nursery field. One year after transplanting, only in vitro IAA-producing capacity was correlated with endogenous IAA concentration of roots of the inoculated seedlings. We conclude that growth responses of conifer seedlings can be partially influenced by IAA and ethylene produced by ectomycorrhizal fungal symbionts. 3aectomycorrhizae 3aethylene 3aseedling growth 3aRhizopogon 3ain vitro culture 3abiosynthesis 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aPinus ponderosa 3aPinus contorta 3acultured cells 3aLaccaria laccata 3aplanting 3afield experimentation 3achemical constituents of plants 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aSuillus luteus 3aroots 3aindole acetic acid 3aBritish Columbia 0agrowth rate 0arhizopogon vinicolor 0atransplanting 0asymbiosis1 aLinderman, R.G.0 tTree physiology.g1998 Nov., v.  18, no.  11 p.739-747x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/18.11.7393Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/501183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110913b20111007c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02186naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024002800099024002100127040001800148072000900166100001600175245006600191300001600257520084500273650001501118650001401133650001601147650002201163650001201185650001301197650001001210650001801220653003201238653001601270653001801286653001501304700001801319700001701337700001601354773006501370852000901435856011201444856007801556930003301634945002501667946001101692961001301703655001201716991611846510742620221122232113.0711201e197108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7191663952DNAL7 a10.1007/BF025311452doi7 a10113/312492hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aKleiman, R.10aOxygenated trans-3-olefinic acids in a Stenachaenium seed oil  ap. 617-622.  aInteresting differences were found in oils from two samples of Stenachaenium macrocephalum (Compositae) seed with dissimilar storage histories.

Characterization of components in the former oil established that the principal epoxy acid (4.0%) is the previously unknown cis-9, 10-epoxy-trans-3, cis-12-octadecadienoic acid. The conjugated dienols include two additional new acids with Î3 unsaturation (2.5%): 9-hydroxy-trans-3,-trans-10, cis-12-octadecatrienoic and 13-hydroxy-trans-3, cis-9, trans-11-octadecatrienoic acoids.

We used established expressed sequence tag information for a Gene Ontology based annotation of genes that are differentially expressed during caste development. Metabolic regulation emerged as a major theme, with a caste-specific difference in the expression of oxidoreductases vs. hydrolases. Motif searches in upstream regions revealed group-specific motifs, providing an entry point to cis-regulatory network studies on caste genes. For genes putatively involved in reproduction, meiosis-associated factors came out as highly conserved, whereas some determinants of embryonic axes either do not have clear orthologs (bag of marbles, gurken, torso), or appear to be lacking (trunk) in the bee genome. Our results are the outcome of a first genome-based initiative to provide an annotated framework for trends in gene regulation during female caste differentiation (representing developmental plasticity) and reproduction.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acaste determination 3asequence analysis 3aApis mellifera 3ahoney bees 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agene expression 3ainsect castes 3ainsect reproduction 2aAnimals 2aBeesxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGenome, Insect 2aOogenesisxgenetics 2aReproductionxgenetics 2aSocial Behavior 0agene annotation 0ainsect sociobiology 0adifferential gene expression 0acaste genes 0areproductive division of labor 0agenome 0agene ontology1 aNunes, F.M.F.1 aLobo, C.H.1 aBitondi, M.M.G.1 aSimÃµes, Z.L.P.1 aFontoura Costa, L. da1 aLattorff, H.M.G.1 aMoritz, R.F.A.1 aEvans, J.D.1 aHartfelder, K.0 tInsect molecular biology.g2006 Oct., v.  15, no.  5 p.703-714dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2583.2006.00696.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/283533Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090425b20090508c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/04/24  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03174naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100002100140245007800161300001400239500013000253500002400383500001500407520156800422650001801990650003302008650001702041650002202058650002402080650002202104650003202126650001102158650002002169650001402189650002502203650002802228650002202256650002302278651001402301653001302315653003702328700001702365773007102382852000902453856011202462930003302574945002502607946001102632961001302643655001202656IND4411828820221118181139.0081023e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441182882DNAL7 a10113/400002hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8331 aTzanetakis, I.E.10aStrawberry chlorotic fleck disease may be caused by a novel Closterovirus  ap. 21-26.  aPaper presented at the Eleventh International Symposium on Small Fruit Virus Diseases, held May 22-26, 2006, Antalya, Turkey.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aChlorotic fleck (CF) is a graft transmissible disease identified almost 50 years ago. The disease agent can cause significant losses in strawberry and is known to be transmitted by the cotton aphid, an indication of the viral etiology of the disease. While CF was a major disease in the area where it was first identified (Louisiana, U.S.A.), no further steps were taken towards identification of the causal agent, probably because of the mild and inconsistent symptoms the agent caused on indicator plants. The strawberry decline observed in the western coast of North America during the last six years led us to investigate the possibility that novel agents may be involved in the symptomatology with CF being one of them. The known CF plant known to exist in the U.S.A. is maintained at the National Clonal Germplasm Repository in Corvallis, Oregon and was used to isolate the CF agent. Cloning and sequence analysis from dsRNA isolated from the CF plant verified the presence of three viruses, two of them being the criniviruses associated with pallidosis disease (Strawberry pallidosis associated virus and Beet pseudo yellows virus) and the third, a previously unidentified member of the family Closteroviridae. Phylogenetic analysis placed the virus in the Closterovirus genus, the aphid-borne closteroviruses. The genome of the new virus has been obtained and detection protocols developed have verified the presence of the virus in the U.S.A. Experiments are currently underway to determine if any of the major strawberry aphids are vectors of the virus. 3aplant viruses 3aplant diseases and disorders 3astrawberries 3adisease detection 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aFragaria ananassa 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3agenome 3aClosteroviridae 3aphylogeny 3adisease transmission 3apathogen identification 3agrafting (plants) 3amicrobial genetics 3aLouisiana 0aetiology 0aStrawberry chlorotic fleck virus1 aMartin, R.R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2008 Jan., , no. 780 p.21-26x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/400003Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100331b20100403c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/03/11  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02961naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008003300029016002200062024002100084040001800105072000900123072000900132100002200141245011800163500002400281520147100305650002301776650002001799650001201819650002101831650002201852650002201874650001601896650002401912650002201936650002001958650002601978650003102004700001802035700001902053700002102072773020502093856011202298930003302410945002502443946001302468961001302481852000902494655001202503IND4442168720221119002836.0100910|xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND444216872DNAL7 a10113/438722hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aSullivan, Michael10aCloning of Red Clover and Alfalfa Polyphenol Oxidase Genes and Expression of Active Enzymes in Transgenic Alfalfa  aIncludes references  aRed clover contains high levels of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and o-diphenol substrates. This results in a characteristic post-harvest browning reaction associated with decreased protein degradation during ensiling. To define PPO's role in inhibition of post-harvest proteolysis, we are taking both biochemical and molecular approaches. We have cloned three unique PPO cDNAs from red clover leaves, RC PPO1-3. The cDNAs encode proteins that are predicted to be targeted to the chloroplast thylakoid lumen. RNA blotting and immunoblotting experiments indicate RC PPO1 is expressed predominantly in young leaf tissue, RC PPO2 is expressed most highly in flowers and petioles, and RC PPO3 is expressed in both leaves and flowers. We expressed the red clover cDNAs in alfalfa, which lacks both significant endogenous PPO activity and o-diphenol substrates in its leaves, to further characterize the individual proteins encoded by RC PPO1-3. The expressed proteins are active in alfalfa extracts and the individual enzymes show differences in substrate specificity, suggesting different functional roles. Additionally, we have cloned a PPO gene from alfalfa. Preliminary studies indicate alfalfa PPO expression is limited to flowers and seedpods. Expression of the cloned alfalfa PPO gene from a strong constitutive promoter in transgenic alfalfa results in low but measurable enzyme activity, suggesting a low specific activity compared to the red clover enzymes. 3aTrifolium pratense 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3acatechol oxidase 3amolecular cloning 3atransgenic plants 3aproteolysis 3aconserved sequences 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzyme activity 3asubstrate specificity 3agene expression regulation1 aThoma, Sharon1 aSamac, Deborah1 aHatfield, Ronald0 tMolecular breeding of forage and turf : the proceedings of the 3rd International Symposium on the Molecular Breeding of Forage and Turf / edited by A.

Herds maintained on farms on which alleyways were flushed with water to remove manure were 8.0 times more likely to have samples test positive for verotoxin-producing E. coli O157 than were herds maintained on farms cleaned by use of other methods of manure removal. 3adairy cows 3atemporal variation 3afeeds 3ageographical variation 3asanitation 3arisk factors 3afeces 3arisk assessment 3agenes 3adairy farming 3averotoxins 3aEscherichia coli 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Toxinsxbiosynthesis 2aCattlexmicrobiology 2aDairying 2aEscherichia coli O157xisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aRisk Factors 2aShiga Toxin 1 0adate 0ashedding1 aWells, S.1 aSchroeder-Tucker, L.1 aFerris, K.0 tJournal of food protection.g1999 Apr., v.  62, no.  4 p.307-312wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/385043Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100218b20100305c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle03326naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002000130040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001800195245013900213300001600352500002400368500001500392520130500407650001801712650001201730650002501742650002001767650002001787650002301807650001701830650002201847650001701869650001401886650002501900650001701925650001901942650002601961650002401987650002202011650002102033651001502054653001702069653002802086653002002114653001702134653002602151653002602177653001402203653001402217700001802231700001902249773009502268852000902363856011102372856008802483930003302571945002502604946001102629961001202640655001202652IND4393446920221122222749.0070724e20070815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439344692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2007.04.0442doi7 a10113/16582hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK810 0aF300 0aX1001 aRitchie, M.W.10aProbability of tree survival after wildfire in an interior pine forest of northern California: Effects of thinning and prescribed fire  ap. 200-208.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aA wildfire at Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest provided the opportunity to observe fire severity at the point of transition between treated and untreated stands. At several locations in the forest, the wildfire burned from a dense stand of largely pole-size trees, into an area that had been recently treated with combinations of thinning and prescribed fire. These treatment areas are part of a large-scale experiment designed to evaluate stand structure, grazing and prescribed fire in an interior ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P.&C. Lawson) forest.Tree survival and damage were sampled on strip plots arranged perpendicular to the treatment plot boundary. Logistic regression was used to develop a model relating the probability of initial mortality (within 9 months after the fire) to distance from treatment plot boundary, and treatment history (thinning and prescribed fire). Fire behavior simulation was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the pre-fire stand treatments.The model shows that probability of survival was greatest in those areas that had both thinning and prescribed fire prior to the wildfire event. Survival was near zero for the untreated areas. Survival in thinned-only areas was greater than untreated areas but substantially less than the areas with both treatments. 3afire behavior 3adensity 3aprobability analysis 3aPinus ponderosa 3aforest thinning 3aprescribed burning 3aforest fires 3asimulation models 3aforest trees 3aequations 3afuels (fire ecology) 3aspatial data 3atree mortality 3afire hazard reduction 3aregression analysis 3aforest management 3anonlinear models 3aCalifornia 0afire ecology 0asilvicultural practices 0aBlacks Mountain 0acrown scorch 0aforest fuel reduction 0avegetation management 0awildfires 0aCone Fire1 aSkinner, C.N.1 aHamilton, T.A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2007 Aug. 15, v.  247, no.  1-3 p.200-208x0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/16583Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2007.04.0443Available from publisher's Web site  a20070731b20070902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/07/30  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02245naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131072000900149072000900158100001900167245007100186300001800257500002400275520056600299650001100865650001200876650001500888650001400903650001000917650002100927650001900948650001600967650001200983650000900995650001601004650001201020650005101032650002501083650002401108650001101132650002601143650004101169650001201210651001801222653002201240653002201262700001601284700001701300700001501317700001701332773008701349852000901436856011201445930003301557945001301590946001301603961001501616655001201631IND2049695820221122172109.0960201e199511  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204969582DNAL7 a87473372pmid7 a10113/385072hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL1001 aLosinger, W.C.10aManagement factors related to Salmonella shedding by dairy heifers  ap. 2464-2472.  aIncludes references  aIn a national survey of dairy operations with greater than or equal to 30 milking cows, fecal samples from 6861 preweaned dairy heifer calves on 1063 operations were tested for Salmonella.

Some species, such as Chlamydia psittaci, also pose a zoonotic disease risk. Abortion is one of the many diseases that has been associated with chlamydial infections in animals, with most attention focused on the economic impacts to sheep production. The role of chlamydia in equine abortions is unknown. Using the family-specific 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) Chlamydiaceae real-time PCR, we tested 169 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded fetal membrane samples from 162 equine abortion cases collected between 2000 and 2018 in Switzerland. Two equine abortion cases (1.2%) tested positive for Chlamydiaceae. Further analyses by the species-specific 23S rRNA ArrayMate microarray and sequencing of a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene revealed C. abortus and C. psittaci. In both cases, equine herpesvirus 1 was also present, which might have been the abortion cause, alone or in synergy with Chlamydia. The prevalence of abortigenic chlamydial species in equine abortion cases in our study was significantly lower than rates described elsewhere. Zoonotic chlamydial agents present in equine fetal membranes nevertheless should be considered a potential risk to humans during foaling, abortion, or stillbirth.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydia 3aChlamydophila psittaci 3aEquid alphaherpesvirus 1 3afetal death 3agenes 3ahorses 3ahost range 3amicroarray technology 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aretrospective studies 3aribosomal RNA 3arisk 3asheep 3azoonoses 3aSwitzerland 0aChlamydiaceae 0aDNA 0aequine abortion 0aimmunohistochemistry 0aplacenta 0areal-time PCR1 aGurtner, Corinne1 aMarti, Hanna1 aBorel, Nicole1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1556-92620 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g2020 July, v. 32, no. 4 p.542-548dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387209329063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03548naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245017800154300001800332500001400350520210000364592002802464650001602492650002002508650001302528650001602541650002402557650001202581650001602593650002702609650002302636650001102659650002602670650001302696650000702709650001202716650001302728653002602741653002102767653002002788653001202808700001202820700001402832700001402846773011202860856007302972852000903045655001203054IND60726912220221119201523.0210209e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072691222DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pew1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, G.Q.10aEffects of dietary oligosaccharide supplementation on growth performance, concentrations of the major odor-causing compounds in excreta, and the cecal microflora of broilers  ap. 2342-2351.  aNAL-light  aThis study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with 4 types of oligosaccharides on the growth performance, concentrations of the major odor-causing compounds in excreta and cecal microflora of broilers. Three hundred 21-day-old Archer Abor broilers with an average initial live weight of 702.3 g were randomly divided into 5 dietary treatments: basal diet, basal diet + 5 g/kg of mannan-oligosaccharide (MOS), basal diet + 1.2 g/kg of inulin, basal diet + 1.5 g/kg of fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS), and basal diet +1.25 g/kg of soybean oligosaccharide (SBOS), respectively. Each diet was fed to 6 replicates of 10 birds from d 21 to 42, and body weight and feed intake were recorded. Fresh excreta were sampled from each replicate on d 40, 41, and 42 and stored at â20 Â°C until further analysis. On d 42, the ceca of killed birds were aseptically removed, and the cecal contents were collected into sterile containers and stored at â80 Â°C until further analysis. Results showed that feeding inulin, FOS, and SBOS diets resulted in an improvement in daily gain (P < 0.05). Broilers fed the SBOS diet showed lower feed:gain ratio (1.84g:g) than the other groups (P > 0.05). Broilers fed the FOS diet showed the lowest volatile basic nitrogen, pH value, and indole and skatole contents in excreta, and broilers fed the SBOS diet had higher total volatile fatty acids concentrations than control (P < 0.05). The cecal microbial community was measured using the PCR-DGGE, which indicated that the cecal microflora Shannon-wiener index and richness of SBOS-fed broilers were significantly higher than that of the control (P < 0.05). The lowest evenness was recorded in the FOS group, which was significantly lower than the other groups (P < 0.05) except the SBOS group. Based on the sequences of the corresponding 16S rDNA of the DGGE bands, in combination with the contents of the major odor-causing compounds in excreta, it is suggested that uncultured Lachnospiraceae bacterium and Bacteroides sp. were associated with the production of major odor-causing compounds in excreta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aLachnospiraceae 3abacteria 3abody weight 3adietary supplements 3aexcreta 3afeed intake 3afructooligosaccharides 3agrowth performance 3ainulin 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3apH 3askatole 3asoybeans 0aexcreta odor compound 0acecal microflora 0aoligosaccharide 0abroiler1 aYin, Y.1 aLiu, H.Y.1 aLiu, G.H.0 tPoultry science.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 95, no. 10 p.2342-2351dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pew1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245015700201300001800358500001900376500002000395520187100415592002802286596002402314650002402338650001402362650001702376650001402393650002002407650001802427650002002445650001802465650002402483650002002507700005802527700006002585773012302645856007302768852000902841655001202850IND60698789820221118005635.0200615e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069878982DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.151242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Haden, Adam C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3817-935210aSoils' dirty little secret: Depthâbased comparisons can be inadequate for quantifying changes in soil organic carbon and other mineral soil properties  ap. 3759-3770.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aQuantifying changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and other soil properties is essential for understanding how soils will respond to land management practices and global change. Although they are widely used, comparisons of SOC stocks at fixed depth (FD) intervals are subject to errors when changes in bulk density or soil organic matter occur. The equivalent soil mass (ESM) method has been recommended in lieu of FD for assessing changes in SOC stocks in mineral soils, but ESM remains underutilized for SOC stocks and has rarely been used for other soil properties. In this paper, we draw attention to the limitations of the FD method and demonstrate the advantages of the ESM approach. We provide illustrations to show that the FD approach is susceptible to errors not only for quantifying SOC stocks but also for soil massâbased properties such as SOC mass percent, C:N mass ratio, and Î´Â¹Â³C. We describe the ESM approach and show how it mitigates the FD method limitations. Using bulk density change simulations applied to an empirical dataset from bioenergy cropping systems, we show that the ESM method provides consistently lower errors than FD when quantifying changes in SOC stocks and other soil properties. To simplify the use of ESM, we detail how the method can be integrated into sampling schemes, and we provide an example R computer script that can perform ESM calculations on large datasets. We encourage future studies, whether temporal or comparative, to utilize sampling methods that are amenable to the ESM approach. Overall, we agree with previous recommendations that ESM should be the standard method for evaluating SOC stock changes in mineral soils, but we further suggest that ESM may also be preferred for comparisons of other soil properties including mass percentages, elemental mass ratios, and stable isotope composition.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEâSC0018420cDOE 3aBiological Sciences 3abioenergy 3abulk density 3acomputers 3adata collection 3aglobal change 3aland management 3amineral soils 3asoil organic carbon 3astable isotopes1 aYang, Wendy H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2104-47961 aDeLucia, Evan H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3400-62860 tGlobal change biology.g2020 July, v. 26, no. 7 p.3759-3770dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.151243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001800147245008800165300001400253520106300267592002801330650001701358650001601375650002001391650002001411650003001431650002101461650001301482650002201495650000901517650001901526650001101545650001301556650001801569650001501587650002601602650002301628650002301651651001401674700002101688700002201709773010001731856008301831852000901914655001201923IND4475341520221120193856.0150810e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447534152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2011.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuyen, Zahida10aSoil salinity and sodicity effects of wastewater irrigation in South East Australia  ap. 33-41.  aAlthough Ã¢ÂÂsewage farmingÃ¢ÂÂ or wastewater irrigation started in Australia in the latter parts of the 19th century, it was in the late 1960s that a considerable interest was revived in arid and semi-arid parts of the world due to scarcity of alternative water sources and the urgency to increase local food production. The practice has manifold benefits in the form of water conservation, nutrient recycling, surface and ground water pollution prevention. But for arid and semi-arid regions like many parts of Australia, while wastewater irrigation can be an attractive solution to irrigation water problems, it might not be the ideal solution for the common soil types encountered in these regions. Due to characteristic low rainfall, high evaporation and low leaching, these soils tend to have higher salt accumulations. This paper examines the soil salinity and sodicity effects of wastewater irrigation in soil types typical to South Eastern Australia and takes the soils of Western Treatment Plant (WTP) as a case study to highlight these issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aevaporation 3afarming systems 3afood production 3agroundwater contamination 3airrigation water 3aleaching 3apollution control 3arain 3asemiarid zones 3asewage 3asodicity 3asoil salinity 3asoil types 3awastewater irrigation 3awater conservation 3awillingness to pay 3aAustralia1 aMoore, Graham A.1 aWrigley, Roger J.0 tAgricultural water management.g2011 Nov., v. 99, no. 1 p.33-41dElsevier B.V.x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2011.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245007800170300001300248520116300261592002801424650002901452650002101481650002801502650002101530650001001551650001201561650001601573650003001589650001901619650001201638650002201650653001701672653002901689653002801718653002001746653002001766700002001786700002001806700001901826700001701845700001901862700002101881773009301902856008701995852000902082655001202091IND60529352020221117071252.0160717e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052935202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2016.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Dong-Ho13aAn unusual chimeric amylosucrase generated by domain-swapping mutagenesis  ap. 7-16.  aAmylosucrase (ASase; EC 2.4.1.4) synthesizes Î±-1,4-glucans using sucrose as a sole substrate. The aim of this study was to compare the enzymatic properties of four recombinant ASase genes to determine the underlying mechanisms thereof. Following cloning and expression in Escherichia coli, we determined that the ASase enzyme from Deinococcus geothermalis (DGAS) had the highest thermostability whereas ASase from Neisseria polysaccharea (NPAS) showed the greatest polymerization activity. Chimeric ASases were constructed using dgas and npas genes by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction. Two of the six chimeric ASases generated, NPAS-Bâ² and DGAS-B, showed ASase activity using sucrose as the sole substrate. However, DGAS-B was not able to produce longer Î±-1,4-glucans; the highest degree of polymerization was <12. In the kinetic study, not only the substrate binding affinity but also the production rate of DGAS-B was greater than those of DGAS. Molecular dynamic computational simulation suggested that DGAS-B could not synthesize longer glucan chains because of the change in flexibilities of loops 4, 7, and 8as compared to those of DGAS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDeinococcus geothermalis 3aEscherichia coli 3aNeisseria polysaccharea 3abinding capacity 3agenes 3aglucans 3amutagenesis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apolymerization 3asucrose 3athermal stability 0aAmylosucrase 0aDeinococcus geothermalis 0aNeisseria polysaccharea 0aDomain swapping 0aChimeric enzyme1 aJung, Jong-Hyun1 aJung, Dong-Hyun1 aPark, Sunyoung1 aYoo, Sang-Ho1 aKim, Young-Rok1 aPark, Cheon-Seok0 tEnzyme and Microbial Technology.g2016 May, v. 86 p.7-16dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2016.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01812naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009800167300001600265500001400281520073500295592002801030650001101058650005001069650001501119653001401134653001901148653001301167653001401180700001301194700001601207700002101223773012401244856008501368852000901453655001201462IND60694764920221117221828.0200514e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069476492DNAL7 a10.1080/24750263.2018.14735132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavolos, D.14aThe name of a model species: the case of Orchestia cavimana (Crustacea: Amhipoda: Talitridae)  ap. 228-230.  aNAL-light  aThe species commonly known as Orchestia cavimana belonging to the Talitridae family (Amphipoda) has been used as crustacean model species.

The enzyme from Variovorax paradoxus converts the methotrexate in to non toxic products. Methotrexate degrading enzyme from V. paradoxus is a dimeric protein with a molecular mass of 46kDa and it acts on casein and gelatin. This enzyme is optimally active at pH 7.5 and 40Â°C and nanoparticles of this enzyme were prepared by desolvation-crosslinking method. Enzyme nanoparticles could degrade methotrexate faster than the native enzyme and they show lower Km compare to the native enzyme. Enzyme nanoparticles show better thermostability and they were stable for much longer time in the serum compare to the native enzyme. Enzyme nanoparticles show better functionality than the native enzyme while clearing the methotrexate added to the serum suggesting their advantage over the native enzyme for the therapeutic and biotechnological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVariovorax paradoxus 3ablood serum 3acasein 3aenzymes 3agelatin 3amethotrexate 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apH 3athermal stability 3atoxicity 0aMethotrexate 0aVariovorax paradoxus 0aCancer 0aCasein 0aGelatin 0aEnzyme nanoparticles1 aVenkatesh, Krishna1 aSahu, Chandan Kumar1 aKadeppagari, Ravi-Kumar0 tEnzyme and Microbial Technology.g2016 Apr., v. 85 p.38-43dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2016.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245007200181300001800253520041800271592002800689650002100717650001100738650001700749650001600766650004400782650002100826650001300847651001200860653001700872653001300889653001700902653003400919700002700953700002200980700002701002700002601029700002501055700002701080700002001107700001901127773010501146856008501251852000901336655001201345IND60519442920221122052556.0160429e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051944292DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.10552662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHegazy, Mohamed-Elamir F.10aNew cytotoxic constituents from the Red Sea soft coral Nephthea sp.  ap. 1266-1272.  aNephthea are soft coral species rich in sesquiterpenoids and steroids.

Seven rotations in two tillage systems (moldboard and chisel plow) were analyzed. We found multiple benefits associated with diversifying rotations in both tillage systems The integration of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] or soybean and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) resulted in 7 to 11% higher corn yields in the chisel tillage system. In the plow tillage system corn yield in rotation with soybean and wheat increased by 5%, when wheat was underseeded with red clover (Trifolium pratense L.). These diversified rotations resulted in an increase in yearly net returns of $51 to $64 in the moldboard tillage system and $96 to $108 in the chisel tillage system. The diversification of rotations reduces variance of net return and thus makes the rotations attractive to risk averse producers. Furthermore diversified rotations showed less response to price changes. Diversified rotations evaluated in this study also proved to be less affected by increasing energy costs. Red clover seeded into wheat resulted in 5% higher yields for the following corn crop in the moldboard system. Rotations that included red clover cover lowered production risk but did not have higher net returns than comparable rotations without red clover. However, the potential for red clover to reduce N fertilization requirements for the following corn, was not considered in this study. Yield penalties due to chisel plowing with financial consequences were only observed in continuous corn. In all other rotations the effect of tillage was negligible. An increase in energy costs forces farmers to switch to crops with lower inputs rather than switch to reduced tillage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3aprofitability 3arisk management 3aplowing 3achiseling 3asoybeans 3acorn 3afield crops 3awheat 3agreen manures 3aTrifolium pratense 3agrain yield 3aTriticum aestivum 3acommodity prices 3aenergy costs 3acrop rotation 3acropping sequence 3aOntario1 aJanovicek, Ken1 aDeen, William1 aWeersink, Alfons0 tAgronomy journal.g2006 Sept., v. 98, no. 5 p.1204-1212dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2005.02623Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03576naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245025300159300001800412500001400430520197900444592002802423650001502451650001602466650002402482650001002506650001502516650002202531650001802553650002202571650001102593650001202604650001102616650002002627650002302647650001002670650001002680650001302690650001002703653002002713653002802733653002702761700001602788700001602804700002202820700002202842773011202864856007302976852000903049655001203058IND60726912420221119201734.0210209e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072691242DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pew1262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorn, Nathan L.10aDetermination of the adequate dose of garlic diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide for effecting changes in growth performance, total-tract nutrient and energy digestibility, ileal characteristics, and serum immune parameters in broiler chickens  ap. 2360-2365.  aNAL-light  aThe objective of the current experiment was to determine the adequate dose and impact of graded concentrations of garlic diallyl disulfide (DADS) and diallyl trisulfide (DATS) on growth performance, total-tract nutrient and energy digestibility, serum immune parameters, and ileal morphology in broiler chickens. At 28-d post-hatch, male broiler chickens were allotted on the basis of initial body weight (1.34 Â± 0.106 kg) in a randomized complete block desing (RCBD) to one of six treatments that consisted of an oral gavage of 0, 0.45, 0.90, 1.80, 3.6, or 7.2 mg of DADS + DATS per kg bodyweight (BW) with 8 replicate cages per treatment and 4 birds per cage. The DADS + DATS was administered to birds by daily oral gavage for a period of 6 d. Growth performance was recorded and excreta were collected for analysis of DM, nitrogen (N), and energy (E) digestibility and on the last day of the experiment, the median bird in each cage was euthanized and the mid ileum was excised for morphological and gene expression measurements and blood was collected for serum natural antibody and complement assays. Body weight gain and villus height were linearly increased (P < 0.01) with oral gavage of DADS + DATS. There was a quadratic effect (P < 0.01) of the oral gavage on digestibility of DM, N, and E that corresponded to an average broken-line regression-derived adequate dose of 1.16 mg DADS + DATS per kg BW. Supplementation of DADS + DATS by oral gavage had no impact on gene expression markers although there was a tendency for an increase (P = 0.10) in serum natural antibody activity due to treatment. Results from the current study indicate that supplementation of a gavage containing DADS + DATS improves BW gain, ileal morphology, and digestibility of DM, N, and E and may affect serum immune parameters in broiler chickens. The average broken-line regression-derived adequate dose to optimize BW gain and villus height response was 2.51 mg DADS + DATS per kg BW.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3acages 3acomplement 3adiallyl disulfide 3adigestibility 3adigestible energy 3aenergy 3aexcreta 3agarlic 3agene expression 3agrowth performance 3aileum 3amales 3anitrogen 3avilli 0abroiler chicken 0amucosal gene expression 0anutrient digestibility1 aRuch, Frank1 aMiller, Guy1 aAjuwon, Kolapo M.1 aAdeola, Olayiwola0 tPoultry science.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 95, no. 10 p.2360-2365dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pew1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01546naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245012900178300002000307520042400327592002800751650001800779650002300797650002300820650001300843650001100856700002000867700006300887700006700950773012301017856008301140852000901223655001201232IND60679221620221120135641.0191221e20191127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067922162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b041062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMthembu, Sinenhlanhla N.10a2-(Dibenzylamino)butane-1,4-dithiol (DABDT), a Friendly Disulfide-Reducing Reagent Compatible with a Broad Range of Solvents  ap. 10111-10114.  aDisulfide-reducing agents play a crucial role in bioconjugate chemistry.

Mutations within the c-KIT gene are previously shown to cause the white coat color phenotypes in pigs, mice, goats, and humans. However, up so far, the splicing isoform(s), genomic architecture of c-KIT have not been characterized well in merino sheep. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis with molecular prediction identified two basic splice variants: Transcript Variant-1, 2 for 12Â bp insertion coding sequences (CDS) corresponding to the four amino acids âGNSKâ, respectively. Using 5â² RACE, here we report for the first time a novel c-KIT âTranscript Variant-3â from the skin of merino sheep by comparative genome analyses at exon(1)-intron(1)-exon(2) boundaries. In contrast, a single product of 795Â bp was characterized by 3' RACE. We also demonstrated that the c-KIT gene expression at the transcript level is not mediated via an intron-9 splicing event. Overall, beyond what was observed in other mammals, our data provide novel insights into the molecular structure of the c-KIT gene in sheep.  aPublisher supplied data  a20/2004cUniversitÃ  degli Studi di Camerino 3aMerino 3aOvis aries 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3achemical structure 3acolor 3aexons 3agene expression 3agenomics 3amelanocytes 3amolecular biology 3aprediction 3areceptor protein-tyrosine kinase 3asheep1 aPallotti, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3196-151X1 aPediconi, Dario1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8734-30701 aRenieri, Carlo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4816-228X1 aLa Terza, Antonietta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1244-15030 tMolecular biology reports.g2021 May, v. 48, no. 5 p.4987-4994dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06486-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245014300174300001600317520119800333592002801531650003501559650001801594650001701612650001201629650002601641650001301667650001201680650002601692653001601718653002601734653002201760653002601782653001701808653000801825653001001833653000901843700002101852700001901873700007301892773012501965856008102090852000902171655001202180IND60605632320221117182145.0180722e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060563232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2016.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNealon, Christopher M.10aI86A/C295A mutant secondary alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus has broadened substrate specificity for aryl ketones  ap. 151-156.  aThermoanaerobacter ethanolicus secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (SADH) reduces aliphatic ketones according to Prelog's Rule, with binding pockets for small and large substituents. It was shown previously that the I86A mutant SADH reduces acetophenone, which is not a substrate of wild-type SADH, to give the anti-Prelog R-product (Musa, M. M.; Lott, N.; Laivenieks, M.; Watanabe, L.; Vieille, C.; Phillips, R. S. ChemCatChem2009, 1, 89â93.). However, I86A SADH did not reduce aryl ketones with substituents larger than fluorine. We have now expanded the small pocket of the active site of I86A SADH by mutation of Cys-295 to alanine to allow reaction of substituted acetophenones. As predicted, the double mutant I86A/C295A SADH has broadened substrate specificity for meta-substituted, but not para-substituted, acetophenones. However, the increase of the substrate specificity of I86A/C295A SADH is accompanied by a decrease in the kcat/Km values of acetophenones, possibly due to the substrates fitting loosely inside the more open active site. Nevertheless, I86A/C295A SADH gives high conversions and very high enantiomeric excess of the anti-Prelog R-alcohols from the tested substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThermoanaerobacter ethanolicus 3aacetophenones 3aactive sites 3aalanine 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3afluorine 3amutants 3asubstrate specificity 0aMutagenesis 0aSubstrate specificity 0aStereospecificity 0aAlcohol dehydrogenase 0aThermophilic 0aADH 0aNADP+ 0aSADH1 aWelsh, Travis P.1 aKim, Chang Sup1 aPhillips, Robert,d1938-2022,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8710-562X0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 606 p.151-156dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2016.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245011500188300001400303520152100317592002801838650001501866650002701881650002001908650002401928650002301952650001001975650002201985650002002007650001802027650002402045650002102069650001302090650003202103650001202135650002002147650003502167650003702202650003502239650005902274650002402333650006102357700002402418700002402442700002602466700002002492700002302512773008202535856004802617852000902665655001202674IND4468258320221120161225.0120417e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446825832DNAL7 a220380582pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-011-2171-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenesky, Matthew D.10aDietary protein restriction impairs growth, immunity, and disease resistance in southern leopard frog tadpoles  ap. 23-31.  aThe immune system is a necessary, but potentially costly, defense against infectious diseases. When nutrition is limited, immune activity may consume a significant amount of an organismâs energy budget. Levels of dietary protein affect immune system function; high levels can enhance disease resistance. We exposed southern leopard frog [Lithobates sphenocephalus (=Rana sphenocephala)] tadpoles to high and low protein diets crossed with the presence or absence of the pathogenic amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Bd) and quantified: (1) tadpole resistance to Bd; (2) tadpole skin-swelling in response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) injection (a measure of the T cell-mediated response of the immune system); (3) bacterial killing ability (BKA) of tadpole blood (a measure of the complement-mediated cytotoxicity of the innate immune system); and (4) tadpole growth and development. Tadpoles raised on a low-protein diet were smaller and less developed than tadpoles on a high-protein diet. When controlled for developmental stage, tadpoles raised on a low-protein diet had reduced PHA and BKA responses relative to tadpoles on a high-protein diet, but these immune responses were independent of Bd exposure. High dietary protein significantly increased resistance to Bd. Our results support the general hypothesis that host condition can strongly affect disease resistance; in particular, fluctuations in dietary protein availability may change how diseases affect populations in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithobates 3acell-mediated immunity 3adietary protein 3adietary restriction 3adisease resistance 3afrogs 3ahigh protein diet 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3ainfectious diseases 3alow protein diet 3atadpoles 2aAnimal Diseasesximmunology 2aAnimals 2aChytridiomycota 2aDietary Proteinsxpharmacology 2aDisease Resistancexdrug effects 2aImmunity, Innatexdrug effects 2aLarvaxgrowth & developmentximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aMycosesximmunology 2aRanidaexgrowth & developmentximmunologyxmicrobiology.1 aWilcoxen, Travis E.1 aRensel, Michelle A.1 aRollins-Smith, Louise1 aKerby, Jacob L.1 aParris, Matthew J.0 tOecologia.g2012 May, v. 169, no. 1 p.23-31dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-011-2171-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245014900171246012800320300001600448520122600464592002801690650002901718650002101747650002201768650001001790650001201800650001601812650001301828650001501841650001701856650001601873650000901889650000901898650001801907650002001925650001301945651001101958700001701969700001801986700001602004773011602020856005702136852000902193655001202202IND4472458820221120184053.0120727e199612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447245882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2389.1996.tb01850.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aREVELLIN, C.10aInfluence des propriÃ©tÃ©s du sol et de l'historique de la culture du soja sur la population de Bradyrhizobium japonicum dans des sols franÃ§ais3 aInfluence of soil properties and soya bean cropping history on the Bradyrhizobium japonicum population in some French soils  ap. 505-510.  aAs French soils are naturally free of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, soya beans planted into new areas must be inoculated with this bacterium. Although, the B. japonicum inoculum can survive in soils for long periods of time even in the absence of a soya bean crop, reâinoculation may increase nodulation and grain yield. Thus, populations of B. japonicum can fall below optimum for plant growth. To identify the soil properties controlling survival of the inoculated bacteria samples of soil were collected from 52 sites from France that had previously grown soya beans. The samples were analysed for some physical and chemical characteristics and the B. japonicum population counted. The soil's CaCO3 content was the main factor affecting survival. The average B. japonicum numbers (per g soil) were 80 for calcareous soils and 15000 for nonâcalcareous soils. In the latter, silt and sand contents were correlated with the numbers of B. japonicum. The cropping frequency of soya bean and the time since the crop was last grown were other factors affecting Bradyrhizobium populations. Thus, there is a probability of enhancing economic benefit for farmers with reâinoculation of soya bean in calcareous and sandy soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3acalcareous soils 3acropping sequence 3acrops 3afarmers 3agrain yield 3ainoculum 3anodulation 3aplant growth 3aprobability 3asand 3asilt 3asoil bacteria 3asoil properties 3asoybeans 3aFrance1 aPINOCHET, X.1 aBEAUCLAIR, P.1 aCATROUX, G.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g1996 Dec., v. 47, no. 4 p.505-510dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1351-07547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.1996.tb01850.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245008500210300001400295520132700309592002801636650001301664650002401677650001201701650003301713650001101746650001001757650002001767650001201787650001801799650001101817650001101828651001701839653002101856653001701877653001601894653001901910700001801929700001901947700001801966700001701984773011002001856008702111852000902198655001202207IND60556866120221119073406.0190318e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055686612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlagaili, A.N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9733-422010aBody temperature patterns of a small endotherm in an extreme desertÂ environment  ap. 16-20.  aMost desert small mammals use mechanisms to avoid overheating or dehydration during summer (e.g. nocturnality or torpor), but some are apparently able to cope with higher body temperatures (Tb) than normally recorded for mammals (i.e. hyperthermia). In winter, some small desert mammals use torpor to conserve energy during cool periods. Still, surprisingly few studies have reported field body temperature patterns in small terrestrial mammals inhabiting deserts, so it is unclear how common hyperthermia and torpor are in desert mammals. We measured Tb of a murid rodent, the Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), during both summer and winter in Saudi Arabia. Modal, minimum, and maximum Tbs were higher in summer than in winter, with maximum Tbs near 42Â Â°C during summer, among the highest Tbs ever recorded in wild mammals. Variation in Tb was significantly higher during summer than winter, which was mostly related to passive warming throughout the day as ambient temperatures regularly exceeded 45Â Â°C during summer. Conversely, during winter, Tbs were highest during the nocturnal active period. While the summer Tbs we recorded are among the highest ever for either murids or small desert mammals, we suspect this represents a lack of data on free-ranging small mammals more than unique adaptations by this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeriones 3aambient temperature 3adeserts 3adry environmental conditions 3aenergy 3afever 3aresting periods 3arodents 3asmall mammals 3asummer 3awinter 3aSaudi Arabia 0aBody temperature 0aHyperthermia 0aLibyan jird 0aArabian desert1 aBennett, N.C.1 aMohammed, O.B.1 aZalmout, I.S.1 aBoyles, J.G.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2017 Feb., v. 137 p.16-20dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011200163300001600275520155700291592002801848650001301876650001101889650001401900650001601914650002301930650001601953650002501969650001101994650000902005650001102014650001902025650002002044650001802064650001702082651000902099651001402108773009502122856008102217852000902298655001202307IND60548158420221123010137.0160903e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054815842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-005-0469-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoni, I. B.10aTracing stable isotope values from meteoric water to groundwater in the southwestern part of the Chad basin  ap. 742-752.  aThe southwestern Chad basin is a semi-arid region with annual rainfall that is generally less than 500Â mm and over 2,000Â mm of evapotranspiration. Surface water in rivers is seasonal, and therefore groundwater is the perennial source of water supply for domestic and other purposes. Stable isotope has been measured for rainwater, surface water and groundwater samples in this region. The stable isotope data have been used to understand the inter-relationships between the rainwater, surface water, shallow and deep groundwater of this region. This is being used in a qualitative sense to demonstrate present day recharge to the groundwater. Stable isotope in rainwater for the region has an average value of â4â° Î´Â¹â¸O and â20â° Î´Â²H. Surface water samples from rivers and Lake Chad fall on the evaporation line of this average value. The Upper Zone aquifer water samples show stable isotope signal with a wide range of values indicating the complex character of the aquifer Zone with three distinguishable units. The wide range of values is attributable to waters from individual unit and/or mixture of waters of different units. The Middle and Lower aquifers Zonesâ waters show similar stable isotopes values, probably indicating similarity in timing and/or mechanism of recharge. These are palaeowaters probably recharged under a climate that is different from today. The Upper Zone aquifer is presently being recharged as some of its waters show stable isotope compositions similar to those of average rainfall waters of the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abasins 3adeuterium 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3aoxygen 3arain 3arivers 3asemiarid zones 3astable isotopes 3asurface water 3awater supply 3aChad 3aLake Chad0 tHydrogeology journal.g2006 June, v. 14, no. 5 p.742-752dSpringer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-005-0469-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01720naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011500173300002000288520053100308592002800839650001600867650001200883650002300895650002300918650001500941650001100956650002200967700002000989700002101009700006101030700006401091773012301155856008301278852000901361655001201370IND60679221920221120130210.0191221e20191210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067922192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b041332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurns, Alexander S.10aRelative and Absolute Structure Assignments of Alkenes Using Crystalline Osmate Derivatives for X-ray Analysis  ap. 10125-10129.  aOsmium tetroxide and TMEDA form stable crystalline adducts with alkenes.

It involves the reconstruction of the hydrogeological framework coupled to the definition of the hydrochemical and isotopic features of the aquifers. A shallow phreatic aquifer, reaching depths of about 60â80Â m from the surface, and deeper aquifers containing confined groundwater, were distinguished.Groundwater generally shows mineralisation decreasing with depth; dissolved ions depict calcium-bicarbonate hydrochemical facies and stable isotopes define the recharge mechanisms, the origin of groundwater, and the hydraulic confinement of deep aquifers. The phreatic aquifer is fed by local infiltration and by streams and irrigation channels. Tritium and Carbon-14 groundwater dating indicate long residence times (on the order of thousands of years) for confined aquifers.The confined aquifers show essentially passive hydrodynamic conditions and maintain a higher piezometric level than the phreatic aquifer. This inhibits the possibility of recent water penetrating far below the surface. The hydrogeological setting of the Lomellina region displays features which are common to other sectors of the Po plain. As a consequence, the results of this study, although conducted on a restricted area, are highly illustrative of groundwater hydrodynamics in large sedimentary aquifers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3ahydrochemistry 3ahydrodynamics 3aions 3airrigation canals 3amineralization 3astable isotopes 3astreams 3atritium 3aItaly1 aSacchi, Elisa1 aZuppi, Gianmaria1 aBraga, Giovanni1 aCiancetti, Gianfranco0 tHydrogeology journal.g2006 June, v. 14, no. 5 p.795-808dSpringer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-005-0465-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01412naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245005400215300001400269520050600283592002800789650001400817653000800831653000700839653000800846653002500854653001800879653002300897773009600920856008501016852000901101655001201110IND60604363220221118060508.0180717e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060436322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2015.03.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZapechelnyuk, Andriy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5033-384813aAn axiomatization of multiple-choice test scoring  ap. 24-27.  aThis note axiomatically justifies a simple scoring rule for multiple-choice tests.

The latter are transformed into the corresponding carboxylic acids during the workup procedure. The buildup of peracids in solution poses safety problems that should not be overlooked.

After the tunnel was completed, artificial infiltration of water into wells drilled from the tunnel was implemented to control the leakage. Synthetic heterogeneity was generated at a scale sufficiently small to simulate the effects of remedial actions that were proposed to control the leakage. The flow field depends on the variance of permeabilities and the covariance model used to generate the heterogeneity. Flow channeling is the most important flow mechanism if the variance of the permeability field is large compared to the expected value. This condition makes the tunnel leakage difficult to control. The main effects of permeability changes due to sealing injection are simulated by a simple perturbation of the log-normal probability density function of the permeability. If flow channeling is the major transport mechanism of water into the tunnel, implementation of artificial infiltration of water to control the leakage requires previous chemical-sealing injection to be successful.  aPublisher supplied data 3acovariance 3adrainage 3ageostatistics 3agroundwater 3amodels 3apermeability 3aprobability distribution 3aremediation 3avariance 3awells 3aNorway1 aColleuille, 1 aWong, 1 aPedersen, 0 tHydrogeology journal.g2000 Oct., v. 8, no. 5 p.480-493dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s1004000000893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245009600167300001400263520121000277592002801487650002501515650002101540650001401561650002801575650001601603650001501619650001301634650003001647650001401677650002201691653001801713653002001731653001401751653002801765700001701793700001901810773009401829856008701923852000902010655001202019IND60529352720221117071901.0160717e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052935272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2016.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Ling10aImproving the activity of the endoglucanase, Cel8M from Escherichia coli by error-prone PCR  ap. 52-58.  aEndoglucanase is a key enzyme involved in cellulose hydrolysis and can be used in multiple industrial fields. In this study, we used error-prone PCR to engineer the endoglucanase, Cel8M, from Escherichia coli. The Cel8M belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 8 and shows 99% identity with the reported endoglucanase from E. coli K12. Through screening of approximately 10,000Cel8M variants, two variants, Cel8ME15 and Cel8ME18, respectively showing 1.42 fold and 1.61 fold increased activities, were obtained. Through sequence analysis, it was found that Cel8ME15 had two mutations, with the residues Ala9 and Glu353 respectively substituting the residues Val9 and Lys353 of Cel8M; while Cel8ME18 had one mutation with the residue Ser117 replacing the residue Gly117 of Cel8M. Based on the analysis of the predicted 3D structure of Cel8M, it was suggested that changes of K353E and G117S might directly affect the substrate binding affinity and therefore contribute to the improved activities of Cel8ME15 and Cel8ME18. Based on all the results we had, it is believed that this study should provide a useful reference for the future engineering of other endoglucanases from glycoside hydrolase family 8.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli K12 3abinding capacity 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aengineering 3ahydrolysis 3amutation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 0aEndoglucanase 0aError-prone PCR 0aCongo red 0a3D-Structural modelling1 aFu, Chenggen1 aHuang, Weiqian0 tEnzyme and Microbial Technology.g2016 May, v. 86 p.52-58dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2016.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245009600170300001800266520220400284592002802488650001202516650001202528650002102540650001502561650001702576650001502593650001402608650001402622650002402636650001402660650001202674650000902686700002102695700002302716773010402739856005502843852000902898655001202907IND4470890620221120143447.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447089062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01891.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHawlena, Dror10aTrophic trait plasticity in response to changes in resource availability and predation risk  ap. 1223-1231.  a1.Ã¢ÂÂAnimals can mitigate the consequences of conflicting foodÃ¢ÂÂweb constraints (e.g. resource availability vs. predation risk) through plasticity in the expression of functional traits. Because functional trait expression in turn determines a speciesÃ¢ÂÂ impact on ecosystem functions, e.g. its trophic function, there is a growing need to develop a predictive theory that links trait plasticity to ecosystem functioning. But there is currently an incomplete empirical foundation on which to develop such theory. 2.Ã¢ÂÂTo address this issue, we explored the link between plasticity in a suite of traits (e.g. head morphology, gut size, bite size) that determine the trophic function of a generalist grasshopper herbivore facing predation risk. We reared grasshoppers in the field under two singleÃ¢ÂÂforage environments where the plant resources had different physical and nutritional properties and in intermediate mixedÃ¢ÂÂforage environments with or without risk of spider predation. 3.Ã¢ÂÂWe found that in the singleÃ¢ÂÂforage environments, grasshoppers became more efficient at ingesting the resource they were reared on. 4.Ã¢ÂÂIn mixedÃ¢ÂÂresource environments, grasshoppers developed a phenotype that was not intermediate to the phenotypes in the two singleÃ¢ÂÂforage environments, regardless of predation risk. 5.Ã¢ÂÂWe propose that the suite of phenotypic changes observed in our study represent two alternative feeding strategies that vary with the possibility of using behavioural resource selection in different environmental contexts. 6.Ã¢ÂÂOur results suggest that plasticity in trophic function may not emerge from a direct link between the primary traits that determine consumer consumption efficiency given the physical properties of its resources (as is customarily presumed) but rather indirectly from secondary traits that may remain latent until such time that they are drawn into play when the species faces a particular challenge. This means that fully understanding how functional traits influence a speciesÃ¢ÂÂ role in an ecosystem requires consideration of a broader suite of traits than simply those assumed to constrain resource ingestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aanimals 3adigestive system 3aecosystems 3agrasshoppers 3aherbivores 3aingestion 3aphenotype 3aphysical properties 3apredation 3arearing 3arisk1 aHughes, Kathy M.1 aSchmitz, Oswald J.0 tFunctional ecology.g2011 Dec., v. 25, no. 6 p.1223-1231dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01891.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02011naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009900169300001600268500001900284520093200303592002801235650001701263650001501280650002101295650001301316653002001329700001901349700001401368700001601382700001901398700002001417700001601437773010101453856008601554852000901640655001201649IND60729093120221122234119.0210428e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072909312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2021.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Jingjing10aHighly regioselective hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in ginsenosides catalyzed by snailase  ap. 114-122.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMinor ginsenosides display higher physiological activities than those of major ginsenosides, but their low abundance limits their clinical application. In this study, snailase was employed to transform protopanaxadiol-type (PPD) ginsenosides, protopanaxatriol-type (PPT) ginsenosides, and Ro to minor ginsenosides. The results showed that snailase hydrolyzed the saccharide chains at the C-3 position of Rb1, Rc, Rb2 Rg3 and Ro and the saccharide chains at the C-28 position of Ro efficiently. The end glucosyl unit of the saccharide chain at the C-6 position of Rf was hydrolyzed entirely. However, the rhamnosyl of Re was intact. The end glucosyl unit of the ginsenoside Rb1 was hydrolyzed entirely, but both arabinopyranosyl of Rb2 and arabinofuranosyl of Rc were not hydrolyzed. So snailase is selective for glycoside bond locations and saccharide types of ginsenoside, and it can be used to produce Rg3, CK, Rh1 and so on.  aPublisher supplied data 3aginsenosides 3ahydrolysis 3aregioselectivity 3asnailase 0aGlycosidic bond1 aZhang, Minghao1 aAi, Zhiyi1 aHuang, Jing1 aWang, Yonghong1 aXiao, Shengyuan1 aWang, Yuhua0 tProcess biochemistry.g2021 Apr., v. 103 p.114-122dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2021.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002300148245008300171300001600254520102300270592002801293650001701321650001601338650000901354650001701363650001201380650001301392650001301405650001501418650001101433650001101444651001501455651001801470700002101488700002401509773008501533856008401618852000901702655001201711IND4475968520221119224633.0141111e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447596852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funeco.2011.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSterflinger, Katja10aFungi in hot and cold deserts with particular reference to microcolonial fungi  ap. 453-462.  aThe occurrence of fungi in soils of the hot deserts and the dry areas of the Antarctic and Arctic are described. A number of filamentous fungi and yeasts have been documented from both â the hot and cold habitat â however, investigations on the abundance and activity of the filamentous hyphomycetes isolated are still missing. There is striking evidence that many ubiquitous species just survive in hot desert soil by their spores, however, without any physiological activity. There is also reasonable suspicion that man-made contamination of the Antarctic deserts might be the reason for finding a broad distribution of Penicillium and other ubiquitous fungi in soil and air. Basidiomycetous yeasts are reported to be endemic in the dry valley of Antarctica. Unrivaled conquerors of the desert environment are black, microcolonial fungi that are part of the epi- and endolithic community in hot and cold arid and semi-arid habitats. These fungi are one of the most stress-tolerant eukaryotic life forms on Earth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHyphomycetes 3aPenicillium 3acold 3adesert soils 3adeserts 3ahabitats 3asoil air 3asoil fungi 3aspores 3ayeasts 3aAntarctica 3aArctic region1 aTesei, Donatella1 aZakharova, Kristina0 tFungal ecology.g2012 Aug., v. 5, no. 4 p.453-462dElsevier Ltdx1754-50487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2011.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013300163300001600296520170200312592002802014596008402042596006802126596008402194650001402278650001202292650001302304650001502317650000902332650002402341650002202365650003302387650001902420650002102439650001002460651001002470700001502480700001602495700001902511700001902530700001802549700001602567700005402583773012802637856008202765852000902847655001202856IND60743427620221122184206.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074342762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-021-04940-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xujun10aPlant diversity and species turnover co-regulate soil nitrogen and phosphorus availability in Dinghushan forests, southern China  ap. 257-272.  aAIMS: The interaction between plants and soil is an important internal driver of ecosystem evolution. Many studies have reported the unidirectional effects of soil nutrients on plant diversity and species turnover. However, there are still many gaps in our knowledge about how plant diversity and species turnover feedback to soil nutrients. METHODS: In the present study, three forest plots with different species composition and diversity were created through artificial disturbance in the same stand origin forest, and their long-term dynamics were observed. We identified underlying mechanisms of how plant diversity (Shannon-Wiener index) and species turnover (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) affect soil total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), available nitrogen (AN), and available phosphorus (AP). RESULTS: Plant diversity was associated with soil TN, TP, AN, and AP concentrations (Pâ<â0.01). Species turnover was negatively correlated with the log-response ratio of TP (LRR TP) (Pâ<â0.001), but not correlated with LRR AP. Species turnover had significant positive correlations with LRR TN and LRR AN (Pâ<â0.001). The structural equation model supports hypotheses that plant diversity and species turnover influenced soil N and P availability by affecting forest community growth (total tree basal area, TBA), litter quantity and quality, and soil physical and chemical properties (soil organic carbon, SOC; soil exchangeable base cations). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results highlighted the co-regulation of plant diversity and species turnover on soil N and P availability by âcomplementaryâ and âmassâ effects during the long-term dynamics of forest ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  a41977287,41991285 and 31961143023cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a201903010021cScience and Technology Programs of Guangzhou City  a2020B1111530004cthe Key Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province 3aevolution 3aforests 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3aspecies diversity 3astructural equation modeling 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3atrees 3aChina1 aTan, Nadan1 aZhou, Guoyi1 aZhang, Deqiang1 aZhang, Qianmei1 aLiu, Shizhong1 aChu, Guowei1 aLiu, Juxiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7850-10060 tPlant and soil.g2021 July, v. 464, no. 1-2 p.257-272dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-04940-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011900176520147400295592002801769650002701797650003401824650002401858650002001882650002001902650001101922650001201933650002901945650002001974700002101994773012702015856008502142852000902227655001202236IND60703342120221117201741.0200721e20200414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070334212DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms80405622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoppenhÃ¶fer, Sonja 10aInteractions among Redox Regulators and the CtrA Phosphorelay in Dinoroseobacter shibae and Rhodobacter capsulatus  aBacteria employ regulatory networks to detect environmental signals and respond appropriately, often by adjusting gene expression. Some regulatory networks influence many genes, and many genes are affected by multiple regulatory networks. Here, we investigate the extent to which regulatory systems controlling aerobicâanaerobic energetics overlap with the CtrA phosphorelay, an important system that controls a variety of behavioral processes, in two metabolically versatile alphaproteobacteria, Dinoroseobacter shibae and Rhodobacter capsulatus. We analyzed ten available transcriptomic datasets from relevant regulator deletion strains and environmental changes. We found that in D. shibae, the CtrA phosphorelay represses three of the four aerobicâanaerobic Crp/Fnr superfamily regulator-encoding genes (fnrL, dnrD, and especially dnrF). At the same time, all four Crp/Fnr regulators repress all three phosphorelay genes. Loss of dnrD or dnrF resulted in activation of the entire examined CtrA regulon, regardless of oxygen tension. In R. capsulatus FnrL, in silico and ChIP-seq data also suggested regulation of the CtrA regulon, but it was only with loss of the redox regulator RegA where an actual transcriptional effect on the CtrA regulon was observed. For the first time, we show that there are complex interactions between redox regulators and the CtrA phosphorelays in these bacteria and we present several models for how these interactions might occur.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodobacter capsulatus 3achromatin immunoprecipitation 3acomputer simulation 3adata collection 3agene expression 3aoxygen 3aregulon 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics1 aLang, Andrew S.,0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Apr. 14, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms80405623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012600166300001600292520196100308592002802269596003402297650001202331650002002343650001202363650001602375650002002391650001902411650002702430650001502457650001802472650001602490650001002506650001202516650001302528650002202541700002202563700002502585700002202610773012802632856008202760961001302842852000902855655001202864IND60743427720221122150736.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074342772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-021-04941-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chongyang10aEvaluation of Bacillus seed coatings on soybean phosphorus uptake in an oxisol fertilized with 32P-labeled hydroxyapatite  ap. 273-287.  aAIMS: Phosphorus (P)-solubilizing microorganisms (e.g. Bacillus species) paired with modern seed coating techniques are promising biological tools to promote crop growth via introduction of beneficial microorganisms that effectively colonize the rhizosphere. This study evaluated P uptake of four soybean seed treatments in an oxisol fertilized with isotopically (Â³Â²P) labeled hydroxyapatite. Seeds included: no coating (NC), fungicidal coating (FC), Bacillus coating (BC), and fungicidalâ+âBacillus coating (FBC). Bacterial strain B. velezensis EX180863 was used in the study. Treatments also included soil with and without lime amendment (as Ca(OH)â), pHâ~â6 and ~â4.8, respectively. METHODS: Soybeans were grown in a growth chamber. A non-destructive method was used to measure Â³Â²P uptake from labeled fertilizer during the soybean vegetative stages by autoradiography. Plants were harvested before entering reproductive stages and plant performance, together with various post-harvest soil properties, were evaluated at harvest. Total P and radioisotope (Â³Â²P) in plant tissues were quantified using different techniques to distinguish soil- and fertilizer-derived P. RESULTS: Without lime, BC and FBC treatment assimilated more Â³Â²P than NC, starting from late vegetative stage (V4). Assuming the ratio of Â³Â²P/Â³Â¹P was constant when P moved from the labeled hydroxyapatite to plant tissues, BC and FBC contained 50â60â% more fertilizer derived P than NC at harvest. Post-harvest soil pH decreased by ~â0.2 units from BC and FBC compared to NC. In contrast, when limed, soybean plants from BC seeds did not take up more P, but the bacteria enhanced root biomass. CONCLUSIONS: Effect of B. velezensis (EX180863) coatings on soybean growth were pH dependent with FBC providing additional benefits compared to BC alone: when unlimed, P uptake was maximized under FBC while FBC had the greatest root biomass when liming the soil.  aPublisher supplied data  aA19-2674-0cBayer Corporation 3aOxisols 3aautoradiography 3abiomass 3afertilizers 3agrowth chambers 3ahydroxyapatite 3anondestructive methods 3aphosphorus 3aradionuclides 3arhizosphere 3aseeds 3asoil pH 3asoybeans 3avegetative growth1 aRippner, Devin A.1 aManavalan, Lakshmi P1 aParikh, Sanjai J.0 tPlant and soil.g2021 July, v. 464, no. 1-2 p.273-287dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-04941-w3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01474naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245009900159300001600258500002000274520043400294592002800728650002700756650001600783650001700799650001500816650001600831650001600847650001700863651001500880700001900895773014200914856007101056852000901127655001201136IND60680387520221121145305.0200105e199305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068038752DNAL7 a10.2307/12429192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, J.

Information on the control of pyrophosphatase activity in soil is desired. Thus, we conducted this study to evaluate the effect of 21 trace elements on the activity of this enzyme in soils. Results showed that 19 of these elements inhibited pyrophosphatase activity and that the relative effectiveness of the trace elements in inhibiting this enzyme depended on the soil. When the trace elements were compared by using 25 Î¼mol/ g soil, the average inhibition in three soils showed that Hg(II), As(V), Mo(VI), and W(VI) were the most effective inhibitors (average inhibition >50%). Moderately effective inhibitors were: Cd(II), Cu(II), Fe(II), B(III), and V(IV) (average inhibition between 30 and 50%). Other trace elements that inhibited pyrophosphatase activity in soils were: As(I), Cu(I), Mn(II), Ni(II), Pb(II), Sn(II), Zn(II), Al(III), As(III), Cr(III), Fe(III), Se(IV), and Ti(IV). Pyrophosphatase activity was not inhibited by Ba(II) or Co(II). The inhibitory effect of trace elements decreased when the amount of trace elements added per gram of soil was decreased fivefold (from 25 to 5 Î¼mol/g soil). The inhibition by the divalent cations Hg, Cd, Cu, Fe, and Sn showed noncompetitive kinetics, but BO3, MoO4, WO4, As4, and VO exhibited competitive kinetics. Among the trace elements studied, MoO4, and WO4 are the most effective inhibitors of pyrophosphatase activity in soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3atrace elements 3apyrophosphatases 3ahydrolysis 3acatalytic activity1 aDICK, W.

Helping others reach their goals (instrumental helping) is considered as an example of prosocial behaviour. Thus, in this pilot study, we examined whether a group of five captive bottlenose dolphins would behave prosocially in an instrumental helping task. Dolphins were given the opportunity to share tokens that allow their partners to obtain a preferred toy. Dolphins were tested in their free time and they could choose to share the tokens or do nothing. None of the dolphins shared the tokens, instead, they preferred to play with them, ignoring their partners. They did transfer the tokens to other sides of the pool but out of the reach of their partners. Therefore, this group of dolphins did not spontaneously help their partners in this task, showing no preference for other-regarding behaviour in this context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTursiops truncatus 3adolphins 3asocial behavior 0aBottlenose dolphins 0aProsocial behaviour 0aInstrumental helping1 aGomila, Antoni0 tBehavioural processes.g2019 July, v. 164 p.54-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2019.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001400161245012200175300001600297500000900313520101000322592002801332650001501360650001201375650002401387650001101411650002201422650002701444650002401471650001601495650002001511650001701531700001801548773014801566856009601714852000901810655001201819IND60668569920221120174140.0191125e198101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066856992DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1981.03615995004500010022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeren, R.10aEffect of Dissolution Rate on the Efficiency of Industrial and Mined Gypsum in Improving Infiltration of a Sodic Soil  ap. 103-107.  aepub  aThe dissolution rate of gypsum from three sources (analytical, mined, and industrialâa by-product of the phosphate fertilizer industry) in solutions containing various initial NaCl concentrations was studied at 25Â°C. The total Ca concentration in 0.05 and 0.1N NaCl solutions at a given time was about 1.3 and 1.5 times that in distilled water, respectively. The dissolution rate of the industrial gypsum was much higher than that of the mined gypsum, whereas the dissolution coefficients of the analytical, industrial, and mined gypsum were the same for a given surface area. The probable reasons for these findings are discussed. The efficiency of the industrial and mined gypsum in maintaining a high infiltration rate in a sodic soil under simulated rain conditions was studied. The efficiency of the industrial gypsum was found to be much higher than that of the mined. The high efficiency of industrial gypsum in maintaining a high infiltration rate is attributed to its high rate of dissolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acalcium 3afertilizer industry 3agypsum 3ainfiltration rate 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3arainfall simulation 3asodic soils 3asodium chloride 3asurface area1 aShainberg, I.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1981 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.103-107dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1981.03615995004500010022x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007900173300001400252520139100266592002801657650001101685650001401696650002901710650001601739650000901755653002901764653002701793653001601820653001301836653002501849700002201874700002101896773010101917856008502018852000902103655001202112IND60638008420221120111609.0190906e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063800842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2019.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aModlinska, Klaudia14aThe impact of changeability of enriched environment on exploration in rats  ap. 78-85.  aAlthough the positive effect of environmental enrichment on animalsâ cognitive capacities is well-known, it remains unclear what role changeability plays in this context. Our study aims to analyse the impact of environmental changeability on the level of exploration and the rate of habituation to novelty.Prior to the experiment, the animals were housed in three settings: enriched stable conditions, enriched changing conditions and standard conditions. Environmental changeability was introduced by re-arranging objects in the housing pen. A test was conducted to measure the level of exploration in adult individuals.The study results suggest that rats housed in standard conditions exhibit a higher demand for interactions with the new environment. However, once novelty is introduced, rats from the enriched environments spend more time than their standard counterparts exploring the new objects. No significant differences have been observed in the behaviour of rats from the stable and changeable conditions. It may be concluded, therefore, that in a setting characterised by long-lasting environmental enrichment, the changeability of the environment plays no major role, at least with respect to exploration, general activity and the rate of habituation to novelty. It may be linked to the relatively quick extinguishment of behaviours reinforced by intrinsic reinforcement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acognition 3aenvironmental enrichment 3ahabituation 3arats 0aEnvironmental enrichment 0aChangeable environment 0aExploration 0aLearning 0aEmotional regulation1 aChrzanowska, Anna1 aPisula, Wojciech0 tBehavioural processes.g2019 July, v. 164 p.78-85dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2019.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02079naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009000166300001400256520112800270592002801398650001301426650000901439650001901448650001601467650001301483700001201496700001801508700001801526700001501544700002001559773006901579856008401648852000901732655001201741IND60092381420221120050551.0141103e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009238142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2013.05.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chen10aTowards low temperature thermal exfoliation of graphite oxide for graphene production  ap. 11-24.  aRealizing mass production of graphene materials at low cost and high quality is urgently required for their real applications. Thermal exfoliation of graphite oxide (GO) is considered as a promising strategy though it normally requires a high exfoliation temperature together with a fast heating rate, making the produced graphenes suffer from high cost and concentrated topological defects. A mild exfoliation of GO at a far lower temperature than the predicted minimum temperature, has been demonstrated by introducing a high vacuum to exert an outward drawing force which helps effective exfoliation of the stacked graphene layers. In this contribution, together with a discussion on the foundation of thermal exfoliation and the general principle for low-temperature exfoliation, we review current strategies and indicate possible novel approaches. Low cost and easy operability are highlighted for the low-temperature exfoliation and the resulting graphene materials are characterized by low defect concentration, and unique and tunable surface chemistry to promote potential mass applications in energy-related areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3atemperature 3atopology1 aLv, Wei1 aXie, Xiaoying1 aTang, Daiming1 aLiu, Chang1 aYang, Quan-Hong0 tCarbon.g2013 Oct., v. 62 p.11-24dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.05.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03372naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245017000180300001800350520152600368592002801894650001901922650001901941650002501960650001701985650001602002650002302018650001602041650002102057650003002078650002102108650001702129650001502146650001202161650001302173650001502186650001902201650001602220653001602236653001702252653001502269653002402284653002402308653001202332700002602344700001902370700001902389773034002408856008502748852000902833655001202842IND60774527820221119100020.0220614e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077452782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2022.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaji-Ghazi Tehrani, Leila10aEffect of Atkins versus a low-fat diet on gut microbiota, and cardiometabolic markers in obese women following an energy-restricted diet: Randomized, crossover trial  ap. 1734-1741.  aThere is controversy about effects of the Atkins diet on cardiometabolic markers in previous studies. No study compared effects of Atkins versus a low-fat diet on gut microbiota in obese women during a weight-loss program up to date.Â A 6-week, randomized, crossover trial was conducted. Twenty-four healthy women with obesity (BMIâ¥30Â kg/mÂ²) were randomly assigned to receive the Atkins (55%, 25%, and 20% of total daily calories from fat, protein, and carbohydrates), or low-fat (20%, 15%, and 65% of total daily calories from fat, protein, and carbohydrates) diets while following a weight-loss program. Vegetable oils were used as the main source of dietary fat. Dietary groups were switched after two weeks of washout period with a weight maintenance low-fat diet. The effects of the two diets did not differ for the most endpoints. However, Gut Actinobacteria residency and serum total antioxidant capacity significantly increased in the Akins diet group compared with the low-fat one (pÂ =Â 0.02 and pÂ =Â 0.04). Adjusting for all parameters, gut Actinobacteria residency 1.48- and 2.5-folds decreased the serum LDL.C/HDL.C ratio and non-HDL.C levels (95%CI: 3.1, â0.22; pÂ =Â 0.03 and â0.07, â0.002; pÂ =Â 0.04), respectively. Decrease in gut Proteobacteria residency showed a significant reduction in serum total oxidant status (95%CI: 7.4, â0.07; pÂ =Â 0.04).Â The Atkins diet, based on vegetable oils, alters gut microbiota composition, atherogenic and antioxidant parameters.Â IRCT20200929048876N3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aProteobacteria 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3across-over studies 3adietary fat 3adigestive system 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alow calorie diet 3alow fat diet 3ametabolism 3aobesity 3aoxidants 3avegetables 3aweight control 3aweight loss 0aAtkins diet 0aLow-fat diet 0aMicrobiota 0aAtherogenic indices 0aAnti-oxidant status 0aObesity1 aMousavi, Seyedeh Neda1 aChiti, Hossein1 aAfshar, Davoud0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2022 July, v. 32, no. 7 p.1734-1741dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2022.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01643naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006600168300001600234520051900250592002800769650001500797650001600812650001100828650001100839650001600850650001900866650002400885653001700909653003400926653001600960653001700976653001300993700001601006773015501022856008301177852000901260655001201269IND60541464620221120235600.0190401e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054146462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2014.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagoswana, S.L.12aA taxonomic revision of Hymenolepis (Asteraceae, Anthemideae)  ap. 126-141.  aThe South African genus Hymenolepis (Asteraceae, Anthemideae) is revised.

However, these ecosystems and the benefits they create for humans are subject to competing uses and increasing pressures. As a consequence of the increasing threats to the marine environment, several regulations require applying an ecosystem-based approach for managing the marine environment. Within the Mediterranean Sea, in 2008, the Contracting Parties of the Mediterranean Action Plan decided to progressively apply the Ecosystem Approach (EcAp) with the objective of achieving Good Environmental Status (GES) for 2018. To assess the environmental status, the EcAp proposes 11 Ecological Objectives, each of which requires a set of relevant indicators to be integrated. Progress towards the EcAp entails a gradual and important challenge for North African countries, and efforts have to be initiated to propose and discuss methods. Accordingly, to enhance the capacity of North African countries to implement EcAp and particularly to propose and discuss indicators and methods to assess GES, the aim of this manuscript is to identify the practical problems and gaps found at each stage of the environmental status assessment process. For this purpose, a stepwise method has been proposed to assess the environmental status using Ecologic Objective 5-Eutrophication as example.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem services 3aeutrophication 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine environment 3aMediterranean Sea 3aNorthern Africa1 aBorja, Angel,1 aBreton, FranÃ§oise,1 aButenschÃ¶n, Momme1 aMarin, Anna,1 aMiller, Peter I.1 aMorisseau, FranÃ§ois1 aXu, Weidong0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 May, v. 187, no. 5 p.289-289dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4316-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009300171300001600264520074900280592002801029650002201057650001701079650001501096650002801111650001001139650002701149650004401176650001301220650002201233653003401255653001801289653002701307653002101334700001201355700001301367700001401380700001401394700001901408700001501427700001801442773009801460856008801558852000901646655001201655IND60563703320221119113732.0190318e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056370332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2017.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Mei-Ping10aHepatoprotective hemiterpene glycosides from the rhizome of Cibotium barometz (L.)

The tube structure of the CNTs was retained and the CNTâAl interface was bonded without pores. As a result, great increases in yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and Youngâs modulus were achieved when a higher concentration of CNTs was incorporated. Moreover, the composites exhibited good ductility. In particular, 3vol.% CNT/2009Al composite exhibited an ultimate tensile strength of 600MPa and elongation of 10%, much higher strengthâductility than the corresponding values for CNT/Al composites fabricated by other processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acarbon nanotubes 3afriction 3arolling 3atensile strength1 aXiao, B.L.1 aWang, W.G.1 aMa, Z.Y.0 tCarbon.g2013 Oct., v. 62 p.35-42dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.05.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245014500129300001600274520174200290592002802032650002602060650002002086650001302106650001302119650001502132650001202147650001402159650001102173700001902184773010902203852000902312939003302321946001302354655001202367IND8503182220221119033906.0181002e198503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND850318222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMARTINI, J.

It is related to the predominance of highly weathered and leached clayey and coarse-textured soils. Liming is an essential practice, and research has been done to elucidate the relationships among liming, soil acidity, and plant growth. However, there is a need to continue to quantify the impact of liming on reducing toxic levels of Al and Mn, on increasing nutrient availability and mobility, and on nutrient uptake during the growing season by determinate soybean varieties. The main objective of this study was to determine the effect of lime levels and time on nutrient availability, mobility, and uptake during the entire soybean growing season, under field conditions.Liming with the recommended rate of 3000 kg/ha was sufficient for optimum soybean yields and seed composition. It also increased soil pH from 5.1 to 5.9 within 4 wk, decreased the exchangeable Al from 29 to 3 ppm within 6 wk, reduced the extractable Mn from 23 to 15 ppm within 6 wk, and increased the extractable P from 3 to 51 ppm within 4 wk.Shoot Al concentrations decreased after week 4 with the onset of exponential growth, despite increasing accumulation rates. Total shoot Al increased after week 4 with plant growth and in spite of decreasing Al concentrations. The daily Al accumulation rate in the shoots increased from week 4 to week 12 in association with fast plant growth and available B horizon Al, despite decreasing Al in the A horizon. The Al accumulation rate decreased to-ward the end of the growing season in association with slow plant growth and loss of roots and root activity. Similar results were observed for Mn and P.  aPublisher supplied data 3anutrient availability 3anutrient uptake 3asoybeans 3aaluminum 3aphosphorus 3asoil pH 3amanganese 3aliming1 aMUTTERS, R.

After 85 days of transplanting, preventive spray of bioacaricides, vermiwash (15.36 mites/leaf) and Darekastra (16.22 mites/leaf) resulted into lower mite population per leaf whereas curative spray of Darekastra significantly reduced mite population levels (112.53 mites/leaf). The effect of bioacaricide application in the form of spray was also quantified in terms of cucumber fruit yield. The bioacaricides applied as preventive sprays enhanced the cucumber fruit yield. High fruit yield was observed after preventive spray of bioacaricides viz. Tamarlassi (1660.67Â g/plant), vermiwash (1656.50Â g/plant) and Darekastra (1626.0Â g/plant). As curative spray, Darekastra resulted into high fruit yield (1446.33Â g/plant).

However, it is still unclear how C and N cycle of boreal forests respond to the N deposition. RESULTS: We conducted an 8-year continuous N addition field experiment in a Larix gmelinii forest in Greater Khingan Mountains, Northeast China. Four N treatments (0, 25, 50, 75Â kgÂ NÂ haâ»Â¹Â yearâ»Â¹) were built. The effects of N addition on the Î´Â¹Â³C and Î´Â¹âµN of needle, branch, bark, and fine root of Larix gmelinii and soil were studied. The result of the balance between the N input and output flux showed that N addition significantly increased the Î´Â¹âµN in each organ of Larix gmelinii, but did not change the Î´Â¹âµN of soil. We also found that the N absorption by needles of Larix gmelinii could increase the needle photosynthesis rate and Î´Â¹Â³C by increasing carboxylation, but N addition had no significant effect on the Î´Â¹Â³C of soil and other organs. In addition, both the soil Î´Â¹âµN and Î´Â¹Â³C increased with the soil depth. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term N addition may lead to more open C and N cycles and further affect plant nutrient acquisition strategies in boreal forest ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  a42230106cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41575137cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41773075cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aKFJJ2021ZD01cOpen Grant for Key Laboratory of Sustainable Forest Ecosystem Management (Northeast Forestry University), Ministry of Education 3aLarix gmelinii 3aabsorption 3abark 3aboreal forests 3acarbon 3acarboxylation 3afield experimentation 3afine roots 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3aphotosynthesis 3asoil depth 3astable isotopes 3aChina1 aYin, Zhiwei1 aYan, Guoyong1 aLiu, Shuang1 aWang, Xiaochun1 aXing, Yajuan1 aWang, Qinggui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2456-57700 tEcological processes.g2022 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.37-37dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22887x2192-17097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13717-022-00382-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245023200164520160800396592002802004650002202032650002502054650001702079650001002096650001802106650001702124650002602141650002202167650001202189650001502201650001302216650001502229650001302244650002402257650001502281650002002296653001002316653001502326653002202341653002502363653001302388700001802401700001702419700001802436700001602454700001702470700001502487700001302502773010602515856008502621852000902706655001202715IND60774528120221119094748.0220517e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077452812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2022.1270242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yifan10aiTRAQ-based proteomic analysis of Bacillus subtilis strain NCD-2 regulated by PhoPR two-component system: A comparative analysis with transcriptomics revealed the regulation for fengycin production by branched chain amino acids  aThe PhoPR two-component system (TCS) is a signal transduction pathway to regulate the phosphate starvation response in Bacillus subtilis and regulated fengycin production in strain NCD-2 under low phosphate condition. The purpose of this study was to characterize the proteome level responses in the phoP-null mutant (MP) and the phoR-null mutant (MR), and to integrate the proteomics with the transcriptomic data obtained previously. The metabolic pathway for fengycin was predicted based on omics analysis as well as molecular genetics assay. Results showed the proteins and genes associated with biosynthesis of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) were regulated by PhoPR TCS, and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis also confirmed that the production of BCAAs was down-regulated in the MP and MR mutants, when compared to wild-type strain NCD-2. Protein network analysis showed that the BCAA metabolism was linked to the biosynthesis of lipopeptides. The MP and MR strains decreased the fengycin production when cultured in modified Landy medium supplied with 0.42Â mM phosphate, however, the fengycin production could be restored when the glutamic acid was replaced with BCAAs that were added to modified Landy medium. The lpdV gene, which is responsible for the BCAA degradation process, was deleted in strain NCD-2. Compared with the wild-type strain, the lpdV mutant produced significantly less fengycin in the medium supplied with BCAAs. Considered together, the results of this study indicate that the PhoPR TCS regulates fengycin production by affecting BCAA biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3agenes 3aglutamic acid 3alipopeptides 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amutants 3aphosphates 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aresearch 3asignal transduction 3astarvation 3atranscriptomics 0aITRAQ 0aProteomics 0aBacillus subtilis 0aTwo-component system 0aFengycin1 aGuo, Qinggang1 aDong, Lihong1 aLiu, Xiaomeng1 aChen, Xiuye1 aWang, Peipei1 aSu, Zhenhe1 aMa, Ping0 tMicrobiological research.g2022 July, v. 260 p.127024-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2022.1270243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015700168300001100325520149500336592002801831596003501859650001301894650001401907650002101921650001301942650001801955700005301973700002302026700002102049700001802070700002102088700001702109773010902126856008302235852000902318655001202327IND60777573620221119185207.0220916e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077757362DNAL7 a10.1186/s13750-022-00271-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacura, Biljana10aWhat evidence exists on the effects of public policy interventions for achieving environmentally sustainable food consumption?

Targeted public policy interventions are crucial for stimulating such transition. While there is extensive research about the promotion of more environmentally sustainable food consumption, this knowledge is scattered across different sources. This systematic map aims to collate and describe the available evidence on public policy interventions such as laws, directives, taxes and information campaigns, for achieving sustainable food consumption patterns. METHODS: We will search bibliographic databases, specialist websites, Google Scholar and bibliographies of relevant reviews. Searches for academic literature will be performed in English, while searches for grey literature will be performed in English, Swedish, Danish and Norwegian. Screening, including consistency checking exercises, will be done at two levels: title and abstract, and full text. We will use machine learning algorithms to support screening at the title and abstract level. Coding and meta-data extraction will include bibliographic information, policy details and context, and measured environmental outcome(s). The evidence base will be summarised narratively using tables and graphs and presented as an online interactive searchable database and a website that will allow for visualisation, filtering and exploring systematic map findings, knowledge gaps and clusters.  aPublisher supplied data  aGD-20210001cNaturvÃ¥rdsverket 3aInternet 3adatabases 3afood consumption 3ametadata 3apublic policy1 aRan, Ylva1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5426-16181 aPersson, U.

A noncooperative game theoretic model suggests that for tacitly collusive pricing behavior to persist in equilibrium, oligopsonists must follow a discontinuous pricing strategy. Meatpackers pay low prices for cattle during cooperative phases and purchase cattle aggressively during noncooperative phases. Tests for cooperative/noncooperative conduct and measures of market power are presented. Fed cattle prices in four direct trade regions in the central United States are examined. Evidence of cooperative/noncooperative conduct is present in all markets but has declined over time. Varying conduct across markets and over time suggests it is important to continue monitoring fed cattle markets to assure a competitive environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3aboxed beef 3acattle 3aeconometric models 3amarket power 3amarkets 3amonitoring 3aoligopsony 3aprices 3atrade 3aMidwestern United States1 aGarcia, Philip1 aHudson, Michael A.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1993 Aug., v. 75, no. 3 p.537-548dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12435613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03686naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100001600186245013700202300001100339506007600350520200300426592002802429506003702457650001602494650002702510650002102537650002302558650002302581650001502604650001602619650001202635650001702647650002102664650001102685650001502696650002102711650002102732650001302753650001502766650002202781650001902803650002502822651001102847700002002858700002802878700002202906773012702928856008003055852000903135655001203144IND60556179420221207061344.0211117e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055617942DNAL7 a259720072pmid7 aPMC44298202pmcid7 a10.1186/1746-4269-11-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZank, Sofia10aLocal health practices and the knowledge of medicinal plants in a Brazilian semi-arid region: environmental benefits to human health  ap. 11.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The concept of eco-cultural health considers the dynamic interaction between humans and ecosystems, emphasizing the implications of the health of the ecosystem for the health and well-being of human populations. Ethnobotanical studies focusing on folk medicine and medicinal plants can contribute to the field of eco-cultural health if they incorporate the perspective and local knowledge of communities. We investigated the local health practices in three rural communities living within the vicinity of a protected area of sustainable use in a semi-arid region of Brazil. We analyzed the opinions of local health experts on the elements that influence human health and on how the environment contributes to this influence. We also analyzed and compared the local knowledge of medicinal plants, as knowledge of this type is an important factor when considering the interaction between environmental and human health. METHODS: We performed structured interviews and free-listings with 66 local health experts. We used content analysis to systematize the elements of the influences on human health. We compared the richness of the plants cited among communities and analyzed the differences among the three communities regarding the ways in which the plants were obtained and the environments in which plants were collected. RESULTS: The local experts identified several influences of the environment on human health. These influences can be associated with ecosystem services, such as climatic conditions, water and air quality, recreation and medicinal and food resources. We identified 192 medicinal plant species, most of which were gathered from wild ecosystems. The most important environments for the three communities were the plateau mountain and backyards. CONCLUSIONS: The informants had a broad and integrated view of health, perceiving the importance of conserving the environment within the National Forest of Araripe for the health and well-being of the local populations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair quality 3aattitudes and opinions 3aclimatic factors 3aconservation areas 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aethnobotany 3aexperts 3ahuman health 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3ainterviews 3amedicinal plants 3anational forests 3aplateaus 3arecreation 3arural communities 3asemiarid zones 3atraditional medicine 3aBrazil1 aPeroni, Nivaldo1 ade AraÃºjo, Elcida Lima1 aHanazaki, Natalia0 tJournal of ethnobiology and ethnomedicine.g2015 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.11-11dBioMed CentralwJournal:2213x1746-42697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-4269-11-113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100004200155245015000197520159800347592002801945650002801973650000802001650001502009650001602024650001602040650001302056650001802069650001802087650001702105650000902122650001502131650001502146650001402161650001202175653002302187653001802210653001202228700002802240700002802268700002502296700004202321700002002363700002402383773009902407856009002506852000902596655001202605IND60748258520221117184553.0211017e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074825852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7373732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnanias, Imaculada de Morais Carvalho10aMenthol as anesthetic for juvenile Lophiosilurus alexandri: Induction and recovery time, ventilatory frequency, hematology and blood biochemistry  aAnesthesia is an indispensable procedure during the handling of fish. This work evaluated the effects of menthol as anesthetic for juvenile Lophiosilurus alexandri. Menthol concentrations of 0 (control), 25, 50, 150, 300 and 450Â mgÂ Lâ»Â¹ were tested using 14 animals for each concentration, with each fish being a replicate. Blood was sampled from seven of the juveniles in each group shortly after anesthetic induction and from the other seven at 24Â h post-anesthesia and procedures to collect biometric measures, i.e., handling and air exposure. Induction time showed a linear response plateau effect (LRP) with an inflection point of 142Â mgÂ Lâ»Â¹, while a dose-response relationship was observed among concentrations for recovery time. Ventilatory frequency (VF) during anesthetic induction had a LRP effect with an inflection point of 127Â mgÂ Lâ»Â¹, while during recovery it had a quadratic effect with a maximum point of 305.45Â mgÂ Lâ»Â¹. Fish anesthetized with 50Â mgÂ Lâ»Â¹ of menthol had the lowest hematocrit values (PÂ <Â 0.05), while those exposed to 450Â mgÂ Lâ»Â¹ had the lowest erythrocyte values (PÂ <Â 0.001). Other changes in hemato-biochemical parameters are discussed. Concentrations between 50 and 300Â mgÂ Lâ»Â¹ of menthol were able to induce deep anesthesia in juvenile L. alexandri with induction and recovery times considered ideal for fish. The use of 50Â mgÂ Lâ»Â¹ of menthol was able to reduce VF during induction and recovery and also prevent increased plasma glucose, with little influence on hematological and biochemical parameters after handling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLophiosilurus alexandri 3aair 3aanesthesia 3aanesthetics 3aaquaculture 3abiometry 3ablood glucose 3adose response 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3ahematocrit 3ahematology 3ajuveniles 3amenthol 0aMenthol anesthesia 0aâpacamÃ£â 0aWelfare1 ade Melo, Caroline Lopes1 aCosta, Deliane Cristina1 aFerreira, Andre Lima1 aFerreira Martins, Edenilce de FÃ¡tima1 aTakata, Rodrigo1 aLuz, Ronald Kennedy0 tAquaculture.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 546 p.737373-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7373733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009500170300001600265520154300281592002801824650002401852650002101876650002501897650001301922650001601935650001201951650001501963650002001978650002001998700003502018773010202053856008102155852000902236655001202245IND60124465320221120110817.0150427e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012446532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10886-015-0555-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoachim, Christoph10aDoes the Aphid Alarm Pheromone (E)-Î²-farnesene Act as a Kairomone under Field Conditions?  ap. 267-275.  aInsect natural enemies use several environmental cues for host/prey finding, and adjust their foraging behavior according to these signals. In insects, such cues are mainly chemical, derived from the host plant or the prey itself. The aphid alarm pheromone, (E)-Î²-farnesene (EBF), is believed to be such a cue, because several aphid enemies are able to perceive EBF and show attractant behavior. These studies are, however, based mainly on electroantennogram or olfactometer assays, and often use unnaturally high pheromone concentrations. It is, therefore, unclear if EBF is used to locate prey in the field when only naturally released amounts are present. We monitored the frequencies and durations of plant visits by aphid natural enemies in the field using long-duration camera observations. By placing pheromone releasers emitting no, natural or exaggerated amounts of EBF next to small colonies of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum), we analyzed if EBF presence altered long-range foraging behavior of natural enemies. Thirteen potential groups of aphid natural enemies were observed in 720Â hr of analyzed video data. There was no effect of EBF on the number of predator visits to an aphid colony, or on predator patch residence times. The number of plant visits increased at exaggerated EBF amounts but not at natural EBF levels. We conclude that while there may be potential for use of high EBF concentrations for agricultural pest management strategies, an ecological role of EBF as a kairomone in a natural context is doubtful.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3aalarm pheromones 3aelectroantennography 3aforaging 3ahost plants 3ainsects 3akairomones 3anatural enemies 3apest management1 aWeisser, W.

Leaf traits of wheat play an important role in directing fog water through leaf rolling and leaf angle into the root zone, where it can be stored for consumption. Wheat leaf traits can enhance fog capturing under drought stress. To examine this, 200 wheat genotypes were characterized for leaf rolling and leaf angle under optimal conditions in the field using a randomized complete block design. Seven different phenotypic combinations for leaf traits were observed. A core set of 44 genotypes was evaluated under drought stress. RESULTS: Results show that variability for leaf traits existed among genotypes. An association was found between leaf rolling and leaf angle, moisture capturing, physiological parameters, and yield contributing traits using correlation. Physiological parameters, especially water use efficiency, were positively correlated with grain yield and moisture capturing at both growth stages. The genotypes (G11 at tillering and G24 at booting phonological phases) with inward to twisting type rolling and erect to semi-erect leaf angle capture more water (12â20%) within the root zone. Twenty-one genotypes were selected based on moisture capturing efficiency and evaluated for leaf surface wettability. Association was found between fog capturing and wettability. This shows that it was due to the leaf repellency validated from static contact angle measurements. CONCLUSION: These results will give insights into fog capturing and the development of drought-tolerant crops in the semi-arid and arid regions.  aPublisher supplied data  a958cPunjab Agriculture Research Board 3aarid zones 3acontact angle 3adrought tolerance 3agrain yield 3aleaf angle 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3arhizosphere 3atillering 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3awettability 3awheat1 aAli, Zulfiqar1 aHabib-ur-Rahman, Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2823-99591 aHakeem, Sadia1 aKhalid, Muhammad Arslan0 tBotanical studies.g2022 Dec., v. 63, no. 1 p.13-13dSpringer Nature SingaporewJournal:22891x1999-31107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40529-022-00343-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010000172300002000272520191500292592002802207650002202235650002002257650001302277650002002290650001902310650002302329650003402352650002202386650001302408650002502421700003002446700002102476700007302497773011602570856008402686852000902770655001202779IND60613011120180928000000.0180911e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061301112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b018272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrederick, Esther10aTwo-Dimensional versus Three-Dimensional Self-Assembly of a Series of 5-Alkoxyisophthalic Acids  ap. 10739-10747.  aPhysisorbed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been suggested as potential models for three-dimensional (3D) crystallization. This work studies the effect of altering the chain length of 5-alkoxyisophthalic acid (CâISA) on self-assembled morphology in both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D to explore the extent comparisons can be drawn between dimensions. Previous studies of 5-alkoxyisophthalic acid at solidâliquid interfaces (2D) reported different morphologies for CâISA and CâISA-alkoxy chains on the one hand and CââISA and CââISA on the other. Independently, also in 3D a dependence of morphology on chain length has been reported, including an unexpected inclusion of a solvent in the 3D morphology of CâISA, while the previous reports of 2D self-assembly were driven only by moleculeâmolecule and moleculeâsubstrate interactions. However, a complete set of data for comparison has been missing. Here, we report scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and molecular dynamics simulations performed for CâISA self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and STM imaging of CâISAâCâISA SAMs, to further examine self-assembly behavior in 2D. In 3D, X-ray diffraction analysis of CâISA single crystals was carried out to complete the data set. With a complete set of data, it was observed that regardless of the dimension, short-chain-length CâISAs formed H-bonding-dominated structures, mid-chain-length CâISAs exhibited solvent-dependent morphologies, and long-chain-length CâISAs displayed van der Waals-dominated solvent-independent structures. However, the transition point among morphologies occurred at different chain lengths in 2D and 3D regardless of the dominant interaction. The results of this study inform the design of 2D films and guide the application of knowledge from physisorbed SAMs to 3D systems, including mixed-dimensional (2D/3D) van der Waals heterostructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3amolecular dynamics 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3asimulation models 3asolvents 3avan der Waals forces1 aCojal GonzÃ¡lez, JosÃ© D.1 aRabe, JÃ¼rgen P.1 aBernasek, S.

The results of X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared transmission spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the simultaneous formation of cubic phase silver nanoparticles and reduction of GO through the electrodeposition process. Field emission scanning electron microscope images showed a uniform distribution of nanometer-sized silver nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution on the RGO sheets, which could only be achieved using silver ammonia complex instead of silver nitrate as precursor. The composite deposited on ITO exhibited notable electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of HâOâ, leading to an enzymeless electrochemical sensor with a fast amperometric response time less than 2s. The corresponding calibration curve of the current response showed a linear detection range of 0.1â100mM (RÂ²=0.9992) while the limit of detection was estimated to be 5Î¼M.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aammonia 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindium 3ananosilver 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asilver 3asilver nitrate1 aHuang, N.M.1 aLim, H.N.1 aZakaria, R.1 aYin, Chun-Yang0 tCarbon.g2013 Oct., v. 62 p.405-412dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01984naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245008200172300001600254520072000270592002800990650001601018650002101034650002201055650002401077650002101101650002901122650002601151653002101177653002601198653001501224653002101239653001701260653002501277653001601302653002201318700001501340700001901355773009101374856008801465852000901553655001201562IND60085308920221119145900.0161021e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008530892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2013.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Zhanglin10aEngineering of transcriptional regulators enhances microbial stress tolerance  ap. 986-991.  aBoth prokaryotes and eukaryotes have pyramid-shaped hierarchical regulatory networks that control gene transcription, enabling the cell to respond to natural environmental changes.

In a first step (<10 Î¼M), IBU electrostatically adsorbs to the lipid headgroups and gradually decreases the interfacial potential. This first step helps to facilitate the second step (10â300 Î¼M), in which hydrophobic insertion of the drug occurs. The second step disrupts the packing of the lipid acyl chains and expands the area per lipid. In a final step, above 300 Î¼M IBU, the lipid membrane begins to solubilize, resulting in a detergent-like effect. The results described herein were obtained by a combination of fluorescence binding assays, vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy, and Langmuir monolayer compression experiments. By introducing trimethylammonium-propane, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids as well as cholesterol, we demonstrated that both the chemistry of the lipid headgroups and the packing of lipid acyl chains can substantially influence the interactions between IBU and the membranes. Moreover, different membrane chemistries can alter particular steps in the binding interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholesterol 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 3aibuprofen 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aspectroscopy1 aSendecki, Anne M.1 aPullanchery, Saranya1 aHuang, Da1 aYang, Tinglu1 aCremer, Paul S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8524-04380 tLangmuir.g2018 Aug. 27, v. 34, no. 36 p.10782-10792dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b018783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00918naa a2200217 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245003500167300001600202520020200218592002800420650002700448773012500475856007900600852000900679655001200688IND60300767220221117204839.0150703e20121012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030076722DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12279592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWellerstein, Alex10aHeterodoxy and Its Discontents  ap. 194-195.  aThrough an examination of the controversies sparked by best-selling author Immanuel Velikovsky (Worlds in Collision), Gordin considers the shifting location of the boundaries of legitimate science.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions0 tScience.g2012 Oct. 12, v. 338, no. 6104 p.194-195dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12279593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04757naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245018200168300001400350520280000364592002803164650002603192650002103218650002803239650002603267650002103293650002103314650002703335650002603362650001203388650002903400650002603429650002503455650001803480650001303498650002803511650001003539650003203549650001803581650001103599650003703610650002603647650001103673650001603684650001003700650001103710653002103721653001103742653001803753653003703771653001603808653000903824700002003833700001803853700001603871773015203887856008304039852000904122655001204131IND60541465520221120092555.0190401e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054146552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2014.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRatshilivha, N.14aThe variation in antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of acetone leaf extracts of 12 Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae) trees enables the selection of trees with additional uses  ap. 59-64.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the variation in antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the leaf acetone extracts of 12 Moringa oleifera trees harvested in order to select the best material for clonal propagation.A two-fold serial microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against a panel of fungal (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans) and bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) species. The radical scavenging capacity was determined using 2,2 diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH).There was a large variation in antimicrobial activities with MICs between 0.04 and 2.50mg/ml against bacteria and from 0.16 to >2.50mg/ml against fungi. For samples harvested in winter: trees L3 and LP2 had significant activity against E. faecalis (MIC 0.08mg/ml) and E. coli (MIC 0.04mg/ml). Trees L5, LP1 and LP6 had weak activity against E. coli (MICs 1.25 and 2.50mg/ml), S. aureus (MIC 1.25mg/ml), and E. faecalis (MIC 2.50mg/ml), while other samples had moderate activity against the four bacteria (MICs 0.16â0.63mg/ml). From samples collected in summer: L5 (MIC 0.08mg/ml), L6 (MIC 0.08mg/ml after 1h incubation), LP1 (MICs 0.08mg/ml), LP2 (MICs 0.08mg/ml after 1h incubation), LP4 (0.08mg/ml) and LP5 (MICs 0.04 and 0.08mg/ml) had significant activity against E. faecalis (L5, L6, LP1, LP2, LP4, and LP5), S. aureus (LP1, and LP5), and E. coli (LP2, and LP5), respectively. Other extracts had weak antibacterial activity with MICs ranging from 0.16 to 0.63mg/ml. Most of the samples harvested in winter had moderate antifungal activity: L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, LP1, LP2, and LP3 had moderate activity against C. albicans (ATCC strains) with MIC of 0.63mg/ml in all cases while L2, L3 and L4 as well as L6, LP1, LP2, LP3, LP5 and LP6 against A. fumigatus (MICs 0.63mg/ml) and C. neoformans (MICs 0.63mg/ml), respectively. Apart from L1 (MIC 0.31mg/ml), L2, L3 and LP6 (MICs 0.63mg/ml in all cases) with moderate activity, all the samples collected during summer had weak activity against A. fumigatus (MICs 1.25â2.50mg/ml). All the extracts had a low radical scavenging activity with the IC50 values ranging from 34.72 to 109.62Î¼g/ml, compared to the reference standard l-ascorbic acid (IC50 2.41Î¼g/ml). This may be related to the extractant used.The large variation in antimicrobial activity and antioxidant activities of 24 acetone leaf extracts of 12 M. oleifera trees may lead to the selection of clonal material to serve as a source of propagation materials. Successful propagation and growth of tree LP with very good activity against E. coli and a high total activity could provide an additional use of this valuable plant species to rural people.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aCandida albicans 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aEscherichia coli 3aMoringa oleifera 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aacetone 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifungal properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abacteria 3afree radical scavengers 3afungi 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apropagation materials 3asummer 3atree growth 3atrees 3awinter 0aMoringa oleifera 0aLeaves 0aAntimicrobial 0aMinimum inhibitory concentration 0aAntioxidant 0aDPPH1 aAwouafack, M.D.1 adu Toit, E.S.1 aEloff, J.N.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2014 May, v. 92 p.59-64dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2014.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011700169300001600286500001100302520151300313592002801826596001501854596002401869596002401893650002201917650001301939650001801952650002101970650001901991700006102010700002102071773015302092856008302245852000902328655001202337IND60777574220221119185117.0220517e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077757422DNAL7 a10.1007/s40626-022-00245-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalviz, Yutcelia14aThe biological concept of stress revisited: relations of stress and memory of plants as a matter of spaceâtime  ap. 239-264.  aReview  aAll biotic and abiotic factors can act as stressors as surveyed here. In 1973 H. Selye has introduced a âbiological stress conceptâ in medical science, which was subsequently adopted in plant biology and physiological ecology. Depending on the strength of stressors and the duration of their action, there is stimulating eustress and destructive distress. According to the stress concept the onset of stress elicits an alarm phase, which then leads the living systems into phases of recovery, hardening and resistance in the case of eustress and of exhaustion in the case of distress. Additionally, de-hardening and repair phases can be expressed. Stressors can also induce memory by priming living organisms or by being stored and recalled for recurrent events of stress. Moreover, the biological clock is involved. The dynamics of the phases, the bridges of the memory and the recordings of the clock underline the deeply fundamental role of time in the performance of living systems under stress. However, this performance is embedded in space, i.e., at the levels of organization of both the organisms and their environment at a range of spatial scales. We need space as a dimension additional to time, where time and space are correlated. In this essay we, therefore, advance the rendition to a âspaceâtime biological stress conceptâ. The time dimension is widened by adding memory of recurrent events. The correlated spatial dimension is added by considering different levels of organization.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCAPES  a302715/2018-5cCNPq  a404817/2021-1cCNPq 3abiological clocks 3adistress 3aecophysiology 3aplant physiology 3aspace and time1 aSouza, Gustavo M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6754-48601 aLÃ¼ttge, Ulrich,0 tTheoretical and Experimental Plant Physiology.g2022 June, v. 34, no. 2 p.239-264dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22892x2197-00257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40626-022-00245-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01226naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245007900160300001400239520029300253592002800546650001100574650001800585650001600603653001300619653001600632653002200648653001200670773015600682856007700838852000900915655001200924IND60761900320221122034003.0220104e20211130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076190032DNAL7 a10.18476/2021.5247682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrimm, Roland10aNew and little known species of Tenebrionidae (Coleoptera) from Borneo (9)  ap. 49-53.  aNesocaedius borneensis sp. n.

This study identified further roles for this compound in the sexual behavior of A. obtectus. Earlier observations revealed that males touched females with their antennae while tandem-running with them and initiated mounting and copulation, whereas they showed no such behavior toward other males. A series of subsequent laboratory choice tests were set up to establish if certain cuticular compounds aid contact sex recognition in A. obtectus. Males chose virgin females over other males. The activity toward females could be eliminated by rinsing with hexane, but was regained by application of female extract onto previously rinsed females. Gas chromatographic (GC) comparison of hexane extracts revealed the presence of two male-specific compounds, methyl (E,R)-2,4,5-tetradecatrienoate and octadecanal, which were absent from the behaviorally active female samples. Of the two compounds, methyl (E,R)-2,4,5-tetradecatrienoate was found to be responsible for the inhibition of male sexual behavior, similar to that observed with crude male extracts applied to virgin females. Furthermore, males preferred virgin over mated females. GC analyses revealed the presence of methyl (E,R)-2,4,5-tetradecatrienoate in mated females in amounts sufficient to curtail mating attempts. It appears that methyl (E,R)-2,4,5-tetradecatrienoate, besides being a male-produced sex pheromone, acts as a male-recognition signal in A. obtectus. Males also transfer it onto females during mating, resulting in mated females being avoided by courting males.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthoscelides obtectus 3aChrysomelidae 3aantennae 3acopulation 3acourtship 3adry beans 3agas chromatography 3ahexane 3amales 3asex pheromones 3avirgin females1 aPowers, Stephen J.1 aCaulfield, John C.1 aPickett, J.

In this study, an advanced SWE retrieval algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method was developed. This method samples the posterior multiple-layer snow properties according to the likelihood of the brightness temperature (TB) simulation with the actual TB observations. The Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks with improved Born approximation (MEMLS-IBA) was used as the observation model. Using a globally applicable method to produce prior estimates of snow properties, the retrieval approach is called the Bayesian Algorithm for SWE Estimation with Passive Microwave measurements (BASE-PM), and was applied on 48 snowpits at SodankylÃ¤, Finland; Churchill, Canada and Colorado, US. The result shows that the root mean squared (RMS) error of the retrieved SWE is 42.7mm excluding two outliers, and is 30.8mm if the outliers as well as six deep snowpits from Colorado are excluded. This accuracy approximately meets the 30-mm requirement of Integrated Global Observing Strategy for shallow snow. The poor performance for the outlier and deep snowpits is explained. Additional experiments using more accurate priors show that SWE retrieval accuracy can be improved with local snowcover knowledge, e.g. if historical snowpit measurements or snow process model simulations are available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aMonte Carlo method 3aalgorithms 3aremote sensing 3asimulation models 3asnow 3asnowpack 3atemperature 3aCanada 3aColorado 3aFinland 0aPassive microwave remote sensing 0aSnow water equivalent 0aRetrieval algorithm1 aDurand, Michael T.1 aVander Jagt, Benjamin J.1 aLiu, Desheng0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2017 Apr., v. 192 p.150-165dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01679naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002700137245013700164300001600301500002000317520066700337592002801004650000901032650001001041650002001051650000901071650001801080650002601098651001801124773014301142856007101285852000901356655001201365IND60680388720221119195017.0200105e199308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068038872DNAL7 a10.2307/12435712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWohlgenant, Michael K.10aDistribution of Gains from Research and Promotion in MultiâStage Production Systems: The Case of the U.S. Beef and Pork Industries  ap. 642-651.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA producerâfinanced program that leads to either an increase in retail demand from promotion or a decrease in marketing costs from research will generate returns to producers that are generally smaller than returns generated through an equivalent change in producer supply from research.

The ice-water interface at the freezing front was concave when viewed from the ice side, because the glass beads were preferentially wetted by the liquid. The size and number of liquid inclusions decreased with distance behind the freezing front. More liquid is trapped by smaller glass beads. The liquid inclusions are probably enriched in soluble impurities. No tendency for pressure buildup or ice lense formation was observed, perhaps because large particles were used. It is very important to extend these observations to other conditions, especially to smaller particle sizes.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil temperature 3afreezing 3asoil temperature regimes0 tSoil science.g1985 Jan., v. 139, no. 1 p.13-20dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19850624c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03321naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011100174300001800285520197700303592002802280650001302308650001402321650001402335650001302349650001402362650001102376650001902387650001902406650001302425650002102438650001202459650001802471650002102489650001702510650001302527650001802540650001302558653001302571653001802584653001302602653001702615653001302632773009902645856008602744852000902830655001202839IND60779130520221121234154.0220621e20220729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077913052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.05.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarciani, Dante J.10aEffects of N-acylation on the immune adjuvanticity of analogs of the Quillaja saponins derivative GPI-0100  ap. 4169-4173.  aModification of the 3-glucuronic acid (GlcA) residue from the Quillaja saponin (QS) adjuvants by N-acylation, yields derivatives with linear alkylamides that show structural and functional changes. Structural, since the relatively unreactive added hydrophobic alkyl chains may modify these glycosidesâ conformation and micellar structure. Functional, because altering the availability of proposed pharmacophores, like fucose (Fucp) and aldehyde groups, to interact with their cellular receptors, may change these glycosidesâ adjuvanticity. While deacylated QS (DS-QS) adjuvants bias the response toward a sole anti-inflammatory Th2 immunity against an antigen, their N-alkylated derivatives carrying octyl to dodecylamide residues, modify that response to a pro-inflammatory Th1 immunity. As shown by their IgG2a/IgG1 titer ratios, which are higher than those for Th2 immunity. A result of the fact that in mice, the IgG2a levels are dependent on the direct influence of secreted interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), a crucial Th1 cytokine. But addition of the longer and more lipophilic tetradecylamide group, yields derivatives that like DS-QS induce Th2 immunity, as shown by their low IgG2a/IgG1 ratio. Results that imply that changes in these analogsâ conformation and micellar structure, would affect the immunomodulatory properties or adjuvanticity of N-acylated DS-QS. Physical changes that may alter the availability of groups like Fucp, to bind to its presumed dendritic cellsâ lectin receptor DC-SIGN; an essential step in the stimulation of Th2 immunity. Structural properties that in an aqueous environment, would depend on these glycosidesâ balance of their hydrophilic and lipophilic moieties (HLB), and the interactions of the newly introduced alkyl chain with the native QSâ lipophilic triterpene aglycone and hydrophilic oligosaccharide chains. A situation that would explain these new derivativesâ qualitative and quantitative changes in adjuvanticity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuillaja 3aadjuvants 3aaldehydes 3aantigens 3acytokines 3afucose 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmunity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alectins 3alipophilicity 3aoligosaccharides 3apharmacology 3asaponins 3atriterpenoids 3avaccines 0aSaponins 0aAdjuvanticity 0aMicelles 0aInflammatory 0aAcylated0 tVaccine.g2022 July 29, v. 40, no. 31 p.4169-4173dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.05.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009600164300001600260520097700276592002801253596005901281650002001340650001401360650002501374650001601399650001001415650002001425650002701445650002101472650001501493650002101508650001601529650001901545650002901564700001801593700005901611773015301670856008301823852000901906655001201915IND60777574520221119185506.0220517e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077757452DNAL7 a10.1007/s40626-022-00241-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ya-Qi10aDNA methylation regulates the expression of salt tolerance gene FtNHX1 in Tartary buckwheat  ap. 185-195.  aDNA methylation is an important part of epigenetics, which can regulate gene expression, cell differentiation, growth and development in plants. In this study, the salt-sensitive variety Chuanqiao No.2 of Tartary buckwheat was used as experimental material. Different concentrations of 5-azaC were used to infect Tartary buckwheat leaves and combined with gene expression analysis, it is determined that the appropriate concentration of 5-azaC treatment is 100Â ÂµM. DNA methylation often occurs in the gene promoter region, causing gene transcription changes, and thus regulating the response to salt stress. By CpG island prediction and promoter region methylation site analysis of FtNHX1 gene, it was found that FtNHX1 gene expression was significantly regulated by DNA methylation. Moreover, after salt stress for 6Â h, DNA methylation rate of FtNHX1 gene was increased. This increase of DNA methylation rate in a short time may inhibit over-expression of FtNHX1 gene.  aPublisher supplied data  a31371552cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aDNA methylation 3abuckwheat 3acell differentiation 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3agenomic islands 3agrowth and development 3aplant physiology 3aprediction 3apromoter regions 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3atranscription (genetics)1 aSong, Jin-Nan1 aYang, Hong-Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4351-99560 tTheoretical and Experimental Plant Physiology.g2022 June, v. 34, no. 2 p.185-195dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22892x2197-00257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40626-022-00241-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03531naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100002200186245011000208300001100318506007600329520195300405592002802358506003702386650001902423650001502442650000902457650001802466650001602484650001102500650001102511650000802522650003602530650000902566650000902575650001902584650001002603650001902613650001702632650001002649650001002659650000902669651000902678700002202687700002102709700001602730700002702746773012702773856008002900852000902980655001202989IND60556180020221207054850.0211117e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055618002DNAL7 a259713042pmid7 aPMC44300202pmcid7 a10.1186/1746-4269-11-142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDembÃ©lÃ©, Urbain10aUse-value and importance of socio-cultural knowledge on Carapa procera trees in the Sudanian zone in Mali  ap. 14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Carapa procera is a native oil tree species with multipurpose values traditionally exploited by the local population in Southern Mali. This study focused on the assessment of local knowledge about the use of Carapa procera. METHODS: Semi-structured ethnobotanical questionnaires were conducted among the ethnic groups Senufo, Fulani and Bambara in two localities in the Sudanian zone in Mali. Use values among these ethnic groups and gender were evaluated. RESULTS: This study showed that Carapa procera is a species with multiple uses and high use values. According to the consensus value for plant parts (CPP), the nuts constituted 57% of exploited plant parts followed by bark and leaves (12%), wood and roots (7%), mistletoes (4%) and gum (1%). The use diversity (UD) values of Carapa procera showed a high proportion of cosmetic (UDâ=â0.49) and therapeutic (UDâ=â0.36) uses. The UD for therapeutic uses was higher for ethnic groups in ZiÃ©korodougou than in Niankorobougou. In contrast, the UD for cosmetic uses was higher for ethnic groups in Niankorobougou than in ZiÃ©korodougou. Comparative analysis between ethnic groups revealed that the highest UD for cosmetic uses (0.63) was observed in the Bambara ethnic group, whereas the highest UD for therapeutic uses (0.39) was obtained in the Senufo ethnic group. The UD showed that cosmetic uses were higher for women than for men in both locations. Men in ZiÃ©korodougou had the highest level of knowledge regarding plant parts used, forms of use and the specific reasons for using Carapa procera. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the sociocultural importance of Carapa procera. In the light of its multipurpose uses, the promotion and enhancement of Carapa procera can provide significant socio-economic benefits to local people. In this perspective, it is necessary to implement conservation strategies and sustainable management through domestication of the species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCarapa procera 3aSantalales 3abark 3adomestication 3aethnobotany 3agender 3aleaves 3amen 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anuts 3aoils 3aquestionnaires 3aroots 3asocioeconomics 3atherapeutics 3atrees 3awomen 3awood 3aMali1 aLykke, Anne Mette1 aKone, YÃ©niziÃ©,1 aTeme, Bino,1 aKouyatÃ©, Amadou MalÃ©0 tJournal of ethnobiology and ethnomedicine.g2015 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.14-14dBioMed CentralwJournal:2213x1746-42697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-4269-11-143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245008500163300001600248520179100264592002802055650001802083650001302101650002002114650001902134650001702153650001102170650001702181650001402198650001302212650001202225650001302237650001402250653002402264653002902288653001902317653001602336700002302352700003002375700001802405700001902423700002102442700002202463700002302485700001902508773017602527856007702703852000902780655001202789IND60761900520221122044346.0220104e20211230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076190052DNAL7 a10.5818/JHMS-07-20202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Ashley R.10aCross-Matching the San CristÃ³bal GalÃ¡pagos Tortoise (Chelonoidis chathamensis)  ap. 315-320.  aCross-matching of the giant tortoise of San CristÃ³bal (Chelonoidis chathamensis) was employed to determine if erythrocyte agglutination occurs in individuals with no transfusion history after exposure to plasma from a conspecific individual. The main islands in the GalÃ¡pagos archipelago are inhabited by unique species of tortoises. On the largest island, Isabela, there are multiple species isolated by volcanic formations creating unique separate ecosystems. With plans to begin the reintroduction of C. chathamensis into the wild, as well as the recent rediscovery of the Fernandina giant tortoise (Chelonoidis phantasticus), appropriate veterinary care is paramount, and having every medical contingency, especially vehicular/tortoise interaction, under consideration is important. Cross-matching the San CristÃ³bal giant tortoise was a first step in exploring the compatibility of blood transfusions between conspecifics. Blood was drawn from the jugular vein of 20 juvenile tortoises with the use of a heparinized syringe and each sample was coded. The blood was centrifuged, the erythrocytes washed (five times), and then the erythrocyte pellet and plasma were used for the major cross-match procedure. The erythrocytes represented the âdonorâ tortoise and the plasma represented the ârecipientâ tortoise. Each tortoise was cross-matched against itself as an auto control and then 1â5 times against another randomly assigned individual at two incubation temperatures, 23Â°C (73.4Â°F) and 34Â°C (93.2Â°F). No agglutination was found in any of the trials. As predicted, fibrin and thrombocyte clumps occurred in all trials. Additional research that includes different species of tortoises is the next important step to enhance our knowledge of antigen compatibilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagglutination 3aantigens 3ablood platelets 3aconspecificity 3aerythrocytes 3afibrin 3ajugular vein 3ajuveniles 3amedicine 3asurgery 3asyringes 3atortoises 0aGalÃ¡pagos tortoise 0aChelonoidis chathamensis 0across-matching 0atransfusion1 aHuffman, Amanda M.1 aMuÃ±oz-PÃ©rez, Juan Pablo1 aVaden, Shelly1 aDÃ­az, Rafael,1 aVasquez, Gabriel1 aDonnelly, Kyle A.1 aPÃ¡ez-Rosas, Diego1 aLewbart, Greg,0 tJournal of herpetological medicine and surgery.g2021 Dec. 30, v. 31, no. 4 p.315-320dAssociation of Reptilian and Amphibian VeterinarianswJournal:26741x1529-96517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5818/JHMS-07-20203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245012200177300001600299520130200315592002801617650001501645650001901660650002501679650002301704650002201727650002601749650002101775650001901796650001201815650001301827650001201840650001201852653002501864653002301889653002101912653002501933653002201958700002201980700001902002700002102021700002002042700002602062700002702088773011202115856008502227852000902312655001202321IND60638009820221116214938.0190516e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063800982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2019.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmirilargani, Mohammad10aMolecular separation using poly (styrene-co-maleic anhydride) grafted to Î³-alumina: Surface versus pore modification  ap. 298-306.  aHere, we report the covalent coupling of poly (styrene-co-maleic anhydride) onto Î³-alumina to develop high-performance organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) membranes. A high molecular weight (Mw) alternating copolymer of maleic anhydride (MA) and styrene (St) was synthesized and directly grafted to the Î³-alumina membrane, while commercially available low Mw random copolymers of St and MA were also investigated. We show that solute rejection and membrane permeability strongly depend on the nature of the applied copolymer. In particular, the Mw of the copolymer applied is potentially the key for improving the membrane performance. When a high Mw copolymer was applied, the grafted layer covered the surface of the membrane. This results in membranes with significantly improved rejection, while maintaining a high permeability. In contrast, we observed pore grafting by applying low Mw copolymers, which resulted in membranes with slightly higher rejection and dramatically lower permeability compared to unmodified membrane. The best results were obtained by grafting Î³-alumina with a high Mw alternating copolymer. These membranes showed a solute rejection of 98% for Sudan Black B (457â¯gâ¯molâ1) in toluene, while the permeability remained high at 2.9â¯Lâ¯mâ2â¯hâ1 barâ1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSudan dyes 3aaluminum oxide 3aartificial membranes 3acomposite polymers 3amaleic anhydrides 3amembrane permeability 3amolecular weight 3ananofiltration 3asolutes 3asolvents 3astyrene 3atoluene 0aMolecular separation 0aCopolymer grafting 0aAlumina membrane 0aSurface modification 0aPore modification1 aMerlet, Renaud B.1 aChu, Liangyong1 aNijmeijer, Arian1 aWinnubst, Louis1 ade Smet, Louis C.P.M.1 aSudhÃ¶lter, Ernst J.R.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 July 15, v. 582 p.298-306dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245015000180520160600330592002801936650002301964650002501987650001902012650001802031650001702049653002702066653005802093653006302151653000902214653004402223653002102267700002302288700001702311700001902328700001702347773013202364856009002496852000902586655001202595IND60744447520221118031407.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074444752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2021.1051162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroadhurst, C.

Particularly important are mixed lipids containing palmitic or stearic acid and arachidonic or docosahexaenoic acid. Gradient temperature Raman spectroscopy (GTRS) applies the temperature gradients utilized in differential scanning calorimetry to Raman spectroscopy, providing a straightforward technique to identify molecular rearrangements and phase transitions. Herein we utilize GTRS for 1-18:0, 2-20:4n-6 PC; 1-18:0 2-22:6n-3 PC; and 1-18:0, 2-18:0 PC from â80 to 50 Â°C temperatures. 20 Mb three-dimensional data arrays with 0.2 Â°C increments and first/second derivatives allowed detailed vibrational mode assignment and analysis. Samples were analyzed neat and with molecular hydration. Previously reported phase transitions for hydrated 18:0â20:4PC and 18:0â22:6PC and numerous spectral differences resulting from hydration and the double bond structure were clearly observed. Molecular models showed that the addition of minimal water molecules results in significant structural differences compared to the neat molecules; 18:0â22:6PC is strikingly compact with water when viewed from the hydrophilic end. This precise Raman data cannot be observed in typically utilized fully hydrated vesicle samples, however the improved GTRS will allow for more precise analysis in fully hydrated vesicles because the underlying modes in the unavoidably broadened spectra can be identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3ahydrophilicity 3aphospholipids 3astearic acid 0aPhospholipid structure 0a1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 0a2-1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 0aGTRS 0aGradient temperature Raman spectroscopy 0aArachidonic acid1 aSchmidt, Walter F.1 aQin, Jianwei1 aChao, Kuanglin1 aKim, Moon S.0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2021 Sept., v. 239 p.105116-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2021.1051163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245014300208300002000351520133000371592002801701650003701729650001201766650001201778650002301790650002101813650002201834650000901856650001301865650001801878650002301896650001301919650001301932650001401945650001001959650001201969650000801981700001701989700005902006700002602065700005602091700002202147700005702169700005702226700006402283700002202347700002202369700005702391773011602448856008402564852000902648655001202657IND60613011720180928000000.0180911e20180810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061301172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b020232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNafria, Raquel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3254-161610aGrowth of AuâPd2Sn Nanorods via Galvanic Replacement and Their Catalytic Performance on Hydrogenation and Sonogashira Coupling Reactions  ap. 10634-10643.  aColloidal PdâSn and AuâPdâSn nanorods (NRs) with tuned size were produced by the reduction of Pd and Sn salts in the presence of size- and shape-controlling agents and the posterior growth of Au tips through a galvanic replacement reaction. PdâSn and AuâPdâSn NRs exhibited high catalytic activity toward quasi-homogeneous hydrogenation of alkenes (styrene and 1-octene) and alkynes (phenylacetylene and 1-octyne) in dichloromethane. AuâPdâSn NRs showed higher activity than PdâSn for 1-octene, 1-octyne, and phenylacetylene. In AuâPdâSn heterostructures, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy evidenced an electron donation from the PdâSn NR to the Au tips. Such heterostructures showed distinct catalytic behavior in the hydrogenation of compounds containing a triple bond such as tolan. This can be explained by the aurophilicity of triple bonds. To further study this effect, PdâSn and AuâPdâSn NRs were also tested in the Sonogashira coupling reaction between iodobenzene and phenylacetylene in N,N-dimethylformamide. At low concentration, this reaction provided the expected product, tolan. However, at high concentration, more reduced products such as stilbene and 1,2-diphenylethane were also obtained, even without the addition of Hâ. A mechanism for this unexpected reduction is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalkenes 3aalkynes 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3adimethylformamide 3agold 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3amethylene chloride 3ananogold 3ananorods 3apalladium 3asalts 3astyrene 3atin1 aLuo, Zhishan1 aIbÃ¡Ã±ez, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5013-28431 aMartÃ­-SÃ nchez, Sara1 aYu, Xiaoting1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0457-40471 ade la Mata, Maria1 aLlorca, Jordi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7447-95821 aArbiol, Jordi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0695-17261 aKovalenko, Maksym V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6396-89381 aGrabulosa, Arnald1 aMuller, Guillermo1 aCabot, Andreu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7533-32510 tLangmuir.g2018 Aug. 10, v. 34, no. 36 p.10634-10643dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b020233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014700162500002200309520180600331592002802137650001302165650001502178650001602193650001302209650002402222650001102246650001502257650001002272650001902282650001502301650001602316651002102332653002102353653002602374653002202400653003902422653001302461653002002474700002202494700002302516700001802539773007502557856008102632852000902713655001202722IND60563704620221119113909.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056370462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2017.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ebony10aImpact of the OMI aerosol optical depth on analysis increments through coupled meteorologyâaerosol data assimilation for an Asian dust storm  aPre-press version  aIn this study, we investigate the possibility of using a coupled meteorology-aerosol data assimilation (DA) to improve the forecast of a dust storm. We interfaced a coupled meteorologyâchemistry model (WRF-Chem) with a hybrid variational-ensemble DA system â the Maximum Likelihood Ensemble Filter (MLEF). The system is strongly coupled, in the sense that cross-covariances between meteorological and aerosol control variables are used in DA. Experiments are conducted for an Asian dust storm case that occurred over the Korean Peninsula on 13 May 2011, by assimilating both meteorological and aerosol observations. Meteorological observations include the conventional ones and the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) satellite radiances, whereas aerosol observations contain aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500nm from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). In the control experiment (CTNL), we assimilated only meteorological observations. In the AODDA experiment, we assimilated both AOD and meteorological observations. Control variables of DA include both meteorological and aerosol ones. Our results indicate that meteorological observations can partially contribute to the change of aerosol initial conditions and vice versa, implying a cross-component impact of observations, and hence improving the utility of observations in coupled DA. The forecast comparison indicates a consistently improved fit to AOD observations after 24 h of DA. In addition, uncertainty of the 24-hour aerosol forecast in AODDA decreases significantly in local regions â by up to â¼21.6% in terms of innovations, and up to â¼81.4% in terms of square root forecast error covariance. These results are encouraging for future applications of ensemble DA with strongly coupled meteorologyâchemistry modeling system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3acovariance 3adust storms 3ahumidity 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aozone 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3auncertainty 3aKorean Peninsula 0aAsian dust storm 0aAerosol optical depth 0aData assimilation 0aMaximum Likelihood Ensemble Filter 0aWRF-Chem 0aStrong coupling1 aÅ½upanski, Milija1 aÅ½upanski, Dusanka1 aPark, Seon Ki0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011900170300001300289520163500302592002801937650002501965650001201990650001402002650001902016650001902035650001102054650001202065650002602077650002502103650001302128650003102141700001702172700002302189700001502212700002202227700001702249773009602266856008102362852000902443655001202452IND60124466120221120074620.0150427e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012446612DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-015-0297-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHegedus, Dwayne D.10aMultiple internal sorting determinants can contribute to the trafficking of cruciferin to protein storage vacuoles  ap. 3-20.  aTrafficking of seed storage proteins to protein storage vacuoles is mediated by carboxy terminal and internal sorting determinants (ISDs). Protein modelling was used to identify candidate ISDs residing near surface-exposed regions in Arabidopsis thaliana cruciferin A (AtCruA). These were verified by AtCruA fusion to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and expression in developing embryos of A. thaliana. As the presence of endogenous cruciferin was found to mask the effects of weaker ISDs, experiments were conducted in a line that was devoid of cruciferin. In total, nine ISDs were discovered and a core determinant defined using a series of alanine scanning and deletion mutant variants. Coupling of functional data from AtCruA ISD-YFP fusions with statistical analysis of the physiochemical properties of analogous regions from several 11/12S globulins revealed that cruciferin ISDs likely adhere to the following rules: (1) ISDs are adjacent to or within hydrophilic, surface-exposed regions that serve to present them on the proteinâs surface; (2) ISDs generally have a hydrophobic character; (3) ISDs tend to have Leu or Ile residues at their core; (4) ISDs are approximately eight amino acids long with the physiochemical consensus [hydrophobic][preferably charged][small or hydrophobic, but not tiny][IL][polar, preferably charged][small, but not charged][hydrophobic, not charged, preferably not polar][hydrophobic, not tiny, preferably not polar]. Microscopic evidence is also presented for the presence of an interconnected protein storage vacuolar network in embryo cells, rather than discreet, individual vacuoles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aalanine 3aglobulins 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3amutants 3aseed storage proteins 3astatistical analysis 3avacuoles 3ayellow fluorescent protein1 aCoutu, Cathy1 aHarrington, Myrtle1 aHope, Brad1 aGerbrandt, Kelsey1 aNikolov, Ivo0 tPlant molecular biology.g2015 May, v. 88, no. 1-2 p.3-20dSpringer-Verlagx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-015-0297-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009700167300001600264520106700280592002801347650001501375650001501390650002001405650001201425650001001437650001101447650001301458650001201471653001501483653002001498653002601518653001401544700001601558700002201574700002201596700002001618700002001638773017601658856008201834852000901916655001201925IND60761900720221122044408.0220104e20211230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076190072DNAL7 a10.5818/JHMS-D-20-00014.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSailler, AnaÃ¯s10aSurgical Management of a Digestive Tract Hernia in a Wild Marsh Frog (Pelophylax ridibundus)  ap. 292-295.  aA wild-caught mature female marsh frog (Pelophylax ridibundus) was presented for a left-sided dorsal swelling. No other abnormalities were detected during the examination. Fine-needle aspiration was non-diagnostic. Baseline hematological and biochemical analyses were within normal reference ranges, and medical imaging did not provide further useful information. Surgical exploration under general anesthesia was performed. The swelling was confirmed to be a digestive tract hernia protruding through a breach of the dorsal muscles and coelomic membrane. Reduction of the hernia was made difficult by the presence of multiple adhesions between the herniated tissue and the coelomic membrane, suggesting a relatively chronic lesion. A traumatic cause was hypothesized. One month later, the animal was considered healed and released back into the wild. Hernias in amphibians are poorly reported in the literature and historically are only found ventrally. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a dorsal hernia in a captive or a wild amphibian.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPelophylax 3aanesthesia 3adigestive tract 3afemales 3afrogs 3ahernia 3amedicine 3asurgery 0aMarsh frog 0amedical imaging 0aPelophylax ridibundus 0aamphibian1 aChai, Norin1 aHuberdeau, Pierre1 aSabatier, Laurent1 aScotti, Thierry1 aBoistel, Renaud0 tJournal of herpetological medicine and surgery.g2021 Dec. 30, v. 31, no. 4 p.292-295dAssociation of Reptilian and Amphibian VeterinarianswJournal:26741x1529-96517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5818/JHMS-D-20-00014.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009700167300001600264520087600280592002801156650002501184650001301209650001301222650001201235650001301247650001701260650001301277650001601290653003301306653003501339653002701374653001901401653002401420700001701444700001801461700001701479700001901496773011201515856008501627852000901712655001201721IND60638010020221122032835.0190516e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063801002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2019.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ju Sung10aMixed matrix membranes with a thermally rearranged polymer and ZIF-8 for hydrogen separation  ap. 381-390.  aMixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with a thermally rearranged (TR) polymer and zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) were prepared in this study. ZIF-8 contributed to not only enhancing gas permeability, but also promoting thermal conversion of TR polymer membranes. As a result, TR ZIF-8 MMMs can be prepared at lower temperatures compared to the original TR polymers. The thermal rearrangement process also increased gas separation properties as it contributes to a tunable cavity size and hour-glass shape cavity distributions. Moreover, interfacial voids between the polymer phase and ZIF crystals which usually occur in most MMMs disappeared during thermal rearrangement of the TR polymer. As a result, the TR ZIF-8 MMMs showed excellent hydrogen separation properties with a H2 permeability of 1,206 Barrer, H2/N2 selectivity of 22.3, and H2/CH4 selectivity of 25.7.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acrystals 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3anitrogen 3apermeability 3apolymers 3atemperature 0aThermally rearranged polymer 0aZeolitic imidazole framework-8 0aMixed matrix membranes 0aGas separation 0aHydrogen separation1 aMoon, Sun Ju1 aWang, Ho Hyun1 aKim, Seungju1 aLee, Young Moo0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 July 15, v. 582 p.381-390dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012400167300001600291520139800307536016301705592002801868596001301896596001501909650004401924650001201968650002201980650001502002650001502017650001402032650001702046650002202063650003702085650001302122650001902135650001902154650001102173650002202184650002102206650000902227650000902236650001702245650001902262653001602281653004002297653002702337653002602364700001902390700001902409773013702428856008502565852000902650655001202659IND60750378920221121182249.0210913e20210831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075037892DNAL7 a10.1080/02773813.2021.19707772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Linhu10aImpregnation of poplar wood with multi-functional composite modifier and induction of in-situ polymerization by heating  ap. 220-228.  aHerein, a modified wood with greatly improved mechanical properties and reduced hygroscopicity was successfully prepared. The effects of the impregnation of multi-functional composite modifier on the chemical, thermal and morphological properties of poplar wood were also studied by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) and Scanning Electron Microscopy- Energy-Dispersive X-ray Analysis (SEM-EDXA). The multi-functional composite modifier was fabricated by methylolurea, dimethylol dihydroxy ethylene urea (DMDHEU), carbamide and silica sol. Cross-linking reaction happened between the wood cell wall and the multi-functional composite modifier. The position peaks in the XRD pattern didnât change obviously, which indicated the crystal structure of cellulose was not noticeably affected by the chemical modification. The FT-IR analysis showed that the intensity of hydroxyl (-OH) and carbonyl (Câ=âO) absorption peaks decreased, which was attributed to the -NHCHâOH of the modifier reacted with the hydroxyl and carbonyl of the wood. Meanwhile the Si-O-Si bond and Si-O-C bond formed between the wood structure and silica sol by in-situ polymerization. The TGA curve showed the thermal stability of the modified wood. The micrographs and major elements of the untreated and modified wood were observed by SEM-EDXA.  afsThe study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51803093) and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20180770).  aPublisher supplied data  a51803093  aBK20180770 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPopulus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3acell walls 3acellulose 3acrosslinking 3acrystal structure 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aethylene 3ahygroscopicity 3apolymerization 3asilica 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3aurea 3awood 3awood anatomy 3awood chemistry 0aPoplar wood 0amulti-functional composite modifier 0ain-situ polymerization 0achemical modification1 aHan, Xiaoshuai1 aJiang, Shaohua0 tJournal of wood chemistry and technology.g2021 Aug. 31, v. 41, no. 5 p.220-228dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33236x1532-23197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02773813.2021.19707773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03968naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001500188245010800203300001100311506007600322520232800398592002802726506003702754650001402791650001702805650001602822650001702838650001502855650003202870650001602902650002202918650000902940650002702949650001202976650002102988650001303009650001603022650001003038651001003048700001903058700001403077700001803091700001803109700001903127700001703146700001503163700001803178773012703196856008203323852000903405655001203414IND60556180320221207054802.0211117e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055618032DNAL7 a260176912pmid7 aPMC44580602pmcid7 a10.1186/s13002-015-0028-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Liya10aEthnobotany of wild plants used for starting fermented beverages in Shui communities of southwest China  ap. 42.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Shui communities of southwest China have an extensive history of using wild plants as starters (Xiaoqu) to prepare fermented beverages that serve important roles in interpersonal relationships and cultural events. While the practice of using wild plants as starters for the preparation of fermented beverages was once prevalent throughout China, this tradition has seen a decline nationally since the 1930s. The traditional technique of preparing fermented beverages from wild plant starters remains well preserved in the Shui communities in southwest China and provides insight on local human-environment interactions and conservation of plant biodiversity for cultural purposes. The present study sought to examine the ethnobotany of wild plants used as starters for the preparation of fermented beverages including an inventory of plants used as a starter in liquor fermentation and associated knowledge and practices. METHODS: Field surveys were carried out that consisted of semi-structured surveys and plant species inventories. One hundred forty-nine informants in twenty Shui villages were interviewed between July 2012 and October 2014 to document knowledge associated with wild plants used as a liquor fermentation starter. The inventories involved plant voucher specimens and taxonomic identification of plant collections. RESULTS: A total of 103 species in 57 botanical families of wild plants were inventoried and documented that are traditionally used as starters for preparing fermented beverages by Shui communities. The majority of the species (93.2%) have multiple uses in addition to being used as a starter with medicinal purposes being the most prevalent. Shui women are the major harvesters and users of wild plants used as starters for preparing fermented beverages and transfer knowledge orally from mother to daughter. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study can serve as a basis for future investigation on fermented beverages and foods and associated knowledge and cultural practices. However, with rapid development, utilization of wild plants and the cultural systems that support them are at risk of erosion. Cultural preservation practices are necessary in Shui communities for the continued use and transmission of this ethnobiological knowledge as well as associated biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeverages 3abiodiversity 3aethnobotany 3afermentation 3aharvesters 3ainterpersonal relationships 3ainventories 3aplant collections 3arisk 3aspecies identification 3asurveys 3atype collections 3avillages 3awild plants 3awomen 3aChina1 aZhuo, Jingxian1 aLei, Qiyi1 aZhou, Jiangju1 aAhmed, Selena1 aWang, Chaoying1 aLong, Yuxiao1 aLi, Feifei1 aLong, Chunlin0 tJournal of ethnobiology and ethnomedicine.g2015 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.42-42dBioMed CentralwJournal:2213x1746-42697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13002-015-0028-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006700150245014100217300001600358520161000374592002801984650003102012650002002043650002702063650002202090650002702112650000902139650001202148650001102160650001602171650001402187650001502201650001402216650003002230653001802260653003202278653001102310653000802321700002102329700002502350773014302375856008402518852000902602655001202611IND60637102520221118050813.0190415e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063710252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2018.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Liethy, Mohamed Azab1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8392-235510aPhenotyping using semi-automated BIOLOG and conventional PCR for identification of Bacillus isolated from biofilm of sink drainage pipes  ap. 334-338.  aThe presence of Bacillus in natural biofilms which develop in sink drainage pipes is not widely studied. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to isolate and identify Bacillus spp. using the BIOLOG GEN III system as a phenotypic fingerprint and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 61 biofilms samples were collected from sink drainage pipes in a kitchen and bathroom of different households in Helwan area and both laboratory and hospital collected from National Research Centre (NRC). Bacillus was isolated from the biofilms using HiCrome Bacillus Agar followed by isolates identification by both BIOLOG to the species level and PCR using genus specific primers to the genera level. Bacillus was detected in all tested biofilm samples (61 samples). The highest counts were observed in hospital sink drainage pipes (105â¯CFU/10â¯cm2) while; the lowest counts were observed in both bathroom and laboratory sink drainage pipes (102â¯CFU/10 cmâ2). In total, 61% Bacillus isolates were identified by BIOLOG while, 67% isolates were confirmed by PCR. The diversity of Bacillus among species level using BIOLOG were 34% B. cereus, 23% B. subtilis ss subtilis, 17% B. thuringiensis, 16% B. licheniformis and 13% B. amyloliquefaciens. It can be concluded that; PCR is more sensitive than BIOLOG for identification of Bacillus. However, BIOLOG can identify Bacillus at species level and test 94 carbon and chemical sources on a microplate in one shot. Thus, the combination between phenotyping by BIOLOG and molecular approaches such as PCR for identification of bacterial isolates is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aBacillus subtilis 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aagar 3abiofilm 3acarbon 3adrain pipes 3ahospitals 3ahouseholds 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 0aBacillus spp. 0aSink drainage pipes biofilm 0aBIOLOG 0aPCR1 aHemdan, Bahaa A.1 aEl-Taweel, Gamila E.0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2018 Oct., v. 38, no. 5 p.334-338dElsevier B.V.aEcological Society of ChinawJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2018.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04150naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245020100196500002000397520225100417592002802668650003402696650002202730650001402752650001202766650002502778650002502803650001702828650001702845650001902862650002202881650002702903650004102930650001102971650004302982650001303025650003203038650001803070650001903088650002003107650002003127650001803147650001303165650001103178650002203189700006503211700006103276700006003337773012803397856007403525852000903599655001203608IND60677748620221120194429.0191213e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067774862DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.130782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeveci, Ebru1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0913-909510aPhytochemical contents, antioxidant effects, and inhibitory activities of key enzymes associated with Alzheimer's disease, ulcer, and skin disorders of Sideritis albiflora and Sideritis leptoclada  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, urease, tyrosinase, cholinesterase inhibitory, and antioxidant activities of various extracts of Sideritis albiflora and Sideritis leptoclada were determined together with the phytochemical contents. In addition, the fatty acid compositions and phenolic compounds were investigated by gas chromatographyÂ (GC), gas chromatographyâmass spectrometryÂ (GCâMS), and high performance liquid chromatographyâdiode array detector (HPLCâDAD). Rosmarinic acid and caffeic acid in both Sideritis species were identified as the most abundant phenolic compounds whereas palmitic acid was found as a major fatty acid. The acetone extract of S. leptoclada indicated the highest antioxidant activity in Î²âcaroteneâlinoleic acid (ICââ: 17.23Â Â±Â 0.11Â Âµg/ml), DPPHâ¢ (ICââ: 28.14Â Â±Â 0.05Â Âµg/ml) and ABTSâ¢âº (ICââ: 15.18Â Â±Â 0.02Â Âµg/ml) assays. The acetone extract of S. albiflora (Aâ.ââ: 32.71Â Â±Â 0.44Â Âµg/ml) was found as the best reductant in cupric reducing antioxidant capacityÂ (CUPRAC) assay. Against acetylcholinesterase (AChE)Â and butyrylcholinesteraseÂ (BChE), only the hexane extracts of Sideritis species showed moderate inhibitory activity. Moreover, all extracts of S. albiflora and the hexane extract of S. leptoclada exhibited significantly higher urease inhibitory activity than that of thiourea. Further, in vivo activity studies on extracts and isolated constituents obtained from these species are needed to understand the activity in biological systems. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Multiple pharmacological studies have proven that Sideritis species is precious with significant bioactive properties. This is the first comprehensive research to determine the enzyme inhibitory and antioxidant activities of various extracts of S. albiflora and S. leptoclada with phytochemical contents. Both Sideritis species were found to be rich in rosmarinic and caffeic acids. The acetone extracts showed the highest activity in terms of antioxidant activity, while the hexane extracts exhibited superior urease inhibitory activity. These results show that Sideritis species could be used as urease inhibitorsâ agents and source of antioxidants in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAlzheimer disease 3aSideritis 3aacetone 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acaffeic acid 3acholinesterase 3aenzyme inhibition 3afatty acid composition 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahexane 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindustry 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3apalmitic acid 3aphytochemicals 3areducing agents 3arosmarinic acid 3askin diseases 3athiourea 3aurease 3aurease inhibitors1 aTelâÃayan, GÃ¼lsen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1916-73911 aDuru, Mehmet Emin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7252-48801 aÃzturk, Mehmet,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8932-45350 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2019 Dec., v. 43, no. 12 p.e13078-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.130783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245009200174300001200266520117000278592002801448650002701476650001701503650002301520650001001543650002001553650001601573650001401589650002501603650001201628650001601640653001901656653002101675653003001696653002301726700002501749700002101774700002201795700002201817773009201839856008701931852000902018655001202027IND60529350120221117072457.0160717e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052935012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2015.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudhir, Ankit P.10aEnhanced catalysis of l-asparaginase from Bacillus licheniformis by a rational redesign  ap. 1-6.  al-Asparaginase (3.5.1.1) being antineoplastic in nature are used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However glutaminase activity is the cause of various side effects when used as a drug against acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Therefore, there is a need of a novel l-asparaginase (L-ASNase) with low or no glutaminase activity. Such a property has been observed with L-ASNase from B. licheniformis (BliA). The enzyme being glutaminase free in nature paved the way for its improvement to achieve properties similar to or near to the commercially available L-ASNases. Rational enzyme engineering approach resulted in four mutants: G238N, E232A, D103V and Q112H. Among these the mutant enzyme, D103V, had a specific activity of 597.7IU/mg, which is higher than native (rBliA) (407.65IU/mg). Moreover, when the optimum temperature and in vitro half life were studied and compared with native BliA, D103V mutant BliA was better, showing tolerance to higher temperatures and a 3 fold higher half life. Kinetic studies revealed that the mutant D103V L-ASNase has increased substrate affinity, with Km value of 0.42mM and Vmax of 2778.9Î¼molminâ1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aasparaginase 3acatalytic activity 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3aglutaminase 3ahalf life 3alymphocytic leukemia 3amutants 3atemperature 0al-asparaginase 0aB. licheniformis 0aSite directed mutagenesis 0aEnhanced catalysis1 aAgarwaal, Viplove V.1 aDave, Bhaumik R.1 aPatel, Darshan H.1 aSubramanian, R.B.0 tEnzyme and Microbial Technology.g2016 May, v. 86 p.1-6dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2015.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03616naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003600153245016900189300001400358500001500372520182800387592002802215650001402243650002202257650001302279650002602292650001302318650001802331650001202349650001402361650002302375650002802398650001002426650000702436650001602443650002302459650001802482650002802500650002202528653002802550653004302578653002302621653001802644653002002662700002702682700003002709700003502739700003202774700002002806700003302826773009502859856008702954852000903041655001203050IND60529350220221117072450.0160717e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052935022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2015.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPÃ©rez de los Santos, Ara Itzel10aImprovement of catalytical properties of two invertases highly tolerant to sucrose after expression in Pichia pastoris. Effect of glycosylation on enzyme properties  ap. 48-56.  a2019-12-06  aZymomonas mobilis genes encoding INVA and INVB were expressed in Pichia pastoris, under the control of the strong AOX1 promoter, and the recombinant enzymes were named INVAAOX1 and INVBAOX1. The expression levels of INVAAOX1 (1660U/mg) and INVBAOX1 (1993U/mg) in P. pastoris were 9- and 7-fold higher than those observed for the native INVA and INVB proteins in Z. mobilis. INVAAOX1 and INVBAOX1 displayed a 2- to 3-fold higher substrate affinity, and a 2- to 200-fold higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) than that observed for native INVA and INVB from Z. mobilis. Positive Schiff staining of INVAAOX1 and INVBAOX1 suggested a glycoprotein nature of both invertases. After deglycosylation of these enzymes, denoted D-INVAAOX1 and D-INVBAOX1, they exhibited a 1.3- and 3-fold lower catalytic efficiency (107 and 164sâ1mMâ1, respectively), and a 1.3- to 5-fold lower thermal stability than the glycosylated forms at temperatures of 35â45Â°C. After deglycosylation no effect was observed in optimal pH, being of 5.5 for INVAAOX1, INVBAOX1, D-INVAAOX1 and D-INVBAOX1. The invertase activity of both enzymes increased in 80% (INVAAOX1) and 20% (INVBAOX1) in the presence of Mn2+ at 1mM and 5mM, respectively. INVAAOX1 and INVBAOX1 were highly active at sucrose concentrations of up to 400 and 300mM, respectively; however, the tolerance to sucrose decreased to 300mM for D-INVAAOX1. Our findings suggest that glycosylation of INVAAOX1 and INVBAOX1 plays an important role in their thermal stability, catalytic efficiency, and tolerance to sucrose. In conclusion, the expression of INVA and INVB from Z. mobilis in P. pastoris yields new catalysts with improved catalytic properties, making them suitable candidates for a number of industrial applications or for the improvement of ethanol production from cane molasses.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3athermal stability 3amolasses 3aKomagataella pastoris 3astaining 3aglycosylation 3asucrose 3acatalysts 3aethanol production 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3agenes 3apH 3atemperature 3acatalytic activity 3aglycoproteins 3aindustrial applications 3aZymomonas mobilis 0aEffect of glycosylation 0aIntracellular/extracellular invertases 0aProtein expression 0aAOX1 promoter 0aPichia pastoris1 aCayetano-Cruz, Maribel1 aGutiÃ©rrez-AntÃ³n, Marina1 aSantiago-HernÃ¡ndez, Alejandro1 aPlascencia-Espinosa, Miguel1 aFarrÃ©s, Amelia1 aHidalgo-Lara, MarÃ­a Eugenia0 tEnzyme and Microbial Technology.g2016 Feb., v. 83 p.48-56dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2015.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245012500163300001200288520133900300592002801639650003201667650002201699650001301721650001101734650001201745650001101757650001201768650001801780650001901798650001801817650001901835650002001854650001301874650001201887653002201899653002101921653002101942653003901963653002302002653001002025653000802035653000802043653000802051653000902059653000902068653000802077653000902085653000802094653000802102653000902110653000902119700001902128700002202147700001602169700001902185700002202204773010402226856008002330852000902410655001202419IND60605630320221122082301.0180722e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060563032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2016.07.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoriya, Koko10aIdentification of dually acylated proteins from complementary DNA resources by cell-free and cellular metabolic labeling  ap. 1-9.  aTo establish a strategy to identify dually fatty acylated proteins from cDNA resources, seven N-myristoylated proteins with cysteine (Cys) residues within the 10Â N-terminal residues were selected as potential candidates among 27Â N-myristoylated proteins identified from a model human cDNA resource. Seven proteins C-terminally tagged with FLAG tag or EGFP were generated and their susceptibility to protein N-myristoylation and S-palmitoylation were evaluated by metabolic labeling with [Â³H]myristic acid or [Â³H]palmitic acid either in an insect cell-free protein synthesis system or in transfected mammalian cells. As a result, EEPD1, one of five proteins (RFTN1, EEPD1, GNAI1, PDE2A, RNF11) found to be dually acylated, was shown to be a novel dually fatty acylated protein. Metabolic labeling experiments using G2A and C7S mutants of EEPD1-EGFP revealed that the palmitoylation site of EEPD1 is Cys at position 7. Analysis of the intracellular localization of EEPD1 C-terminally tagged with FLAG tag or EGFP and its G2A and C7S mutants revealed that the dual acylation directs EEPD1 to localize to the plasma membrane. Thus, dually fatty acylated proteins can be identified from cDNA resources by cell-free and cellular metabolic labeling of N-myristoylated proteins with Cys residue(s) close to the N-myristoylated N-terminus.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell-free protein synthesis 3acomplementary DNA 3acysteine 3ahumans 3ainsects 3amodels 3amutants 3amyristic acid 3amyristoylation 3apalmitic acid 3apalmitoylation 3aplasma membrane 3aproteins 3atritium 0aProtein acylation 0aN-myristoylation 0aS-palmitoylation 0aCell-free protein synthesis system 0aMetabolic labeling 0aEEPD1 0aNMT 0aPAT 0aECL 0aDMSO 0aDMEM 0aFCS 0aPVDF 0aCBB 0aNAT 0a2-HM 0a2-BP1 aKimoto, Mayumi1 aMatsuzaki, Kanako1 aKiwado, Aya1 aTakamitsu, Emi1 aUtsumi, Toshihiko0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 511 p.1-9dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2016.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03738naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245006400167300001800231500001400249520235200263592002802615650001802643650001002661650000902671650001502680650000902695650001302704650001002717650002002727650001202747650001402759650001702773650002302790653001202813653002202825653002302847700002602870700001802896700002502914700002502939700002002964700001802984700001703002700001903019773011203038856007303150852000903223655001203232IND60726910420221119201140.0210209e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072691042DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pew0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVizzier Thaxton, Yvonne10aSymposium: Animal welfare challenges for today and tomorrow  ap. 2198-2207.  aNAL-light  aThe increasing separation of the public from production agriculture means there is often a lack of knowledge among consumers about current production practices and a perception that increased productivity and economic efficiency are necessarily associated with a decline in animal welfare. A symposium was organized to present information about animal welfare issues and the challenges they pose for both scientists and the poultry and allied industries. Companion papers provide information about understanding public attitudes and physiological/immunological approaches to welfare assessment, while this paper outlines current and future challenges to egg and meat production and industry responses to those challenges. For broiler chickens, increases in growth rate result in corollary increases in metabolic heat generation and water consumption, leading to the need for continuing improvements in housing, ventilation, and litter management. Stocking densities, lighting programs, muscle myopathies, and use of antibiotics are also areas that require research attention. In the layer industry, the key challenge is housing, with the industry undergoing a shift from conventional cage housing to alternatives like enriched colonies or cage-free. While these alternative systems have hen welfare advantages, there are also welfare disadvantages that require the development of mitigation strategies, and it is also essential to address associated issues including economic, environmental, egg safety, and worker health impacts. Concerns on the horizon include euthanasia of surplus male chicks and spent hens as well as beak-trimming. The humaneness of slaughter methods is an important welfare and consumer confidence issue, and the current regulations for poultry slaughter in the USA are discussed and compared to those for livestock. The poultry and allied industries, including retailers, are responding to these concerns by consulting with experts, developing science-based animal care standards and auditing programs, strengthening training and oversight programs, promoting research, and improving communication channels. In future, intensifying multi-disciplinary research efforts and developing mechanisms to improve communication between scientists and stakeholders, including the public, will be critical to addressing these issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeak trimming 3acages 3aeggs 3aeuthanasia 3aheat 3aindustry 3amales 3ameat production 3amuscles 3aslaughter 3astakeholders 3awelfare assessment 0aWelfare 0aPublic perception 0aWelfare challenges1 aChristensen, Karen D.1 aMench, Joy A.1 aRumley, Elizabeth R.1 aDaugherty, Christine1 aFeinberg, Bruce1 aParker, Molly1 aSiegel, Paul1 aScanes, C.

Nonetheless, data regarding GM use on sandy soils in warm-temperate environments remains scarce. We conducted a 2-yr field study to evaluate growth and decomposition of sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.), blue lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L., winter 2001â2002), and Cahaba white vetch (Vicia sativa L., winter 2002â2003) used as GM to provide N for sweet corn (Zea mays L. var Rugosa) in a reduced tillage system in northern Florida. Intercepted solar radiation accounted for most variability in total GM dry weight and N content regardless of species or year. Sunn hemp exhibited substantial growth and N accumulation (â¤12.2 Mg haâ»Â¹ and 172 kg N haâ»Â¹ in 14 wk). However, rapid N loss (45â58% within 4 wk after death) occurred after sunn hemp death. Winter GM growth (2.0â4.0 Mg haâ»Â¹ and 51â104 kg N haâ»Â¹ in 18â20 wk) appeared limited by low LAI response to growing degree days (GDD) and was not affected by previous sunn hemp GM. Sunn hemp residues and living winter legume together contained 120 to 125 kg N haâ»Â¹ at time of final sampling before sweet corn planting. Corn rotated with sunn hemp plus winter GM and supplemented with 133 kg synthetic N haâ»Â¹ produced marketable ear yields similar to monoculture corn fertilized with 200 kg synthetic N haâ»Â¹, but the practical value of this benefit is low. In northern Florida, winter and/or summer GM use may substitute only for a relatively small portion of synthetic N rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3asweetcorn 3atemperate zones 3agreen manures 3anitrogen 3aplant nutrition 3anutrient availability 3asandy soils 3aCrotalaria juncea 3aLupinus angustifolius 3aVicia sativa 3asolar radiation 3areduced tillage 3adry matter accumulation 3anitrogen content 3acrop residues 3aleaf area index 3acrop rotation 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer rates 3aFlorida1 aScholberg, J.

Maillard reaction products are also known to cause oxidation of tissues and inflammation, thus increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The aim of this review is to present a detailed information about the role of foodborne constituents as antibrowning agents to significantly reduce the harmful compounds like advanced glycation end products (AGEs) during food processing. This review includes strategies involving addition of amino acids, aromatic compounds, vitamins, modification of amino acids, and reducing sugars as antibrowning agents to reduce the AGEs. The role of Food borne functional ingredients such as catechin, epicathechin, luteolin, and ferulic acids as inhibitors of AGEs is also discussed. Among the naturally occurring inhibitors, genistein could be a crucial and safe agent to reduce reactive intermediates. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Maillard reaction leads to changes in food color, protein functionality, protein digestibility, and loss of nutrient from foods. Maillard reaction products (MRPs) is also reported to be associated with various inflammatory conditions and may contribute to the progress of chronic diseases, including diabetes. It is hence necessary to reduce the MRPs, in both food and biological products, to offset this phenomenon. Among the strategies adopted till date, chemical agents could inhibit reactive carbonyl species and reactive oxygen species, but also are known to elicit serious side effects. Dietary flavonoids could be a very good inhibitor of MRPs both in biological and in food systems. It could be suggested that dietary flavonoids and isoflavones can be used as antibrowning agents in food and pharmaceutical industries particularly for targeted and sustained release of hypoglycemic drug in the intestines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction products 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aadverse effects 3aantibrowning agents 3acardiovascular diseases 3acatechin 3achronic diseases 3acolor 3adiabetes 3adigestibility 3adigestible protein 3aessential amino acids 3aferulic acid 3afood industry 3afood processing 3afunctional foods 3agenistein 3ahypoglycemic agents 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3aluteolin 3anutrients 3aoxidation 3apharmaceutical industry 3areactive oxygen species 3areducing sugars 3arisk 3atissues 3atoxic substances 3avitamins1 aHongsprabhas, Parichat1 aThottiam Vasudevan, Ranganathan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2565-99120 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2019 Dec., v. 43, no. 12 p.e13089-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.130893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005400140245011900194500002000313520217800333592002802511650001702539650001402556650001302570650000902583650001202592650001102604650004102615650001602656650001902672650001002691650001302701650001402714650002302728650001202751700002002763700001802783700005602801700001802857773012802875856007403003852000903077655001203086IND60677748920221120184033.0191213e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067774892DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.130402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0844-878510aCharacterization of key aromaâactive compounds in four commercial egg flavor Sachimas with differing egg content  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTo characterize the aroma components of Sachima and provide insight into the influence of egg on the flavor of Sachima, the key aromaâactive compounds in four commercial egg flavor Sachimas with different egg content, which named Premium, Classical, Whole egg, and Egg yolk, were identified using GCâMSâO analysis, aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) combined with sensory evaluation. In total, 75 volatile compounds were identified by GCâMS, including 26 compounds were revealed of having aroma activities by AEDA/GCâO. The major volatile compounds in Sachima were the aldehydes and heterocyclic compounds. The OAV further revealed the significant activity of eight key aromaâactive compounds include 2âmethylbutanal, 3âmethylbutanal, hexanal, nâpropylacetate, 2âpentylfuran, 2âethylpyrazine, nonanal, and benzaldehyde. The OAV of 2âmethylbutanal and 3âmethylbutanal were much higher in Premium sample that has the most egg content, than that in other samples, whereas hexanal was the highest in Whole egg samples. The plot analyzed by PLS suggest that the Premium sample with more egg content was shown more complicated flavor than other kind of Sachima. Practical applications Sachima is a type of famous sweet Chinese traditional pastries. The flavor and texture of this kind of pastry were appreciated by all age group, especially for almost all elderly Chinese. Because Sachima is not only a suitable food that easy to chew, but a type of food which filled with childhood memory. Egg flavor of Sachima was always the most popular and classic flavor category. However, the characteristic aroma compounds of Sachimaâone of the most important factor of the Sachima's qualityâhave been still uncovered and had not been identified yet, not to mentioned the comparison between different egg content in Sachima. What's more, GCâMSâO/AEDA analysis has been always a very effect and wellâknown method for aroma compounds analysis. This study trying to find the contribution of eggs to Sachima and the key aromaâactive compounds of Sachima, so as to provide some useful information for practical production and flavor quality improving.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzaldehyde 3achildhood 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3aelderly 3aflavor 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amastication 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3apastries 3apyrazines 3asensory evaluation 3atexture1 aZheng, Yingying1 aYou, Mengchen1 aSong, Huanlu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8513-32991 aZou, Tingting0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2019 Dec., v. 43, no. 12 p.e13040-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.130403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011900171300001400290520187800304592002802182650003102210650002302241650002302264650003202287650001702319650001602336650001202352650002802364650002202392650001402414650001102428650001102439650001502450650002302465650002602488650001602514653003102530653002602561653002802587653002202615653002202637653002402659700001602683700001602699700001902715773009502734856008702829852000902916655001202925IND60529350420221117072347.0160717e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052935042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2015.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Joo-Hyun10aLysine Îµ-aminotransferases: kinetic constants, substrate specificities, and the variation in active site residues  ap. 11-16.  al-Lysine Îµ-aminotransferase (lysAT) is an important enzyme in tailoring the terminal amino group of l-lysine or l-ornithine and can be directed to the synthesis of various value-added chemicals such as adipic acid. Three lysATs, lysAT from Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL 2338 (lysAT_Sery), lysAT from Nocardia farcinica IFM 10152, and lysAT from Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, were cloned, and their kinetic values and substrate specificities were investigated. In the reaction using 5mM l-lysine and 10mM Î±-ketoglutarate, lysAT_Sery from S. erythraea NRRL 2338 showed 72% higher specific activity than lysAT from Nocardia farcinica IFM 10152 and 42% higher specific activity than lysAT from R. jostii RHA1. More interesting result was that lysAT Sery, exhibiting the highest activity among three lysATs, did not show any activity to l-ornithine. The alignment of 146 lysAT sequences from RefSeq database was searched by the EC number of lysAT to compare the active site residues among the lysAT sequences. The sequence alignment showed that only two residues, corresponding to Ala129 and Asn328 of lysAT from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (lysAT_Mtub), showed variations among the active site residues. All the active site residues except those two residues were completely conserved throughout 145 lysAT sequences. lysAT from S. erythraea NRRL 2338 has A129T and N328S variations (residue numbers are those of the crystal structure of lysAT_Mtub). The structural analysis by the homology model indicate that Thr126 by A129T variation in lysAT_Sery is appeared to interact more tightly with the phosphate group of PLP than alanine (the distance between Thr126 and the phosphate group of PLP was 2.92Ã). In addition, Ser328 is located at the substrate recognition site of active site and, therefore, N328S variation may be connected to the substrate specificity of lysAT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aNocardia farcinica 3aRhodococcus jostii 3aSaccharopolyspora erythraea 3aactive sites 3aadipic acid 3aalanine 3aalpha-ketoglutaric acid 3acrystal structure 3adatabases 3alysine 3amodels 3aphosphates 3asequence alignment 3asubstrate specificity 3avalue added 0aLysine Îµ-aminotransferase 0aSubstrate specificity 0aEnzyme characterization 0aKinetic constants 0aSequence analysis 0aStructural analysis1 aKim, Eun-Mi1 aChae, Ahram1 aKim, Byung-Gee0 tEnzyme and Microbial Technology.g2016 Mar., v. 84 p.11-16dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2015.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008100168300001300249520073600262592002800998650001301026650002201039650001501061650001201076650000901088650003301097650001101130650002001141650000901161650001401170650001101184650001101195650001201206651002201218653000901240653000901249653000901258653001301267653001101280653002601291700002601317700001901343700002301362700002101385773012301406856008701529852000901616655001201625IND60556864120221119071513.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055686412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, Erin10aMammal predation by an ariid catfish in a dryland river of Western Australia  ap. 9-11.  aThe presence of the spinifex hopping mouse Notomys alexis in the diet of lesser salmon catfish Neoarius graeffei from the Ashburton River, Western Australia, is reported for the first time.

Here, to uncover critical components downstream of p53 in tumor suppression, we perform unbiased RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screens inÂ vivo. These screens converge upon the p53-inducible gene Zmat3, encoding an RNA-binding protein, and we demonstrate that ZMAT3 is an important tumor suppressor downstream of p53 in mouse Krasá´³Â¹Â²á´°-driven lung and liver cancers and human carcinomas. Integrative analysis of the ZMAT3 RNA-binding landscape and transcriptomic profiling reveals that ZMAT3 directly modulates exon inclusion in transcripts encoding proteins of diverse functions, including the p53 inhibitors MDM4 and MDM2, splicing regulators, and components of varied cellular processes. Interestingly, these exons are enriched in NMD signals, and, accordingly, ZMAT3 broadly affects target transcript stability. Collectively, these studies reveal ZMAT3 as a novel RNA-splicing and homeostasis regulator and a key component of p53-mediated tumor suppression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA splicing 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aexons 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3aliver 3alungs 3amice 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 0aZmat3 0ap53 0atumor suppression 0aRBP 0aalternative splicing 0aRNAi screen 0aCRISPR screen 0alung adenocarcinoma 0ahepatocellular carcinoma 0aMdm41 aKaiser, Alyssa M.1 aMorgens, David W.1 aBoutelle, Anthony M.1 aSeoane, Jose A.1 aVan Nostrand, Eric L.1 aZhu, Changyu1 aHoulihan, Shauna L.1 aMello, Stephano S.1 aYee, Brian A.1 aMcClendon, Jacob1 aPierce, Sarah E.1 aWinters, Ian P.1 aWang, Mengxiong1 aConnolly, Andrew J.1 aLowe, Scott W.1 aCurtis, Christina1 aYeo, Gene W.1 aWinslow, Monte M.1 aBassik, Michael C.1 aAttardi, Laura D.0 tMolecular cell.g2020 Nov. 05, v. 80, no. 3 p.452-469.e9dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01217naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245007000164300001800234520025700252592002800509650001300537650002300550650002300573650002200596700001900618700001900637700002000656700001900676773011800695856008100813852000900894655001200903IND60565388720171214000000.0170325e20170317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056538872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b027862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOÅ¡eka, Maksim10aTwo Catalytic Methods of an Asymmetric Wittig [2,3]-Rearrangement  ap. 2889-2897.  aTwo different approaches for asymmetric catalytic Wittig [2,3]-rearrangement were developed.

PTIR determines the rates at which initially monomeric proteins are converted to aggregates over a range of temperatures, under initial-rate conditions. Using SMSLS for the same set of conditions provides time courses of the absolute Rayleigh scattering ratio, IR(t), from which a potentially different measure of aggregation rates can be quantified. The present report compares these measures of aggregation rates across a range of solution conditions that result in different aggregation mechanisms for anti-streptavidin (AS) immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1). The results illustrate how the two methods provide complementary information when deducing aggregation mechanisms, as well as cases where they provide new mechanistic details that were not possible to deduce in previous work. Criteria are presented for when the two techniques are expected to give equivalent results for quantitative rates, the potential limitations when solution non-idealities are large, as well as a comparison of the temperature dependence of AS-IgG1 aggregation rates with published data for other antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3achromatography 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alight scattering 3atemperature 0aProtein stability 0aAggregation rates 0aAggregation mechanisms 0aLaser scattering1 aDrenski, Michael1 aRazinkov, Vladimir1 aReed, Wayne F.1 aRoberts, Christopher J.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 511 p.80-91dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2016.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147242005300170245006100223300001600284520129300300592002801593650001101621650001601632650002101648650001201669650001901681650001401700650000701714650001101721650000901732650001801741700002001759700001801779700001901797700002101816700002201837773008601859856008101945852000902026655001202035IND60548156320221122234050.0160903e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aIND6054815632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00767-006-0155-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlagentz,  Volkmar10apH-Wertpufferung im Abstrom von ReaktionswÃ¤nden10apH buffering downgradient of permeable reactive barriers  ap. 259-269.  aSequenced column experiments were conducted in order to assess the impact of elevated pH caused by two possible reactive media combinations for permeable reactive barriers (FeÂ°/Oxygen Release Compound (ORC) and FeÂ°/activated carbon) on the groundwater quality in a lignite sand. In the experiments, pH values > 9,5 downgradient of FeÂ° and ORC reactors were buffered to lower values by the lignite sand. In the lignite sand, pH fronts formed, propagating downgradient at a velocity that was 220â1,100 times slower than the groundwater flow velocity (0.71 and 0.83Â m/d, respectively). The amount of base equivalents buffered in both experiments (52 and 7.3Â meq/kg sediment, respectively) depended mainly on the different amounts of base equivalents present in the inflowing solutions. The majority of the base neutralization can be explained by the deprotonation of functional groups on mineral surfaces and organic carbon. The extent of other buffering mechanisms, such as mineral dissolution and pyrite oxidation, was limited in time. For the lignite sand examined here, high pH values downgradient of permeable reactive barriers will be limited to a narrow zone, even in the long term, and high pH values will not limit the possible implementation of a permeable reactive barrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3alignite 3aneutralization 3aoxidation 3apH 3apyrite 3asand 3awater quality1 aSchÃ¤fer,  Dirk1 aKÃ¶ber,  Ralf1 aEbert,  Markus1 aDahmke,  Andreas1 aDethlefsen, Frank0 tGrundwasser.g2006 Dec., v. 11, no. 4 p.259-269dSpringer-Verlagx1430-483X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00767-006-0155-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02226naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009700172300001400269520107900283592002801362650001701390650001401407650001101421650002001432650001101452653001501463653002101478653001801499653001801517653000801535700002801543700001701571700001501588700002301603773011701626856008801743852000901831655001201840IND60562780120221118072010.0180830e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056278012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuysman, Sofie10aPerformance indicators for a circular economy: A case study on post-industrial plastic waste  ap. 46-54.  aA linear economy approach results in many environmental challenges: resources become depleted and end up as waste and emissions. One of the key strategies to overcome these problems is using waste as a resource, i.e. evolving toward a circular economy. To monitor this transition, suitable indicators are needed that focus on sustainability issues whilst taking into account the technical reality. In this paper, we develop such an indicator to quantify the circular economy performance of different plastic waste treatment options. This indicator is based on the technical quality of the plastic waste stream and evaluates resource consumption by using the Cumulative Exergy Extraction from the Natural Environment (CEENE) method. To illustrate the use of this new indicator, it was applied in a case study on post-industrial plastic waste treatment. The results show that the indicator can be a very useful approach to guide waste streams towards their optimal valorization option, based on quality of the waste flow and the environmental benefit of the different options.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aemissions 3aexergy 3awaste treatment 3awastes 0aIndicators 0aCircular economy 0aCompatibility 0aPlastic waste 0aLCA1 aDe Schaepmeester, Jonas1 aRagaert, Kim1 aDewulf, Jo1 aDe Meester, Steven0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2017 May, v. 120 p.46-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013800173300001800311520114400329592002801473650001901501650002301520650003001543650002501573650001301598650001601611650001901627650001701646650002701663650001501690650002801705650001101733650001801744650001601762650001401778650002101792650001101813653002901824653002801853653002101881653002501902653002301927700003501950700002301985700002402008700001602032700001802048700002002066700002202086700002802108773010502136856008502241852000902326655001202335IND60519441620221122042733.0160429e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051944162DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.10506712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiceli, Natalizia10aRole of the flavonoid-rich fraction in the antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of Bauhinia forficata Link.

The contribution of a flavonoid-rich fraction (FRF), HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS characterised, to the antioxidant and cytotoxic properties of B. forficata hydro-alcoholic leaves extract was evaluated for the first time. Both extract and FRF showed radical-scavenging activity and reducing power with a strong relationship with the flavonoid content found; hence, flavonoids are mainly responsible for the primary antioxidant activity of B. forficata extract. The extract significantly decreased FO-1 cell viability at the higher concentrations. FRF did not exert any effect; thus, flavonoids do not appear to be responsible for the cytotoxicity of the extract. The extract resulted virtually non-toxic against both Artemia salina and normal human lymphocytes, demonstrating potential selectivity in inhibiting cancer cell growth. Finally, no antimicrobial activity was observed against the bacteria and yeasts tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia salina 3aBauhinia forficata 3aanti-infective properties 3aantioxidant activity 3abacteria 3acell growth 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3adiabetic complications 3aflavonoids 3afree radical scavengers 3ahumans 3aleaf extracts 3alymphocytes 3aneoplasms 3aoxidative stress 3ayeasts 0aBauhinia forficata Link. 0aflavonoid-rich fraction 0aphenolic profile 0aantioxidant activity 0acytotoxic activity1 aBuongiorno, Luigina Pasqualina1 aCeli, Maria Grazia1 aCacciola, Francesco1 aDugo, Paola1 aDonato, Paola1 aMondello, Luigi1 aBonaccorsi, Irene1 aTaviano, Maria Fernanda0 tNatural product research.g2016 June 2, v. 30, no. 11 p.1229-1239dTaylor & Francisx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2015.10506713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009400164300001600258520094200274592002801216650002301244650001001267650002901277650001201306650002401318650001401342650002001356650001401376650001401390650001301404650001301417650001301430700002001443773011501463856008201578852000901660655001201669IND60729090820221123012215.0210713e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072909082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgr.2020.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Won Sik10aCorona-Cov-2 (COVID-19) and ginseng: Comparison of possible use in COVID-19 and influenza  ap. 535-537.  aIn the 1918 influenza pandemic, more than 95% of mortalities were ascribed to bacterial pneumonia. After the primary influenza infection, the innate immune system is attenuated, and the susceptibility to bacteria is increased. Subsequent bacterial pneumonia exacerbates morbidity and increases the mortality rate. Similarly, COVID-19 infection attenuates innate immunity and results in pneumonia. In addition, the current pneumococcal conjugate vaccine may have limited defense against secondary pneumococcal infection after influenza infection. Therefore, until a fully protective vaccine is available, a method of increasing immunity may be helpful. Ginseng has been shown to increase the defense against influenza in clinical trials and animal experiments, as well as the defense against pneumococcal pneumonia in animal experiments. Based on these findings, ginseng is suspected to be helpful for providing immunity against COVID-19.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aPanax 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aanimals 3abacterial pneumonia 3ainfluenza 3ainnate immunity 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apandemic 3aresearch 3avaccines1 aRhee, Dong-Kwon0 tJournal of Ginseng Research.g2021 July, v. 45, no. 4 p.535-537dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27195x1226-84537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgr.2020.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007000168300001800238520080300256592002801059650002201087650001001109650001701119650001601136650001601152650001101168650002101179650001701200650001901217650002601236653001801262653003301280653001801313653001601331700002001347700001701367700002101384700002001405700002601425773010501451856008501556852000901641655001201650IND60519441820221122042803.0160429e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051944182DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.10520672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPejin, Boris10aIn vitro evaluation of cytotoxic and mutagenic activity of avarol  ap. 1293-1296.  aThe cytotoxicity of avarol, a main secondary metabolite of the Mediterranean sponge Dysidea avara , was in vitro screened by MTT assay against four human tumour cell lines.

This crisis has prompted the search for alternative energy sources. Biodiesel can be considered as one of the potential candidates of energy sources in order to resolve this problem. Most of the fuel properties of biodiesel are very close to that of petroleum diesel. However, commercial use of biodiesel in the automobile engine is being limited because of its unstable fuel properties. Instability of the fuel properties appears to be more aggravated when biodiesel comes in metal contact. The present study is intended to investigate the stability of different fuel properties and chemical composition of palm biodiesel upon exposure to copper and mild steel. Static immersion tests were performed by exposing metallic coupons in palm biodiesel at room temperature for different periods viz., 20, 40, 60 days. Compositional analysis of biodiesel was conducted by gas chromatography. Investigated fuel properties include induction period, total acid value, water content, calorific value, viscosity, density, cloud point, pour point, etc. Effect of biodiesel on metal surfaces was examined by measuring the corrosion rate and conducting SEM/EDS analysis. It is found that copper has strong influence in changing fuel properties especially for viscosity, water content, calorific value, density, etc. Compositional analysis of biodiesel showed that principal unsaturated constituent of palm biodiesel, methyl oleate reduced more in copper exposed biodiesel than that in mild steel exposed biodiesel. Formation of poly unsaturated methyl linoleate was observed in both metal exposed palm biodiesel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid value 3aambient temperature 3aautomobiles 3abiodiesel 3acopper 3acorrosion 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agas chromatography 3aoleic acid 3apetroleum 3aphysicochemical properties 3apour point 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asteel 3aviscosity 3awater content 0aCopper 0aMild steel 0aPalm biodiesel 0aFuel properties 0aCompositional changes1 aJakeria, M.R.1 aHaseeb, A.S.M.A.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2014 July, v. 58 p.8-14dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01792naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245013100166300001800297520052300315592002800838650001600866650002300882650002300905650002200928650001300950650004400963650002201007650002101029700001701050700002301067700001901090700001901109700002001128700001601148700002201164773011801186856008101304852000901385655001201394IND60565389320171214000000.0170325e20170317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056538932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b028952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRegenass, Pierre10aComparative Study of the Synthesis and Structural and Physicochemical Properties of Diketopiperazines vs Aza-diketopiperazines  ap. 3239-3244.  aAza-diketopiperazines (aza-DKPs) represent an underprivileged motif obtained by scaffold hopping of 2,5-diketopiperazines (2,5-DKPs).

Moreover, the replacement of one CÎ±-stereogenic center by a nitrogen atom results in a significant improvement of both the water solubility and the microsomal stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adiketopiperazines 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic chemistry 3awater solubility1 aBosc, Damien1 aRichÃ©, StÃ©phanie1 aGizzi, Patrick1 aHibert, Marcel1 aKarmazin, Lydia1 aGanesan, A.1 aBonnet, Dominique0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 Mar. 17, v. 82, no. 6 p.3239-3244dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.6b028953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245006700177300001600244520101400260592002801274650001101302650001101313650001001324650001101334650001701345650002001362650001601382650001801398651001001416653002901426653002801455653003001483653002501513653001901538700001601557773011501573856008401688852000901772655001201781IND60122407120221120072641.0150325e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012240712DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2013.8478372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalidasa Murugavel, K.10aEffect of Cover Plate Transmittance on Solar Still Performance  ap. 431-439.  aThe year round performance of solar still mainly depends not only on the variations of solar radiation incidence on the glass covers and also on the solar energy transmittance variations of the covers. In this work, a single basin double slope solar still has been theoretically modeled. The year round variations in radiation energy incidence, transmitted and lost at the covers and the total production of the still for the local place, Kovilpatti (9Â°11â²N, 77Â°52â²E), India, have been studied using the model. During January, February, November, and December, the north cover experienced around 25% of energy loss. But, the loss at south cover is only 15â20% during different months of the year. The still production is minimum (2.7 L/m Â²/day) during June and maximum (6.5 L/m Â²/day) during March. The yearly average production of the still is 4.75 L/m Â²/day. The payback period of the still is one and half years. The actual production of the fabricated still was close with the estimated values.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aenergy 3aglass 3amodels 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3asolar still 3atransmittance 3aIndia 0aDouble slope solar still 0atransmittance variation 0asolar incidence variation 0aenergy loss analysis 0astill modeling1 aSrithar, K.0 tInternational journal of green energy.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 12, no. 4 p.431-439dTaylor & Francisx1543-50837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2013.8478373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01727naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001700162245004900179300001400228500000900242520064000251592002800891650001300919650000900932650001500941650001600956650001200972650001500984650001700999650001101016650001501027700001701042700001701059700002001076700001901096773012001115856009701235852000901332655001201341IND60663368520221118063941.0191122e196801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066336852DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1968.00021962006000010006x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, J.

Using data collected from surveys conducted by the French National Agency for Water and Aquatic Environment (Onema) from 1989 to 2010 in more than 500 sites throughout the country (10636 electrofishing surveys), we investigated the potential impact of the European catfish on fish communities in French rivers. In the first part of the analysis, we compared trends observed before and after the European catfish was established at given sites (beforeâafter analysis). Species richness, evenness and diversity decreased significantly after the European catfish was established at 1.4%, 1.4% and 5.8% of the sites, respectively. Total fish biomass and density decreased significantly at 6.6% and 2.9% of the sites, respectively. In the second part of the analysis, we compared sites with European catfish against sites lacking European catfish during the same period (withâwithout analysis). Fish species richness was significantly higher in sites with European catfish. No significant differences in fish diversity, evenness, total fish biomass or density were found between sites with or without European catfish. While our results indicate that the European catfish may in a few cases impact fish communities or populations, it does not appear to be responsible for a countrywide collapse in fish assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSilurus glanis 3aaquatic environment 3abiomass 3afish 3afish communities 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3aFrance1 aDelmotte, SÃ©bastien1 aBoulÃªtreau, StÃ©phanie1 aLauzeral, Christine1 aPoulet, Nicolas1 aSantoul, FrÃ©dÃ©ric0 tFreshwater biology.g2015 May, v. 60, no. 5 p.922-928dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.125453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245010200187300001600289520145000305592002801755650001701783650001101800650002701811650001301838650002201851650001201873650001401885650002001899650001501919650000901934650001001943650002601953650001101979650001801990650001702008650004402025650002702069650002302096650006402119650001802183700001902201700002302220773009202243856004802335852000902383655001202392IND50062803420221122205243.0130323e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006280342DNAL7 a230529252pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-012-0128-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaftery, Tara D.10aAltered Host CellâBacteria Interaction due to Nanoparticle Interaction with a Bacterial Biofilm  ap. 496-503.  aNanoparticle (NP) use in everyday applications creates the potential for NPs to enter the environment where, in aquatic systems, they are likely to settle on substrates and interact with microbial communities. Legionella pneumophila biofilms are found as part of microbial communities in both natural and man-made environments, especially in man-made cooling systems. The bacterium is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease. Legionella requires a host cell for replication in the environment, and amoebae commonly serve as this host cell. Our previous work demonstrated significant changes in Legionella biofilm morphology after exposure to 0.7Â Î¼g/L gold NPs (AuNPs). Here, we investigate how these morphology changes alter hostâbacteria interactions using Acanthamoeba polyphaga as a model. HostâbacteriaâNP interactions are affected by NP characteristics. Biofilms exposed to 4- and 18-nm, citrate-capped, spherical AuNPs significantly altered the grazing ability of A. polyphaga, which was not observed in biofilms exposed to 24-nm polystyrene beads. Uptake and replication of NP-exposed planktonic L. pneumophila within A. polyphaga were not altered regardless of NP size or core chemistry. Nanomaterial effects on the interaction of benthic organisms and bacteria may be directly or, as shown here, indirectly dependent on bacterial morphology. NP contamination therefore may alter interactions in a normal ecosystem function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthamoeba 3aAmoeba 3aLegionella pneumophila 3abacteria 3abenthic organisms 3abiofilm 3achemistry 3acooling systems 3aecosystems 3agold 3ahosts 3amicrobial communities 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apolystyrenes 2aAcanthamoebaxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aBiofilmsxdrug effects 2aGoldxpharmacology 2aLegionella pneumophilaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aNanoparticles1 aLindler, Heidi1 aMcNealy, Tamara L.0 tMicrobial ecology.g2013 Feb., v. 65, no. 2 p.496-503dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-012-0128-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245013600171520120900307592002801516650002301544650001501567650002801582650001801610650001901628700003101647700002801678700002601706700002801732700003001760773012401790856007501914852000901989655001201998IND60792697220221118053458.0220908e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079269722DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141736222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarquÃ©s-MartÃ­nez, Laura 10aAssociation between the Severity of Dental Caries and the Degree of Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet in the Pediatric Population  aChildren who show better eating practices are less likely to suffer from severe caries than those who eat a diet rich in sugars. In the present study, we aimed to establish the relationship between the severity of dental caries and adherence to the Mediterranean diet. A cross-sectional study was carried out in which 263 children aged 2 to 14 years old were examined intraorally to analyze the presence and severity of caries. Childrenâs parents/caregivers completed the KIDMED questionnaire to determine their degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The results showed that the prevalence of caries is greater than 80% in children with medium or low adherence to the Mediterranean diet, and remains significant at 67% in the high adherence group (p = 0.010). A statistically significant negative correlation of weak magnitude (r = â0.29; p < 0.001) was found between adherence and the number of carious teeth. Caries severity in the first molars is also influenced by adherence to the diet in a statistically significant way. In conclusion, there is an association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the prevalence, extension, and severity of caries in the pediatric population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3acaregivers 3across-sectional studies 3adental caries 3aquestionnaires1 aPÃ©rez-Bermejo, Marcelino 1 aLairÃ³n-Peris, Ana Rosa1 aGuinot-Barona, Clara 1 aBorrell-GarcÃ­a, Carla 1 aGarcÃ­a-Miralles, Esther 0 tNutrients.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 14, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141736223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002000188245008100208300001800289506007600307520133600383592002801719506003701747650002201784650002301806650001301829650002001842650001201862650002001874650003401894650002701928650002701955650000901982650001201991650001302003650001502016650001402031650001502045650002802060650002602088651001002114651001902124653002202143653002202165653000802187653001202195653002702207700002302234700001802257700002202275700001902297700002002316773012002336856008202456852000902538655001202547IND60517255320221207062334.0190729e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051725532DNAL7 aPMC37604402pmcid7 a234486782pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820130000242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWITZIG, CLAUDIA10aIdentifying permethrin resistance loci in malaria vectors by genetic mapping  ap. 1468-1477.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIdentification of the major loci responsible for insecticide resistance in malaria vectors would aid the development and implementation of effective resistance management strategies, which are urgently needed to tackle the growing threat posed by resistance to the limited insecticides available for malaria control. Genome-wide association studies in the major malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, have been hindered by the high degree of within-population structuring and very low levels of linkage disequilibrium hence we revisited the use of quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to study resistance phenotypes in this vector species. Earlier work, identified two major QTL associated with pyrethroid resistance in A. gambiae s.s. from East Africa using genetic crossing of laboratory-colonized resistant and susceptible strains. In this study, we report the results from genetic mapping of pyrethroid resistance in three isofemale pedigrees established from wild-caught female A. gambiae s.s. mosquitoes from Benin. We identified two QTL on chromosomes 2L and 3R in these field populations, in similar genomic locations to the QTL identified in laboratory strains. The relative merits of two alternative study designs are discussed and suggestions made for future genetic mapping studies of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3achromosome mapping 3acrossing 3adevelopment aid 3afemales 3agenetic vectors 3agenome-wide association study 3ainsecticide resistance 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3amalaria 3apedigree 3apermethrin 3aphenotype 3apyrethrins 3aquantitative trait loci 3aresistance management 3aBenin 3aEastern Africa 0aAnopheles gambiae 0anatural pedigrees 0aQTL 0amalaria 0ainsecticide resistance1 aWONDJI, CHARLES S.1 aSTRODE, CLARE1 aDJOUAKA, ROUSSEAU1 aRANSON, HILARY1 aDevaney, Eileen0 tParasitology.g2013 Oct., v. 140, no. 12 p.1468-1477dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820130000243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245007900162520142100241592002801662650001801690650001901708650001801727650001801745650001501763650001901778650001301797650001901810650003001829650002601859650001601885650001001901650001701911650001201928650003301940650001801973650000901991650001702000650001802017650001602035653000802051653001602059653001202075653000902087653001902096700001902115700001702134700001802151700001502169700002302184700001902207700001702226700002002243700002002263773011602283856007702399852000902476655001202485IND60699908820221120192740.0200623e20160908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069990882DNAL7 a10.1093/femsec/fiw1932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGwosdz, Simone10aLong-term COâ injection and its impact on near-surface soil microbiology  aImpacts of long-term COâ exposure on environmental processes and microbial populations of near-surface soils are poorly understood. This near-surface long-term COâ injection study demonstrated that soil microbiology and geochemistry is influenced more by seasonal parameters than elevated COâ. Soil samples were taken during a 3-year field experiment including sampling campaigns before, during and after 24 months of continuous COâ injection. COâ concentrations within COâ-injected plots increased up to 23% during the injection period. No COâ impacts on geochemistry were detected over time. In addition, COâ-exposed samples did not show significant changes in microbial COâ and CHâ turnover rates compared to reference samples. Likewise, no significant COâ-induced variations were detected for the abundance of Bacteria, Archaea (16S rDNA) and gene copy numbers of the mcrA gene, Crenarchaeota and amoA gene. The majority (75%â95%) of the bacterial sequences were assigned to five phyla: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The majority of the archaeal sequences (85%â100%) were assigned to the thaumarchaeotal cluster I.1b (soil group). Univariate and multivariate statistical as well as principal component analyses showed no significant COâ-induced variation. Instead, seasonal impacts especially temperature and precipitation were detected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aCrenarchaeota 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3abacteria 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3afield experimentation 3agene dosage 3agenes 3ageochemistry 3amethane 3aprincipal component analysis 3aribosomal DNA 3asoil 3asoil biology 3asoil sampling 3atemperature 0aCCS 0aCO2-leakage 0aArchaea 0aqPCR 0apyrosequencing1 aWest, Julia M.1 aJones, David1 aRakoczy, Jana1 aGreen, Kay1 aBarlow, Thomas J.,1 aBlÃ¶the, Marco1 aSmith, Karon1 aSteven, Michael1 aKruger, Martin,0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2016 Sept. 8, v. 92, no. 12dOxford University PresswJournal:1989x1574-69417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiw1933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013700155300001600292520108500308592002801393650001601421650001701437650001301454650001601467650001301483650002301496650001601519650001301535651001001548653001401558653001801572653001901590653002701609653001501636700002101651700002701672700002401699700002701723700002401750773011201774856007401886852000901960655001201969IND60746321420221118104852.0210731e20210730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074632142DNAL7 a10.2326/osj.20.2012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyu, Putri10aSeasonal Variation in Populations of Eurasian Coot Fulica atra: Relationships with Environmental Variables in Mediterranean Wetlands  ap. 201-212.  aMediterranean wetlands represent a broad variety of natural resources with a huge role in the maintenance of biological diversity. Waterbirds are significant components of this diversity. Among them, the Eurasian Coot Fulica atra is a key species when studying the correlations and interactions between waterbirds and environmental variables, because of its abundance, ease of detection, and relation with some basic aspects of the functioning of wetlands. The present study aimed to analyse the annual and seasonal variation in populations of Eurasian Coot in 31 wetlands in Andalusia, southern Spain, from 2003 to 2008, paying particular attention to correlations with biotic and abiotic variables. The results showed a positive correlation between water depth and coot abundance, while a negative relationship was observed with salinity and no correlation was observed between wetland size and coot abundance. These environmental variables, together with submerged macrophyte coverage, stand out as playing important roles in the use of habitat by coots in Andalusian wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFulica atra 3abiodiversity 3ahabitats 3amacrophytes 3asalinity 3aseasonal variation 3awater birds 3awetlands 3aSpain 0aAndalusia 0aEurasian Coot 0aFood resources 0aMediterranean wetlands 0aWaterbirds1 aOrtega, Fernando1 aMÃ¡rquez, Francisco J.1 aGilbert, Juan Diego1 aRendÃ³n-Martos, Manuel1 aGuerrero, Francisco0 tOrnithological science.g2021 July 30, v. 20, no. 2 p.201-212dUniBio PresswJournal:19740x1347-05587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2326/osj.20.2013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01773naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001900162245006000181300001600241500000900257520068400266592002800950650002200978650002701000650001401027650001801041650003101059650001101090650002301101650001401124650001501138650000901153700002101162773012301183856009601306852000901402655001201411IND60663368720221118064019.0191122e196809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066336872DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1968.00021962006000050007x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHipp, Billy W.10aMethod for Predicting Potassium Uptake by Grain Sorghum  ap. 467-469.  aepub  aA greenhouse experiment using nutrient solution culture with graded levels of K was used to determine the concentration of K required in grain sorghum leaves for optimum growth.

The high resolution of output provided by Regional Climate Models (RCMs) is expected to be a suitable tool to describe regional and local climatic features, although their simulation results may still present biases. For these reasons, we compared several post-processing methods to correct or reduce the biases of RCM simulations from the ENSEMBLES project for the IP. The bias-corrected datasets were also evaluated in terms of their applicability and consequences in improving the results of a crop model to simulate maize growth and development at two IP locations, using this crop as a reference for summer cropping systems in the region. The use of bias-corrected climate runs improved crop phenology and yield simulation overall and reduced the inter-model variability and thus the uncertainty. The number of observational stations underlying each reference observational dataset used to correct the bias affected the correction performance. Although no single technique showed to be the best one, some methods proved to be more adequate for small initial biases, while others were useful when initial biases were so large as to prevent data application for impact studies. An initial evaluation of the climate data, the bias correction/reduction method and the consequences for impact assessment would be needed to design the most robust, reduced uncertainty ensemble for a specific combination of location, crop, and crop management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acorn 3acrop models 3acropping systems 3acrops 3adata collection 3agrowth and development 3aphenology 3asimulation models 3asummer 3auncertainty 3aIberian Peninsula1 aFernandez, Aurelio Rodriguez,1 aDosio, A.1 aGoodess, C.

Not only can a number of immune cells influence this process, but also the characteristics, preparation and modification of the decellularized scaffold can significantly impact this reaction. Such factors can, together or alone, trigger immune cells to polarize towards either a pro-healing or pro-inflammatory direction. In this article, we have comprehensively reviewed factors which may influence the immune response of the host towards a decellularized scaffold, including the source of the biomaterial, biophysical properties or modifications of the scaffolds with bioactive peptides, drugs and cytokines.

We report a crystalline ion-triggered growth strategy for embedding AuNCs in ZIF-8. As control, when the encapsulation was triggered with other metal ions (e.g., CaÂ²âº, PbÂ²âº, CdÂ²âº, Naâº, FeÂ³âº, CuÂ²âº, and NiÂ²âº), the AuNCs failed to be encapsulated. The quantum yields and lifetime of AuNCs were greatly enhanced after embedding in ZIF-8. The AuNCs@ZIF-8 were then successfully applied for the selective sensing of HâS both in liquid and gas phases. This crystalline ion-triggered growth strategy was easily extended to other systems, such as AgNCs@ZIF-8 and AuNCs@ZIF-67, indicating the general adaptability of this design protocol.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acoordination polymers 3acopper 3aencapsulation 3agases 3ahydrogen sulfide 3airon 3alead 3aliquids 3ametal ions 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3asodium 0ametalâorganic frameworks 0aluminescent nanocluster 0afluorescence sensor 0aconfinement-induced enhancement 0acrystalline ion-triggered growth1 aTsui, Anne S.,1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6638-00401 aGuo, Chang1 aChen, Yueguang1 aWang, Leyu1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5961-77640 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Apr. 20, v. 10, no. 18 p.16059-16065dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b045313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245021600165520142300381592002801804650002801832650002501860650002001885650002301905650001801928650001401946650000901960650002501969650001601994700002102010700002102031700002102052700002802073700002602101700001902127700001802146773012402164856007502288852000902363655001202372IND60792697420221118053428.0220908e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079269742DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141736232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacob, Chandni Maria10aAcceptability of the FIGO Nutrition Checklist in Preconception and Early Pregnancy to Assess Nutritional Status and Prevent Excess Gestational Weight Gain: A Study of Women and Healthcare Practitioners in the UK  aOptimum nutrition and weight before and during pregnancy are associated with a lower risk of conditions such as pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. There is a lack of user-friendly tools in most clinical settings to support healthcare practitioners (HCPs) in implementing them. This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability of (1) using a nutrition checklist designed by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) for nutritional screening of women in the preconception and early pregnancy period and (2) routine discussion of nutrition and weight in clinical care. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted with women (aged 18â45) and HCPs (e.g., general practitioners, obstetricians, and midwives). Quantitative statistical analysis and qualitative content analysis were performed. The concept and content of the checklist were acceptable to women (n = 251) and HCPs (n = 47) (over 80% in both groups). Several barriers exist to implementation such as lack of time, training for HCPs, and the need for sensitive and non-stigmatizing communication. Routine discussion of nutrition was considered important by both groups; however, results suggest that nutrition is not regularly discussed in perinatal visits in the UK. The FIGO nutrition checklist presents a valuable resource for use in clinical practice, offering long-term and intergenerational benefits for both mother and baby.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-sectional studies 3agestational diabetes 3ahealth services 3anutritional status 3apre-eclampsia 3apregnancy 3arisk 3astatistical analysis 3aweight gain1 aInskip, Hazel M.1 aLawrence, Wendy 1 aMcGrath, Carmel 1 aMcAuliffe, Fionnuala M.1 aKilleen, Sarah Louise1 aDivakar, Hema 1 aHanson, Mark 0 tNutrients.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 14, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141736233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03433naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245011400166300001600280520135900296592002801655650001801683650002101701650002001722650002101742650001901763650002001782650001001802650001401812650002001826650001101846650001901857650001901876650000801895650001501903650001401918650002101932650001701953650001801970650001901988650001002007651001002017651001102027651001802038653001802056653001702074653001602091653001402107653002302121700001802144700001802162700001802180700002002198700002002218700002102238700001802259700001302277700002002290700001702310700001602327700001402343700001802357700002002375700001302395700001802408700002102426700001802447773010202465856008702567852000902654655001202663IND60531622020221119003249.0161102e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053162202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xi10aLong-term exposure to urban air pollution and lung cancer mortality: A 12-year cohort study in Northern China  ap. 855-861.  aCohort evidence that links long-term exposures to air pollution and mortality comes largely from the United States and European countries. We investigated the relationship between long-term exposures to particulate matter <10Î¼m in diameter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) and mortality of lung cancer in Northern China. A cohort of 39,054 participants were followed during 1998â2009. Annual average concentrations for PM10, NO2, and SO2 were determined based on data collected from central monitoring stations. Lung cancer deaths (n=140) were obtained from death certificates, and hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for age, gender, BMI, education, marital status, smoking status, passive smoking, occupation, alcohol consumption, etc. Each 10mg/m3 increase in PM10 concentrations was associated with a 3.4%â6.0% increase in lung cancer mortality in the time-varying exposure model and a 4.0%â13.6% increase in the baseline exposure model. In multi-pollutant models, the magnitude of associations was attenuated, most strongly for PM10. The association was different in men and women, also varying across age categories and different smoking status. Substantial differences exist in the risk estimates for participants based on assignment method for air pollution exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aalcohol drinking 3abody mass index 3achronic exposure 3acohort studies 3adata collection 3adeath 3aeducation 3aexposure models 3agender 3alung neoplasms 3amarital status 3amen 3amonitoring 3amortality 3anitrogen dioxide 3aparticulates 3arisk estimate 3asulfur dioxide 3awomen 3aChina 3aEurope 3aUnited States 0aAir pollution 0aCohort study 0aLung cancer 0aMortality 0aParticulate matter1 aZhang, Li-wen1 aHuang, Jia-ju1 aSong, Feng-ju1 aZhang, Luo-ping1 aQian, Zheng-min1 aTrevathan, Edwin1 aMao, Hong-jun1 aHan, Bin1 aVaughn, Michael1 aChen, Ke-xin1 aLiu, Yamin,1 aChen, Jie1 aZhao, Bao-xin1 aJiang, Guo-hong1 aGu, Qing1 aBai, Zhi-peng1 aDong, Guang-Hui,1 aTang, Nai-jun0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 571 p.855-861dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245006000171300001800231500001900249500000900268520164900277592002801926650002001954650001101974650001401985650001401999650001002013650002102023650001402044650001602058650001802074650001802092650001202110650001002122700002502132773012402157856008502281852000902366655001202375IND60665219320221119233817.0191228e200009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066521932DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2000.4051241x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeel, Michael D.10aImprovement Strategy for Mature Plant Breeding Programs  ap. 1241-1246.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aIn mature plant breeding programs an elite core germplasm forms the backbone of the breeding effort, confronting the breeder with the challenge of maintaining germplasm diversity as genetic distance between the elite core germplasm and donor germplasm widens. This research assessed the effects on grain yield of transferring genes from two-row barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars to a six-row gene pool. We conducted three cycles of recurrent-type breeding, beginning with crosses involving five two-row donor parents. The crossing scheme led to progenies with theoretical proportions of two-row germplasm of 25 to 50% in Cycle 1, 12.5 to 25% in Cycle 2 and 6.25 to 12.5% in Cycle 3. In Cycle 1, yield of the six-row progeny across the five populations ranged from 86 to 97% of the respective six-row parent. Kernel weight of the six-row progeny was also low in Cycle 1. In Cycle 2, grain yield improved to 99% of the check mean and kernel weight improved to 102% of the check mean. In Cycle 3, sets of lines representing three populations yielded from 112 to 119% of the check mean in 1997 and 1998 and individual lines surpassed âStanderâ, the highest yielding check in both 1997 to 1998. The highest yielding lines in each cycle were derived from populations having the highest theoretical percentage of adapted recurrent parent germplasm, that is, when six-row gene combinations were predominately left intact. Results from the three breeding cycles support the proposition that a strategy that maintains favorable gene combinations while introgressing relatively small amounts of donor germplasm can lead to incremental yield gains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3acultivars 3agene pool 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3agermplasm 3agrain yield 3aintrogression 3amature plants 3aprogeny 3aseeds1 aRasmusson, Donald C.0 tCrop science.g2000 Sept., v. 40, no. 5 p.1241-1246dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2000.4051241x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245009000161506031000251520171500561592002802276650002202304650001102326650001202337650002302349650000902372651001002381653002102391653001502412653001602427653003002443700001902473700002102492700002602513773012402539856007602663852000902739655001202748IND60478792720221119060502.0160114e20141221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047879272DNAL7 a10.4081/jae.2014.4312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTonon, Alessia10aUsing a Terrestrial Laser Scanner to Detect Wood Characteristics in Gravel-Bed Rivers  aThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.  aThe possibility of analysing the characteristics and volume of in-channel large wood (LW) is of importance for river management but the traditional manual field activities are usually time-consuming and not easy to apply at a larger spatial scale. This paper presents an alternative and faster method to detect the characteristics and measurements of large wood in rivers by using the terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) technology. Field-measurements data and TLS scans were collected in August 2013 along 14 ha of the Piave River (Italy) analysing 230 and 208 woody elements for the manual method and the TLS one, respectively. TLS data were processed using the Cyclone 7 software and the LW measurements were extracted adopting two specific tools. The resulting low margin of error in the comparison between field data and those derived from TLS surveys confirmed the ability of TLS in the detection of large wood and wood jams characteristics. The greatest deviations were found for wood jams height which the TLS showed a tendency to overestimate (+24.37%) and LW length with a slight underestimation (â19.76%). Considering the wood volume, the relative difference between the TLS and manual method was within a negligible margin of error of Â±7%. Characteristics and measurements of LW in rivers can be obtained from TLS surveys, but some progress in this technique is still needed to allow a better management of the 3D point cloud and a faster extraction of the wood measurements. The proposed method represents an alternative tool for faster and repeated surveys of wood characteristics in a complex river environment, ensuring a reliable quantification of spatial and temporal variation of wood volume.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3arivers 3asurveys 3atemporal variation 3awood 3aItaly 0agravel-bed river 0alarge wood 0aPiave River 0aterrestrial laser scanner1 aPicco, Lorenzo1 aRavazzolo, Diego1 aLenzi, Mario Aristide0 tJournal of agricultural engineering.g2014 Dec. 21, v. 45, no. 4dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx2239-62687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jae.2014.4313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001800158245006500176300001800241520118600259592002801445650001201473650003201485650004201517650005201559650002401611650001101635650003101646650002801677650002801705650003501733650002101768650002301789650000901812650003501821650002401856650002201880650003701902650001001939650003301949700002301982700002302005700002002028700002102048700002202069773012002091856007502211852000902286655001202295IND60129693420221117160952.0151126e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012969342DNAL7 a196735892pmid7 a10.1645/GE-1987.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNejsum, Peter10aPopulation Dynamics of Ascaris suum in Trickle-infected Pigs  ap. 1048-1053.  aThe population dynamics of Ascaris suum was studied by long-term exposure of pigs to infective eggs. The pigs were experimentally inoculated with 25 A. suum eggs/kg/day, and 7, 8, and 8 pigs were necropsied at weeks 4, 8, and 14 postinoculation (PI), respectively. Despite the fact that the pigs were continuously reinfected, dramatic reductions in numbers of liver lesions (white spots) and migrating lung larvae were observed as a function of time. However, even at the end of the study, a few larvae were able to complete migration, but these larvae seemed unable to mature in the small intestine. Thus, the adult worm population seemed to consist of worms from the first part of the exposure period. The noticeable decrease in number of white spots suggests that the level of exposure is not reflected in the number of white spots in the late phase of a continuous infection. The serum levels of A. suum Lâ-specific IgG1 and IgA were significantly elevated by week 4 PI, after which the antibody levels declined. The population dynamics and parasite regulating mechanisms are discussed for A. suum in pigs as well as for the closely related species A. lumbricoides in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Helminthxblood 2aAscariasisxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aAscaris suumxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aImmunoglobulin Axblood 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aIntestine, Smallxparasitology 2aLiverxpathology 2aLungxparasitology 2aMale 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aRandom Allocation 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxparasitology1 aThamsborg, Stig M.1 aPetersen, Heidi H.1 aKringel, Helene1 aFredholm, Merete1 aRoepstorff, Allan0 tJournal of parasitology.g2009 Oct., v. 95, no. 5 p.1048-1053dAmerican Society of Parasitologistsx0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645%2FGE-1987.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001600188245009200204300001200296506007600308520163900384592002802023596009102051506003702142650002502179650002502204650001602229650001002245650001602255650001802271650001402289650003002303650002102333650002402354650001302378650001102391650002102402650001302423650001602436650000902452650001202461650000802473700001602481700001802497700001802515700001302533700001502546773013102561856008202692852000902774655001202783IND60580103420221207081137.0210514e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058010342DNAL7 a288867412pmid7 aPMC55915222pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-017-1961-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Wenhua10aTaurine and tea polyphenols combination ameliorate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in rats  ap. 455.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, for which there is currently no safe and effective drug for therapy. In this study, we explored the effects of taurine, tea polyphenols (TPs), or a combination thereof, on NASH rats. METHODS: Rats were divided into a normal group, a high-fat diet induced model group and a treatment group (including taurine, TPs, or taurineÂ +Â TPs treatment for 8Â weeks). Twelve weeks later, all rats were sacrificed, and serum transaminase, lipid and lipopolysaccharide levels and hepatic oxidative stress levels were determined. Histological changes were evaluated. RESULTS: In NASH rats, hepatocyte damage, lipid disturbance, oxidative stress and elevated lipopolysaccharide levels were confirmed. Taurine treatment alleviated hepatocyte damage and oxidative stress. TPs treatment improved lipid metabolism and increased hepatic antioxidant activity. The therapeutic effects of taurineÂ +Â TPs treatment on hepatocyte damage, lipid disturbance, and oxidative stress were superior to those of taurine and TPs treatment, respectively. Taurine, TPs and their combination all decreased serum lipopolysaccharide levels in NASH rats, but the combination of the compounds caused these levels to decrease more significantly than taurine or TPs treatment alone. CONCLUSION: Taurine combined with TPs treatment could relieve NASH by alleviating hepatocyte damage, decreasing oxidative stress and improving lipid metabolism and gut flora disturbance partly. Taurine and TPs combination may act as a new effective medicine for treating NASH patients.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 2015XH05cGrant from Science and technology Department of Hainan province in China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalternative medicine 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3adrugs 3afatty liver 3ahigh fat diet 3ahistology 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism 3alipopolysaccharides 3amedicine 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3apolyphenols 3arats 3ataurine 3atea1 aChen, Siwen1 aChen, Ronggui1 aPeng, Zhiqing1 aWan, Jun1 aWu, Benyan0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.455-455dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-1961-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245013500172300002000307520226900327592002802596650001702624650001302641650002802654650001302682650002302695650002102718650002602739650001302765650001802778650003402796650003302830650001202863650002002875650003802895650003702933650001102970700002102981700001703002700002403019700001903043700002603062700003003088773012403118856007403242852000903316655001203325IND60640846420221122211526.0190505e20160714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064084642DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra10575k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, Pulikanti Guruprasad10aDesign, development, EUVL applications and nano mechanical properties of a new HfOâ based hybrid non-chemically amplified resist  ap. 67143-67149.  aA new HfOâ based hybrid polymer HfOââmethacrylateâMAPDST (HMM, Mw â¼27â885 g molâ»Â¹) was synthesized by reacting the hybrid monomer HfOââmethacrylate (HM) with (methacryloyloxy)phenyldimethylsulfoniumtriflate (MAPDST) in the presence of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as a radical initiator in tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile (2â:â1; v/v) at 60 Â°C for Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) applications as a non-chemically amplified resist (n-CAR) material. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analyses revealed the particle sizes of HM and HMM hybrids as â¼3â5 nm and â¼12 nm respectively. Thin films of thickness â¼53 nm were prepared by spin coating 3% (w/v) solutions of HMM in methanol onto 4â²â² p-type Si wafers consisting of a 40 nm hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) under layer. The films were then subjected to EUV exposure at a dose of 51.7127 mJ cmâ»Â² on a micro exposure tool (MET) with an Advanced Light Source (ALS) at SEMATECH Berkeley using standard mask IMO228775 with field R4C3 (LBNL low flare bright-field). The EUV Eâ dose used for the exposure was 22 mJ cmâ»Â². Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) micrographs of the EUV exposed hybrid resist films showed isolated line patterns of 80, 70, 60, 50, 45, 40, 35 and 30 nm for 5â:â1 duty cycle, of which 80 to 50 nm line patterns were well resolved, whereas patterns of 45 to 30 nm or higher resolutions exhibited undesirable traits like bridging, fracturing, de-adhesion, peel-off and pattern collapse. To comprehend the reasons behind these undesirable traits, nano-mechanical properties (modulus and adhesion) of the EUV exposed and developed resist patterns were investigated by using Peak Force-Quantitative Nano-Mechanical (PF-QNM) tapping mode Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). These studies revealed â¼18% and â¼19% reductions in DerjaguinâMÃ¼llerâToporov (DMT) modulus and adhesion magnitudes respectively with an increase in isolated line pattern resolution from 80 to 30 nm for 5â:â1 duty cycles. The reduction in modulus and adhesion magnitudes might have caused the observed fracturing, peel-off and collapse of the high resolution line patterns during the pattern development processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aadhesion 3aatomic force microscopy 3acoatings 3acomposite polymers 3alight scattering 3amechanical properties 3amethanol 3aparticle size 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3atetrahydrofuran 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awafers1 aMamidi, Narsimha1 aKumar, Pawan1 aSharma, Satinder K.1 aGhosh, Subrata1 aGonsalves, Kenneth E.1 aPradeep, Chullikkattil P.0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 14, v. 6, no. 71 p.67143-67149dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra10575k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010100159520128700260592002801547650001201575650001401587650001501601650001301616650001201629650002201641650001701663650003101680650001201711650002101723650001601744650001401760700001801774700001701792700002201809700002201831773012301853856007501976852000902051655001202060IND60791056920221120131634.0220826e20220812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079105692DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141633102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Chia-Ling 10aQuercetin Increases Mitochondrial Biogenesis and Reduces Free Radicals in Neuronal SH-SY5Y Cells  aAlzheimerâs disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that causes dementia and affects millions of people worldwide. The mechanism underlying AD is unclear; however, oxidative stress and mitochondrial biogenesis have been reported to be involved in AD progression. Previous research has also reported the reduction in mitochondrial biogenesis in the brains of patients with AD. Quercetin (QE), a type of polyphenol, has been found to be capable of increasing mitochondrial biogenesis in the body. Accordingly, we explored whether QE could reduce amyloid beta (AÎ²) accumulation caused by hydrogen peroxide (HâOâ)-induced oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells. Our results revealed that QE stimulated the expression of mitochondrial-related proteins such as SIRT1, PGC-1Î±, and TFAM and subsequently activated mitochondrial biogenesis. Additionally, QE increased ADAM10 expression but reduced HâOâ-induced reactive oxygen species production, apoptosis, Î²-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 expression, and AÎ² accumulation in the SH-SY5Y cells. These findings indicate that QE can effectively elevate mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins and reduce the damage caused by oxidative stress, making it a promising option for protecting neuronal cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3aapoptosis 3abiogenesis 3adementia 3aenzymes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amitochondria 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3aquercetin1 aKao, Ning-Jo 1 aLin, Jingyi,1 aCross, Tzu-Wen L.1 aLin, Shyh-Hsiang 0 tNutrients.g2022 Aug. 12, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141633103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03261naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245016200172520207500334592002802409650001702437650001102454650002402465650002002489650001502509650001302524650002002537653002202557653002502579653001802604653002802622653002002650700002102670773011602691856008302807852000902890655001202899IND60681588820221119042357.0200405e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068158882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2020.1266042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSartison, Katharina10aEdible cities â An innovative nature-based solution for urban sustainability transformation? An explorative study of urban food production in German cities  aCities are confronted with different societal challenges calling for urban sustainability transformation (UST). Nature-based solutions (NbS) can provide actions for such challenges and strive for maximizing environmental, social and economic benefits. Edible cities, which encompass different forms of urban food production (UFP) in the city, can be seen as multifunctional NbS. However, the concept of edible cities has just recently arrived in research and its understanding as potential NbS supporting UST is still fragmented. Therefore, the study created an analytical framework, which aims at identifying and prioritizing 1) challenges that edible cities can contribute in the context of UST and 2) strategies for implementing and mainstreaming the edible city in the context of urban sustainability acceleration. The study is of explorative character and encompasses interviews with key actors from three German case studies: Andernach â a German frontrunner in implementing the edible city, Haar â follower I, which implemented the concept after learning from Andernach and Munich â follower II, where the concept of edible cities was not yet implemented but a range of bottom-up activities exist to promote the topic. Results show that edible cities can be seen as NbS that can support UST in terms of social-spatial and socio-ecological transformation, in particular promoting social cohesion and human-nature and food connection. In terms of implementing and mainstreaming, the results suggest that the edible city can be taken up by different city departments due to its multifunctionality. Furthermore, a mix of motivated bottom-up initiatives and top-down authorities paired with courage and room for experimentation on the edible city is crucial for its embedding. Apart from that, network creation with different UFP initiatives as well as with other cities is an important factor for mainstreaming edible cities. Future research shall test the transferability of the analytical framework to other NbS analyzing their potential to contribute to UST.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3afinancial economics 3afood production 3ainterviews 3alearning 3asocial cohesion 0aUrban agriculture 0aUrban transformation 0aMainstreaming 0aHuman-nature connection 0aUrban gardening1 aArtmann, Martina0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2020 Mar., v. 49 p.126604-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2020.1266043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011600163300001600279500002000295520184500315592002802160596002002188596003802208596002202246596002002268650001402288650002002302650001002322650002702332650001802359650001102377650001402388650001402402650001802416650002102434650001902455651001202474651001202486651001802498700006202516700002002578700001802598700002202616700005602638773012002694856007302814852000902887655001202896IND60698673720221118080812.0200614e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069867372DNAL7 a10.1111/jpy.129742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikhailyuk, Tatiana10aDictyosphaeriumâlike morphotype in terrestrial algae: what is Xerochlorella (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta)?1  ap. 671-686.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSeveral strains of terrestrial algae isolated from biological soil crusts in Germany and Ukraine were identified by morphological methods as the widely distributed species Dictyosphaerium minutum (=Dictyosphaerium chlorelloides). Investigation of the phylogeny showed their position unexpectedly outside of Chlorellaceae (Trebouxiophyceae) and distantly from Chlorella chlorelloides, to which this taxon was attributed after revision of the genus Chlorella based on an integrative approach. SSU rRNA phylogeny determined the position of our strains inside a clade recently described as a new genus of the cryptic alga Xerochlorella olmiae isolated from desert biological soil crusts in the United States. Investigation of the morphology of the authentic strain of X.Â olmiae showed Dictyosphaeriumâlike morphology, as well as some other characters, common for our strains and morphospecies D.Â minutum. The latter alga was described as terrestrial and subsequently united with the earlier described aquatic representative D.Â chlorelloides because of their similar morphology. The revision of Chlorella mentioned above provided only one aquatic strain (D.Â chlorelloides), which determined its position in the genus. But terrestrial strains of the morphospecies were not investigated phylogenetically. Our study showed that the terrestrial D.Â minutum is not related to the morphologically similar D.Â chlorelloides (=Chlorella chlorelloides, Chlorellaceae), and instead represented a separate lineage in the Trebouxiophyceae, recently described as genus Xerochlorella. Therefore, revision of Xerochlorella is proposed, including nomenclatural combinations, epitypifications, and emendations of two species: X.Â minuta and X.Â dichotoma. New characters of the genus based on investigation of morphology and ultrastructure were determined.  aPublisher supplied data  cGeorgâForster  cAlexander von Humboldt Foundation  aKA899/28â1cDFG  a1951âB16cFWF 3aChlorella 3aDictyosphaerium 3aalgae 3abiological soil crusts 3amorphospecies 3amorphs 3anew genus 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3atype collections 3aultrastructure 3aGermany 3aUkraine 3aUnited States1 aHolzinger, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7745-39781 aTsarenko, Petro1 aGlaser, Karin1 aDemchenko, Eduard1 aKarsten, Ulf1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2955-07570 tJournal of phycology.g2020 June, v. 56, no. 3 p.671-686dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl23523x0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.129743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100002000163245008200183300001800265500001900283500000900302520102300311592002801334650002301362650001701385650001201402650001801414650001901432650001601451650001501467650001601482650001201498651001001510700001701520773012301537856009801660852000901758655001201767IND60665219520221119233951.0191122e197811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066521952DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1978.0011183X001800060045x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPercival, A.

Five sub-lines were isolated within each isoline. The sub-line within each isoline did not vary significantly. Tests of the isolines showed that they differed significantly in seven of the 13 agronomic characters measured (date of first flower, seed cotton yield, lint yield, boll size, seed index, lint percentage, and lint index). The introgression of frego bract (fg) into the standard background delayed the date of first flower (indicating lateness) and reduced boll size, lint percentage, and lint index.

The provision of adequate nutritional support in this high-risk population is challenging. The development of the lungs and physical growth are closely linked together in infants with BPD. Growth deficiency has been associated with pulmonary dysfunction, whereas improvement in respiratory status results in growth acceleration. Currently, there is not enough data regarding optimal nutritional strategies in this population. Nutrition in these infants should provide sufficient calories and nutrients to establish growth, avoid growth retardation and assist alveolarization of the lungs. Meticulous follow-up is mandatory during and after discharge from the Neonatal Intensive care Unit (NICU) to minimize growth retardation and improve lung function. Despite the significant literature supporting the contribution of growth and nutrition in the avoidance of BPD, there is limited research regarding interventions and management of infants with established BPD. Our aim was to review clinical strategies applied in everyday clinical practice and identify debates on the nutritional approach of newborns with BPD. Well-organized interventions and clinical trials regarding the somatic development and nutrition of infants with BPD are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3abronchopulmonary dysplasia 3agrowth retardation 3alung function 3anutritional support 3aoptimal nutrition1 aGkentzi, Despoina 1 aVarvarigou, Anastasia 0 tNutrients.g2022 Aug. 12, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141633113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245014300165300002000308520181200328592002802140650001602168650003702184650001502221650002202236650001902258650001402277650001502291650002202306650000902328650002402337650001302361650001802374650001202392700001202404700002302416700002202439700002302461700001902484700002102503700002202524700002002546773012902566856008202695852000902777655001202786IND60566901320221121062428.0170414e20160728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056690132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b008952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasuda, Takuya10aVarious Active Metal Species Incorporated within Molecular Layers on Si(111) Electrodes for Hydrogen Evolution and CO2 Reduction Reactions  ap. 16200-16210.  aOrganic molecular layers with viologen moieties as electron transfer mediators were constructed on hydrogen-terminated Si(111) surfaces, and metal catalysts for multielectron transfer reactions were incorporated into the molecular layers by immersing the viologen-modified Si(111) electrodes in aqueous solutions containing various metal complexes (KâPdClâ, NaAuClâ, and KâPtClâ). Significant enhancements were achieved for COâ reduction at the Au-modified Si(111) electrode and for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and COâ reduction at the Pd-modified Si(111) electrode. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis showed that Au complexes were spontaneously reduced to metal nanoparticles during the metal insertion, and therefore, actual catalysts for COâ reduction at the Au-modified Si(111) electrode were Au metal nanoparticles. In contrast, Pd complexes were inserted into the molecular layers and partly reduced during HER and COâ reduction. Pd complexes and relatively small Pd nanoparticles (<2 nm) were considered to be actual catalysts for HER and COâ reduction. Interestingly, at the Pt-modified Si(111) electrode, not only highly efficient HER but also highly selective COâ reduction in preference to HER were achieved, despite the fact that HER is dominant at Pt pure metal electrodes even in COâ-saturated aqueous solutions. On the basis of XPS and XAFS analysis, Pt complexes were incorporated into the molecular layers and acted as confined molecular catalysts for both HER and COâ reduction without being converted into Pt metal nanoparticles. This should be the major reason for the anomalously high selectivity of the Pt-modified Si(111) electrode for COâ reduction, unlike pure Pt metal electrocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3agold 3ahydrogen production 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3asilicon1 aSun, Yu1 aFukumitsu, Hitoshi1 aUehara, Hiromitsu1 aTakakusagi, Satoru1 aChun, Wang-Jae1 aKondo, Toshihiro1 aAsakura, Kiyotaka1 aUosaki, KÅhei,0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 July 28, v. 120, no. 29 p.16200-16210dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b008953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009100161300001600252520116300268592002801431650003701459650001201496650001201508650001501520650001101535650002101546650001501567650002501582650001901607650002101626650003301647650001801680700001801698700001501716700001501731700001601746700001601762773010301778856008201881852000901963655001201972IND60091522320221116171957.0141103e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009152232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.07.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Bin10aPower production enhancement with a polyaniline modified anode in microbial fuel cells  ap. 373-377.  aIn this paper, an approach of improving power generation of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) by using a HSOâ â» doped polyaniline modified carbon cloth anode was reported. The modification of carbon cloth anode was accomplished by electrochemical polymerization of aniline in 5% HâSOâ solution. A dual-chamber MFC reactor with the modified anode achieved a maximum power density of 5.16Wmâ»Â³, an internal resistance of 90Î©, and a start-up time of 4 days, which was respectively 2.66 times higher, 65.5% lower, and 33.3% shorter than the corresponding values of the MFC with unmodified anode. Evidence from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy results proved that the formation of biofilm on the anode surface could prevent the HSOâ â» doped polyaniline to be de-doped, and the results from electrochemical tests confirmed that the electrochemical activity of the modified anode was enhanced significantly after inoculation. Charge transfer was facilitated by polyaniline modification. All the results indicated that the polyaniline modification on the anode was an efficient approach of improving the performance of MFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaniline 3abiofilm 3abiosensors 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3amicrobial fuel cells 3apolymerization 3apower generation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asulfuric acid1 aTang, Xinghua1 aLi, Haoran1 aDu, Zhuwei1 aLiu, Xinwei1 aZhang, Qian0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 28, no. 1 p.373-377dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.07.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245020000159300001600359520080800375592002801183650001401211650001301225650001801238650001001256650002501266650001401291650001301305651001501318653001301333653002301346653001401369653001401383653001601397653001301413700002101426773011501447856007101562852000901633655001201642IND60637211420221116182453.0190416s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063721142DNAL7 a10.1071/IS180612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKallal, Robert J.10aEvolution of the male palp morphology of the orb-weaver hunting spider Chorizopes (Araneae:Araneidae) revisited on a new phylogeny of Araneidae, and description of a third species from Madagascar  ap. 473-487.  aThe genus Chorizopes (Araneae, Araneidae) includes over two dozen species of webless araneids found mainly in the Indomalayan region. They are characterised by a distinctive bulbous carapace and a specialised foraging behaviour: preying on other orb-weavers. Chorizopes casictones, sp. nov.

The palpal morphology of the male of Chorizopes is illustrated in detail. We discuss the palpal homologies and the evolution of araneid palpal sclerites based on the newly inferred family phylogenetic tree.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneidae 3aforaging 3ainvertebrates 3amales 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3ataxonomy 3aMadagascar 0aarachnid 0aBayesian inference 0agenitalia 0aparsimony 0asystematics 0ataxonomy1 aHormiga, Gustavo0 tInvertebrate systematics.g2019, v. 33, no. 2 p.473-487dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957319x1445-52267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/IS180613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245011500208520073200323592002801055650002501083650001001108650002801118650001601146650001701162650001001179650001501189650001701204650001301221653001501234653002401249653003401273653002201307700001701329700001901346700001501365700001401380700002101394773010301415856008601518852000901604655001201613IND60722142620221119105059.0220606e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072214262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1047032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zongyao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4202-957910aEnhancement in serum (1â3)-Î²-D-glucan level by cutaneous alternariosis: A case report and literature review  aContamination with the fungus Alternaria spp. is often considered to have originated from laboratory sources, which occasionally causes infection in immunocompromised patients, termed as phaeohyphomycosis. Here, we have reported a case of cutaneous alternariosis caused by Alternaria alternata. This diagnosis was based on microscopic examination and mycological culturing of patient's vesicular lesions, with the use of 5 molecular markers (namely, ITS, ATPase, Actin, rpb2, and tef1) for strain identification. We noted that Alternaria infection caused an increase in the serum level of (1â3)-Î²-D-glucan (BG) in the patients.

Financial redistribution mechanisms based on accrued benefits and costs of conservation require relevant data unavailable in many locations. To address this, a contingent valuation method identified willingness to pay (WTP) among national park visitors and connected tourism business owners. Both groups derive benefit from government-funded conservation policies. The study was conducted in Bardia and Chitwan National Parks, Nepal 2017â2018; two locations world-renowned for tiger conservation. Local and international park visitors (NÂ =Â 387) provided WTP for ongoing conservation via additional park entry fees. Tourism business owners (TBOs; NÂ =Â 74) proximate to the parks stated their WTP for compensation funding provided directly to farmers. The majority (65%) of park visitors were willing to pay extra to support conservation (sample mean US$ 20) while 85 percent of TBOs supported their payment of funds for compensating farming communities (sample mean annual contribution being US$ 156). Valid WTP regression modelling found that visitor WTP was predicted by international travel costsand environmental organization affiliation. For TBOs indicating WTP, the amount to pay was predicted by annual net income from the tourism business. Application of study data indicates US$ 25 average increase to visitor park fees would maximise revenue and contribute a further US$ 495,000 available for conservation activities. Similarly, a flat-rate tariff on TBOs at the mean WTP amount would contribute more than double the annual budget available for farmer compensation (providing approximately US$ 43,000). More generally, the study findings are informative for policy-makers seeking equitable conservation outcomes while maintaining viable populations of critically endangered wild tigers. They should however be interpreted with caution given limitations of the sampling frame and method of data elicitation. Regardless, any policy decision effects require careful scrutiny to ensure desired outcomes are realized.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontingent valuation 3aenvironmental management 3afarmers 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3anational parks 3astakeholders 3atariffs 3atourism 3atravel 3awillingness to pay 3aNepal1 aMorgan, Damian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2811-27201 aWright, Wendy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3388-12730 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 284 p.112018-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1120183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245007700177520149200254592002801746650001501774650002901789650001801818650001501836650002501851650001101876650001901887650002001906650002301926650001701949650001601966650001601982650001401998650002102012653001502033653001002048653002902058700006402087700002902151700002002180700002102200700002502221700006002246700002502306700002302331773010302354856008602457852000902543655001202552IND60722142720221119104954.0220606e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072214272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1047042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Priscila N.10aInactivation of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 by pathogenic Leptospira  aLeptospires are aerobic, Gram-negative spirochetes with a high invasive capacity. Pathogenic leptospires secrete proteases that inactivate a variety of host's proteins including molecules of the extracellular matrix and of the human complement system. This strategy, used by several pathogens of medical importance, contributes to bacterial invasion and immune evasion. In the current work we present evidence that Leptospira proteases also target human cathelicidin (LL-37), an antimicrobial peptide that plays an important role in the innate immune response. By using six Leptospira strains, four pathogenic and two saprophytic, we demonstrated that proteases present in the supernatants of pathogenic strains were capable of degrading LL-37 in a time-dependent manner, whereas proteolytic degradation was not observed with the supernatants of the two saprophytic strains. Inactivation of LL-37 was prevented by using the 1,10-phenanthroline inhibitor, thus suggesting the involvement of metalloproteinases in this process. In addition, the antibacterial activity of LL-37 against two Leptospira strains was evaluated. Compared to the saprophytic strain, a greater resistance of the pathogenic strain to the action of the peptide was observed. Our data suggest that the capacity to inactivate the host defense peptide LL-37 may be part of the virulence arsenal of pathogenic Leptospira, and we hypothesize that its inactivation by the bacteria may influence the outcome of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptospira 3aantibacterial properties 3acathelicidins 3acomplement 3aextracellular matrix 3ahumans 3aimmune evasion 3ainnate immunity 3ametalloproteinases 3apathogenesis 3aproteolysis 3asaprophytes 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 0aLeptospira 0aLL-37 0aProteolytic inactivation1 aCourrol, Daniella S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4448-59031 aChura-Chambi, Rosa Maria1 aMorganti, Ligia1 aSouza, Gisele O.1 aFranzolin, Marcia R.1 aWunder, Elsio A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5239-85111 aHeinemann, Marcos B.1 aBarbosa, Angela S.0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2021 Jan., v. 150 p.104704-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1047043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010900168300001400277520118800291592002801479650002701507650002101534650001201555650001201567650001701579650001301596650001601609650001401625650001801639650001601657650002301673650000901696650002101705650001801726650001901744650001601763650001301779653001601792653002101808653001201829653000701841653000701848653002101855700001701876700001801893700001201911700001501923700001801938700001701956700001501973700002001988700001402008700001802022773010302040856008402143852000902227655001202236IND60531622720221119054630.0160723e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053162272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.05.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hanzhi10aComparison of chelates for enhancing Ricinus communis L. phytoremediation of Cd and Pb contaminated soil  ap. 57-62.  aWe studied chelate effects on castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) growth. These effects included Cd and Pb accumulation in plant tissues and the chemical behavior of Cd and Pb in the plant rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere. Tests were conducted in a glasshouse using the rhizobag method. Two castor bean cultivars (Zibo-3 and Zibo-9) were grown in soil contaminated with 3.53mg/kg Cd and 274mg/kg Pb. The soil was treated with citric acid (CA), ethylenediamine disuccinic acid (EDDS) or ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (5mmol/kg). EDDS-treated soil produced 28.8% and 59.4% greater biomass for Zibo-3 and Zibo-9 respectively. In contrast, CA and EDTA inhibited the growth of the two cultivars. Zibo-9 had greater tolerance than Zibo-3 to chelate toxicity. Based on Cd and Pb plant uptake, EDDS could substitute for EDTA for phytoremediation of Cd in soil. EDTA was the most effective of the three chelates for Pb phytoremediation but it is less suitable for field use due to toxicology environmental persistence. Acid extractable Cd and Pb in the rhizosphere or reducible Cd and Pb in the non-rhizosphere of soil were the main influences on Cd and Pb accumulation in castor bean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aRicinus communis 3abiomass 3acadmium 3acastor beans 3achelates 3acitric acid 3acultivars 3aecotoxicology 3agreenhouses 3agrowth retardation 3alead 3aphytoremediation 3aplant tissues 3apolluted soils 3arhizosphere 3atoxicity 0aCastor bean 0aRicinus communis 0aChelate 0aCd 0aPb 0aChemical species1 aGuo, Qingjun1 aYang, Junxing1 aMa, Jie1 aChen, Gang1 aChen, Tongbin1 aZhu, Guangxu1 aWang, Jian1 aZhang, Guangxin1 aWang, Xin1 aShao, Chunyan0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2016 Nov., v. 133 p.57-62dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.05.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001100150245015900161500002200320520124900342592002801591653002001619653001901639653002601658700001501684700001801699700001901717700001801736700001801754700005301772700001801825700001601843773006701859856008401926852000902010655001202019IND60563363120221120224045.0170719s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056336312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mtener.2017.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Ge10aConstructing novel WO3/Fe(III) nanofibers photocatalysts with enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity via interfacial charge transfer effect  aPre-press version  aIn this work, we have prepared a series of efficient visible-light-driven WO3/Fe(III) nanofiber photocatalysts by electrospinning and impregnation method. The physical and optical properties of the prepared photocatalysts were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the nitrogen adsorption analysis. Under the irradiation of visible light, all the prepared WO3/Fe(III) nanofiber photocatalysts exhibit much higher activity for degrading methyl orange (MO) solution than the pristine WO3 nanofibers, and reaches 94.6% under visible light irradiation for 3Â h when the relative grafting amount of Fe(III) ions was 0.003 by mass percentage. Grafting of Fe(III) ions on the surface of WO3 nanofiber could enhance its visible-light absorption and reduce the photo-generated electron-hole pairs recombination due to the interfacial charge transfer (IFCT) effect, and thus improve its photocatalytic activity, which were further verified by the ultravioletâvisible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UVâVis DRS), photoluminescence (PL) and the ns-level time-resolved fluorescence decay spectrum measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 0aElectrospinning 0aPhotocatalytic 0aWO3/Fe(III) nanofiber1 aChen, Zhen1 aChen, Zhihong1 aJin, Mingliang1 aMeng, Qingguo1 aYuan, Mingzhe1 aWang, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4771-84531 aLiu, Jun-Ming1 aZhou, Guofu0 tMaterials Today Energy.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx2468-60697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mtener.2017.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04156naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245020400170520202000374592002802394650001802422650002502440650002802465650002002493650001802513650002502531650001402556650001302570650002402583650001902607650001702626650001502643650001302658650001802671650002102689650002002710650002102730650002202751650001802773650001102791650002102802650001702823650001702840650001502857650001302872650001802885650002102903650002402924653002002948653002202968653002202990653003403012653002203046653002103068700001703089700006503106700006103171700002603232700002603258773010303284856008603387852000903473655001203482IND60722142820221119104910.0220606e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072214282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1047052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdulla, Faruq12aA comprehensive screening of the whole proteome of hantavirus and designing a multi-epitope subunit vaccine for cross-protection against hantavirus: Structural vaccinology and immunoinformatics study  aHantaviruses are an emerging zoonotic group of rodent-borne viruses that are having serious implications on global public health due to the increase in outbreaks. Since there is no permanent cure, there is increasing interest in developing a vaccine against the hantavirus. This research aimed to design a robust cross-protective subunit vaccine using a novel immunoinformatics approach. After careful evaluation, the best predicted cytotoxic & helper T-cell and B-cell epitopes from nucleocapsid proteins, glycoproteins, RdRp proteins, and non-structural proteins were considered as potential vaccine candidates. Among the four generated vaccine models with different adjuvant, the model with toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) agonist adjuvant was selected because of its high antigenicity, non-allergenicity, and structural quality. The selected model was 654 amino acids long and had a molecular weight of 70.5Â kDa, which characterizes the construct as a good antigenic vaccine candidate. The prediction of the conformational B-lymphocyte (CBL) epitope secured its ability to induce the humoral response. Thereafter, disulfide engineering improved vaccine stability. Afterwards, the molecular docking confirmed a good binding affinity of â1292 kj/mol with considered immune receptor TLR-4 and the dynamics simulation showed high stability of the vaccine-receptor complex. Later, the in silico cloning confirmed the better expression of the constructed vaccine protein in E. coli K12. Finally, in in silico immune simulation, significantly high levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), cytotoxic & helper T lymphocyte (CTL & HTL) populations, and numerous cytokines such as interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), interleukin-2 (IL-2) etc. were found as coherence with actual immune response and also showed faster antigen clearance for repeated exposures. Nonetheless, experimental validation can demonstrate the safety and cross-protective ability of the proposed vaccine to fight against hantavirus infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aEscherichia coli K12 3aHantaviridae infections 3aOrthohantavirus 3aT-lymphocytes 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aadjuvants 3aagonists 3acomputer simulation 3across immunity 3acytotoxicity 3adisulfides 3aepitopes 3aglycoproteins 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoinformatics 3ainterleukin-2 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3anucleocapsid 3apathogenesis 3aprediction 3aproteome 3apublic health 3asubunit vaccines 3avaccine development 0aOrthohantavirus 0aImmunoinformatics 0aImmune simulation 0aMolecular dynamics simulation 0aIn silico cloning 0aCross-protection1 aNain, Zulkar1 aHossain, Md.

This estimate is important because a decrease in genetic variability might result in a reduction of the plasticity of the crops to respond to changes in climate, pathogen populations, or agricultural practices. In this study, 105 Argentine bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars released between 1932 and 1995 were characterized by simple sequence repeat (SSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A selected subset of 10 highly informative SSR was used to construct an Identification Matrix that allowed the discrimination of the 105 cultivars. Data obtained from SSR markers were complemented by information derived from AFLPs. Molecular data were used to quantify genetic diversity across Argentine wheat breeding programs and to determine if modern wheat cultivars have a lower genetic diversity than earlier cultivars (genetic erosion). No significant differences in genetic diversity were found among the large private and public breeding programs, suggesting that each of them contains a representative sample of the complete diversity of the Argentine germplasm. Significant differences were found for both SSR and AFLP only between breeding programs with large differences in number of released cultivars. No significant differences in genetic diversity were found between the group of cultivars released before 1960 and those released in each of the following three decades. Average diversity values based on SSR markers were almost identical for the four analyzed periods. Genetic diversity estimates based on AFLP data confirmed the absence of a reduction of genetic diversity with time, but significant differences (P = 0.01) were found between bread wheat cultivars released in the 1970s (PIC = 0.28) and those released in the 1980s (PIC = 0.34). These results show that the Argentine bread wheat germplasm has maintained a relatively constant level of genetic diversity during the last half century.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aTriticum aestivum 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aclimate 3acultivars 3agenetic erosion 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apathogens 3aplasticity 3aquantitative analysis 3awheat1 aSchlatter, A.R.1 aHopp, H.E.1 aSuÃ¡rez, E.Y.1 aDubcovsky, J.0 tCrop science.g2001 May, v. 41, no. 3 p.682-690dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2001.413682x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245012000177520107200297592002801369650001601397650002001413650001601433650001701449650001801466650001301484650001301497650002101510650001201531650001701543650001601560650001901576650001601595650003001611650002601641650002201667650001101689650001601700650001201716650001501728650001901743650001601762650001701778650001901795650001201814650001101826653001401837653002901851653001901880700002101899700003101920700002401951773011201975856008202087852000902169655001202178IND60681589720221119043511.0200228e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068158972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2020.1037872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwolabi, Iyiola Oluwakemi10aGut microbiota metabolism of functional carbohydrates and phenolic compounds from soaked and germinated purple rice  aThis study revealed that soaking and germination significantly reduced (PÂ <Â 0.05) the glycemic index of purple rice (72.64Â Â±Â 0.75â61.52Â Â±Â 3.11%) and lowest value was observed with 24Â h soaked sample.

The initial requirements were for a robust substrate with strong surface enhancement of Raman scattering with minimal surface contamination. The rods with length up to 20 Î¼m were electrochemically deposited in alumina templates bonded to gold-coated silicon wafers. After the removal of the template, surface-bound cyanide from the deposition process was removed by mild electropolishing. Reflectance and cathodoluminescence measurements revealed transverse dipole and quadrupole plasmon modes. Surface enhancement of 10â¶ was determined by taking Raman spectra of self-assembled monolayers of 4-aminothiophenol. The enhancement factor (EF) was found to be independent of nanorod aspect ratio because only the length of the nanorods was varied while their diameter was kept constant, and because of the large length of nanorods only the transverse plasmons were excited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aaluminum oxide 3acyanides 3aelectrochemistry 3agold 3ananorods 3aphysical chemistry 3areflectance 3asilicon 3awafers1 aMartens, Isaac1 aGrÃ¼Ãer, Martin1 aBizzotto, Dan1 aSchuster, Rolf1 aLipkowski, Jacek0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 July 28, v. 120, no. 29 p.16246-16253dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b027423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245014700163300001800310500001900328500000900347520147700356592002801833650001901861650000901880650002801889650002201917650003701939650001601976650001401992650001202006650001402018650000902032650002002041650001602061700001302077700001702090700001702107700001502124700001502139700001602154773013402170856008402304852000902388655001202397IND60665220320221119231553.0191122e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066522032DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2015.04.02312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, E.A.10aInvolvement of Year-to-Year Variation in Thermal Time, Solar Radiation and Soil Available Moisture in Genotype-by-Environment Effects in Maize  ap. 2180-2192.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aYear-to-year variability in temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation is increasing due to global climate change. This enhanced variation will likely lead to more frequent and larger genotype-by-environment interaction (G Ã E) effects impacting genetic gains from selection. In this study G Ã E effects are examined in the absence of genetic variation for thermal time requirements (i.e., phenology), with an understanding of which physiological mechanisms are responsible for genotypic differences in grain yield, using a series of developmental windows, and in the context of fully characterized environments. Using a set of hybrid RILs of the classic Iodent Ã Stiff Stalk heterotic pattern, we demonstrate that the hybrid RILs are phenologically uniform and that grain yield differences are due primarily to genetic variation in dry matter accumulation during the grain filling period. We demonstrate that annual fluctuations in thermal time and solar radiation during key windows of development are causing G Ã E effects, and that variation in soil available water is not a major contributor to the G Ã E effects. Finally, we present evidence to support the concept that G Ã E effects resulting in crossover interactions occur due to how the genotypes respond to environmental factors that impact development, while G Ã E effects resulting in changes in magnitude arise due to variation in how genotypes respond to growth-related environmental parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acorn 3adry matter accumulation 3agenetic variation 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrain yield 3aheterosis 3ahybrids 3aphenology 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3atemperature1 aDeen, W.1 aHooyer, M.E.1 aChambers, A.1 aParkin, G.1 aGordon, R.1 aSingh, A.K.0 tCrop science.g2016 Sept., v. 56, no. 5 p.2180-2192dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2015.04.02313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245009700162506025800259520117900517592002801696650001701724650001201741650001501753650001301768650002601781650001301807650001801820651001001838653001901848653001101867653002601878653002501904700002601929700001601955700002801971773012401999856007602123852000902199655001202208IND60478793720221119060643.0160114e20150630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047879372DNAL7 a10.4081/jae.2015.4262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErbino, Chantal10aGuidelines for the Design of a Healing Garden for the Rehabilitation of Psychiatric Patients  aThis article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License (by-nc 3.0) which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.  aHealing gardens are green spaces designed to promote and improve health and well-being for people suffering from illness. This paper proposes a methodology for defining a master plan for healing gardens. The methodology is based on site analysis (identification, limitations and potentials of the area) and the evaluation of user needs (patients, staff, relatives). The aim of the master plan is to provide guidelines for the definition of the executive plan, and to set up a sufficiently flexible project suitable for future new categories of patients, according to the different needs of the regional health authorities. The methodology has been applied to a case study: this paper considers the design of the healing garden of a building named Villa Bianca, part of the wider complex of the clinic for mental disorders Villa di Salute located in Trofarello (in the province of Turin, Piedmont, Italy). The main kinds of disturbances treated at Villa di Salute are schizophrenia and personality disorders; there are also some patients with severe depression. At the present time the building and the garden of Villa Bianca are not being used and are undergoing renovation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3agardens 3aguidelines 3apatients 3apersonality disorders 3apiedmont 3aschizophrenia 3aItaly 0aHealing garden 0adesign 0ahorticultural therapy 0apsychiatric patients1 aToccolini, Alessandro1 aVagge, Ilda1 aFerrario, Paolo Stefano0 tJournal of agricultural engineering.g2015 June 30, v. 46, no. 2dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx2239-62687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jae.2015.4263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01569naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245009200160300001600252520058400268592002800852650001600880650001200896650001900908653001200927653001300939653002300952653001200975700001400987700001401001700001701015773011001032856008001142852000901222655001201231IND60616426620221119080541.0181016e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061642662DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175156221512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParada, M12aA review on advanced imaging technologies for the quantification of wicking in textiles  ap. 110-132.  aThis review covers imaging techniques of wicking in textiles ranging from visible light to synchrotron x-ray.

Gilts (N = 32) were part of an ongoing reproductive efficiency study involving the use of raw soybean (RSB; N = 15) versus soybean meal (SBM; N = 17) as a source of dietary protein. Gilts were monitored daily for signs of estrus using a teaser boar. Thermal images of vulva surface temperatures (TEMP) were recorded at standing estrus and diestrus. Measurements for analysis included minimum (MIN), maximum (MAX), mean (AVG), and standard deviation (SD) of temperature gradients. At imaging, ambient (AMB) and rectal temperatures (RT) were recorded, and blood samples taken for serum progesterone (Pâ) concentration analysis (by RIA) to confirm stage of cycle. Mean serum progesterone values at estrus and diestrus were (mean Â± SD) 1.0 Â± 0.1 and 10.9 Â± 0.8 ng/mL, respectively. Vulva MIN, MAX, and AVG thermal images were positively correlated with one another (P < 0.01), and were positively correlated with ambient temperature (P < 0.01). Vulva MAX and AVG thermal temperatures were greater (P < 0.05) at estrus than at diestrus (36.6 Â± 0.2 Â°C and 33.4 Â± 0.3 Â°C vs. 35.6 Â± 0.3 Â°C and 31.8 Â± 0.6 Â°C, respectively), whereas MIN and SD had no differences (P > 0.05) between stages of the cycle. No differences (P > 0.05) in RT were detected between stages and RT was not significantly correlated with vulva thermal images. Diet had no significant effect on RT or vulva temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3ablood 3aboars 3acorrelation 3adiestrus 3adietary protein 3aestrus 3agilts 3aimage analysis 3alandraces 3aprogesterone 3areproductive efficiency 3asoybean meal 3asoybeans 3asurface temperature 3atemperature profiles 3avulva 2aAnimals 2aBody Temperaturexphysiology 2aDiestrusxphysiology 2aEstrusxphysiology 2aEstrus Detectionxmethods 2aFemale 2aInfrared Raysxdiagnostic use. 2aSignal Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aSwinexphysiology 2aThermographyxmethodsxveterinary. 2aVulvaxphysiology1 aCouvillion, J.S.1 aCromiak, A.1 aBowers, S.1 aSchenck, E.1 aCrenshaw, M.1 aRyan, P.L.0 tTheriogenology.g2012 July 1, v. 78, no. 1 p.147-152dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2012.01.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011100171300001600282500001900298500000900317520161200326592002801938650002801966650000801994650002002002650002002022650002302042650002202065650001102087650002302098650002202121650002302143650001602166650001502182650001902197650002302216650001102239650001702250650002402267650001302291650001802304650001002322651001802332700002102350700002202371700002202393773013102415856008402546852000902630655001202639IND60665220520221119231441.0191122e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066522052DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2013.04.02612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarson, Steven R.10aGenes and Quantitative Trait Loci Controlling Biomass Yield and Forage Quality Traits in Perennial Wildrye  ap. 111-126.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aNative perennial grasses have potential as low-input biomass feedstocks. Basin wildrye [Leymus cinereus (Scribn. & Merr.) Ã. LÃ¶ve] is the largest native grass in western North America but is susceptible to defoliation. Creeping wildrye [Leymus triticoides (Buckley) Pilg.] is a shorter less productive grass with durable rhizomes and higher forage quality. Two creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations derived from interspecific hybrids were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling plant height, rhizome spreading, flowering, postanthesis biomass yield, cellulosic fiber, lignin, and protein traits using a linkage map comprising 376 expressed sequence tags and 423 other DNA markers. Biomass yields of the Fâ hybrids and pseudo-backcross populations were significantly greater than creeping wildrye with some genotypes nearly equal to or greater than basin wildrye. Rhizome spreading and forage quality of the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations were significantly greater than basin wildrye. Six of nine plant height QTL overlap with biomass QTL. Three flowering QTL detected in both populations overlap with fiber QTL. Plant height and flowering QTL were aligned to genes controlling dwarfing, photoperiod response, and vernalization in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) using the Brachypodium distachyon (L.) P. Beauv. genome reference sequence. Evidence suggests that genetic mechanisms controlling plant height and flowering are conserved among temperate grasses and reveals pathways for improving biomass production and forage quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachypodium distachyon 3aDNA 3aHordeum vulgare 3aLeymus cinereus 3aLeymus triticoides 3aTriticum aestivum 3abarley 3abiomass production 3acellulosic fibers 3achromosome mapping 3adefoliation 3afeedstocks 3aforage quality 3aindigenous species 3alignin 3aplant height 3aquantitative traits 3arhizomes 3avernalization 3awheat 3aNorth America1 aJensen, Kevin B.1 aRobins, Joseph G.1 aWaldron, Blair L.0 tCrop science.g2014 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.111-126dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2013.04.02613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009700169300001600266500002000282500001900302500000900321520155200330592002801882596004601910650002301956650001401979650002001993650001302013650001602026650001502042650001502057651001202072651001302084651001402097651001602111651001302127651001402140700003002154700002102184700001802205700002002223700001602243700001902259700001602278700001602294773013102310856008402441852000902525655001202534IND60665220620221119231530.0220805e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066522062DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2018.04.02222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaper, Tyson B.10aGenetic and Environmental Contributions to Cotton Yield and Fiber Quality in the MidâSouth  ap. 307-317.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aProducers need to know the contributions of genotype, environment, and their interaction (GÃE) in determining cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) lint yield, lint percentage, and fiber quality. The recent introduction of longer upper half mean length (UHML) fiber, lower micronaire cultivars may alter previously defined contributions. The objectives of this research were to define the genotype, environment, and GÃE contributions to lint yield, lint percentage, and fiber quality from common cultivars evaluated within the US MidâSouth and define shifts in these contributions caused by the introduction of a longer UHML, lower micronaire cultivar. Data from 102 largeâplot trials within Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee were compiled from the 2015 and 2016 seasons; 85 siteâyears contained three common cultivars, and 69 contained four common cultivars. Analysis of three common cultivars within the 69âsiteâyear dataset indicated environment dominated factors of lint yield (85.8%), lint percentage (88.5%), micronaire (70.9%), length (70.5%), and uniformity (70.4%). Large increases in the contribution of genotype to micronaire (26.0%) and length (37.6%) were observed when the lower micronaire, longer UHML cultivar was included. The relatively minor role of cultivar in determining lint yield and the substantial role of cultivar in determining micronaire and length suggest that producers within the MidâSouth should begin to place more importance on fiber quality data when selecting cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data  cCotton Commission and Cotton Incorporated 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acultivars 3adata collection 3agenotype 3alint cotton 3alint yield 3amicronaire 3aAlabama 3aArkansas 3aLouisiana 3aMississippi 3aMissouri 3aTennessee1 aSnider, J.

This paper examines the pig and poultry market chains of four targeted Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs): Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu and combines them with a risk pathway analysis to identify the highest risk areas (risk hotspots) and risky practices and behaviours (risk factors) of animal disease introduction and/or spread, using highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) as model diseases because of their importance in the region. The results show that combining a market chain analysis with risk pathways is a practical way of communicating risk to animal health officials and improving biosecurity. It provides a participatory approach that helps officials to better understand the trading regulations in place in their country and to better evaluate their role as part of the control system. Common risk patterns were found to play a role in all four PICTs. Legal trade pathways rely essentially on preventive measures put in place in the exporting countries while no or only limited control measures are undertaken by the importing countries. Legal importations of animals and animal products are done mainly by commercial farms which then supply local smallholders. Targeting surveillance on these potential hotspots would limit the risk of introduction and spread of animal diseases within the pig and poultry industry and better rationalize use of skilled manpower. Swill feeding is identified as a common practice in the region that represents a recognized risk factor for dissemination of pathogens to susceptible species. Illegal introduction of animals and animal products is suspected, but appears restricted to small holder farms in remote areas, limiting the risk of spread of transboundary animal diseases along the market chain. Introduction of undeclared goods hidden within a legal trade activity was identified as a major risk pathway. Activities such as awareness campaigns for pig and poultry farmers regarding disease reporting, biosecurity measures or danger of swill feeding and training of biosecurity officers in basic animal health and import-associated risks are recommended to prevent and limit the spread of pathogens within the PICTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal health 3aanimal products 3aavian influenza 3abiosecurity 3acommercial farms 3acontrol methods 3adeveloping countries 3adisease surveillance 3afarmers 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3amarkets 3apathogens 3apoultry 3apoultry industry 3arisk analysis 3arisk factors 3aswine 3atrade 3aFiji 3aPapua New Guinea 3aSolomon Islands 3aVanuatu 0aPacific Island countries and territories 0aRisk hotspot 0aPig/poultry market chain 0aLegal/illegal trade 0aHighly pathogenic avian influenza 0aFoot-and-mouth disease1 aGummow, Bruce0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2016 July 01, v. 129 p.13-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2016.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245017600173500001900349520183100368592002802199650002302227650001602250650001602266650001902282650001102301650001602312650000902328650000902337650001802346650001802364650002002382650001102402650002302413650002502436650002302461650000902484650001702493650002402510650001302534650001602547650001002563650001602573653001202589653000902601700005602610700002302666700001702689700001802706700002002724700001602744700001602760773010802776856009002884852000902974655001202983IND60736748820221116171928.0210608e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073674882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2021.1064002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaaban, M.M.10aThyme and celery as potential alternatives to ionophores use in livestock production: their effects on feed utilization, growth performance and meat quality of Barki lambs  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of including thyme, celery or their mixture (as an alternative to salinomycin ionophore) on nutrient utilization and animal performance were evaluated using Barki lambs. Fifty-five lambs weighing 18.5 Â± 1.1 kg and about 90 Â± 5 days old were stratified into 5 treatment groups and fed: (1) a control diet of concentrates and maize fodder (600:400 on dry matter basis), or the control diet supplemented with (2) 15 g of thyme, (3) 15 g of celery, (4) 15 g of thyme and celery mixture, or (5) 1 g of salinomycin/lamb daily for 288 days. Additives significantly increased (P<0.05) both maize and total intakes, while thyme and thyme-celery significantly increased nutrient digestibility (P<0.05) compared with the control treatment. Celery, thyme-celery and salinomycin treatments decreased (P<0.05) serum cholesterol. Celery increased (P<0.05) final body weight, weight gain and average daily gain without affecting shrunk liveweight, hot carcass weight or dressing percent. Thyme-celery mix increased fat thickness of the rib cuts (P<0.001), while thyme, thyme-celery and celery treatments increased (P<0.01) the longissimus muscle area. Salinomycin, celery and thyme treatments increased (P<0.05) the lean proportion and decreased the fat proportion.

Overall, results in the present study showed that these natural additives had similar effects to salinomycin, but further studies are necessary to validate the results and their mechanism of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaverage daily gain 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acarcass weight 3acelery 3acholesterol 3acorn 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afat thickness 3afeed conversion 3aforage 3agrowth performance 3alivestock production 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat 3ameat quality 3amechanism of action 3aresearch 3asalinomycin 3athyme 3aweight gain 0aCarcass 0aLamb1 aKholif, A.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0472-47701 aAbd El Tawab, A.M.1 aRadwan, M.A.1 aHadhoud, F.I.1 aKhattab, M.S.A.1 aSaleh, H.M.1 aAnele, U.Y.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2021 July, v. 200 p.106400-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2021.1064003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03965naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245013900172300001600311520241100327592002802738650001602766650000902782650001902791650000902810650002202819650002302841650000902864650002402873650001102897650001402908650002502922650001002947650001802957650001602975653001902991653001103010653001403021653002503035653001003060653001403070700001603084700001703100700001703117700002003134700001603154700001903170700001803189773011803207856008903325852000903414655001203423IND60532516220221117203001.0190403e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053251622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2015.09.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrobose, H.L.14aThe influence of pelleting and supplementing sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5) on nursery pigs fed diets contaminated with deoxynivalenol  ap. 152-164.  aFour experiments were conducted to ascertain the effects of hydrothermal treatment and sodium metabisulfite (SMB) on deoxynivalenol (DON)-contaminated corn dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). Experiment 1 evaluated SMB and heat (autoclaving) on high-DON DDGS (20.6mg/kg). Six levels of SMB were tested: 0.0% (control), 0.5%, 1%, 2.5%, 5%, and 5% with 100mL/kg distilled water. Autoclaving after 1h at 121Â°C alone elicited a 9.8% reduction in DON, whereas an 82% reduction was achieved when 5% SMB was added before autoclaving. Experiment 2 tested pelleting high-DON DDGS with SMB. Four batches of DDGS (20.5mg/kg DON) were tested: 0 (control), 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0% SMB. Pelleted samples were collected at conditioning temperatures of 66 and 82Â°C and retention times of 30 and 60s within temperature. Pelleting conditions had no effect on DON levels, but as SMB inclusion increased in pelleted DDGS, DON levels were reduced (quadratic; P<0.001). Experiments 3 and 4 evaluated pelleting and SMB on nursery pig growth. Both trials were arranged in a 2Ã3+1 factorial with 5 replicate pens per treatment. In Exp. 3, 987 pigs (13.0Â±0.2kg) were used with main effects of (1) diet form: meal or pellet and (2) SMB level: Negative Control (NC), NC+0.25% SMB, or NC+0.50% SMB. Negative Control diets were formulated to contain 3mg/kg DON. Treatment 7 was a Positive Control (PC; <0.5mg/kg DON) fed in meal form. Pigs fed high-DON diets had reduced (P<0.001) ADG and ADFI, but pelleting improved (P<0.001) ADG and G:F. Adding SMB increased (linear; P<0.03) ADG and tended to increase (P<0.10) ADFI. In Exp. 4, 1180 pigs (11.1Â±0.32kg) were used with main effects of (1) diet form: meal or pellet and (2) DDGS source: PC (<0.5mg/kg DON), NC (5mg/kg DON), or NC+DDGS pelleted and crumbled before mixing into the final diet. In meal form, treatment 7 included 2.5% SMB prior to pelleting DDGS (final diet contained 0.77% SMB). Overall, a 2-way interaction (P<0.04) was observed within NC diets where pelleting the final diet improved G:F by a greater margin in high-DON diets than when the DDGS was pelleted, crumbled, and re-pelleted. DON reduced (P<0.002) ADG and ADFI, and pelleting the diet improved (P<0.01) ADG and G:F. Including SMB prior to pelleting DON-contaminated DDGS increased (P<0.01) ADG and ADFI. Using SMB combined with thermal processing can mitigate DON effects in diets for nursery pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoclaving 3acorn 3adeoxynivalenol 3adiet 3adistillers grains 3afeed contamination 3aheat 3ahot water treatment 3amixing 3apelleting 3asodium metabisulfite 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3atemperature 0aDeoxynivalenol 0aGrowth 0aPelleting 0aSodium metabisulfite 0aSwine 0aVomitoxin1 aFruge, E.D.1 aTokach, M.D.1 aHansen, E.L.1 aDeRouchey, J.M.1 aDritz, S.S.1 aGoodband, R.D.1 aNelssen, J.L.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2015 Dec., v. 210 p.152-164dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2015.09.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245018400168520101000352592002801362650001801390650001501408650001601423650001701439650002001456650001201476650001701488650000901505650001001514650003101524650001001555650002701565650002201592650003301614650002401647650001601671650001701687650001601704650002101720650000901741650001301750650002501763650001401788653001001802653001701812653001801829653002801847653003201875700005601907700001801963700002701981773011202008856008202120852000902202655001202211IND60681590220221119042100.0200228e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068159022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2020.1037932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarmadi, Bahareh10aMechanism of action of cocoa on bone metabolism in calcium- and estrogen-deficient rat model of osteoporosis: Evidence for site and dose-related responses and involvement of IGF-I  aThe present study evaluated the impact of cocoa on skeleton of ovariectomized rats.

Urinary calcium loss was decreased in C6 but not C12, while serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I increased in both cocoa groups. Improvement in bone quality and strength was observed in femur mid-shaft in C6 but not C12. Bone density, quality and strength of lumbar vertebrae were improved in both cocoa groups. Cocoa improved systemic oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers. In bone tissue of C12, higher levels of HâOâ and lower levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were observed. Cocoa down-regulated osteoblast- and osteoclast-related genes while up-regulated GPx and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Cocoa decreased bone turnover in ovariectomized rats. Its effects depended on the dose applied and the bone site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3abone density 3abone metabolism 3acalcium 3acocoa powder 3adiet 3afemur 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amechanism of action 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoporosis 3aovariectomy 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3askeleton 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avertebrae 0aCocoa 0aBone quality 0aBone strength 0aInflammatory biomarkers 0aPostmenopausal osteoporosis1 aIsmail, Amin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9427-20281 aYusof, Loqman1 aFaridz Mod Yunoh, Mohd0 tJournal of functional foods.g2020 Mar., v. 66 p.103793-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2020.1037933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010200160520135700262592002801619650002201647650001401669650001201683650001601695700002301711700002301734700001801757700002501775700002301800700002101823773012301844856007501967852000902042655001202051IND60791058120221123031337.0220826e20220813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079105812DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141633192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusella, Mario 10aVitamin D Deficiency in Patients with Morbid Obesity before and after Metabolic Bariatric Surgery  aBackground: Metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) is the most effective treatment for severe obesity. Vitamin D deficiency is a common complication encountered both during preoperative workup and follow-up. Aim: To estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients undergoing MBS. Methods: Prospectively maintained database of our university MBS center was searched to assess the rate of preoperative and postoperative vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency in patients undergoing MBS over a one-year period. Results: In total, 184 patients were included, 85 cases of Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG), 99 Gastric Bypass (GB; 91 One Anastomosis and 8 Roux-en-Y). Preoperative vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were respectively found in 61% and 29% of patients, with no significant difference between SG and GB. After six months, 15% of patients had vitamin D deficiency, and 34% had vitamin D insufficiency. There was no significant difference in the rate of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency and the percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) at 1, 3, and 6 postoperative months between SG and GB. Conclusions: Preoperative vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is common in MBS candidates. Regular follow-up with correct supplementation is recommended when undergoing MBS. Early postoperative values of vitamin D were comparable between SG and OAGB.  aPublisher supplied data 3abariatric surgery 3adatabases 3aobesity 3aweight loss1 aBerardi, Giovanna 1 aVitiello, Antonio 1 aDayan, Danit 1 aSchiavone, Vincenzo 1 aFranzese, Antonio 1 aAbu-Abeid, Adam 0 tNutrients.g2022 Aug. 13, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141633193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01885naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245013400166300001400300500001900314520080200333592002801135650001601163650001301179650001401192653002201206653001401228653002401242653002301266700002701289700001601316773013101332856007501463852000901538655001201547IND60698675920221118081456.0200615e20140530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069867592DNAL7 a10.3897/dez.61.75342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartÃ­n-Vega, Daniel14aThe immature stages of the necrophagous fly Liopiophilavaripes and considerations on the genus Liopiophila (Diptera: Piophilidae)  ap. 37-42.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe preimaginal stages of Liopiophilavaripes (Meigen, 1830) (Diptera: Piophilidae), the only species of the genus Liopiophila Duda, are described.

The cationic nature of quats results in a strong ionic interaction and adsorption onto wipes materials that have an anionic surface charge, such as cellulosic materials, including cotton. The degree of adsorption of quats onto cotton nonwovens is affected by pretreatment of the substrate, more specifically whether it is a greige or a scoured and bleached fabric. This study examined the effect of varying the chemical and physical properties of solutions on the adsorption of the quat alkyl-dimethyl-benzyl-ammonium chloride (ADBAC) onto greige and scoured and bleached cotton nonwoven fabrics produced by hydroentanglement. At a constant surfactant concentration, the liquor ratio, pH, temperature, and concentrations of various electrolytes in the solution were varied and the amount of ADBAC depleted from solution was determined over time. The results suggested that a more alkaline solution increased the amount of ADBAC adsorbed onto both cotton nonwoven fabrics, while a more acidic solution reduced ADBAC adsorption. Likewise, increasing the temperature and concentration of salts in the solution reduced the adsorption of ADBAC onto the cotton fabrics. The presence of nonionic surfactants or low molecular weight quats also reduced ADBAC adsorption onto cotton fabrics in a concentration-dependent manner. The results of this study will provide guidance for optimized chemical formulations compatible with disposable disinfecting cotton-based wipes, cloths, and other cotton-containing implements intended for use in cleaning and disinfecting applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acationic surfactants 3acellulosic materials 3acleaning 3acotton 3acotton fabric 3aelectrolytes 3aingredients 3aliquid-solid interface 3amolecular weight 3anonionic surfactants 3anonwoven fabrics 3apH 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asalts 3atemperature 0aadsorption 0acationic surfactant 0agreige cotton 0ahydroentangle 0anonwovens 0aquats1 aCondon, Brian D1 aSlopek, Ryan P1 aReynolds, Michael0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 87, no. 1 p.70-80dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175156221543Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245009000167300001800257520133100275592002801606650001601634650002201650650001101672650001801683650001101701650001701712650001301729650001301742650001701755650001101772650001601783650002101799650003701820700002201857700002101879700001801900700002401918773012601942856008202068852000902150655001202159IND60566902220180615000000.0170414e20160128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056690222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b079932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakeye, Motolani10aDetailed Study of the Nanocasting Process by in Situ X-ray Scattering and Diffraction  ap. 1854-1862.  aThe nanocasting method is a valuable tool for producing metal oxides with a well-defined nanostructure. However, the precise details on how the metal oxide is developed inside the mesoporous silica template remain unclear. In this study, we clarify how nickel nitrate species are evolving to nickel oxide and how they are redistributed inside mesoporous SBA-15 particles as a function of heating temperature and surrounding gas atmosphere by a combination of in situ small-angle X-ray scattering, X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric techniques as well as ex situ transmission electron microscopy and nitrogen physisorption measurements. The SBA-15 template was initially impregnated with Ni(NOâ)âÂ·6HâO using the wet infiltration method. The results indicate an initial redistribution of the nickel nitrate salt located outside the pore system into the mesopores due to dissolution, while at temperatures of 110â150 Â°C (depending on which type of gas flow is used) the mobility of the salt is lost due to drying of the salt. Above 220 Â°C, the nickel nitrate decomposes, possibly via nickel hydroxynitrate, to NiO, forming nanoparticles inside the pore channels. The results shed light on the events occurring during the nanocasting process and can be used for further optimization of the fidelity of replication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3adrying 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3anickel oxide 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aporous media 3asilica 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZiller, Sebastian1 aAmenitsch, Heinz1 aLindÃ©n, Mika1 aSmÃ¥tt, Jan-Henrik,0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Jan. 28, v. 120, no. 3 p.1854-1862dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b079933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002900141245010400170300001400274500001900288520126500307592002801572650001801600650001001618650002301628651001201651651001401663651000901677651002301686651001201709651001601721651001601737653001501753653001701768653001601785653001101801653001301812653002101825653002301846700002801869700002201897773013101919856007502050852000902125655001202134IND60698676020221118080814.0200615e20140530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069867602DNAL7 a10.3897/dez.61.75662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeler-HernÃ¡ndez, Albert12aA review of the genus Oosternum Sharp of the West Indies (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae: Sphaeridiinae)  ap. 43-63.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe representatives of the genus Oosternum Sharp, 1882 occurring in the West Indies are revised. Ten species are recorded, of which seven are here described as new: Oosternumandersonisp. n. (Cuba), Oosternumbacharengesp. n. (Dominican Republic), Oosternumcercyonoidessp. n. (Jamaica), Oosternuminsularesp. n. (Jamaica), Oosternumluciaesp. n. (Saint Lucia), Oosternummegnaisp. n. (Cuba) and Oosternumpeckisp. n. (Dominican Republic). Diagnoses and detailed distributional data are also provided for Oosternumsharpi Hansen, 1999 (widespread throughout both Greater and Lesser Antilles), Oosternumlatum FikÃ¡Äek, Hebauer & Hansen, 2009 (endemic to St. Vincent) and an undescribed species from the Bahamas. A key to the West Indian Oosternum is provided and important diagnostic characters are illustrated. The West Indian fauna of Oosternum contains representatives of five different species groups and likely originated by multiple independent colonizations from the American continent. Within the study region, the highest diversity is known from the Greater Antilles, where two endemic species each in Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola. The populations of Oosternumsharpi were found to consist exclusively of females on all islands with the exception Puerto Rico.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHydrophilidae 3afauna 3aindigenous species 3aBahamas 3aCaribbean 3aCuba 3aDominican Republic 3aJamaica 3aPuerto Rico 3aSaint Lucia 0aColeoptera 0aMegasternini 0anew species 0aisland 0aendemics 0aCaribbean Region 0aNeotropical Region1 aCala-Riquelme, Franklyn1 aFikÃ¡Äek, Martin0 tDeutsche entomologische Zeitschrift.g2014 May 30, v. 61, no. 1 p.43-63dPensoft PublisherswJournal:jnl57628x1860-13247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/dez.61.75663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245011100162506025800273520132400531592002801855650002501883650002801908650001601936650001501952650002001967650002501987650002702012651001402039653002302053653001402076700002202090773012402112856007602236852000902312655001202321IND60478794120221119060450.0160114e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047879412DNAL7 a10.4081/jae.2015.4502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreti, Federico10aShallow Landslide Susceptibility Assessment in a Data-Poor Region of Guatemala (Comitancillo Municipality)  aThis article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License (by-nc 3.0) which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.  aAlthough landslides are frequent natural phenomena in mountainous regions, the lack of data in emerging countries is a significant issue in the assessment of shallow landslide susceptibility. A key factor in risk-mitigation strategies is the evaluation of deterministic physical models for hazard assessment in these data-poor regions. Given the lack of physical information, input parameters to these data-intensive deterministic models have to be estimated, which has a negative impact on the reliability of the assessment. To address this problem, we examined shallow landslide hazard in Comitancillo municipality, Guatemala. Shallow landslides are here defined as small (less than two or three metre-deep) rotational or translational slides or earth flows. We based our hazard simulation on the stability index mapping model. The modelâs input parameters were estimated from a statistical analysis of factors affecting landslides in the municipality obtained from a geodatabase. The outputs from the model were analysed and compared to an inventory of small-scale landslides. The results of the comparison show the effectiveness of the method developed to estimate input parameters for a deterministic model, in regions where physical data related to the assessment of shallow landslide susceptibility is lacking.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3ahazard characterization 3ainventories 3alandslides 3aphysical models 3astatistical analysis 3atranslation (genetics) 3aGuatemala 0aShallow landslides 0aGuatemala1 aLetterio, Tommaso0 tJournal of agricultural engineering.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 46, no. 3dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx2239-62687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jae.2015.4503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245013200163300001600295500002000311520171100331592002802042650001402070650001002084650002002094650002402114650001002138650002002148650002502168650001702193650001502210650001502225650001802240700002502258700002202283700002302305773008702328856007302415852000902488655001202497IND60580104720221120101534.0170909e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058010472DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.125142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzymaÅski, PaweÅ,14aThe song of Skylarks Alauda arvensis indicates the deterioration of an acoustic environment resulting from wind farm startâup  ap. 769-777.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe rapid development of wind energy may have negative effects on bird populations, including collisions with turbines, displacement due to disturbance or habitat loss, indirect effects of reduced breeding success and barrier effects. This challenging conservation issue has attracted a great deal of interest, but the noise generated by turbines has been largely overlooked. Here, we studied acoustic behaviour of Skylarks Alauda arvensis in relation to wind farm startâup to assess whether a change in song parameters can indicate a deterioration in the acoustic environment. We recorded territorial males displaying close to operating and nonâoperating turbines and at a control site without turbines. In the following breeding season, we undertook replications at the same sites, except that the nonâoperating turbines were now in operation. We found that Skylarks displaying at the wind farm were affected by wind turbine noise. Males singing close to operating wind turbines sang higherâfrequency songs than males from a control site and those that displayed near nonâoperating turbines. In addition, an upward frequency shift in songs was observed when nonâoperating turbines started to operate in the consecutive season. We therefore conclude that the frequency shift observed did not result from turbine presence, but from the noise they started to generate. This shows that a change in song parameters may reliably and within a relatively short time indicate a significant deterioration of the acoustic environment as a consequence of wind farm startâup. This may help conservation biologists to identify species and populations that are particularly susceptible to wind farm noise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3abirds 3abreeding season 3ahabitat destruction 3amales 3anoise pollution 3areproductive success 3avocalization 3awind farms 3awind power 3awind turbines1 aDeoniziak, Krzysztof1 aÅosak, Katarzyna1 aOsiejuk, Tomasz S.0 tIbis.g2017 Oct., v. 159, no. 4 p.769-777dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.125143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010600177500001900283520136700302592002801669650001001697650001101707650001901718650001701737650001201754650002501766650001101791650001901802650001101821653002001832653001901852653002201871653001701893653002601910773010301936856008702039852000902126655001202135IND60736749020221116172251.0210610e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073674902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.1070812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkushima, Shinichiro10aEnergy poor need more energy, but do they need more carbon? Evaluation of people's basic carbon needs  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the era of low-carbon energy transitions, both climate and energy justice studies have raised concerns about the deterioration of energy poverty triggered by carbon mitigation policies. Nevertheless, no in-depth analysis has thus far examined the relationship between people suffering energy poverty and their carbon dioxide emissions. This study addresses the issue by presenting a novel approach to measuring people's basic carbon needs (BCN), which are defined as the amount of carbon emissions needed to achieve (socially and materially) adequate levels of domestic energy services. The results, using Japan as a case study, reveal the differences in people's BCN based on climatic, socio-demographic, and dwelling factors, showing that people in energy poverty need greater carbon emissions to fulfil their basic energy needs than the affluent population. In upcoming low-carbon energy transitions, people's BCN must be reduced while satisfying their basic energy needs. However, this study shows that the carbon intensity of domestic energy services for energy poverty households is high, leading carbon mitigation policies such as carbon pricing to adversely affect them without suitable countermeasures. Hence, ensuring access to low-carbon energy for all, including the energy poor, is essential to engender an inclusive low-carbon energy transition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aecological economics 3aenergy 3aenergy poverty 3apeople 0aClimate justice 0aEnergy justice 0aEnergy transition 0aFuel poverty 0aSubsistence emissions0 tEcological economics.g2021 Sept., v. 187 p.107081-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.1070813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002100187245014800208300001800356506007600374520166500450592002802115506003702143650003702180650001102217650001302228650002202241650002802263650002102291650001102312650000902323650001102332650001402343650001102357650002302368650002402391650001402415650001602429700002402445700002402469700002202493700001702515700002302532700002302555700002602578700002302604700001902627773012602646856008202772852000902854655001202863IND60566902320221207103101.0170414e20160128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056690232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b085962doi7 aPMC47358092pmcid7 a268778272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNenning, Andreas10aAmbient Pressure XPS Study of Mixed Conducting Perovskite-Type SOFC Cathode and Anode Materials under Well-Defined Electrochemical Polarization  ap. 1461-1471.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe oxygen exchange activity of mixed conducting oxide surfaces has been widely investigated, but a detailed understanding of the corresponding reaction mechanisms and the rate-limiting steps is largely still missing. Combined in situ investigation of electrochemically polarized model electrode surfaces under realistic temperature and pressure conditions by near-ambient pressure (NAP) XPS and impedance spectroscopy enables very surface-sensitive chemical analysis and may detect species that are involved in the rate-limiting step. In the present study, acceptor-doped perovskite-type Laâ.âSrâ.âCoOââÎ´ (LSC), Laâ.âSrâ.âFeOââÎ´ (LSF), and SrTiâ.âFeâ.âOââÎ´ (STF) thin film model electrodes were investigated under well-defined electrochemical polarization as cathodes in oxidizing (Oâ) and as anodes in reducing (Hâ/HâO) atmospheres. In oxidizing atmosphere all materials exhibit additional surface species of strontium and oxygen. The polaron-type electronic conduction mechanism of LSF and STF and the metal-like mechanism of LSC are reflected by distinct differences in the valence band spectra. Switching between oxidizing and reducing atmosphere as well as electrochemical polarization cause reversible shifts in the measured binding energy. This can be correlated to a Fermi level shift due to variations in the chemical potential of oxygen. Changes of oxidation states were detected on Fe, which appears as Feá´µá´µá´µ in oxidizing atmosphere and as mixed Feá´µá´µ/á´µá´µá´µ in Hâ/HâO. Cathodic polarization in reducing atmosphere leads to the reversible formation of a catalytically active Feâ° phase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanodes 3acathodes 3achemical analysis 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3airon 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphysical chemistry 3areaction mechanisms 3astrontium 3atemperature1 aOpitz, Alexander K.1 aRameshan, Christoph1 aRameshan, Raffael1 aBlume, Raoul1 aHÃ¤vecker, Michael1 aKnop-Gericke, Axel1 aRupprechter, GÃ¼nther1 aKlÃ¶tzer, Bernhard1 aFleig, JÃ¼rgen0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Jan. 28, v. 120, no. 3 p.1461-1471dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b085963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245007900163506025800242520081000500592002801310650002601338650001101364650001201375650001101387650001701398650001401415651001001429653002601439653002901465653002001494700002201514773012401536856007601660852000901736655001201745IND60478794220221119060455.0160114e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047879422DNAL7 a10.4081/jae.2015.4582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPascuzzi, Simone13aAn Innovative Pneumatic Electrostatic Sprayer Useful for Tendone Vineyards  aThis article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License (by-nc 3.0) which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.  aThe aim of this note is to analyse the features of the ESS 150 RB14 electrostatic sprayer, an innovative model compared to the standard air-assisted sprayers traditionally used by Apulian growers (Southern Italy) in tendone vineyards. The experimental tests showed that the activation of the electrostatic system produced a significant increase in the mean deposit, but it was located only on the foliar layer of the canopy closer to the sprayer. However this result should also imply an increase in the deposits on the bunches when the electrostatic system is activated, even if further tests are necessary to verify this expectation.

Two hundred eighty Nellore bulls were blocked by initial body weight (BWÂ =Â 349Â Â±Â 33Â kg), assigned to 40 feedlot pens and pens within weight block were randomly assigned to treatments: five levels of inclusion of WC [0%, (WC0); 8%, (WC8); 16%, (WC16); 24% (WC24); and 32% (WC32); dry matter (DM) basis] in diets containing 13% (DM basis) of sugarcane bagasse. One additional treatment was formulated to contain similar concentration of lipid as diet WC32 but with no WC, rather using soybean oil (SO). When averaged across the total feeding period, increasing dietary level of WC affected DM intake (DMI), final body weight, average daily gain (ADG), and feed efficiency (G:F; quadratic; PÂ â¤Â 0.01). Compared to WC0, diet SO decreased DMI (PÂ <Â 0.001), tended to reduce ADG, and final BW (PÂ â¤Â 0.09) but no differences in G:F were observed between this two treatments (PÂ =Â 0.38). Compared to WC32, bulls fed SO had greater DMI, ADG, final BW, and G:F (PÂ â¤Â 0.02). Increasing dietary level of WC affected hot carcass weight (HCW), dressing percentage, and longissimus muscle area (quadratic; PÂ â¤Â 0.05). Bulls fed SO had greater HCW, dressing percentage, 12th-rib fat (PÂ â¤Â 0.001), and a tendency for greater longissimus muscle area (PÂ =Â 0.09) compared with WC32. Increasing levels of WC did not affect meat composition (PÂ â¥Â 0.12). No differences in meat composition were observed between bulls fed SO and WC0 (PÂ â¥Â 0.24) or bulls fed SO and WC32 (PÂ â¥Â 0.31). Trained panelists detected changes in tenderness (linear; PÂ =Â 0.05) due the increasing levels of WC in the diets. Compared to WC0 (PÂ =Â 0.06) and to WC32 (PÂ â¤Â 0.05) bulls fed SO have greater tenderness and overall acceptability. Increasing levels of whole cottonseed in high-concentrate diets reduced the DMI of finishing bulls. Levels of WC greater than 15% of diet DM decreased feed efficiency. Including up to 32% of WC in finishing diets had no effects on meat quality or acceptability. No positive effects of increasing dietary fat content from 3.2 to 7.8% with SO were observed on growth performance and overall meat characteristics of finishing bulls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNellore 3aaverage daily gain 3abeef cattle 3abody weight 3acarcass weight 3acottonseed 3adietary fat 3afeed conversion 3afeedlots 3agrowth performance 3alipid content 3alipids 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat 3ameat composition 3ameat quality 3asoybean oil 3asugarcane bagasse 0aFeedlot 0aBy-products 0aFat 0aMeat flavor 0aHigh-concentrate diets1 aBiehl, Marcos Vinicius1 aAndrade, Tiago SÃ©rgio1 aFerraz Junior, Marcos Vinicius de Castro1 aFerreira, Evandro Maia1 aPolizel, Daniel Montanher1 aAntonelo, Daniel Silva1 aBridi, Ana Maria1 aOwens, Frederic N.1 aPires, Alexandre Vaz0 tLivestock science.g2020 Feb., v. 232 p.103934-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1039343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245009300168300001400261520128800275592002801563650001101591650001601602650001101618650001101629650001001640650002001650650001701670650002501687650001401712650001401726650001401740650000901754650001401763650001201777650001601789650001201805651001001817653004001827653001001867653003101877653002501908653001901933700001501952700001801967700001801985700002002003773011602023856008802139852000902227655001202236IND60525446820221123032207.0190318e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052544682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2016.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWako, D.D.10aIndigenous knowledge of pastoralists on respiratory diseases of camels in northern Kenya  ap. 60-66.  aThe camel disease terminology of pastoralists in northern Kenya differentiates between two respiratory disease complexes of camels. Participatory epidemiology data were collected in 2011 in three camel keeping communities (Gabra, Garri, and Somali) and analysed to assess the validity of this differentiation. Further queries assessed recurrence of the disease in the same animal, most affected age group, relative frequency of occurrence, morbidity rates, mortality rates and response to antibiotic treatment. Based on matrix scoring the cardinal symptom nasal discharge was significantly correlated with Respiratory Disease Complex 1 (RDC1; Somali Hergeb, Gabra & Garri Furri) while cough was correlated with Respiratory Disease Complex 2 (RDC2; Somali Dhuguta, Gabra Qufa, Garri Dhugud). RDC1 appears to occur regularly every year and does not respond to antibiotic treatments while outbreaks of RDC2 are only observed at intervals of several years and treated cases do generally respond to antibiotics. While RDC1 is more severe in calves, RDC 2 is mostly associated with respiratory disease in adults. Elements of this differentiation appear to be in agreement with other authors who differentiate between camel influenza (PI3 virus) and bacterial camel pneumonia, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aantibiotics 3acalves 3acamels 3acough 3adata collection 3aepidemiology 3aindigenous knowledge 3ainfluenza 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anose 3apneumonia 3arelapse 3aterminology 3aviruses 3aKenya 0aRespiratory Disease Complex 1 and 2 0aCamel 0aParticipatory epidemiology 0aIndigenous knowledge 0aNorthern Kenya1 aYounan, M.1 aTessema, T.S.1 aGlÃ¼cks, I.V.1 aBaumann, M.P.O.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 130 p.60-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2016.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009700168300001500265520117900280592002801459650002601487650002601513650002101539650002601560650001601586650001301602650002001615650002101635650001001656650001101666650001801677650000901695650001601704650002401720650001301744700001801757700001601775700002201791700006501813773011001878856008101988852000902069655001202078IND60604143020221123014820.0180716e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060414302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2015.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScully, Ingrid L10aAnti-infective vaccination in the 21st centuryânew horizons for personal and public health  ap. 96-102.  aThe 21st century has seen the licensure of new anti-infective vaccines that have demonstrated their benefit for both individual and population (herd) protection. Despite this there are still many human pathogens for which no vaccine is available. As we learn more about these pathogens, and as technologies advance, more opportunities for vaccine development have become available. This review will address these advances and highlight the paradigm shift from vaccines that are used on a population basis, to others which will have an individual benefit, if successfully licensed, but are not expected to have widespread population based use. The development of the latter vaccines has resulted in a paradigm shift toward vaccinating individuals at specific risk for infection from bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium difficile, which are members of normal human flora but can cause severe disease under certain circumstances. Increasing levels of antibiotic resistance in such bacteria such as S. aureus have also driven the urgency for the identification of alternative methods of protection that do not rely on treatment or prophylaxis with antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium difficile 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanimal pathogens 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3adisease control 3adisease severity 3aflora 3ahumans 3apublic health 3arisk 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3avaccines1 aSwanson, Kena1 aGreen, Luke1 aJansen, Kathrin U1 aAnderson, Annaliesa S1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6413-17180 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2015 Oct., v. 27 p.96-102dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2015.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157100001700175245013800192300001800330520184600348592002802194650001202222650002002234650000902254650001002263650000902273650002002282650001502302650001402317650002902331650000902360650001202369650001102381650003102392650002202423650008702445650004102532650001102573650001402584650000902598650002202607650001402629650001702643650002002660700001602680700001802696700001802714700001802732773009102750856009202841852000902933655001202942IND4478117320221120205510.0141111e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447811732DNAL7 a221923912pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.10.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheong, S.H.10aEffects of diagnostic low-volume uterine lavage shortly before first service on reproductive performance, culling and milk production  ap. 1217-1222.  aThe objective was to evaluate if uterine sampling by low-volume uterine lavage, done shortly before the end of the voluntary waiting period, affected reproductive performance, milk production, or culling. Approximately 20 cows (40 and 60 d postpartum) were sampled in each of 38 herds (total, 752 cows), whereas all remaining cows concurrently between 40 and 60 d were a non-sampled reference cohort (n = 2,252 cows). There was an interaction between parity and sampling for first-service conception, calving to conception interval, and milk production. When stratified by parity, there was a tendency for impaired reproductive performance in sampled primiparous cows compared with non-sampled primiparous cows (Odds Ratio for pregnancy to first-service = 0.78 (95% C.I. 0.58â1.04). The Hazard Ratio for pregnancy in sampled primiparous cows was 0.89 (95% C.I. 0.77â1.04) compared to non-sampled primiparous cows. Sampling did not affect first-service conception rate (Odds Ratio for pregnancy Odds ratio (OR) for pregnancy = 1.03; 95% C.I. 0.80â1.33) or calving-to conception interval in multiparous cows (Hazard Ratio = 1.04; 95% C.I. 0.91â1.18). Sampling did not affect culling risk (Hazard Ratio HR = 0.92; 95% C.I. 0.77â1.11) after accounting for covariates. After stratification by parity, milk production was not affected by sampling except in fourth- and fifth-parity cows where sampled cows produced more milk than non-sampled cows after controlling for first test-day milk production and days-postpartum at first test-day. In conclusion, sampling by low-volume uterine lavage did not have significant detrimental effects on reproduction, culling, or milk production. However, there was a tendency for lower first-service conception in sampled primiparous cows, but the procedure appeared to be benign in multiparous cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalving 3aconception rate 3acows 3aherds 3amilk 3amilk production 3aodds ratio 3apregnancy 3areproductive performance 3arisk 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosis 2aDairyingxmethods 2aDiagnostic Techniques, Obstetrical and Gynecologicalxadverse effectsxveterinary. 2aEndometritisxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aMilk 2aPostpartum Period 2aPregnancy 2aReproduction 2aRisk Assessment1 aNydam, D.V.1 aGalvÃ£o, K.N.1 aCrosier, B.M.1 aGilbert, R.O.0 tTheriogenology.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 77, no. 6 p.1217-1222dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.10.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245010100163520141100264592002801675650000801703650001601711650001101727650002701738650002201765650001801787650002301805650002201828650002301850651001101873653002801884653003201912653001901944653001301963653001501976700003201991700002002023700002202043773010802065856007702173852000902250655001202259IND60699905620221120182949.0200623s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069990562DNAL7 a10.1093/femsec/fiw1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Laura10aCyanobacterial diversity of western European biological soil crusts along a latitudinal gradient  aCyanobacteria associated with biological soil crusts (BSCs) have important attributes, such as nitrogen fixation and soil stabilisation. However, research on these organisms has been minimal, and their diversity and distribution throughout temperate Europe is currently unknown. The SCIN (Soil Crust International) project is a multidisciplinary research initiative that aims to achieve improved understanding of the BSCs of Europe, one facet being an investigation into the cyanobacterial communities of BSCs across a latitudinal gradient. Cyanobacteria assemblages were analysed by both morphological and molecular analysis. Two treatments were applied prior to DNA extraction, continued sample wetting and a dry sample process, and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicons were processed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The results reveal high and variable cyanobacterial diversity with each site showing a unique assemblage. Many common cyanobacterial genera, for example Nostoc and Microcoleus, were found in all sites but the abundances of different genera varied considerably. The polyphasic approach was found to be essential in recording the presence of important cyanobacteria that a single method itself did not highlight. The wet and dry treatments showed some differences in diversity, but mainly in abundance, this may suggest how cyanobacterial composition of BSCs changes with seasonal variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMicrocoleus 3aNostoc 3abiological soil crusts 3anitrogen fixation 3aribosomal RNA 3aseasonal variation 3asequence analysis 3asoil stabilization 3aEurope 0acyanobacteria diversity 0abiological soil crust (BSC) 0aIllumina MiSeq 0a16S rRNA 0amorphology1 aLoewen-Schneider, Katharina1 aMaier, Stefanie1 aBÃ¼del, Burkhard,0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2016, v. 92, no. 10dOxford University PresswJournal:1989x1574-69417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiw1573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245015300165300002000318520127500338592002801613650001101641650001101652650001401663650001301677650001701690650002201707650002001729650000901749653002701758653002801785653002301813653002801836653002201864653002601886700001901912700001901931700002501950700005701975773014102032856007802173852000902251655001202260IND60596133820221117063402.0180615e20180509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059613382DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b041082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammad, Irshad10aSynthesis of Fast Fluoride-Ion-Conductive Fluorite-Type Ba1âxSbxF2+x (0.1 â¤ x â¤ 0.4): A Potential Solid Electrolyte for Fluoride-Ion Batteries  ap. 17249-17256.  aToward the development of high-performance solid electrolytes for fluoride-ion batteries, fluorite-type nanostructured solid solutions of BaâââSbâFâââ (x â¤ 0.4) were synthesized by high-energy ball-milling method. Substitution of divalent BaÂ²âº by trivalent SbÂ³âº leads to an increase in interstitial fluoride-ion concentration, which enhances the ionic conductivity of the BaâââSbâFâââ (0.1 â¤ x â¤ 0.4) system.

Integrated evaluations of ARs are necessary to comprehend the condition and benefits of these structures. Multimetric indices (ARMIs) were developed to evaluate fish assemblages associated with artificial structures and to assess the efficiency of the AR compared to control area (CA). The AR global ranking index (ARMIáµ£) and AR local effect index (ARMIâ) include 16 metrics that represent four broad levels of the fish community: structure of fish assemblages, trophic structure, vulnerability and economic importance. Individual metrics were evaluated using a long-term dataset of fish assemblages from the AR and CA in northern Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Bottom gillnets were used to sample the fish two times per year for 21 years after creating the reef. The ARMIáµ£ general score for the AR was 51 out of a possible 100, with scores varying from 38 to 54. The ARMIáµ£ general score for the CA was 39 out of 100, with scores varying from 35 to 47. Average ARMIâ values were 12% higher for the AR in relation to the CA. Spatial-temporal comparisons of the ARMIáµ£ using generalized additive models revealed significant differences between AR and CA. Evaluations of the ARMIâ scores revealed that the assemblage structure and economic importance level significantly increased over time in the AR. The proposed indices combine structural and functional levels of fish, providing a robust and sensitive method to evaluate the ecological condition of ARs and adjacent areas. The data contribute to discussions related to ARs management and provides a baseline for defining fish assemblage metrics in assessment of localities with artificial structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial reefs 3acoastal zone management 3adata collection 3afish 3afish communities 3afisheries 3agillnets 3amodels 3atraditional technology 3aBrazil 0aArtificial structures 0aFish assemblage 0aIntegrated management 0aCoastal management 0aBiological indicators1 aAtalah, Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0625-34311 aSanchez-Jerez, Pablo1 aZalmon, Ilana Rosental0 tOcean & coastal management.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 198 p.105350-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1053503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011600162300001600278520183600294592002802130650001502158650001402173650001502187650001202202650001302214650001502227650002302242650001102265650001202276650001602288650002302304700002102327773011102348856007302459852000902532655001202541IND60125999020221119214215.0150428e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012599902DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.124982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtkinson, Carla L.10aBiogeochemical hotspots: temporal and spatial scaling of the impact of freshwater mussels on ecosystem function  ap. 563-574.  aIn streams, the creation of nutrientâtransformation hotspots by aggregated organisms may have heterogeneous and strong cumulative influences on stream nutrient dynamics. Here, we examine the potential for aggregations of freshwater mussels to create such hotspots. We measured nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) excretion rates of six mussel species and body tissue composition of eight. We combined these data with population densities of surveyed mussel beds in the Kiamichi River, OK, to estimate reachâscale and streamâscale nutrient recycling and storage. Additionally, we estimated the temporal variability in the magnitude of mussel nutrient recycling combining volumetric excretion at a reach scale with discharge and temperature data. Mussel beds constituted 1.45% of the area of the Kiamichi River. Mussel nutrient remineralisation varied greatly across beds (11.1â699.5Â Î¼molÂ NÂ mâ»Â²Â hâ»Â¹and 0.8â53.0Â Î¼molÂ PÂ mâ»Â²Â hâ»Â¹), because of varying mussel densities. The communityâwide average excretion N:P (molar) of the mussel communities was 29.57, with higher excretion N:P significantly associated with higher abundances of Actinonaias ligamentina. Total nutrient storage per bed varied two orders of magnitude (6.3â631.7Â kg N and 2.3â227.5Â kg P) between mussel beds. Moreover, areal nutrient storage varied among the beds (11.2â133.7Â mgÂ NÂ mâ»Â², 4.1â48.9Â mgÂ PÂ mâ»Â²) with the majority of nutrient storage in a longâterm store, shell (c. 87% of total N storage, c. 95% of total P storage). Freshwater mussels can be important to nutrient dynamics through nutrient regeneration and the creation of storage hotspots. However, the importance of nutrient remineralisation varies dramatically in response to organism patchiness, flow conditions and background nutrient concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aexcretion 3afreshwater 3amussels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apopulation density 3arivers 3astreams 3atemperature 3atemporal variation1 aVaughn, Caryn C.0 tFreshwater biology.g2015 Mar., v. 60, no. 3 p.563-574dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.124983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245012500198300002000323520125500343592002801598650001501626650001401641650002301655650001301678650001701691650001601708650001301724650001701737700001301754700005501767700005301822700002501875700005401900700005601954700005502010700005702065700005902122700001302181773014902194856007602343852000902419655001202428IND60744745220221117010943.0210716e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074474522DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c053542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Zhihua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7413-180X10aAdsorption-Induced Active Vanadium Species Facilitate Excellent Performance in Low-Temperature Catalytic NOâ Abatement  ap. 10454-10461.  aVanadia-based catalysts have been widely used for catalyzing various reactions, including their long-standing application in the deNOâ process. It has been commonly considered that various vanadium species dispersed on supports with a large surface area act as the catalytically active sites. However, the role of crystalline VâOâ in selective catalytic reduction of NOâ with NHâ (NHâ-SCR) remains unclear. In this study, a catalyst with low vanadia loading was synthesized, in which crystalline VâOâ was deposited on a TiOâ support that had been pretreated at a high temperature. Surprisingly, the catalyst, which had a large amount of crystalline VâOâ, showed excellent low-temperature NHâ-SCR activity. For the first time, crystalline VâOâ on low-vanadium-loading catalysts was found to be transformed to polymeric vanadyl species by the adsorption of NHâ. The generated active polymeric vanadyl species played a crucial role in NHâ-SCR, leading to remarkably enhanced catalytic performance at low temperatures. This new finding provides a fundamental understanding of the metal oxide-catalyzed chemical reaction and has important implications for the development and commercial applications of NHâ-SCR catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3apolymers 3asurface area 3atemperature 3avanadium 3avanadyl ions1 aWei, Jie1 aShan, Wenpo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2818-57081 aYu, Yunbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2935-09551 aRadjenovic, Petar M.1 aZhang, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9588-90301 aHe, Guangzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1770-35221 aLiu, Fudong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-59381 aLi, Jian-Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1598-68561 aTian, Zhong-Qun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9775-81891 aHe, Hong0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 July 01, v. 143, no. 27 p.10454-10461dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c053543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245009800205300001600303520152500319592002801844596005601872650001701928650001901945650002201964650001901986650001202005650001502017650001402032650001402046650002202060650001502082650002202097650001702119651002502136700002202161700002902183773011402212856008302326852000902409655001202418IND60718356620221120025323.0211202e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071835662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-020-04739-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShihan, Ammar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8140-356210aNeighbor identity affects growth and survival of Mediterranean plants under recurrent drought  ap. 555-569.  aThe increasing intensity and frequency of droughts predicted for the Mediterranean basin with ongoing climate change will impact plant communities and ecosystem functioning. This study investigated the effect of severe recurrent droughts and the role of the neighbor plant identity on the growth and survival of three abundant and co-existing species of a typical Mediterranean shrubland. Two juvenile plants, either of the same species or in all possible combinations of the two woody species Quercus coccifera and Cistus albidus and the perennial grass species BrachypodiumÂ retusum were grown together in rhizotrons under controlled watering regimes for two years. Compared to a treatment with only one drought cycle, three successive droughts reduced the relative growth rates (RGR) of shoots and roots in B. retusum, but not in woody species, and increased the mortality of the woody species, but not that of the grass. The survival of C. albidus and of B.Â retusum, but not of Q. coccifera, increased when the neighbor individual was a different species than when it was the same species. Our data suggest that both species composition and frequency of drought events will impact the dynamics of plant communities in Mediterranean shrublands under ongoing climate change. The abundance of dehydration sensitive woody species will likely decrease under more frequent drought events at the expense of dehydration-tolerant grass species, resulting in potentially strong changes in the functioning of these ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-10-LABX-04-01cAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3aBrachypodium 3aCistus albidus 3aQuercus coccifera 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aecosystems 3ajuveniles 3amortality 3aperennial grasses 3ashrublands 3aspecies diversity 3awoody plants 3aMediterranean region1 aVolaire, Florence1 aHÃ¤ttenschwiler, Stephan0 tOecologia.g2020 Dec., v. 194, no. 4 p.555-569dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04739-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245005200170300001400222520111900236592002801355650001501383650001601398650002501414650002201439650001001461650002001471650001701491650001601508650000901524650001901533650001901552650001701571650001401588650002301602650002501625650002601650653002401676653000901700653002401709653001501733653002001748653001701768700001701785700002301802700002401825700002201849700002101871700002201892700001801914773009001932856008102022852000902103655001202112IND60544739920221118062727.0160901e20141203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054473992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2014.08.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Sanjukta A.12aA visual strip sensor for determination of iron  ap. 87-94.  aA visual strip has been developed for sensing iron in different aqueous samples like natural water and fruit juices. The sensor has been synthesized by UV-radiation induced graft polymerization of acrylamide monomer in microporous poly(propylene) base. For physical immobilization of iron selective reagent, the in situ polymerization of acrylamide has been carried out in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline. The loaded strip on interaction with Fe(II) in aqueous solution turned into orange red color and the intensity of the color was found to be directly proportional to the amount of Fe(II) in the aqueous sample. The minimal sensor response with naked eye was found for 50ngmLâ1 of Fe in 15min of interaction. However, as low as 20ngmLâ1 Fe could be quantified using a spectrophotometer. The detection limit calculated using the 3s/S criteria, where âsâ is the standard deviation of the absorbance of blank reagent loaded strip and âSâ is the slope of the linear calibration plot, was 1.0ngmLâ1. The strip was applied to measure Fe in a variety of samples such as ground water and fruit juices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aacrylamides 3aanalytical chemistry 3aaqueous solutions 3acolor 3adetection limit 3afruit juices 3agroundwater 3airon 3apolymerization 3apolypropylenes 3aporous media 3apropylene 3aspectrophotometers 3astatistical analysis 3aultraviolet radiation 0aVisual strip sensor 0aIron 0a1,10-Phenanthroline 0aAcrylamide 0aPoly(propylene) 0aGround water1 aThakur, Neha1 aParab, Harshala J.1 aPandey, Shailaja P.1 aShinde, Rakesh N.1 aPandey, Ashok K.1 aKumar, Sangita D.1 aReddy, A.V.R.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 Dec. 03, v. 851 p.87-94dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.08.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245014600212520141500358592002801773650002001801650001601821650002501837650001801862650001501880650002801895650002001923650002401943650000901967650001401976650002501990650001302015650001202028650001302040650001102053650001102064651002102075653002502096653002202121653001802143653002102161653002902182700001702211700005802228773011002286856008802396852000902484655001202493IND60709506420221120192256.0210904e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070950642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1053532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYÄ±ldÄ±z, Taner1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3140-511812aA comparison of market landings during fish spawning seasons to better understand the effectiveness of the temporal fishery closure in Turkey  aSeasonal fishery closures, are an input control measure to reduce fishing pressure on spawning stocks in fisheries management. Despite the huge foregone economic losses from such closures, the efficacy of them has yet to be examined in Turkey. This study compares the monthly landed catch distribution for commercial marine species averaged for 12 years (2006â2017) from Istanbul fish market, to catch rates of those species during the spawning seasons. Our results revealed that at first glance, most commercially important fish species examined here have their spawning seasons protected under the Turkish industrial seasonal closure period, especially for small and medium pelagics, as well as some demersals. On the other hand, taxa with winter spawning seasons such as Merlangius merlangus, John dory Zeus faber, brown meagre Sciaena umbra, big-scale sand smelt Atherina boyeri, and bogue Boops boops do not benefit from the commercial fisheries summer closure (>50% of their catch total). Also, some species are still heavily fished (>35% of their catch total) during the closure implying they are mainly targeted by small-scale fisheries (SSF). To help rebuild the commercial fisheries, we recommend the accompaniment of the industrial closure with the use of âReal Time Closuresâ (RTCs) applied to all fishing sectors for species highly fished during their spawning periods and spawning habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtherina boyeri 3aBoops boops 3aMerlangius merlangus 3aSciaena umbra 3aZeus faber 3acoastal zone management 3acontrol methods 3afinancial economics 3afish 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3ahabitats 3amarkets 3aspawning 3asummer 3awinter 3aTurkey (country) 0aFish market landings 0aSeasonal closures 0aMarine fishes 0aFisheries policy 0aReal time closures (RTC)1 aUlman, Aylin1 aDemirel, Nazli1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4542-92760 tOcean & coastal management.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 198 p.105353-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1053533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01810naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005500166300001400221520078000235592002801015650003001043650001301073650001701086650001501103650001701118650001001135650002601145650001101171650001801182650002001200650001101220700001801231773010901249856008101358852000901439655001201448IND60604143420221121040205.0180716e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060414342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2015.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavÃ¬, Valeria10aMechanics and morphogenesis of fission yeast cells  ap. 36-45.  aThe integration of biochemical and biomechanical elements is at the heart of morphogenesis.

How these particular mechanical properties may influence basic cellular processes, such as growth, shape and division remains poorly understood. Recent work using the model fungal cell fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, highlights important contribution of cell mechanics to various morphogenesis processes.

Plasma hormone levels are assessed on blood samples collected weekly at 9:00 a.m., during one year. The ovarian activity is characterized by an anestrous period from mid-March to mid-July and a breeding period during the rest of the year. Adrenal histomorphometry and immunolocalization of Estrogen Receptors Î± (ERÎ±) and Progesterone Receptors (PR) were performed on adrenal glands collected during each season. During the anestrous period, all adrenal compartments appeared enlarged, as did cellular and nuclear areas. ERÎ± and PR immunostaining were identified in all the adrenal gland zonae with more intensity for the ERÎ±. ERÎ± immunostaining is greater in zona fasciculata whereas PR immunostaining is more intense in zona fasciculata and zona reticularis during the breeding season. Plasma ACTH shows no difference between the two seasons, while cortisol rises slightly during the anestrous period. There is a negative but not significant correlation between progesterone levels with plasma ACTH and cortisol. The pituitary-adrenal axis is activated essentially at the anestrous onset and at the ovarian resumption which represents stressful events, but it varies slightly between these two seasons in this goat.  aPublisher supplied data  aResearch Project number: F 002 2012 0047 3aadrenal cortex 3abiological rhythms 3acortisol 3adry environmental conditions 3aestrogens 3anannygoats 3aprogesterone 3aresearch 0aSeasonal anestrous 0apituitary adrenal axis 0aadrenal sex steroid receptors 0aovarian steroids 0asaharan goat1 aKhaldoun-Benabbas, Mounira1 aCharallah-Cherif, Salima1 aKassouri, Sara1 aKhammar, Farida1 aAmirat, Zaina0 tBiological rhythm research.g2021 Oct. 21, v. 52, no. 9 p.1394-1411dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12260x1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2019.16309203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01814naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245010400160300001800264520081600282592002801098650002101126650000901147650001301156650002001169650001901189650001301208650001801221650001301239650001501252650001001267650000901277773009801286856007101384852000901455655001201464IND60518530820221120122437.0160418e197011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051853082DNAL7 a10.2307/19336392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadgwick, H.

Observed time series are from tide gauges and altimetry, as well as from reconstructions over the last 50 years. CMIP5 coupled atmosphere-ocean model output of regional sea-level and associated uncertainty estimates are merged with scenario-independent contributions from GIA and dynamic ice to provide time series of coastal sea-level projections to the end of the 21st century. We focus on better quantifying the regional departure of coastal sea level rise from its global average, identify the reasons for the regional departure, and quantify the reasons for the uncertainty in these regional projections. Many of these coastal sea level projections are lower than the global mean change in sea level due to glacial isostatic adjustment, and gravitational changes from loss of land ice and terrestrially stored ground water. In most coastal regions, local deviations from the global mean vary up to Â±20 cm which, depending on the location, differ substantially in their underlying causes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3agauges 3agroundwater 3aice 3amodels 3asea level 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty1 aKohl, A.,1 aStammer, D.1 aA.

In the present paper, the reaction of MGO with creatine, arginine, and lysine during simulated digestion, and its reaction with creatine during the digestion in human volunteers, was studied. Therefore, simulated digestion experiments with a gastric and an intestinal phase were performed. Additionally, an intervention study with 12 subjects consuming MGO-containing Manuka honey and creatine simultaneously or separately was conducted. Derivatization with o-phenylenediamine and HPLCâUV was used to measure MGO, while creatine and glycated amino compounds were analyzed via HPLCâMS/MS. We show that MGO quickly reacts with creatine and arginine, but not lysine, during simulated digestion. Creatine reacts with 56% of MGO to form the hydroimidazolone MG-HCr, and arginine reacted with 4% of MGO to form the hydroimidazolone MG-H1. In the intervention study, urinary MG-HCr excretion is higher in subjects who consumed MGO and creatine simultaneously compared to subjects who ingested the substances separately. This demonstrates that the 1,2-dicarbonyl compound MGO reacts with amino compounds during human digestion, and glycated adducts are formed. These contribute to dietary glycation products consumed, and should be considered in studies investigating their physiological consequences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3aclinical trials 3acreatine 3aderivatization 3adigestion 3aexcretion 3aglycation 3ahumans 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestines 3alysine 3amanuka honey1 aGross, Julia,1 aPÃ¤tzold, Susann 1 aHenle, Thomas 0 tNutrients.g2022 Aug. 31, v. 14, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141735983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245014200164300001600306520102600322592002801348650002801376650001501404650001901419650001601438650002201454650002701476650001301503650001601516650002601532650001301558650001401571650001401585653001801599653001301617653001501630653000801645653000801653653001401661700001801675700001401693700001801707700001701725700001601742773010701758856005101865852000901916655001201925IND50088327720221119042004.0140414e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008832772DNAL7 a10.1080/01490451.2011.5813312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Xuan14aThe Physiological Response of Synechococcus elongatus to Salinity: A Potential Biomarker for Ancient Salinity in Evaporative Environments  ap. 477-483.  aThe purpose of this study was to characterize the physiological response of Synechococcus elongatus, a brackish-water cyanobacterium, to salt stress. S. elongatus was grown in artificial sea water medium with different salinities. The response was measured by analysis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and membrane lipids. The EPS yields were positively correlated (rÂ² = 0.99) with the salinity. The ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids (U/S) increased with salinity in the range of 2.1â° to 31.5â° and decreased at 52.5â°. A positive linear correlation (rÂ² = 0.92) was observed between the average chain length (ACL) of fatty acids and the salinity. These data indicate that S. elongatus adapted to salt stress by the secretion of EPS and by adjusting the membrane fluidity through the changes in ACL or desaturation of fatty acids. These variations in EPS and fatty acids may be used as geochemical biomarkers in sediments to unravel changes in the salinity of ancient evaporative environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSynechococcus elongatus 3abiomarkers 3abrackish water 3acorrelation 3amembrane fluidity 3aphysiological response 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asaturated fatty acids 3aseawater 3asecretion 3asediments 0aSynechococcus 0asalinity 0afatty acid 0aEPS 0aACL 0abiomarker1 aWang, Hongmei1 aLiu, Deng1 aGong, Linfeng1 aWu, Xiaoping1 aXiang, Xing0 tGeomicrobiology journal.g2012 June 1, v. 29, no. 5 p.477-483dTaylor & Francis Groupx1521-05297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2011.581331  aDNAL 7aarticle01942naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245007800201300002000279520064700299592002800946650002700974650001401001650001701015650003401032650001501066650003301081650001301114700006001127700002001187700001601207700006301223700006001286773014901346856007601495852000901571655001201580IND60744745520221117011353.0210716e20210628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074474552DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c057322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhan, Chin-Soon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6500-696X10aArgicyclamides AâC Unveil Enzymatic Basis for Guanidine Bis-prenylation  ap. 10083-10087.  aGuanidine prenylation is an outstanding modification in alkaloid and peptide biosynthesis, but its enzymatic basis has remained elusive.

For validation and as a baseline rotor, the NREL Phase VI wind turbine rotor blade is used. The Reynolds-Averaged NavierâStokes Equations are solved and different turbulence models including the SpalartâAllmaras, Standard k- Ïµ , k- Ïµ YangâShih and SST kâ Ï models are used and tested. The results are shown in terms of power generation at different wind speeds and the pressure distribution at different sections of the blade, and the comparisons are made with the available experimental data. For tip tilting analysis, 16 different geometries belonging to four different configurations are studied. The geometries are generated based on changing the twist and the cant angles of the winglet. The four different configurations are obtained from tilting the blade tip toward pressure side, suction side, leading edge, and trailing edge. The effect of the different configurations on the flow characteristics and hence on the power production of the wind turbine is investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amodels 3apower generation 3aturbulent flow 3awind speed 3awind turbines 0aWind turbine 0aHAWT 0aTip tilting 0aWinglet 0aCFD1 aSezer Uzol, Nilay1 aAkmandor, Ä°.

Throughout transcription elongation, RNA polymerases frequently deal with a number of obstacles that need to be removed for transcription resumption. One important type of hindrance consists of helix-distorting DNA lesions. Transcription-coupled repair (TC-NER), a specific sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair, ensures a fast repair of such transcription-blocking lesions. While the nucleotide excision repair reaction is fairly well understood, its regulation and the way it deals with DNA transcription remains largely unknown. In this review, we update our current understanding of the factors involved in TC-NER and discuss their functional interplay with the processes of transcription elongation and mRNP biogenesis.

The results show that the temperature field was neglibibly affected by the non-uniform inlet profile of the fuel, but the current density distribution was apparently affected. The difference in current density distribution between the curved profile and the progressively decreasing profile was small in the case of an solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with 10 stacks, but became larger in an SOFC with 20 stacks. In the 10-stack SOFC, the difference of current density between the uniform inlet flow and the curved inlet flow was less than 3%, whereas the deviation in the curved profile was less than 12%. However, in a 20-stack SOFC, the difference of current density was over 20%, whereas the deviation in the curved profile was more than 50%. Comparing the results between the curved and the progressively decreasing inlet profile indicates that the current density difference was over 20% in the 20-stack SOFC, but below 1% in the 10-stack SOFC. Therefore, a progressively decreasing inlet profile can replace a curved profile for analyzing an SOFC stack when the number of stacks is less than 10.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluid mechanics 3afuel cells 3afuels 3atemperature 0aElectrical analysis 0aSolid oxide fuel cell 0aStack 0aCurved profile 0aInlet flow rate 0aCurrent density1 aYuan, Bing,1 aLiu, Syu-Fang0 tInternational journal of green energy.g2015 Feb. 1, v. 12, no. 2 p.117-124dTaylor & Francisx1543-50837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2014.8890133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245011200165300002000277520134200297592002801639650001401667650001101681650001301692650002401705650001201729650002201741650001401763650001901777650001801796650001601814653001401830653002001844653002001864653002001884653002401904700005401928700001701982700001901999700001602018700001302034773014102047856007802188852000902266655001202275IND60596134220221117063553.0180615e20180508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059613422DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b041642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehman, Wasif ur10aBouquet-Like Mn2SnO4 Nanocomposite Engineered with Graphene Sheets as an Advanced Lithium-Ion Battery Anode  ap. 17963-17972.  aVolume expansion is a major challenge associated with tin oxide (SnOâ), which causes poor cyclability in lithium-ion battery anode. Bare tin dioxide (SnOâ), tin dioxide with graphene sheets (SnOâ@GS), and bouquet-like nanocomposite structure (MnâSnOâ@GS) are prepared via hydrothermal method followed by annealing. The obtained composite material presents a bouquet structure containing manganese and tin oxide nanoparticle network with graphene sheets. Benefiting from this porous nanostructure, in which graphene sheets provide high electronic pathways to enhance the electronic conductivity, uniformly distributed particles offer accelerated kinetic reaction with lithium ion and reduced volume deviation in the tin dioxide (SnOâ) particle during chargeâdischarge testing. As a consequence, ternary composite MnâSnOâ@GS showed a high rate performance and outstanding cyclability of anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The electrode achieved a specific capacity of about 1070 mA h gâÂ¹ at a current density of 400 mA gâÂ¹ after 200 cycles; meanwhile, the electrode still delivered a specific capacity of about 455 mA h gâÂ¹ at a high current density of 2500 mA gâÂ¹.

Spatial heterogeneity has also been positively correlated with species diversity. Here we investigated how temporal and spatial differences in nutrient addition together impact biodiversity in metacommunities varying in the degree of connectivity among the patches. We used a microcosm experimental design to test two spatiotemporal ways of supplying nutrients: synchronously (nutrients were added regionallyâto all four patches at the same time) and asynchronously (nutrients were added locallyâto a different patch each time), combined with two different degrees of connectivity among the patches (low or high connectivity). We used three species of algae and one species of cyanobacteria as the primary producers; and five ciliate and two rotifer species as the grazers. We expected higher diversity in metacommunities receiving an asynchronous nutrient supply, assuming stronger development of heterogeneous patches with this condition rather than with synchronous nutrient supply. This result was expected, however, to be dependent on the degree of connectivity among patches. We found significant effects of nutrient addition in both groups of organisms. Phytoplankton diversity increased until the fourth week (transiently) and zooplankton richness was persistently higher under asynchronous nutrient addition. Our results were consistent with our hypothesis that asynchronicity in nutrient supply would create a more favorable condition for species to co-occur. However, this effect was, in part, transient and was not influenced by the degree of connectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotifera 3aexperimental design 3anutrient availability 3aphytoplankton 3aspatial variation 3aspecies diversity 3azooplankton1 aWickham, Stephen A.0 tOecologia.g2020 Dec., v. 194, no. 4 p.695-707dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04768-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01312naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006200165300001600227520037600243592002800619650001300647650001400660650001600674650002200690700002200712700001600734700006100750773010900811856008100920852000901001655001201010IND60709506920221120201815.0200907e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070950692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2020.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhijie10aTowards a General Understanding of Bacterial Interactions  ap. 783-785.  aUnderstanding the general rules of microbial interactions is central for advancing microbial ecology.

The aim of this work was to identify associations between polymorphic polypeptides from fruit pericarp at two ripening stages and fruit quality traits evaluated in two segregating populations of tomato. A cross between a normal ripening cultivar of Solanum lycopersicum (C, Caimanta) and a genotype carrying the nor (non ripening) gene (N) as well as a cross between Caimanta and a cherry type tomato of S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme (Ce) showed genetic variance for several fruit quality traits such as fruit weight, shape, solids soluble content, acidity, color and fruit shelf life. The quantitative variations observed at phenotypic level had correspondence with the polymorphism detected in the protein profiles. Indeed, the polymophic polypeptides associated with quality fruit traits and fruit shelf life would be useful to assist tomato breeding programs as protein molecular markers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acherry tomatoes 3aacidity 3acultivars 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3apericarp 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3ashelf life 3atotal soluble solids 3acrossing 3afruit quality 3agenes 3acolor 3agenotype 3aripening 3aphenotypic variation 3agenetic variance 3agenetic markers 0asoluble solids1 aCosta, Javier H.

Herein, highly-dispersed Pt nanodots on Au nanorods (HD- PtNDs@AuNRs) with mimetic peroxidase activity were designed as an active electrode modifier for fabrication of a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrochemical sensor. The HD-PtNDs@AuNRs were synthesized by a seed-mediated growth approach and confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and UVâvis spectroscopy. The electrochemical and catalytical performances of HD-PtNDs@AuNRs towards H2O2 reduction were investigated in detail by cyclic voltammetry and amperometry. The HD-PtNDs@AuNRs modified electrode displayed a high catalytic activity to H2O2 at â0.10V (versus SCE), a rapid response within 5s, a wide linear range of 2.0â3800.0Î¼M, a detection limit of 1.2Î¼M (S/N=3), and a high sensitivity of 181Î¼AmMâ1cmâ2.

The most widely used protocol relies on a water-sucrose gradient flotation technique. Na-hexametaphosphate has also been used to deflocculate soil aggregates prior to spore extraction in order to optimize recovery, but its effect on spore viability remains unknown. Here, we report that Na-hexametaphosphate increases average spore yield in a high clay soil by about 15%, but decreases average spore viability by about 20%. Na-hexametaphosphate should therefore be used cautiously where the extracted spores are destined to be used as inoculum for subsequent studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay soils 3acommunity structure 3ainoculum 3amycorrhizal fungi 3asodium 3asoil aggregates 3aspores 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aviability1 aBradley, Robert L.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2011 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.2273-2274dElsevier Ltdx0038-07177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245007700161520142900238592002801667650001901695650001401714650001501728650001901743650001601762650001401778650001001792650001301802650002601815650001501841650001401856650001001870650002101880650001101901650001201912650001801924650001101942650001401953653001201967653003301979653001102012700003102023700001802054700001602072773011502088856007702203852000902280655001202289IND60699906420221120142639.0200623e20160808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069990642DNAL7 a10.1093/femsec/fiw1652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuggia, Lucia10aSchizoxylon as an experimental model for studying interkingdom symbiosis  aExperiments to re-synthesise lichens so far focused on co-cultures of fungal and algal partners. However, recent studies have revealed that bacterial communities colonise lichens in a stable and host-specific manner. We were therefore interested in testing how lichenised fungi and algae interact with selected bacteria in an experimental setup. We selected the symbiotic system of Schizoxylon albescens and the algal genera Coccomyxa and Trebouxia as a suitable model. We isolated bacterial strains from the naturally occurring bacterial fraction of freshly collected specimens and established tripartite associations under mixed culture experiments. The bacteria belong to Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and corresponded to groups already found associated with fungi including lichens. In mixed cultures with Coccomyxa, the fungus formed a characteristic filamentous matrix and tightly contacted the algae; the bacteria distributed in small patches between the algal cells and attached to the cell walls. In mixed cultures with Trebouxia, the fungus did not develop the filamentous matrix, but bacterial cells were observed to be tightly adhering to the fungal hyphae. Our experiments show that this tripartite fungalâalgalâbacterial model system can be maintained in culture and can offer multiple opportunities for functional studies based on experiments under controlled conditions in the laboratory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aCoccomyxa 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3aSchizoxylon 3aTrebouxia 3aalgae 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3acell walls 3acoculture 3afungi 3ahost specificity 3ahyphae 3alichens 3amixed culture 3amodels 3asymbiosis 0aculture 0ascanning electron microscopy 0asystem1 aFernÃ¡ndez-Brime, Samantha1 aGrube, Martin1 aWedin, Mats0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2016 Aug. 8, v. 92, no. 10dOxford University PresswJournal:1989x1574-69417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiw1653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001900188245012000207300001800327506007600345520134200421592002801763506003701791650000801828650001301836650002201849650002101871650001401892650002401906650001301930650002101943650001601964650001301980650001101993650001502004650000902019650001202028650002602040650002102066650001402087650002002101650001602121650001802137653002202155653001702177653002102194653001502215653001602230700002302246700002302269700002702292700002102319700002102340773011902361856008202480852000902562655001202571IND60517253020221207064922.0190729e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051725302DNAL7 aPMC41898272pmcid7 a237018222pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820130005042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVANAGAS, LAURA10aEpichromatin is conserved in Toxoplasma gondii and labels the exterior parasite chromatin throughout the cell cycle  ap. 1104-1110.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aToxoplasma gondii is an apicomplexan intracellular protozoan parasite responsible for toxoplasmosis, a disease with considerable medical and economic impact worldwide. Toxoplasma gondii cells never lose the nuclear envelope and their chromosomes do not condense. Here, we tested the murine monoclonal antibody PL2-6, which labels epichromatin (a conformational chromatin epitope based on histones H2A and H2B complexed with DNA), in T. gondii cultured in human fibroblasts. This epitope is present at the exterior chromatin surface of interphase nuclei and on the periphery of mitotic chromosomes in higher eukaryotes. PL2-6 reacted with T. gondii H2A and H2B histones in Western blot (WB) assays. In addition, the antibody reacted with the nuclear fraction of tachyzoites, as a single band coincident with H2B histone. In the T. gondii tachyzoite stage, PL2-6 also had peripheral nuclear localization, as observed by epifluorescence/confocal microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy. Confocal analysis showed that epichromatin is slightly polarized to one face of the parasite exterior chromatin surface. In replicating tachyzoites, PL2-6 also labels the exterior chromatin surface, covering the face of both segregating nuclei, facing the plasma membrane of the mother cell. The possible role of epichromatin in T. gondii is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aProtozoa 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aWestern blotting 3achromatin 3aconfocal microscopy 3aepitopes 3aeukaryotic cells 3afibroblasts 3ahistones 3ahumans 3ainterphase 3amice 3amitosis 3amonoclonal antibodies 3anuclear membrane 3aparasites 3aplasma membrane 3atachyzoites 3atoxoplasmosis 0aToxoplasma gondii 0aepichromatin 0anuclear envelope 0acell cycle 0areplication1 aDALMASSO, MARIA C.1 aDUBREMETZ, JEAN F.1 aPORTIANSKY, ENRIQUE L.1 aOLINS, DONALD E.1 aANGEL, SERGIO O.0 tParasitology.g2013 Aug., v. 140, no. 9 p.1104-1110dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820130005043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010600173300001600279520157200295592002801867650003201895650002101927650002301948650000801971650001201979650002301991650001802014650002902032700002102061700002502082700002302107700003302130773010702163856008402270990002302354852000902377655001202386IND60089968320221118095552.0141102e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008996832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagrm.2012.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStec-Dziedzic, Ewa10aCharacterization of the transcriptional stimulatory properties of the Pseudomonas putida RapA protein  ap. 219-230.  aRNA polymerase-associated factors can significantly affect its performance at specific promoters. Here we identified a Pseudomonas putida RNA polymerases-associated protein as a homolog of Escherichia coli RapA. We found that P. putida RapA stimulates the transcription from promoters dependent on a variety of Ï-factors (Ïâ·â°, ÏS, Ïâµâ´, ÏÂ³Â², Ïá´±) in vitro. The level of stimulation varied from 2- to 10-fold, with the maximal effect observed with the Ïá´±-dependent PhtrA promoter. Stimulation by RapA was apparent in the multi-round reactions and was modulated by salt concentration in vitro. However, in contrast to findings with E. coli RapA, P. putida RapA-mediated stimulation of transcription was also evident using linear templates. These properties of P. putida RapA were apparent using either E. coli- or P. putida-derived RNA polymerases. Analysis of individual steps of transcription revealed that P. putida RapA enhances the stability of competitor-resistant open-complexes formed by RNA polymerase at promoters. In vivo, P. putida RapA can complement the inhibitory effect of high salt on growth of an E. coli RapA null strain. However, a P. putida RapA null mutant was not sensitive to high salt. The in vivo effects of lack of RapA were only detectable for the Ïá´±-PhtrA promoter where the RapA-deficiency resulted in lower activity. The presented characteristics of P. putida RapA indicate that its functions may extend beyond a role in facilitating RNA polymerase recycling to include a role in transcription initiation efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas putida 3aRNA 3amutants 3asalt concentration 3asigma factors 3atranscription (genetics)1 aÅyÅ¼eÅ, Robert1 aSkÃ¤rfstad, Eleonore1 aShingler, Victoria1 aSzalewska-PaÅasz, Agnieszka0 tBBA - Gene Regulatory Mechanisms.g2013 Feb., v. 1829, no. 2 p.219-230dElsevier B.V.x1874-93997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2012.11.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245004400212300001400256506007600270520090000346592002801246506003701274650001501311650001201326650001401338650001001352650001601362650001801378650001101396650001101407650002201418700002201440773010901462856008101571852000901652655001201661IND60604144520221207115540.0180716e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060414452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2015.08.0092doi7 aPMC46881082pmcid7 a263791972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoberts, Samantha E10aNuclear autonomy in multinucleate fungi  ap. 60-65.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWithin many fungal syncytia, nuclei behave independently despite sharing a common cytoplasm. Creation of independent nuclear zones of control in one cell is paradoxical considering random protein synthesis sites, predicted rapid diffusion rates, and well-mixed cytosol. In studying the surprising fungal nuclear autonomy, new principles of cellular organization are emerging. We discuss the current understanding of nuclear autonomy, focusing on asynchronous cell cycle progression where most work has been directed. Mechanisms underlying nuclear autonomy are diverse including mRNA localization, ploidy variability, and nuclear spacing control.

Here, we show that warming-related tree mortality is recently taking place in high-elevation semi-arid Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) forests of the north-eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau (Qilian Mountains). Tree-ring samples were collected from 24 Qinghai spruce forest plots (20Â mÂ ÃÂ 20Â m) at three elevations (2600, 2700, 2800Â m) along eight elevation transects on north-facing slopes. Three lines of evidence suggest that these forests are increasingly at risk of increased tree mortality as a consequence of global warming, (i) a strong precipitation and air humidity dependence of radial growth, (ii) increasing frequency of missing tree rings, and (iii) a rising tree mortality rate in recent decades. The recent drought episode on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau may represent a precursor of future global-change-type drought events in large parts of Inner Asia. Warming-related tree mortality of the semi-arid forests may be interpreted as early-warning signs for the densely populated artificial oases surrounding the Gobi Desert, which largely depend on river run-off from the mountain forests on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea crassifolia 3aair 3adecline 3adrought 3aglobal warming 3agrowth rings 3ahumidity 3amontane forests 3amortality 3amountains 3aoases 3arisk 3arivers 3arunoff 3atree growth 3atree mortality 3awater stress 3aChina 3aGobi Desert1 aLeuschner, Christoph1 aDulamsuren, Choimaa1 aWagner, Bettina1 aHauck, Markus0 tClimatic change.g2016 Jan., v. 134, no. 1-2 p.163-176dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-015-1531-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245023800162300001600400520190400416592002802320650001902348650002202367650002502389650000902414650001002423650001302433650001402446650002002460650001802480650002602498650001602524650001702540650001502557650001302572650002902585650001002614653002302624653002602647653001702673653001802690653001602708653001602724700001502740700001602755700002302771700001702794700001502811773009202826856008102918852000902999655001203008IND60544740820221119183730.0160901e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054474082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2014.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiesa, L.10aDetection of boldenone, its conjugates and androstadienedione, as well as five corticosteroids in bovine bile through a unique immunoaffinity column clean-up and two validated liquid chromatographyâtandem mass spectrometry analyses  ap. 137-145.  aThe presence of Î²-boldenone II phase metabolites and prednisolone in urine samples, owing to endogenous or natural origin or illicit treatment, is under debate within the European Union. The detection of Î²-boldenone conjugates, Î±-boldenone conjugates at concentrations higher than 2ngmLâ1 and prednisolone above the cut-off level of 5ngmLâ1 in urine have been, until now, critical in deciding if illegal drug use has occurred. The use of urine sometimes is not entirely satisfactory, especially when the drug is administrated at low doses or when its metabolic conversion is very fast. This subsequently would hamper its detection in urine. The introduction of a new, advantageous matrix where the illicit treatment can be investigated would be highly appreciated. In this study, we have developed and validated a simple and unique immunoaffinity clean-up procedure, which was applied to bovine bile samples, followed by two different analytical liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry methods. The first method tests androstadienedione, Î±- and Î²-boldenone sulphate, glucuronate and related free forms, while the other method assays prednisolone, prednisone, dexamethasone, cortisone, and cortisol. The methods were validated according to European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The evaluated parameters were linearity, specificity, precision (repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility), recovery, decision limit and detection capability. The decision limits (CCÎ±) were between 0.38 and 0.45ngmLâ1 for anabolic steroids, and 0.13 and 0.15ngmLâ1 as far as corticosteroids were concerned. Intra- and inter-day repeatability was below 15.8 and 19.9% for all analytes, respectively. The methods were applied to the analysis of some bile samples collected from untreated young bulls in order to investigate the presence of the studied steroids in this matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aanabolic steroids 3aanalytical chemistry 3abile 3abulls 3acortisol 3acortisone 3adetection limit 3adexamethasone 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3aprednisolone 3aprednisone 3asulfates 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine 0aBoldenone sulphate 0aBoldenone glucuronide 0aPrednisolone 0aDexamethasone 0aBovine bile 0aFood safety1 aNobile, M.1 aPanseri, S.1 aSgoifo Rossi, C.A.1 aPavlovic, R.1 aArioli, F.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 852 p.137-145dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245011300166520140900279592002801688650002101716650001501737650002101752650002201773650002101795650002401816650001301840650001601853650001101869650001501880650001901895650002201914650001401936650001701950650001401967650001501981650001701996650002502013650003102038651001202069653002802081653002302109653002302132653001602155653001302171700002302184700002002207700002002227700001902247773012602266856007702392852000902469655001202478IND60699906920221120141955.0200623e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069990692DNAL7 a10.1093/femsec/fiw1732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtega, Rocel Amor14aThe plant is crucial: specific composition and function of the phyllosphere microbiome of indoor ornamentals  aThe plant microbiome is a key determinant of plant health. Less is known about the phyllosphere microbiota and its driving factors in built environments. To study the variability of the microbiome in relation to plant genotype and climate under different controlled conditions, we investigated 14 phylogenetically diverse plant species grown in the greenhouses of the Botanical Garden in Graz (Austria). All investigated plants showed specific bacterial abundances of up to 10â¶ CFUâcmâ»Â² on their leaves. Bacterial diversity (Hâ²: 2.4â7.9) and number of putative OTUs (461â2013) were strongly plant species dependent. Statistical analysis showed a significantly higher correlation of community composition to plant genotype in comparison to the ambient climatic variables. In addition to the microbiome structure, we studied the antagonistic potential towards the foliar pathogen Botrytis cinerea as functional indicator. A high proportion of isolates (up to 58%) were able to inhibit pathogen growth by production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Data of structure and function were linked: frequently isolated VOCs producers (e.g. Bacillus and Stenotrophomonas) were highly present in phyllosphere communities, which were dominated by members of Firmicutes. This study indicates that indoor ornamentals feature a distinct, stable microbiota on leaves irrespective of the indoor climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aFirmicutes 3aStenotrophomonas 3abotanical gardens 3aclimatic factors 3acommunity structure 3agenotype 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3aornamental plants 3apathogens 3aphyllosphere 3aphylogeny 3aphytobiome 3aplant health 3astatistical analysis 3avolatile organic compounds 3aAustria 0aphyllosphere microbiome 0aindoor ornamentals 0abuilt environments 0aantagonists 0aBotrytis1 aMahnert, Alexander1 aBerg, Christian1 aMÃ¼ller, Henry,1 aBerg, Gabriele0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 92, no. 12 p.fiw173-dOxford University PresswJournal:1989x1574-69417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiw1733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245006700208300001600275520174500291592002802036650003202064650001202096650001502108650001302123650001902136650001602155650001302171650001402184650001302198650001802211650002302229650001402252650002902266700001402295700001902309700001702328700001802345773010502363856008402468990002302552852000902575655001202584IND60089968720221118095517.0141102e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008996872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagrm.2012.10.0142doi7 aPMC35944522pmcid7 a231538262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHannan, K.M.10aDysregulation of RNA polymerase I transcription during disease  ap. 342-360.  aTranscription of the ribosomal RNA genes by the dedicated RNA polymerase I enzyme and subsequent processing of the ribosomal RNA are fundamental control steps in the synthesis of functional ribosomes. Dysregulation of Pol I transcription and ribosome biogenesis is linked to the etiology of a broad range of human diseases. Diseases caused by loss of function mutations in the molecular constituents of the ribosome, or factors intimately associated with RNA polymerase I transcription and processing are collectively termed ribosomopathies. Ribosomopathies are generally rare and treatment options are extremely limited tending to be more palliative than curative. Other more common diseases are associated with profound changes in cellular growth such as cardiac hypertrophy, atrophy or cancer. In contrast to ribosomopathies, altered RNA polymerase I transcriptional activity in these diseases largely results from dysregulated upstream oncogenic pathways or by direct modulation by oncogenes or tumor suppressors at the level of the RNA polymerase I transcription apparatus itself. Ribosomopathies associated with mutations in ribosomal proteins and ribosomal RNA processing or assembly factors have been covered by recent excellent reviews. In contrast, here we review our current knowledge of human diseases specifically associated with dysregulation of RNA polymerase I transcription and its associated regulatory apparatus, including some cases where this dysregulation is directly causative in disease. We will also provide insight into and discussion of possible therapeutic approaches to treat patients with dysregulated RNA polymerase I transcription.

It has been hypothesized that, at low oxygen concentrations, microbial iron oxidation is favored over abiotic oxidation. Here, we compare the kinetics of abiotic Fe(II) oxidation to oxidation in the presence of the bacterium Leptothrix cholodnii Appels isolated from a wetland sediment. Rates of Fe(II) oxidation were determined in batch experiments at 20Â°C, pH 7 and oxygen concentrations between 3 and 120 Î¼mol/l. The reaction progress in experiments with and without cells exhibited two distinct phases. During the initial phase, the oxygen dependency of microbial Fe(II) oxidation followed a Michaelis-Menten rate expression (KM = 24.5Â Â±Â 10 Î¼mol Oâ/l, vâââ = 1.8Â Â±Â 0.2 Î¼mol Fe(II)/(l min) for 10â¸ cells/ml). In contrast, abiotic rates increased linearly with increasing oxygen concentrations. At similar oxygen concentrations, initial Fe(II) oxidation rates were faster in the experiments with bacteria. During the second phase, the accumulated iron oxides catalyzed further oxidative iron precipitation in both abiotic and microbial reaction systems. That is, abiotic oxidation also dominated the reaction progress in the presence of bacteria. In fact, in some experiments with bacteria, iron oxidation during the second phase proceeded slower than in the absence of bacteria, possibly due to an inhibitory effect of extracellular polymeric substances on the growth of Fe(III) oxides. Thus, our results suggest that the competitive advantage of microbial iron oxidation in low oxygen environments may be limited by the autocatalytic nature of abiotic Fe(III) oxide precipitation, unless the accumulation of Fe(III) oxides is prevented, for example, through a close coupling of Fe(II) oxidation and Fe(III) reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3aferric oxide 3awetlands 3airon 3apH 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3abacteria 3aLeptothrix cholodnii 0aneutrophilic Fe(II) oxidation 0aoxygen dependency 0aMichaelis-Menten kinetics 0aoxides1 aBehrends, Thilo1 aVan Cappellen, Philippe0 tGeomicrobiology journal.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 29, no. 6 p.550-560dTaylor & Francis Groupx1521-05297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2011.594147  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245004200161300001600203520107600219592002801295650001901323650001901342650001401361650002501375650001101400650001201411650001101423650001201434651001001446700002201456700002401478773009801502856008101600852000901681655001201690IND60474614620221119002136.0151223e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047461462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-015-1516-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Da10aEquity and emissions trading in China  ap. 131-146.  aChina has embarked on an ambitious pathway for establishing a national carbon market in the next 5â10Â years. In this study, we analyze the distributional aspects of a Chinese emissions-trading scheme from ethical, economic, and stated-preference perspectives. We focus on the role of emissions permit allocation and first show how specific equity principles can be incorporated into the design of potential allocation schemes. We then assess the economic and distributional impacts of those allocation schemes using a computable general equilibrium model with regional detail for the Chinese economy. Finally, we conduct a survey among Chinese climate-policy experts on the basis of the simulated model impacts. The survey participants indicate a relative preference for allocation schemes that put less emissions-reduction burden on the western provinces, a medium burden on the central provinces, and a high burden on the eastern provinces. Most participants show strong support for allocating emissions permits based on consumption-based emissions responsibilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon markets 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3aenvironmental policy 3aethics 3aexperts 3amodels 3asurveys 3aChina1 aSpringmann, Marco1 aKarplus, Valerie J.0 tClimatic change.g2016 Jan., v. 134, no. 1-2 p.131-146dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-015-1516-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006600188245011700254300001400371506007600385520083900461592002801300506003701328650002701365650001501392650001501407650002301422650001301445650001401458650001901472650002001491650001501511650001701526650002201543650001301565650001401578700002701592700001601619773010901635856008101744852000901825655001201834IND60604144920221207120427.0180716e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060414492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2015.07.0172doi7 aPMC46880862pmcid7 a264768042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazmierczak, Barbara I1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8162-803X10aCross-regulation of Pseudomonas motility systems: the intimate relationship between flagella, pili and virulence  ap. 78-82.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPseudomonas aeruginosa navigates using two distinct forms of motility, swimming and twitching. A polar flagellum and Type 4 pili power these movements, respectively, allowing P. aeruginosa to attach to and colonize surfaces. Single cell imaging and particle tracking algorithms have revealed a wide range of bacterial surface behaviors which are regulated by second messengers cyclic-di-GMP and cAMP; the production of these signals is, in turn, responsive to the engagement of motility organelles with a surface. Innate immune defense systems, long known to recognize structural components of flagella, appear to respond to motility itself. The association of motility with both upregulation of virulence and induction of host defense mechanisms underlies the complex contributions of flagella and pili to P. aeruginosa pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aalgorithms 3acyclic AMP 3adefense mechanisms 3afimbriae 3aflagellum 3aimage analysis 3ainnate immunity 3aorganelles 3apathogenesis 3asecond messengers 3aswimming 3avirulence1 aSchniederberend, Maren1 aJain, Ruchi0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2015 Dec., v. 28 p.78-82dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2015.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245004100159300001800200520115100218592002801369650001201397650002201409650001001431650001501441650002301456650001001479773009801489856007101587852000901658655001201667IND60518531820221122013812.0160418e197011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051853182DNAL7 a10.2307/19336322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHickman, James C.10aSeasonal Course of Xylem Sap Tension  ap. 1052-1056.  aMore than 1,000 xylem tension measurements were made with a pressure chamber on plants of various life forms, including delicate herbs. Five patterns of seasonal change in tension were discerned. The commonest pattern consists of marked diurnal fluctuations which steadily increase in magnitude. Actively growing annuals and perennials exhibiting this pattern were found to withstand tensions greater than 70 atm. Other perennials showed seasonally constant maxima, with minima increasing until there was little diurnal fluctuation. One species evidenced no seasonal change in either maximum or minimum tension. Of the ephemeral annuals exemplifying the remaining two patterns, one species showed increasingly prominent diurnal fluctuations with a critical point beyond which plants desiccated rapidly, whereas another species exhibited little diurnal fluctuation and had an earlier and lower critical point. Annuals have the ability to maintain low tensions under high radiation loads, and the ability to withstand extremely high internal tensions. These responses appear to be alternative adaptations to a seasonally decreasing moisture supply.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannuals 3adiurnal variation 3aherbs 3aperennials 3aseasonal variation 3axylem0 tEcology.g1970 Nov., v. 51, no. 6 p.1052-1056dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19336323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007400170300001600244520103600260592002801296650001701324650001201341650001501353650001901368650001601387650002101403650002101424650001301445651002701458700001801485700002801503773009801531856008101629852000901710655001201719IND60474614920221119002129.0151223e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047461492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-015-1534-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarter Johnson, W.10aNon-linear responses of glaciated prairie wetlands to climate warming  ap. 209-223.  aThe response of ecosystems to climate warming is likely to include threshold events when small changes in key environmental drivers produce large changes in an ecosystem. Wetlands of the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) are especially sensitive to climate variability, yet the possibility that functional changes may occur more rapidly with warming than expected has not been examined or modeled. The productivity and biodiversity of these wetlands are strongly controlled by the speed and completeness of a vegetation cover cycle driven by the wet and dry extremes of climate. Two thresholds involving duration and depth of standing water must be exceeded every few decades or so to complete the cycle and to produce highly functional wetlands. Model experiments at 19 weather stations employing incremental warming scenarios determined that wetland function across most of the PPR would be diminished beyond a climate warming of about 1.5â2.0Â Â°C, a critical temperature threshold range identified in other climate change studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aglobal warming 3atemperature 3avegetation cover 3aweather stations 3awetlands 3aPrairie Pothole region1 aWerner, Brett1 aGuntenspergen, Glenn R.0 tClimatic change.g2016 Jan., v. 134, no. 1-2 p.209-223dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-015-1534-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245012000203300001800323500001900341520167600360592002802036596005002064596006202114596004602176596003202222650001502254650001202269650001902281650002002300650003102320650002102351650002102372650001502393650001102408650002602419650001802445700005302463700005802516700005702574773010102631856008202732852000902814655001202823IND60718358020221120054932.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071835802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-020-00488-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Hares1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9576-317910aMajor Effects of Alkalinity on the Relationship Between Metabolism and Dissolved Inorganic Carbon Dynamics in Lakes  ap. 1566-1580.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSeveral findings suggest that COâ emissions in lakes are not always directly linked to changes in metabolism but can be associated with interactions with the dissolved inorganic carbon equilibrium. Alkalinity has been described as a determining factor in regulating the relative contributions of biological and inorganic processes to carbon dynamics in lakes. Here we analyzed the relationship between metabolic changes in dissolved oxygen (DO) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) at different timescales in eight lakes covering a wide range in alkalinity. We used high-frequency data from automatic monitoring stations to explore the sensitivity of DIC to metabolic changes inferred from oxygen. To overcome the problem of noisy data, commonly found in high-frequency measurements datasets, we used Singular Spectrum Analysis to enhance the diel signal-to-noise ratio. Our results suggest that in most of the studied lakes, a large part of the measured variability in DO and DIC reflects non-metabolic processes. Furthermore, at low alkalinity, DIC dynamics appear to be mostly driven by aquatic metabolism, but this relationship weakens with increasing alkalinity. The observed deviations from the metabolic 1:1 stoichiometry between DO and DIC were strongly correlated with the deviations expected to occur from calcite precipitation, with a stronger correlation when accounting also for the benthic contribution of calcite precipitation. This highlights the role of calcite precipitation as an important driver of COâ supersaturation in lakes with alkalinity above 1Â meqÂ Lâ»Â¹, which represents 57% of the global area of lakes and reservoirs around the world.  aPublisher supplied data  a722518cH2020 Marie SkÅodowska-Curie Actions  aCGL2017-86788-C3-3-PcMinisterio de Ciencia e InnovaciÃ³n  aIUT 21-02cHaridus- ja Teadusministeerium  aPSG32cEesti Teadusagentuur 3aalkalinity 3acalcite 3acarbon dioxide 3adata collection 3adissolved inorganic carbon 3adissolved oxygen 3ainorganic carbon 3ametabolism 3aoxygen 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3astoichiometry1 aLaas, Alo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4801-03771 aMarcÃ©, Rafael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7416-46521 aObrador, Biel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4050-04910 tEcosystems.g2020 Dec., v. 23, no. 8 p.1566-1580dSpringer USwJournal:jnl70038x1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-020-00488-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245016000155300002000315520121700335592002801552650002101580650001801601650001401619650002301633650001701656650002601673650002101699650001501720650001301735650001301748650001701761650001801778650001401796650001101810650002201821650001301843650001701856650002901873700001601902700001801918700001401936700001601950700001201966700001301978700001301991700001602004773014402020856007402164852000902238655001202247IND60671162220221118192852.0191002e20150811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067116222DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta03900b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xinzhe10aMOF derived CoâOâ nanoparticles embedded in N-doped mesoporous carbon layer/MWCNT hybrids: extraordinary bi-functional electrocatalysts for OER and ORR  ap. 17392-17402.  aHighly efficient and non-precious metal electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) are at the heart of key renewable-energy technologies. Nevertheless, developing highly active bi-functional catalysts at low cost for both OER and ORR still remains a huge challenge. In this paper, CoâOâ nanocrystals embedded in N-doped mesoporous graphitic carbon layer/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) hybrids are prepared by a facile carbonization and subsequent oxidation process of MWCNT-based metalâorganic frameworks (MOFs). As a result, in alkaline media, the hybrid material catalyzes OER with an onset potential of 1.50 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) and an over-potential only of 320 mV to achieve a stable current density of 10 mA cmâ»Â² for at least 25 h. The same hybrids also exhibit similar catalytic activity but superior stability to the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst for ORR, making it a high-performance cheap bi-catalyst for both OER and ORR. The design concept of nonmetal-doped and precious-metal-free electrocatalysts from MOFs can be extended to fabricate other novel, stable and easy to use catalyst systems for advanced applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acarbonization 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt oxide 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3aplatinum 3aporous media 3arenewable energy sources1 aFang, Yiyun1 aLin, Xiaoqing1 aTian, Min1 aAn, Xingcai1 aFu, Yan1 aLi, Rong1 aJin, Jun1 aMa, Jiantai0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Aug. 11, v. 3, no. 33 p.17392-17402dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta03900b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04351naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001600160245016700176300001800343520198800361592002802349650001702377650001302394650001302407650002002420650001502440650001702455650001802472650002802490650001802518650001402536650001302550650001202563650001802575650001702593650001402610650001202624650002302636650002002659650000802679650002102687650001302708650000902721650002002730650001702750650001502767650001002782650002102792650004902813650002802862650004102890650002302931650005602954650001603010650001103026650003503037650001903072650002303091650000903114650002703123650002903150650002103179650002403200650001603224700001703240700002203257700002103279700001903300700002203319773011403341856008103455852000903536655001203545IND4471256620221122224927.0120501e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447125662DNAL7 a219405102pmid7 a10.3945/jn.111.1445922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMah, Eunice10aPostprandial Hyperglycemia Impairs Vascular Endothelial Function in Healthy Men by Inducing Lipid Peroxidation and Increasing Asymmetric Dimethylarginine:Arginine  ap. 1961-1968.  aPostprandial hyperglycemia induces vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED) and increases future cardiovascular disease risk. We hypothesized that postprandial hyperglycemia would decrease vascular function in healthy men by inducing oxidative stress and proinflammatory responses and increasing asymmetric dimethylarginine:arginine (ADMA:arginine), a biomarker that is predictive of reduced NO biosynthesis. In a randomized, cross-over design, healthy men (n = 16; 21.6 Â± 0.8 y) ingested glucose or fructose (75 g) after an overnight fast. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), plasma glucose and insulin, antioxidants, malondialdehyde (MDA), inflammatory proteins, arginine, and ADMA were measured at regular intervals during the 3-h postprandial period. Baseline FMD did not differ between trials (P > 0.05). Postprandial FMD was reduced following the ingestion of glucose only. Postprandial MDA concentrations increased to a greater extent following the ingestion of glucose compared to fructose. Plasma arginine decreased and the ratio of ADMA:arginine increased to a greater extent following the ingestion of glucose. Inflammatory cytokines and cellular adhesion molecules were unaffected by the ingestion of either sugar. Postprandial AUC0â3 h for FMD and MDA were inversely related (r = â0.80; P < 0.05), suggesting that hyperglycemia-induced lipid peroxidation suppresses postprandial vascular function. Collectively, these findings suggest that postprandial hyperglycemia in healthy men reduces endothelium-dependent vasodilation by increasing lipid peroxidation independent of inflammation. Postprandial alterations in arginine and ADMA:arginine also suggest that acute hyperglycemia may induce VED by decreasing NO bioavailability through an oxidative stress-dependent mechanism. Additional work is warranted to define whether inhibiting lipid peroxidation and restoring arginine metabolism would mitigate hyperglycemia-mediated decreases in vascular function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aarginine 3aarteries 3abioavailability 3abiomarkers 3abiosynthesis 3ablood glucose 3acardiovascular diseases 3acell adhesion 3acytokines 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahyperglycemia 3ainflammation 3aingestion 3ainsulin 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amen 3aoxidative stress 3aproteins 3arisk 3astress response 3avasodilation 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aArea Under Curve 2aArgininexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCross-Over Studies 2aEndothelium, Vascularxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aHomeostasis 2aHumans 2aHyperglycemiaxphysiopathology 2aInsulinxblood 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aMale 2aMalondialdehydexblood 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aOxidative Stress 2aPostprandial Period 2aYoung Adult1 aNoh, Sang K.1 aBallard, Kevin D.1 aMatos, Manuel E.1 aVolek, Jeff S.1 aBruno, Richard S.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2011 Nov., v. 141, no. 11 p.1961-1968dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.111.1445923Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009700166300001600263520089100279592002801170650002101198650001301219650000901232650001701241650002501258650002501283700001601308700001801324700001701342700002001359700002201379700002001401773008601421856008501507852000901592655001201601IND60559498420221117202302.0190425e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055949842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.05.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jikun10aPulsed ultra-violet laser interactions with ultra-low-density porous carbon nanotube sponges  ap. 604-610.  aIn order to improve the understanding of laser interactions of materials with homogeneous nano-structures, pulsed laser induced plasma from a low density, high-porosity multiwall carbon nanotube (CNT) sponge and a dense graphite block have been investigated by combinational spectroscopy approaches. We observe distinct differences in the laser-induced light emission of the CNT sponge and graphite block which we attribute to the occurrence of a phase explosion caused by the lower thermal conductivity and weaker mechanical strength of the CNT sponge. Furthermore, spectroscopy plasma analysis reveals that differences in the surface of the two systems play a key role in the generation of negative carbon ions. We observe a more effective production of negative ions for the CNT sponge as compared to the graphite block due to the greater number of surface defects of the CNT sponge.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3agraphene 3aions 3aspectroscopy 3astrength (mechanics) 3athermal conductivity1 aGui, Xuchun1 aLin, Zhiqiang1 aTang, Zikang1 aLee, Michael M.1 aWokaun, Alexander1 aLippert, Thomas0 tCarbon.g2015 Nov., v. 93 p.604-610dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.05.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015600173520184600329592002802175650002002203650002502223650001702248650001802265650002902283650001002312650001402322650002402336650001202360650001202372650001202384650001602396650001602412650001102428650001402439650000702453650001302460650002302473650001302496650002002509650002302529650001502552650004402567650001402611653002602625653002802651653001502679653003002694653002602724700001602750700001902766700001702785773011302802856008602915852000903001655001203010IND60702697720221118000713.0201024e20201120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070269772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1231432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLÃ³pez-Hortas, L.10aMicrowave hydrodiffusion and gravity versus conventional distillation for Acacia dealbata flowers. Recovery of bioactive extracts for cosmetic purposes  aNatural extracts recovered from underutilized wild Acacia dealbata flowers using microwave hydrodiffusion and gravity (MHG) were compared with those obtained from conventional steam distillation. Several irradiation powers (50â125Â W) were studied. MHG solid phases were treated by solid-liquid extraction (SLE) with ethanol solvent. Their total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, total carotenoid content, color characteristics, pH value and solar protection factor (SPF) were tested. Selected extracts were incorporated to an oil-in-water emulsion cosmetic model made with three thermal spring waters and preliminary sensory analysis was made. These creams were chemically and rheologically analyzed jointly with their bioactive capacity by an acceleration oxidation test. The optimum MHG extract was collected at 75Â W for 180Â min, since this flower liquor exhibited the highest total phenolic content (around 0.15Â mg GAE/g flower dry weight) and antioxidant capacities (about 0.39Â mg Trolox eq/g flower dry weight and 0.36Â Î¼g Î²-carotene/g flower dry weight) of microwave extracts. Distillation extracts presented higher concentrations (about 0.20Â mg GAE/g flower dry weight and around 0.58Â mg Trolox eq/g flower dry weight), but with larger (two times) estimated specific energy requirements. Selected extracts provided sunscreen creams with similar chemical (i.e., pH and SPF values) and bioactive properties (i.e., thiobarbituric acid reactive substance outcomes) that cosmetics prepared with BHT or (Â±)-Î±-tocopherol commercial antioxidants. The viscosity features of the different cosmetic samples were similar, except for those sun creams elaborated with one thermal spring water. This sample presented lower apparent viscosity profiles, which could be an important advantage from the skin application point of view.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia dealbata 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeta-carotene 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acolor 3aemulsions 3aenergy requirements 3aethanol 3aflowers 3agravity 3ahot springs 3airradiation 3amodels 3aoxidation 3apH 3arheology 3asensory evaluation 3asolvents 3aspecific energy 3asteam distillation 3asunscreens 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3aviscosity 0aAntioxidant compounds 0aEco-friendly extraction 0aSun creams 0aRheology characterization 0aThermal spring waters1 aFalquÃ©, E.1 aDomÃ­nguez, H.1 aTorres, M.D.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Nov. 20, v. 274 p.123143-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1231433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245012900160300001600289500002000305520143800325592002801763650001301791650001401804650001101818650001901829650001401848650001201862650001101874650001201885650001701897650001301914650001001927650001301937650001601950650001901966650001201985650001201997650001602009650000702025650001102032700001302043700001702056700001802073700001602091773011202107856007802219852000902297655001202306IND60585639920221116150421.0171112e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058563992DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2017001322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuanfei10aIndigenously associated methanogens intensified the metabolism in hydrogenosomes of anaerobic fungi with xylose as substrate  ap. 933-940.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAnaerobic fungi are potent lignocellulose degraders, but have not yet been exploited in this capacity, largely owing to their poor metabolic characterization. In the current study, a time course of fermentation was conducted to study the effect of the coâcultured methanogens on xylose metabolism by anaerobic fungi. The fermentation endâproducts from anaerobic fungal monoculture were Hâ (6.7âml), COâ (65.7âml), formate (17.90âmM), acetate (9.00âmM), lactate (11.89âmM), ethanol, and malate after 96âh fermentation. Compared to the monoculture, the endâproducts of coâculture shifted to more COâ (71.8âml) and acetate (15.20âmM), methane (14.9âml), less lactate (5.28âmM), and hardly detectable formate and Hâ at the end of fermentation. After 48âh, accumulated formate was remarkably consumed by coâcultured methanogens, accompanied by significantly increased acetate, COâ and pH, and decreased lactate and malate. Xylose utilization, in both cultures, was similar during fermentation. However, the relative flux of carbon in hydrogenosomes in the coâculture was higher than that in the monoculture. In conclusion, the coâculture with methanogens enhanced âenergy yieldsâ of anaerobic fungi by removing the accumulated formate, decreased the metabolism in cytosol, for example, the lactate pathway, and increased the metabolism in hydrogenosomes, for example, the acetate pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aanaerobes 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoculture 3acytosol 3aenergy 3aethanol 3afermentation 3aformates 3afungi 3ahydrogen 3alactic acid 3alignocellulose 3amalates 3amethane 3amethanogens 3apH 3axylose1 aJin, Wei1 aMu, Chunlong1 aCheng, Yanfen1 aZhu, Weiyun0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2017 Nov., v. 57, no. 11 p.933-940dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2017001323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245008400170520080900254592002801063650001501091650001601106650001301122650001301135650001301148650000901161650001901170650001501189650001001204653003401214653002301248653002001271653001801291700001801309700001901327700001501346700001801361700005601379773009101435856009001526852000901616655001201625IND60676785820221119203202.0191231e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067678582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2019.1056982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Qunfu10aGradient nanocomposite with metastructure design for broadband radar absorption  aAbsorbers with gradient or stepwise gradient design have been demonstrated to be very beneficial for broadband radar absorption.

In this study, metastructure design is introduced to a stepwise gradient nanocomposite containing flaky carbonyl iron power (FCIP) and graphene nanosheet (GNS) as fillers, in order to obtain a thin and ultra-broadband radar absorber. The matrix of the nanocomposite is hybrid of cyanate ester (CE) and Bisphenol-A based epoxy (E51). The absorption band of the fabricated 5Â mm thick nanocomposite covers the full measured frequency band (2â18Â GHz, 26.5â40Â GHz) below â10Â dB, except for the range of 5.7â7.6Â GHz (below â9dB).  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abisphenol A 3acyanates 3aepoxides 3agraphene 3airon 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3aradar 0aRadar absorbing nanocomposite 0aBroadband absorber 0aGradient medium 0aMetastructure1 aYang, Xuezhao1 aLei, Hongshuai1 aLiu, Yayun1 aHuang, Yixing1 aChen, Mingji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4337-95190 tComposites.g2020 Feb., v. 129 p.105698-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2019.1056983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100001700154245009900171300001800270520123600288592002801524650002401552650002801576650001101604650001801615650001901633650001901652650001601671650002801687650001901715650002101734650000901755650001401764650001501778650001301793650001201806650002801818650002801846650002701874650001901901650004101920650003301961700001901994700001802013773012702031856003802158852000902196655001202205IND4468441420221122055358.0200220e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446844142DNAL7 a215203952pmid7 a10.1002/ps.21802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Sha Sha10aInsecticidal compounds from the essential oil of Chinese medicinal herb Atractylodes chinensis  ap. 1253-1257.  aBACKGROUND: In a screening programme for new agrochemicals from Chinese medicinal herbs, the essential oil of Atractylodes chinensis (DC.) Koidz was found to possess strong insecticidal activity against the common vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster L. The essential oil was extracted via hydrodistillation, and its constituents were determined by GCâMS analysis. RESULTS: The main components of A. chinensis essential oil were Î²âeudesmol (21.05%), Î²âselinene (11.75%), Î³âelemene (7.16%) and isopetasam (5.36%). Bioactivityâdirected chromatographic separation on repeated silica gel columns led to the isolation of five compounds, namely atractylon, Î±âelemol, Î²âeudesmol, hinesol and Î²âselinene. Î²âSelinene, Î±âelemol and hinesol showed pronounced contact toxicity against D. melanogaster adults, with LD50 values of 0.55, 0.65 and 0.71 Âµg adultâ1 respectively. Atractylon and Î²âeudesmol were also toxic to the fruit flies (LD50 = 1.63 and 2.65 Âµg adultâ1 respectively), while the crude oil had an LD50 value of 2.44 Âµg adultâ1. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that the essential oil of Atractylodes chinensis and its active constituents may be explored as natural potential insecticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtractylodes lancea 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aadults 3aagrochemicals 3achromatography 3aessential oils 3afruit flies 3ainsecticidal properties 3alethal dose 50 3amedicinal plants 3aoils 3ascreening 3asilica gel 3avinegars 2aAnimals 2aAtractylodesxchemistry 2aDrosophila melanogaster 2aInsecticidesxanalysis 2aLethal Dose 50 2aOils, Volatilexchemistryxtoxicity. 2aPlants, Medicinalxchemistry1 aJiang, Guo Hua1 aLiu, Zhi Long0 tPest management science.g2011 Oct., v. 67, no. 10 p.1253-1257dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.2180  aDNAL 7aarticle03739naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003400113040001800147100002300165245014800188300001600336520138400352592002801736650001301764650001801777650001901795650000901814650001501823650001401838650001401852650001301866650001001879650001801889650001901907650002501926650001601951650001801967650001501985650002202000650002002022650005802042650001102100650001202111650001402123650003902137650004502176650001402221650003702235650005402272650001102326650006702337650002402404650002302428650003302451650004602484650002502530650002702555653002102582653003102603653002802634653002402662700002202686700002102708700002002729700002902749700001802778773010702796856008102903852000902984655001202993IND60112531220221120221424.0190405e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011253122DNAL7 a240105942pmid7 a10.1016/j.fm.2013.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlaiotta, Giuseppe10aEffect of chestnut extract and chestnut fiber on viability of potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains under gastrointestinal tract conditions  ap. 161-169.  aThe main challenge to probiotics, during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract, are the acidic gastric secretions of the stomach, and the bile salts released into the duodenum. The survival of the strains, in this phase, is strongly influenced by the food used for their delivery.This work is part of a project studying the development of novel food processes, based on the use of chestnuts from cultivar âCastagna di Montellaâ. In detail, the effect of indigestible chestnut fiber and of chestnut extract on the viability of selected lactic acid bacteria strains was evaluated. Among 28 cultures, twelve strains were selected, on the basis of tolerance to low pH values and bile salts, and submitted to exposition to simulated gastric or bile juice in presence of chestnut extract with or without immobilization in chestnut fiber. The presence of chestnut extract proved to play a significant role on the gastric tolerance improvement of lactobacilli. The recorded protective effect could not be simply related to the starch or reducing sugars content. RP-HPLC demonstrated that in the chestnut flour, there are one or more hydrophobic peptides or oligopeptides, which specifically offer a marked resistance to simulated gastric juice, albeit present at low concentration. These beneficial effects proved to be dependent by the cultivar used to produce the flour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea 3aLactobacillus 3aacid tolerance 3abile 3abile salts 3achestnuts 3acultivars 3aduodenum 3aflour 3agastric juice 3ahydrophobicity 3alactic acid bacteria 3anovel foods 3aoligopeptides 3aprobiotics 3aprotective effect 3areducing sugars 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3astarch 3astomach 3aviability 2aBile Acids and Saltsxpharmacology 2aDietary Fiberxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aDigestion 2aFagaceaexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGastrointestinal Tractxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aHumans 2aLactobacillusxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMicrobial Viability 2aModels, Biological 2aNutsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Extractsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPrebioticsxanalysis 2aProbioticsxmetabolism 0aChestnut extract 0aGastrointestinal tolerance 0aLactobacillus rhamnosus 0aLactobacillus casei1 aLa Gatta, Barbara1 aDi Capua, Marika1 aDi Luccia, Aldo1 aCoppola, R.q(Raffaele),1 aAponte, Maria0 tFood microbiology.g2013 Dec., v. 36, no. 2 p.161-169dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2013.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245018600160300001600346500002000362520168900382592002802071650001402099650001802113650001602131650002002147650001602167650001202183650002302195650001102218650004302229650001302272650001802285650001302303650001602316650001702332650002102349700002302370700003102393700002502424700003802449700002002487700002402507773010302531856007202634852000902706655001202715IND60572141520221121023751.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057214152DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.57372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZare Javid, Ahmad14aThe Impact of Resveratrol Supplementation on Blood Glucose, Insulin, Insulin Resistance, Triglyceride, and Periodontal Markers in Type 2 Diabetic Patients with Chronic Periodontitis  ap. 108-114.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the impact of resveratrol supplementation along with nonâsurgical periodontal treatment on blood glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, triglyceride (TG), and periodontal markers in patients with type 2 diabetes with periodontal disease. In this doubleâblind clinical trial study, 43 patients with diabetes with chronic periodontitis were participated. Subjects were randomly allocated to intervention and control groups. The intervention and control groups received either 480âmg/day of resveratrol or placebo capsules (two pills) for 4âweeks. Fasting blood glucose, insulin, insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), TGs, and pocket depth were measured in all subjects' preâintervention and postâintervention. The mean serum levels of fasting insulin and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) were significantly lower in the intervention group compared with control group (10.42âÂ±â0.28 and 10.92âÂ±â0.9; 3.66âÂ±â0.97 and 4.49âÂ±â1.56, respectively). There was a significant difference in the mean pocket depth between intervention and control groups (2.35âÂ±â0.6 and 3.38âÂ±â0.5, respectively) following intervention. No significant differences were observed in the mean levels of fasting blood glucose and TGs between two groups' postâintervention. It is recommended that resveratrol supplementation may be beneficial as adjuvant therapy along with nonâsurgical periodontal treatment in insulin resistance and improving periodontal status among patients with diabetes with periodontal disease.

Greenhouse gas emissions could cause a 3â6Â°C increase in mean land surface temperature at high and temperate latitudes. Despite this, few experiments have isolated the effects of temperature for this scenario on trees and forests. This review focuses on tree and forest responses at boreal and temperate latitudes, ranging from the cellular to the ecosystem level. Adaptation to varying temperatures revolves around the tradeâoff between utilizing the full growing season and minimizing frost damage through proper timing of hardening in autumn and dehardening in spring. But the evolutionary change in these traits must be sufficiently rapid to compensate for the temperature changes. Many species have a positive response to increased temperature â but how close are we to the optima? Management is critical for a positive response of forest growth to a warmer climate, and selection of the best species for the new conditions will be of vital importance. Contents Summary 369 I.

Corn alone covers about 88 million acres, valued at $63 billion of which 20 percent is exported.Â Adapting corn and soybean production to a changing climate is a critical need as yields are affected by drought and excess water. We studied the effect of tillage, rotation and cover crop on corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max) yields from 2011 to 2013. The study was conducted on a Waldron silty-loam soil at Lincoln University of Missouri's Freeman farm. Twenty four plots of each corn and soybean were established on a 4.05ha field and arranged in a 3-factor factorial design with 3 replications. The 3 factors (treatments) were tillage at two levels (no-tillage vs conventional tillage), cover crop at two levels (no-rye vs rye) and rotation at four levels (continuous corn, continuous soybean, corn/soybean and soybean/corn rotations). Corn and soybean were planted each year in June and harvested in late October. Rye (Secale cereale) was planted in 12 plots of each corn and soybean immediately after harvest. All corn and soybean plots received 26kg N, 67kg P2O5, and 67kg K2O/ha. However, the corn plots received an additional 202kg N/ha from urea. Overall, corn yield was significantly affected by year (p=0.001), but not tillage or cover crop. Soybean yield, however, was significantly affected by year (p=0.0001), tillage (p=0.0218) and cover crop (p=0.0531). In addition, on year per year basis, corn yield was significantly affected by tillage in 2011 while soybean yield was significantly affected by tillage and cover crop in 2011 and 2012 (p<0.05). These results suggest that cover crop may have an impact on soybean yield. The study is still being conducted for two more years and will hopefully provide more light on the effects of soil/crop management practices on the yields of corn and soybean in this silt loam soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aSecale cereale 3aZea mays 3aclimate change 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3acover crops 3acrop management 3acrop yield 3adrought 3afarms 3ano-tillage 3aplanting 3arye 3asilt loam soils 3asoybeans 3aurea 3aMissouri 0aTillage 0acover crop 0acorn 0asoybean 0ayield1 aHaruna, Samuel I.0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2015, v. 29 p.15-16dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2015.07.1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003200132024002200164024001900186024001100205040001800216100002300234245006400257300001700321506007600338506017300414520138100587592002801968506003701996650001002033650001602043650001802059650000802077650001402085650001002099650001402109650001302123650002202136650001002158653001702168653001502185653001402200653001702214700002202231700002202253700002202275700002002297700002402317773010002341856011202441856007802553956008602631961001302717852000902730655001202739IND50073696820221214223446.0150620e20140307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007369682DNAL7 a2947562aris7 a10113/585632hdl7 a10.1098/rspb.2013.30062doi7 aPMC39069472pmcid7 a244520282pmid8 ans4217  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPauli, Jonathan N.12aA syndrome of mutualism reinforces the lifestyle of a sloth  ap. 20133006.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aArboreal herbivory is rare among mammals. The few species with this lifestyle possess unique adaptions to overcome size-related constraints on nutritional energetics. Sloths are folivores that spend most of their time resting or eating in the forest canopy. A three-toed sloth will, however, descend its tree weekly to defecate, which is risky, energetically costly and, until now, inexplicable. We hypothesized that this behaviour sustains an ecosystem in the fur of sloths, which confers cryptic nutritional benefits to sloths. We found that the more specialized three-toed sloths harboured more phoretic moths, greater concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and higher algal biomass than the generalist two-toed sloths. Moth density was positively related to inorganic nitrogen concentration and algal biomass in the fur. We discovered that sloths consumed algae from their fur, which was highly digestible and lipid-rich. By descending a tree to defecate, sloths transport moths to their oviposition sites in sloth dung, which facilitates moth colonization of sloth fur. Moths are portals for nutrients, increasing nitrogen levels in sloth fur, which fuels algal growth. Sloths consume these algae-gardens, presumably to augment their limited diet. These linked mutualisms between moths, sloths and algae appear to aid the sloth in overcoming a highly constrained lifestyle.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afeces 3afertilizers 3aforest litter 3afur 3alifestyle 3amoths 3amutualism 3anitrogen 3aoviposition sites 3atrees 0acommensalism 0aCosta Rica 0aCryptoses 0aTrichophilus1 aMendoza, Jorge E.1 aSteffan, Shawn A.1 aCarey, Cayelan C.1 aWeimer, Paul J.1 aPeery, M.

The latter studies were done using barley lines high and low in Stomatal frequency from two backcross populations. Heritabilities, estimated by the parent-progeny regression method, ranged from 22 to 74%. These estimates were for the Fâ and Fâ generations on the individual plant basis. Realized hei it abilities based on simulated high and low selection were in good agreement with the regression estimates, although the estimates were consistently higher for the high than for the low selection. For plants pretreated to assure open stomata, Stomatal diffusive resistances and transpiration rates differed statistically among lines, but photosynthesis did not. Lines having low Stomatal frequencies had higher Stomatal resistances, and transpired less water than lines with more stomata. A 25% decrease in frequency of stomata reduced transpiration rates by about 24%. Stomatal frequency did not influence the rate of photosynthesis, however. Hence, the possibility exists of altering transpiration without altering photosynthesis by selecting varieties with fewer stomata.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3afield crops 3aplant genetics 3aplant breeding1 aRasmusson, Donald C.1 aMoss, Dale N.0 tCrop science.g1972 Nov., v. 12, no. 6 p.780-783dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1972.0011183X001200060019x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02611naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013400168300001400302520108100316592002801397650001201425650001301437650001701450650001701467650001901484650002301503650000901526650001201535650002401547650002401571650001401595650002301609650001501632650001101647650001101658653003501669653003901704653003401743653002001777653002201797653001901819700001601838700002401854700002201878773011301900856008302013852000902096655001202105IND60544611420221119153802.0190417e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054461142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2013.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJongberg, Sisse10aEffect of high-oxygen atmosphere packaging on oxidative stability and sensory quality of two chicken muscles during chill storage  ap. 38-48.  aThe oxidative stability and sensory quality of chicken breast (m. pectoralis) and thigh (m. peroneus longus) stored in high-oxygen modified atmosphere (MAP-O2), non-oxygen modified atmosphere (MAP-N2), or vacuum for up to 9 days at 5Â°C were investigated. Protein thiol concentration in breasts and thighs decreased significantly between 5 and 9 days storage in MAP-O2 compared to non-oxygen storage, and resulted in myosin heavy chain disulfide cross-links. Thiol loss and protein cross-link formation were more pronounced in thighs compared to breasts, and a similar tendency was seen for the formation of secondary lipid oxidation products. However, while breast stored in MAP-O2 clearly scored lower in tenderness and higher in rancidity compared to breast in non-oxygen storage, the effect of MAP-O2 for the sensory quality of thigh was negligible. These results show that thigh is more suitable for storage in MAP-O2 than breast, indicating that the negative effect MAP-O2 may have on the oxidative stability and sensory quality of meat varies between different muscles.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreasts 3achickens 3acold storage 3acrosslinking 3afood packaging 3alipid peroxidation 3ameat 3amuscles 3amyosin heavy chains 3aoxidative stability 3arancidity 3asensory properties 3ashelf life 3athighs 3athiols 0aChicken breast (m. pectoralis) 0aChicken thigh (m. peroneus longus) 0aModified atmosphere packaging 0aLipid oxidation 0aProtein oxidation 0aEating quality1 aWen, Jinzhu1 aTÃ¸rngren, Mari Ann1 aLund, Marianne N.0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2014 Mar., v. 1, no. 1 p.38-48dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2013.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03873naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009400169300001300263520161800276592002801894650002601922650004201948650002501990650001302015650001002028650002002038650001602058650001702074650001002091650001902101650002602120650003302146650001802179650001302197650001302210650001202223653000602235653001002241653001002251653001002261653000802271653000802279653001402287653000702301653001002308653001002318653000702328653000802335653000702343653000902350653001102359653000802370653000802378653000702386653000802393653000802401653000902409653000802418653000702426653000802433653000802441653000702449653000802456653000702464653001302471653002602484653004002510653002002550653003102570653004202601700001902643700005802662700005602720700001802776773012002794856008402914852000902998655001203007IND60628407120221120055520.0190325e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062840712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2019.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRendina, Nunzia10aChitosan-elicited defense responses in Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-infected tomato plants  ap. 9-17.  aThe control of plant diseases by inducing plant resistance responses represents an interesting solution to avoid yield losses and protect the natural environment. Hence, the intertwined relationships between host, pathogen and inducer are increasingly subject of investigations. Here, we report the efficacy of chitosan-elicited defense responses in Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme plants against Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Chitosan was applied via foliar spray before the CMV inoculation to verify its effectiveness as a preventive treatment against the viral infection. Virus accumulation, photosynthetic performance, as well as genes encoding for proteins affecting resistance responses and biosynthetic pathways, were investigated. It was observed a significant reduction of CMV accumulation in chitosan-treated plants that were successively infected with CMV, compared to only CMV-infected ones (up to 100%). Similarly, a positive effect of chitosan on gas exchange dynamics was revealed. The analysis of gene expression (CEVI-1, NPR1, PSY2 and PAL5) suggested the occurrence of chitosan-induced, systemic acquired resistance-related responses associated with a readjustment of the plantâs oxidative status. In addition, the absence of deleterious symptoms in chitosan-treated successively CMV-infected plants, confirmed that chitosan can be used as a powerful control agent. Our data indicate that chitosan, when preventively applied, is able to elicit defense responses in tomato to control CMV infection. Such finding may be recommended to protect the tomato fruit yields as well as other crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme 3abiochemical pathways 3achitosan 3acrops 3afoliar spraying 3afruit yield 3agas exchange 3agenes 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant disease control 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3aproteins 3atomatoes 3aviruses 0aA 0aANOVA 0aAR156 0aCERK1 0aCHT 0aCMV 0aDAS-ELISA 0aET 0aFv/Fm 0aGAPDH 0ags 0aISR 0aJA 0aNPR1 0aÎ¦PSII 0aPAL 0aPAR 0aPR 0aPSY 0aPVX 0aqPCR 0aROS 0aSA 0aSAR 0aTMV 0aTP 0aTUB 0aUK 0aChitosan 0aCucumber mosaic virus 0aDefense/antioxidant-related protein 0aDisease control 0aPhotosynthetic performance 0aSolanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme1 aNuzzaci, Maria1 aScopa, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8610-33231 aCuypers, Ann1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0171-02451 aSofo, Adriano0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2019 Mar.,  Apr., v. 234-235 p.9-17dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2019.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245011700156300001600273520193900289592002802228650002302256650000902279650002502288650001902313650002102332650001202353650001802365650001302383650002002396650001302416650002302429650001102452650001802463650002402481650001002505651001502515653001902530653001402549653001702563653001802580653002202598700002102620700002502641773008802666856007102754852000902825655001202834IND60523513420221119072405.0160623s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052351342DNAL7 a10.1071/RJ151032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroad, Kiri C.10aUse of business analysis in beef businesses to direct management practice change for climate adaptation outcomes  ap. 273-282.  aBeef businesses in northern Australia are facing increased pressure to be productive and profitable with challenges such as climate variability and poor financial performance over the past decade. Declining terms of trade, limited recent gains in on-farm productivity, low profit margins under current management systems and current climatic conditions will leave little capacity for businesses to absorb climate change-induced losses. In order to generate a whole-of-business focus towards management change, the Climate Clever Beef project in the Maranoa-Balonne region of Queensland trialled the use of business analysis with beef producers to improve financial literacy, provide a greater understanding of current business performance and initiate changes to current management practices. Demonstration properties were engaged and a systematic approach was used to assess current business performance, evaluate impacts of management changes on the business and to trial practices and promote successful outcomes to the wider industry. Focus was concentrated on improving financial literacy skills, understanding the businessâ key performance indicators and modifying practices to improve both business productivity and profitability. To best achieve the desired outcomes, several extension models were employed: the âgroup facilitation/empowerment modelâ, the âindividual consultant/mentor modelâ and the âtechnology development modelâ. Providing producers with a whole-of-business approach and using business analysis in conjunction with on-farm trials and various extension methods proved to be a successful way to encourage producers in the region to adopt new practices into their business, in the areas of greatest impact. The areas targeted for development within businesses generally led to improvements in animal performance and grazing land management further improving the prospects for climate resilience.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal performance 3abeef 3abusiness enterprises 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3afinance 3agrazing lands 3aindustry 3aland management 3aliteracy 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3aprofitability 3aprofits and margins 3atrade 3aQueensland 0aclimate change 0aextension 0aproductivity 0aprofitability 0awhole-of-business1 aSneath, Roger J.1 aEmery, Timothy M.

HUW234. The donor was the CIMMYT breeding line PMBWIR4, and each of the target genes was marked by a simple PCR assay. A three step screening strategy was adopted: the first screen comprised foreground selection, the second used markers lying close to the introgression borders to reduce the extent of linkage drag, and the last was background selection based on 149 informative microsatellite assays. Based on the background selection outcomes, at the BC1F1 generation the proportion of the genome fixed for cv. HUW234 alleles ranged from 55% to 67%. Three BC1F1 individuals were crossed a second time with cv. HUW234, resulting in the identification of six BC2F3 families carrying all three target Sr genes; the proportion of their genome inherited from cv. HUW234 ranged from 86% to 92%. BC2F4 and BC2F5 material was planted at three different locations under both disease-free and artificially induced epiphytotic conditions. Compared to recurrent parent, the improved versions of cv. HUW234 displayed significantly superior resistance to stem rust, and their agronomic performance was as good as, or even marginally better than that of the source cultivar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuccinia graminis 3aagronomic traits 3aalleles 3abackcrossing 3acultivars 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aintrogression 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplant biology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3astem rust 3astrontium 3awheat 0aMolecular breeding 0aBackground selection 0aForeground selection 0aRust resistance1 aMishra, V.K.1 aArun, B.1 aChand, R.1 aVishwakarma, M.K.1 aVasistha, N.K.1 aMishra, A.N.1 aKalappanavar, I.K.1 aJoshi, Arun K.0 tCurrent plant biology.g2015 May, v. 2 p.25-33dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23302x2214-66287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpb.2015.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03692naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009900167500001900266520253700285592002802822650001702850650001902867650001002886650001402896650002102910650002402931650001602955650001502971651001002986653001802996653002503014653001803039653002503057700001903082773011203101856008403213852000903297655001203306IND60730560520221119070037.0210603e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073056052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e015332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Ruoyan10aDistribution patterns and influencing factors of different parasitic angiosperm types in China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aParasitic plants are widely distributed in major biomes. They can be categorized into root parasites and stem parasites in terms of parasitic sites or divided into hemiparasites and holoparasites according to the degree of nutritional dependence on their hosts via haustoria. However, little is known concerning distribution patterns of different parasitic plant types and their determinants, which may be helpful for effective management and ecological conservation. Here, we collated an updated checklist of parasitic angiosperms in China and examined the distribution pattern of the four types, and then performed multiple linear regression analysis and redundancy analysis of 22 influencing factors representing biotic, topographic, and climatic factors. There are 745 species of parasitic angiosperms in China, belonging to 50 genera and 12 families. Regarding root parasites, most appeared in the west of China than in the east; while stem parasites showed a broader north-south divide in distribution. Hemiparasites were fewer in the east and more in the southwest. However, holoparasites displayed a patchy distribution across China. The results of redundancy analysis (after eliminating multicollinearity effects) showed that explained variation of root parasites, stem parasites, and hemiparasites was 87.9%, 93.7%, and 87.0%, respectively; while that of holoparasites was only 57.8%. Therefore, the four types of parasitic angiosperms varied quite distinctly in terms of distribution patterns across China. Seed plant richness was one of the common leading factors affecting distributions of root parasites, stem parasites, and hemiparasites in China. Besides, the other major influencing factors were the maximum temperature of the warmest month (Bio5), temperature seasonality (Bio4) and precipitation of the warmest quarter (Bio18), and isothermality (Bio3), respectively. Additionally, the main factor affecting holoparasitesâ distribution was the temperature (Bio3). We found that different parasitic angiosperm types in China were mainly affected by the biotic factor, temperature, and precipitation. In addition, the whole flora of parasites was similar to root parasites and hemiparasites in distribution; nevertheless, its leading factors were the same as those of hemiparasites. Our findings reveal the various responses of different parasitic angiosperm types to the environmental changes across China.

Behavior, activity, body temperature, and Iodineâ131 uptake by the thyroid gland were studied from Jan. 23 to Feb. 27, 1964. Parietalectomy had no detectable effect on any of the parameters investigated. Home ranges of adult male and female lizards were measured, and defensive and antagonistic behavior was noted. The home ranbges of males often encompassed those of several females. Most adults arose and retired with the sun, and sharply reduced exposure to sunlight at midday. At night, lizards buried themselves in soil and leafâlitter, and the same bed sites were often regularly used. Individuals injected with Iodineâ131 were located at night with a scintillation counter. Active lizards had body temperatures averaging 34 to 35Â°C (range 22.6 to 39.0Â°C), which showed a biâmodal distribution. Cloud cover was a significant factor in body temperature fluctuations. Sexual dimorphism, both in color and in size of adults, was marked. Females had red "cheek" patches and were smaller than males.Most males had sperm in their sperm ducts and some females contained largeâshelled oviducal eggs. Mating males seized females with their jaws, and sometimes carried them some distance before attempting copulation. Posturing and perhaps the odor of refractory females discouraged males. The lizards were found to be insectivorous, but some plant material was also eaten. One small gecko (Phyllodactylus galapagoensis) was recovered from stomach contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody temperature 3aburied soils 3acloud cover 3acolor 3acopulation 3aeggs 3aeyes 3afemales 3afield experimentation 3ahome range 3ainsectivores 3ajaws 3alizards 3amales 3aodors 3asexual dimorphism 3aspermatozoa 3astomach 3atemperate zones 3athyroid gland 3aGalapagos Islands1 aLowenstein, Jerold M.1 aCohen, Nathan W.0 tEcology.g1967 Sept., v. 48, no. 5 p.839-851dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19337423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013900174520212100313592002802434650002302462650001702485650002202502650001602524650001902540650002402559650000902583650002002592650001402612650001502626650001102641653003502652653002602687653002302713653002402736653002002760700001902780700002102799773010102820856008502921852000903006655001203015IND60758218420221122031302.0220124e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075821842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2021.1047942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMbuthia, Jackson M.12aA review of methods for improving resolution of milk production data and weather information for measuring heat stress in dairy cattle  aGenetic selection for heat tolerance is a sustainable strategy to support mitigation of the adverse effects of heat stress that may be achieved through housing and feeding modification in livestock. To identify and select heat tolerant animals, it is necessary to have high temporal resolution animal performance records and high spatio-temporal resolution weather information. The temporal resolution being the amount of time detail in terms of sampling frequency and the spatial resolution the amount of space area i.e. area covered and how detailed an observation is. This review highlights some approaches to improve the resolution of data necessary for evaluating heat stress in dairy cattle. Because heat stress occurs only periodically, mainly during summer, information from monthly test-day milk records only is limited in phenotypic data. The use of only test-day records over time captures a small fraction of the response due to heat stress. It is expected that daily milk production records would allow for better estimation of heat stress effects. In regions where data from weather stations are scarce or lacking, grid interpolated weather data may improve accuracy of prediction. This is because grid interpolation enables creation of reliable virtual weather stations that can provide complete and long-term weather data. However, studies are lacking to compare the agreement of measured weather data and grid interpolated data to assess the effects of heat stress in livestock. To evaluate the performance of animals under various climatic conditions, environmental parameters are applied either individually or augmented into an index and merged with production records. Although there are many indices defined in literature, most have not been applied in genetic evaluation studies and grid interpolated indices have not been developed for use in livestock studies. This review highlights approaches to contribute to improved temporal resolution of performance records as well as spatial and temporal resolution of weather data necessary for improvement of heat stress evaluation in dairy cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal performance 3adairy cattle 3agenetic selection 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ameteorological data 3amilk 3amilk production 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3asummer 0aGrid interpolated weather data 0aHeat stress indicator 0aSpatial resolution 0aTemporal resolution 0aThermal indices1 aMayer, Manfred1 aReinsch, Norbert0 tLivestock science.g2022 Jan., v. 255 p.104794-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2021.1047943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245007700175300001900252520139500271592002801666650001701694650001501711650001601726650001301742650000801755650001301763650001401776650003101790650001601821650001201837650002101849650002201870700002501892700001801917773009901935856008802034990002302122852000902145655001202154IND60098579920221119085413.0141104e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009857992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJefferys, Amanda14aThe management of retrograde ejaculation: a systematic review and update  ap. 306-312.e6.  aOBJECTIVE: To determine the best management of retrograde ejaculation to optimize the chance of conception. DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING: Tertiary reproductive medicine center. PATIENT(S): Subfertile men with retrograde ejaculation. METHOD(S): Systematic search of studies using search terms âmanagementâ or âtherapyâ or âtreatmentâ and âretrograde ejaculation.â We excluded case reports and papers not in English. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Pregnancy and live birth rates and rates of achievement of antegrade ejaculation. RESULT(S): Thirty-four studies met our criteria. Studies were mostly observational. Descriptions of predictive and confounding variables were often insufficient. The treatment options included urinary sperm retrieval and medical management with anticholinergics and sympathomimetics. Successful pregnancies and live births were also achieved using surgical techniques and electroejaculation; however, numbers were small. CONCLUSION(S): Many treatment options exist in the management of retrograde ejaculation; however, current literature is insufficient to allow firm comparisons between interventions. Treatment should be tailored, therefore, to the individual. Our findings support the need for further research in this areaâincluding large randomized controlled trials. However, these would be difficult logistically and may not be possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aconception 3aejaculation 3amedicine 3amen 3apatients 3apregnancy 3arandomized clinical trials 3aspermatozoa 3asurgery 3asympathomimetics 3asystematic review1 aSiassakos, Dimitrios1 aWardle, Peter0 tFertility and sterility.g2012 Feb., v. 97, no. 2 p.306-312.e6dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.11.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010900171300001400280520143700294592002801731650002201759650002701781650001201808650001701820650001501837650001101852650002401863650002801887650002801915650002801943650001801971650001601989650002302005650001602028650001702044650001902061650002302080650002002103650001102123650001202134650002902146653003302175653002402208653001802232653003602250653003402286653001802320700002002338700002302358700002302381700002402404700002402428773012102452856008402573852000902657655001202666IND60628407320221120065833.0190325e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062840732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2019.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoleimani, Maryam10aEnergy saving and improvement of metabolism of cultured tobacco cells upon exposure to 2-D clinorotation  ap. 36-43.  aStudies have confirmed that on the ground, the plant cells must expend energy to maintain positional homeostasis against gravity. Under microgravity conditions, such energy may be saved for other process such as biosynthesis of beneficial metabolites for growth. This hypothesis was examined on a cell line of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Burley 21). The cells were continuously treated with 2-D clinostat for 1 week. Exposure to clinorotation conditions increased biomass and total protein. Total content of soluble sugar also increased which may provide more precursors for Krebs cycle and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. In the case of 2-D clinorotation, the expression and activity of glutamate producing enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) increased, whereas the activity of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) decreased. Regarding the role of GAD in initiation of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) shunt, it is plausible that under clinorotation condition, the tobacco cells directed their metabolism toward saving energy for Krebs cycling and more production of ATP rather than shifting to side paths such as GABA shunt.Improvement of radical scavenging enzymes activity and increase of the contents of phenolic compounds and certain peroxide neutralizing amino acids, e.g., His, Pro, Ser, and Asp under clinorotation conditions decreased membrane lipid peroxidation and maintained the growth potential of tobacco cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3acell lines 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aglutamate decarboxylase 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3aglutamic acid 3ahomeostasis 3alipid peroxidation 3ametabolites 3amicrogravity 3aneutralization 3aphenolic compounds 3aprotein content 3asugars 3atobacco 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0aAdenosine triphosphate (ATP) 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aClinorotation 0aGamma amino butyric acid (GABA) 0aGlutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) 0aTobacco cells1 aGhanati, Faezeh1 aHajebrahimi, Zahra1 aHajnorouzi, Abazar1 aAbdolmaleki, Parviz1 aZarinkamar, Fatemeh0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2019 Mar.,  Apr., v. 234-235 p.36-43dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2019.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012900171300001600300520135500316592002801671650001601699650002201715650001301737650001101750650001101761650002101772650001301793650001401806650002801820650001101848650001901859650001501878650001801893650003401911650002001945650002101965700001601986700001802002700001702020700003202037773008602069856008502155852000902240655001202249IND60559498920221117205803.0190425e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055949892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.05.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamezanzadeh, B.10aCovalently-grafted graphene oxide nanosheets to improve barrier and corrosion protection properties of polyurethane coatings  ap. 555-573.  aSurface modification of graphene oxide (GO) has been performed by grafting of polyisocyanate (PI) resin. Results obtained from X-ray photo electron spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the PI resin chains were successfully attached onto the surface of GO nanosheets through covalent bonding with hydroxyl and carboxylic groups leading to amides and carbamate esters bonds formation. Subsequently, the PI functionalized GO sheets were incorporated into the polyurethane (PU) matrix. The X-ray diffraction analysis showed that surface modification of GO nanosheets with PI enhanced the level of exfoliation of PIâGO in the PU matrix. Scanning electron microscope analysis showed the enhanced interaction between GO and PU matrix after functionalization by PI resin. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and salt spray tests were performed to reveal the effects of addition of 0.1wt.% GO and PIâGO nanosheets on the corrosion protection properties of the PU coating. Also, the adhesion loss of the coatings was obtained by pull-off adhesion test after 30days immersion in 3.5wt.% NaCl solution. It was found that incorporation of 0.1wt.% surface modified GO nanosheets into the PU matrix resulted in significant improvement of the coating corrosion protection properties and ionic resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadhesion 3aamides 3acarbon 3achemical bonding 3acoatings 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aesters 3agraphene oxide 3ananosheets 3apolyurethanes 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asodium chloride 3athermogravimetry1 aGhasemi, E.1 aMahdavian, M.1 aChangizi, E.1 aMohamadzadeh Moghadam, M.H.0 tCarbon.g2015 Nov., v. 93 p.555-573dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.05.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245012700194300001600321520157100337592002801908650002301936650002701959650002201986650001602008650001102024650002202035650001402057650001102071650002402082650001202106650001802118650002302136650002302159650002102182650002602203650002602229650002002255650002002275650002802295650002402323650001402347650004202361650004202403650002802445650002302473650002702496700002002523700001802543700001702561773009502578856004802673852000902721655001202730IND50061643320221122014329.0130319e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006164332DNAL7 a228253942pmid7 a10.1007/s10126-012-9474-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohyama, T.q(Takashi),10aIdentification of Two Penelope-Like Elements with Different Structures and Chromosome Localization in Kuruma Shrimp Genome  ap. 115-123.  aPenelope, originally found as a key element responsible for the hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis, has been widely conserved throughout eukaryotic genomes. In other organisms, they are often referred to as Penelope-like elements or PLEs. In this study, we found two types of PLEs, designated MjPLE01 and MjPLE02, from kuruma shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus. There was no observed nucleotide similarity between MjPLE01 and 02, and both elements differed from each other in terms of their structure; MjPLE02 has a distinctive endonuclease (EN) domain at the C-terminus while MjPLE01 do not. A phylogenetic tree that includes publicly available PLEs and TERTs showed that MjPLE01 and 02 were closely related to Coprina elements, which have been reported as an EN-deficient PLE, and to PenelopeâPoseidon group, which possess an EN domain, respectively. Genomic Southern blot analysis using MjPLE01 as a probe showed several multiple bands that differ among individual shrimps. On the other hand, two major identical bands were observed when MjPLE02 was used. Colony hybridization showed co-localization of MjPLE01 and GGTTA repeats, suggesting that MjPLE01 might be prevalent in subtelomeric regions of kuruma shrimp genome. These results suggest that the kuruma shrimp genome has at least two types of PLEs with different domain compositions, phylogenetic positions, and probably chromosomeal localization. Such distinctive types of PLEs in an organism have never been described and hence could be a potential source to understand how multiple PLE types evolved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila virilis 3aMarsupenaeus japonicus 3aSouthern blotting 3achromosomes 3agenome 3ahybrid dysgenesis 3aphylogeny 3ashrimp 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCluster Analysis 2aComputational Biology 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aGene Components 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPenaeidaexgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aProtein Structure, Tertiaryxgenetics 2aRNA-Directed DNA Polymerasexgenetics 2aRetroelementsxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aKondo, Hidehiro1 aAoki, Takashi1 aHirono, Ikuo0 tMarine biotechnology.g2013 Feb., v. 15, no. 1 p.115-123dSpringer-Verlagx1436-22287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-012-9474-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245009000164520146300254592002801717650001201745650001701757650001701774650002201791650001601813650001301829650001701842650002101859650001501880650004301895650001301938650001001951650001301961650002401974650001901998650001102017650001202028650001102040650001002051650002102061650001602082650001802098650001702116651001302133700002502146700001802171700002002189700002602209773011902235856007202354852000902426655001202435IND60648818720221119033728.0190701e20180116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064881872DNAL7 a10.3390/f90100362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSommeechai, Montathip10aEcological Structure of a Tropical Urban Forest in the Bang Kachao Peninsula, Bangkok  aRapid urbanization has changed the structure and function of natural ecosystems, especially floodplain ecosystems in SE Asia. The ecological structure of vegetation stands and the usefulness of satellite images was investigated to characterize a disturbed tropical urban forest located in the Chao Phraya River lower floodplain, Thailand. Nine sample plots were established on the Bang Kachao Peninsula (BKP) within 4 tropical forest types in an urban area: rehabilitation forest, home-garden agroforestry, mangrove and park. The tree habitats were beach forest, swamp forest, moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest, mangrove forest and abandoned orchard or home-garden. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values obtained from Landsat 7 satellite images were correlated with plant structure from field surveys. NDVI had the highest relationship with stand factors for number of families, number of species, Shannon-Weiner index and total basal area. Linear regression predicted well the correlation between NDVI and stand factors for families and basal area. NDVI trends reflected urban tropical forest typing and biodiversity, being high in rehabilitation and mangrove forests, moderate in home-gardens and low in parks. We suggest that the application of NDVI for assessments can be useful for future planning, monitoring and management of the BKP and hence may contribute for increasing biodiversity and complexity of these urban forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aagroforestry 3abiodiversity 3aevergreen forests 3afloodplains 3ahabitats 3ahome gardens 3amangrove forests 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aorchards 3aparks 3aplanning 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asurveys 3aswamps 3atrees 3atropical forests 3aurban areas 3aurban forests 3aurbanization 3aThailand1 aWachrinrat, Chongrak1 aDell, Bernard1 aThangtam, Nipon1 aSrichaichana, Jamroon0 tForests.g2018 Jan. 16, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90100363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245006600155300001600221500001100237520144400248592002801692650002601720650002101746650001001767650002501777650001301802650002201815650001301837650002501850700001901875700001601894700001901910700002101929700001401950700003101964700002601995700001502021700001702036700001702053700001602070700001802086700002702104700001802131700001802149700003502167773010302202856007202305852000902377655001202386IND60572141820221120221811.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057214182DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.57512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTariq, Akash12aA systematic review on ethnomedicines of antiâcancer plants  ap. 202-264.  aREVIEW  aCancer is a serious health problem and the second leading cause of death around the globe. Present review is an attempt to provide utmost information based on ethnoâpharmacological and toxicological aspects of antiâcancer plants of the world. A total of 276 articles published in English journals and containing maximum ethnomedicinal information were reviewed using several data sources such as; Google scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and floras of different countries. A total of 199 antiâcancer plants were recorded in present review and results indicated that traditional medicines are mostly being use in developing countries for cancer treatment. Traditionally and scientifically skin and breast cancer types gained more focus. Seventy plants were reportedly analyzed for inâvitro activities while 32 plants were having inâvivo reports. Twenty nine pure compounds (mostly phenolic) were reportedly isolated from antiâcancer plants and tested against different cancer cell lines. Inspite having better efficiency of ethnomedicines as compared to synthetic drugs, several plants have also shown toxic effects on living system. Therefore, we invite researchers attention to carry out detailed ethnoâpharmacological and toxicological studies on unâexplored antiâcancer plants in order to provide reliable knowledge to the patients and develop novel antiâcancer drugs.

Life cycle WFs including blue, green and gray water were evaluated for the selected fuel pathways. Geographical differences of water requirements were revealed to be different by locations. The results indicated that water irrigation requirements were significantly different from crop to crop, ranging from 2â293, 78â137, and 17â621 mÂ³/ha, for sweet sorghum, cassava, and Jatropha curcas L., respectively. Four biofuel pathways were selected on this basis to analyze the life cycle WF: cassava based bioethanol in Guangxi, sweet sorghum based bioethanol in Northeast China, Jatropha curcal L. based biodiesel in Yunnan and microalgae based biodiesel in Hainan. The life cycle WFs of bioethanol from cassava and sweet sorghum were 3708, and 17â156 mÂ³ per ton of bioethanol, respectively, whereas for biodiesel produced from Jatropha curcas L. and microalgae, they were 5787, and 31â361 mÂ³ per ton of biodiesel, respectively. The crop growing stage was the main contributor to the whole life cycle of each pathway. Compared to blue and green water, gray water was significant due to the use of fertilizer during the growing of biomass. From the perspective of the WF, cassava based bioethanol in Guangxi and Jatropha based biodiesel in Yunnan were suitable for promotion, whereas the promotion for microalage based biodiesel in Hainan required improvement on technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha curcas 3abiodiesel 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3acassava 3aclimate 3afertilizers 3ageographical variation 3airrigation requirement 3amicroalgae 3asweet sorghum 3awastewater 3awater footprint 3aChina1 aXie, Xiaomin1 aHuang, Zhen0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 48, no. 7 p.4137-4144dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes404458j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001500169245012600184300001800310520114400328592002801472650002401500650001201524650002301536650002101559650002301580650001301603650001601616700001801632700001801650773009201668856008601760852000901846655001201855IND4448728520221119155817.0141111e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444872852DNAL7 a252139872pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.12.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Wentao10aExtraction and concentration of tanshinones in Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge by task-specific non-ionic surfactant assistance  ap. 1985-1990.  aOrganic solvents were widely used for extraction of bioactive compounds from different functional foods and nutraceuticals. However, the involvement of toxic and volatile organic solvents causes significant environmental problems. In order to overcome the shortages, non-ionic surfactant-assisted extraction was proposed as an alternative, effective, cheap and green extraction method. By considering the chemical structure and stability of the target compounds, a task-specific non-ionic surfactant can be selected. The bioactive compounds were extracted from the solid matrix with subsequent concentration by cloud point extraction. This proposed method was thoroughly evaluated by extraction and then concentration of both cryptotanshinone and tanshinone I from functional food of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge. Cryptotanshinone (0.208mg/g) and tanshinone I (0.147mg/g) were extracted using Triton X-100 with concentrations of 45.7 and 40.6Î¼g/ml, respectively. Furthermore, the Triton X series surfactant exhibited potential for application towards more hydrophobic bioactive compounds containing benzene rings, such as phenolic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvia miltiorrhiza 3abenzene 3achemical structure 3afunctional foods 3aphenolic compounds 3asolvents 3asurfactants1 aTian, Minglei1 aRow, Kyung Ho0 tFood chemistry.g2011 June 15, v. 126, no. 4 p.1985-1990dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.12.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002000168245005200188300001600240500000900256520123700265592002801502650002101530650002301551650001601574700001901590773012101609852000901730856009801739655001201837991615878190742620221120221835.0191122e197211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7391346892DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1972.0011183X001200060026x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaunders, J.

Plants could be obtained from callus placed on a basal medium, but addition of naphthalene acetic acid, tyrosine, or a cytokinin either alone or in certain combinations increased efficiency. The most efficient production was accomplished on a medium composed of Blaydes' inorganic and vitamin constituents with 100 mg/liter inositol and 2.0 g/liter yeast extract. Ability of fresh callus to differentiate into plantlets depended on the hormone levels of the initial callus-inducing medium, as well as on the genotype of the donor plant. Daylength appeared not to be critical for shoot differentiation. Plants differentiated out of callus derived from immature anthers, internode sections, seedling hypocotyls, and immature ovaries. Callus was obtained from anthers which were in premeiotic to nearly mature stages. Histological studies indicated that in most cases anther callus arose from somatic cells in interlocular connective tissue. Most of the 200 plants recovered from callus were tetraploid, as was the donor plant, although at least nine octaploids and several off-type plants, including albinos, were obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3afield crops1 aBingham, E.

After infection, flies were housed at 29âÂ°C and mortality was evaluated daily until day seven. WT flies were resistant to the infection, whereas Toll-deficient flies showed inoculum-dependent mortality rates. Fungal burden, assessed by histopathological analysis and by counting the number of colony-forming units of dead flies, corroborated the results. The D. melanogaster model is a promising minihost model for future large-scale studies of virulence mechanisms and antifungal drug activity in malasseziosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aMalassezia pachydermatis 3aanimals 3aantifungal agents 3adermatitis 3ahistopathology 3ainoculum 3amodels 3amortality 3aotitis 3athorax 3avirulence 3ayeasts 0amalasseziosis 0asystemic infection 0aToll-deficient fruit flies1 aHeidrich, Daiane1 aDanilevicz, Chris Krebs1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6818-135X1 aScroferneker, Maria LÃºcia1 aZanette, RÃ©gis A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4432-22310 tVeterinary microbiology.g2018 Oct., v. 224 p.31-33dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.08.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245012300169520132400292592002801616650001801644650001901662650002601681650001401707650001601721650002001737650002001757650001701777650000901794650001201803650002801815650001401843650001501857650001401872700002401886700002101910700002201931700002001953700002201973700001901995773012502014856007802139852000902217655001202226IND60702264020221120024507.0200719e20200207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070226402DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90201442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLogozzi, Mariantonia 10aBeneficial Effects of Fermented Papaya Preparation (FPPÂ®) Supplementation on Redox Balance and Aging in a Mouse Model  aIn recent decades much attention has been paid to how dietary antioxidants may positively affect the human health, including the beneficial effects of fermented foods and beverages. Fermented Papaya Preparation (FPPÂ®) has been shown to represent a valuable approach to obtain systemic antioxidants effect. In this study, we wanted to verify whether FPPÂ® had a clear and scientifically supported in vivo anti-aging effect together with the induction of a systemic antioxidant reaction. To this purpose we daily treated a mouse model suitable for aging studies (C57BL/6J) with FPPÂ®-supplemented water from either the 6th weeks (early treatment) or the 51th weeks (late treatment) of age as compared to mice receiving only tap water. After 10 months of FPPÂ® treatment, we evaluated the telomerase activity, antioxidants and Reactive Oxygen Species ROS plasmatic levels and the telomeres length in the bone marrow and ovaries in both mice groups. The results showed that the daily FPPÂ® assumption induced increase in telomeres length in bone marrow and ovary, together with an increase in the plasmatic levels of telomerase activity, and antioxidant levels, with a decrease of ROS. Early treatment resulted to be more effective, suggesting a potential key role of FPPÂ® in preventing the age-related molecular damages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aanimal ovaries 3aanti-aging properties 3abeverages 3abone marrow 3aenzyme activity 3afermented foods 3ahuman health 3amice 3apapayas 3areactive oxygen species 3atap water 3atelomerase 3atelomeres1 aDi Raimo, Rossella 1 aMizzoni, Davide 1 aAndreotti, Mauro 1 aSpada, Massimo 1 aMacchia, Daniele 1 aFais, Stefano 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Feb. 07, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90201443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245011700207300001300324520125500337592002801592650002701620650002201647650002201669650002501691650002501716650002401741650001301765650001701778650001601795650004201811650003601853650002201889650001301911650001101924650001401935650001501949650002201964650004301986650005202029650002502081650004402106653002402150653002702174653002202201653002702223653002102250700001802271700002202289700001902311700002202330773010902352856008402461852000902545655001202554IND60585393020221119222330.0190318e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058539302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2017.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUzilday, Baris1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8168-056X10aChanges in redox regulation during transition from C3 to single cell C4 photosynthesis in Bienertia sinuspersici  ap. 1-10.  aBienertia sinuspersici performs single cell C4 photosynthesis without Kranz anatomy. Peripheral and central cytoplasmic compartments in a single chlorenchyma cell act as mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells. Development of this specialized mechanism is gradual during plant development. Young leaves perform C3 photosynthesis, while mature leaves have complete C4 cycle. The aim of this work was to investigate changes in redox regulation and antioxidant defence during transition from C3 to single cell C4 photosynthesis in B. sinuspersici leaves. First, we confirmed gradual development of C4 with protein blot and qRT-PCR analysis of C4 enzymes. After this activities and isoenzymes of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) and H2O2 and TBARS and glutathione pool and redox status (GSH/GSSG) were determined in young, developing and mature leaves during transition from C3 to single cell C4 photosynthesis. Activities of SOD, APX and POX decrease, while GR and DHAR were increased. However, most striking results were the changes in isoenzyme patterns of SOD, CAT and GR which were gradual through transition to C4 photosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBienertia sinuspersici 3aC3 photosynthesis 3aC4 photosynthesis 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abundle sheath cells 3acatalase 3achlorenchyma 3aglutathione 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aisozymes 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3aperoxidase 3aplant development 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aBienertia sinuspersici 0aC4 photosynthesis 0aPlant cell development 0aRedox regulation1 aOzgur, Rengin1 aYalcinkaya, Tolga1 aTurkan, Ismail1 aSekmen, A.

However, the presence of PAs in roots and root exudations and their rhizodeposition under intercropping are still unclear. Hydroponic and soil experiments of wheat, faba bean, and wheat intercropped with faba bean were conducted, and the major compositions and contents of PAs in roots, root exudations, and rhizospheric soil were determined. The results showed that Ï-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, and syringic acids were the major components of PAs in roots, root exudations, and rhizospheric soil in a wheat and faba bean intercropping system. The compositions and percentages of PAs in roots of faba bean were altered when faba bean intercropped with wheat. The total exudation rate of PAs in root exudations was decreased by 30%â60% under the wheat and faba bean intercropping (W//F) system as compared to mono-cropped faba bean (MF). Ï-hydroxybenzoic acid was identified in the root exudation of both MF and mono-cropped wheat (MW), but not detected in the intercropping on 60â¯days after transplanting. Vanillic acid was only detected in the root exudation of MF on 30â¯days after transplanting. The rhizodepostion of vanillic and cumaric acid were decreased at both branching and pod setting stages in W//F as compared to MF. In conclusion, interspecific interaction changed the compositions and contents of PAs in faba bean roots and root exudations. W//F constrained vanillic acid exuded by roots and decreased vanillic and coumaric acid rhizodeposition by faba bean, which provides insight into root-soil interactions in the intercropping systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallelochemicals 3acontinuous cropping 3acoumaric acids 3aexudation 3afaba beans 3ahydroponics 3arhizodeposition 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3asoil-borne diseases 3avanillic acid 3awheat 0aExudation rate 0aPhenolic acids 0aRoot exudations 0aWheat and faba bean intercropping1 aZhu, Ying-An1 aDong, Yan1 aYin, Xinhua1 aTang, Li1 aZheng, Yi0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2021 Oct. 07, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2021.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002700138245014700165520123500312592002801547650002401575650001301599650001101612650001901623650001501642650001401657650001701671650002101688650001201709650001701721650001401738650001401752650001601766650002101782650001501803650002201818650001601840650001901856650001001875651001801885700002001903700002001923700002201943773011901965856007202084852000902156655001202165IND60648818820221119033620.0190701e20180116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064881882DNAL7 a10.3390/f90100372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatthes, Jaclyn Hatala10aTree Stress and Mortality from Emerald Ash Borer Does Not Systematically Alter Short-Term Soil Carbon Flux in a Mixed Northeastern U.S. Forest  aInvasive insect pests are a common disturbance in temperate forests, but their effects on belowground processes in these ecosystems are poorly understood. This study examined how aboveground disturbance might impact short-term soil carbon flux in a forest impacted by emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) in central New Hampshire, USA. We anticipated changes to soil moisture and temperature resulting from tree mortality caused by emerald ash borer, with subsequent effects on rates of soil respiration and methane oxidation. We measured carbon dioxide emissions and methane uptake beneath trees before, during, and after infestation by emerald ash borer. In our study, emerald ash borer damage to nearby trees did not alter soil microclimate nor soil carbon fluxes. While surprising, the lack of change in soil microclimate conditions may have been a result of the sandy, well-drained soil in our study area and the diffuse spatial distribution of canopy ash trees and subsequent canopy light gaps after tree mortality. Overall, our results indicate that short-term changes in soil carbon flux following insect disturbances may be minimal, particularly in forests with well-drained soils and a mixed-species canopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrilus planipennis 3aFraxinus 3acanopy 3acarbon dioxide 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3ainsect pests 3ainvasive species 3amethane 3amicroclimate 3amortality 3aoxidation 3asoil carbon 3asoil respiration 3asoil water 3atemperate forests 3atemperature 3atree mortality 3atrees 3aNew Hampshire1 aLang, Ashley K.1 aJevon, Fiona V.1 aRussell, Sarah J.0 tForests.g2018 Jan. 16, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90100373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013800162300001800300520150800318592002801826650001401854650001201868650002901880650001001909650001001919650001101929650001501940650003701955650001401992650000902006650001602015700002102031700002102052700001902073700002302092773010502115856007502220852000902295655001202304IND60534050120170526000000.0160802e20131121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053405012DNAL7 a10.1021/ef401484s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSÃ¡nchez, Nazly
E.10aInfluence of the Oxygen Presence on Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) Formation from Acetylene Pyrolysis under Sooting Conditions  ap. 7081-7088.  aThe concentration of sixteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), classified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as priority pollutants, and the soot amount obtained from acetylene conversion for different oxygen concentrations have been determined in a tubular reactor experimental system. The present work also reports concentrations of other products such as light gases, which are known as important in the soot-PAH formation process or because of their abundance in the experiment outlet gas stream. For an acetylene concentration of 30000 ppmv two types of studies have been performed namely a) the effect of reaction temperature was evaluated between 873 and 1323 K in absence and presence of oxygen (0 and 10000 ppmv) and b) the influence of the oxygen concentration between 0 and 50000 ppmv on product formation was considered for temperatures of 973 and 1223 K. Apart from CO as the main product formed from the conversion of CâHâ in the presence of oxygen, benzene, PAH, and soot are also formed in significant amounts. They are encouraged by the presence of oxygen in fuel rich conditions at the lowest temperatures studied but seem to be diminished when the temperature is increased. The results obtained at a reaction temperature of 973 K and different oxygen concentrations showed that the PAH concentration presents a maximum of around 10000 ppmv.

The signaling peptides of the epidermal patterning factor (EPF) family regulate stomatal development and density in Arabidopsis. Several putative homologs of EPF/EPFL exist in rice genome. To understand their possible involvement in stomatal formation, in this study we generated a series of transgenic lines including reporter promoter fusions, down-regulation and overexpression and demonstrated drastic differences in stomatal densities between different genotypes, as elevated expression of OsEPF1 or OsEPF2 greatly reduced stomatal density in rice, whereas ectopic overexpression of either OsEPF1 or OsEPF2 significantly decreased the high stomatal frequency of both mutant lines of epf2 and epf1epf2 Arabidopsis. Conversely, knocking down OsEPFL9 transcription conferred transgenic plants with fewer stomata than WT in rice, whereas overexpressing rice OsEPFL9 gene could cause excessive production of stomata in Arabidopsis. In conclusion, homologs of EPF/EPFL regulate stomatal development in a generally highly conserved way yet there exist function distinctions between dicot and monocot plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3arice 3aArabidopsis 3agene overexpression 3atransgenic plants 3atranscription (genetics) 3agenes 3agenotype 3amutants 3asignal peptide 3avapors 3aphotosynthesis 3aLiliopsida 3agene expression regulation 3astomata 0aGUS 0aRT-PCR 0aWater use efficiency 0aCaMV 35S 0aStomatal development 0aleaves 0aWUE 0aSignaling peptide 0abHLH 0aEpidermal patterning factor 0aX-Gluc 0aEDTA 0aMMC 0aPCR 0aTBO 0aDIC 0aRice1 aHe, Jingjing1 aZhou, Xiaosheng1 aZhong, Jinjin1 aLi, Jiao1 aLiang, Yun-Kuan0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2019 Mar.,  Apr., v. 234-235 p.18-27dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2019.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04104naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245011300208246005200321506007600373520217900449592002802628506003702656650002302693650001202716650001902728650002702747650002302774650000902797650002002806650003102826650001402857650001002871650001302881650001202894650001102906650001202917650001502929650001602944650002002960650001502980650003302995650004303028650002603071650001303097650001103110650001403121700001703135700001703152700001303169700001303182700001503195700001903210700001703229700001703246773007303263856008403336961001303420852000903433655001203442IND60121627920221207102723.0150316e20130923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012162792DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00743092doi7 aPMC37810882pmcid7 a240863312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Shun-Fan10aParasitization by Cotesia chilonis Influences Gene Expression in Fatbody and Hemocytes of Chilo suppressalis3 aRNA-seq Analysis of Parasitized C. suppressalis  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring oviposition many parasitoid wasps inject various factors, such as polydnaviruses (PDVs), along with eggs that manipulate the physiology and development of their hosts. These manipulations are thought to benefit the parasites. However, the detailed mechanisms of insect host-parasitoid interactions are not fully understood at the molecular level. Based on recent findings that some parasitoids influence gene expression in their hosts, we posed the hypothesis that parasitization by a braconid wasp, Cotesia chilonis , influences the expression of genes responsible for development, metabolism and immune functions in the fatbody and hemocytes of its host, Chilo suppressalis . We obtained 39,344,452 reads, which were assembled into 146,770 scaffolds, and 76,016 unigenes. Parasitization impacted gene expression in fatbody and hemocytes. Of these, 8096 fatbody or 5743 hemocyte unigenes were down-regulated, and 2572 fatbody or 1452 hemocyte unigenes were up-regulated. Gene ontology data showed that the majority of the differentially expressed genes are involved in enzyme-regulated activity, binding, transcription regulator activity and catalytic activity. qPCR results show that most anti-microbial peptide transcription levels were up-regulated after parasitization. Expression of bracovirus genes was detected in parasitized larvae with 19 unique sequences identified from six PDV gene families including ankyrin, CrV1 protein, cystatin, early-expressed (EP) proteins, lectin, and protein tyrosine phosphatase. The current study supports our hypothesis that parasitization influences the expression of fatbody and hemocyte genes in the host, C. suppressalis . The general view is that manipulation of host metabolism and immunity benefits the development and emergence of the parasitoid offsprings. The accepted beneficial mechanisms include the direct impact of parasitoid-associated virulence factors such as venom and polydnavirus on host tissues (such as cell damage) and, more deeply, the ability of these factors to influence gene expression. We infer that insect parasitoids generally manipulate their environments, the internal milieu of their hosts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChilo suppressalis 3aCotesia 3aPolydnaviridae 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acatalytic activity 3aeggs 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahemocytes 3ahosts 3aimmunity 3ainsects 3alarvae 3alectins 3ametabolism 3aoviposition 3aparasitic wasps 3aparasitism 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription factors 3aunigenes 3avenoms 3avirulence1 aSun, Fang-Da1 aQi, Yi-Xiang1 aYao, Yao1 aFang, Qi1 aHuang, Jia1 aStanley, David1 aYe, Gong-Yin1 aMans, Ben J.0 tPloS one.g, v. 8, no. 9dPublic Library of Sciencex1932-62037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00743093Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002000167245016600187300001600353520152900369592002801898653001501926653002501941653001501966653002601981700001902007773012402026856011502150852000902265655001202274IND60130353120221116153329.0151127e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013035312DNAL7 a10.2983/0730-8000(2008)27[241:PAOTSA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUlrich, Paul N.10aProteome Assay of Temperature Stress and Protein Stability in Extreme Environments: Groundwork with the Heat Stress Response of the Bivalve Mercenaria mercenaria  ap. 241-246.  aProtein metabolism is an expensive cellular process that can generally account for one third of basal metabolism in animals. Shifts in the stability of proteins under increased environmental temperatures could potentially alter the energy budget of an organism. However, studying the thermal stability kinetics of individual proteins is tedious and ultimately, difficult to relate to changes in the fitness of an organism. Yet understanding how organisms inhabiting extreme environments (polar seas, hydrothermal vents, and deep ocean basins) are able to maintain or limit the rate of protein turnover in the total cellular protein pool is crucial for our understanding of the total metabolic costs associated with survival in these habitats. To assess protein stability in field collected organisms at a proteome scale, we developed a high-throughput assay for protein denaturation profiles of total tissue extracts in bivalves. These profiles are quantitative and reveal unique compositional features of different tissues. Heat stress experiments in the clam Mercenaria mercenaria reveal that the protein pool of mantle and digestive mass tissues are more thermally stable after a short exposure to 35Â°Â°C. This increase in stability could have large implications for the energy budget of M. mercenaria when exposed to high summer water temperatures. This methodology could readily be used to assess the stability and/or turnover potential of a variety of organisms experiencing extremes of both temperature and pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMercenaria 0aprotein denaturation 0ametabolism 0aphysiological ecology1 aMarsh, Adam G.0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2008 Mar., v. 27, no. 1 p.241-246dNational Shellfisheries Associationx0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983%2F0730-8000%282008%2927%5B241%3APAOTSA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245010900209300001800318520208800336592002802424650002202452650001302474650002602487650001402513650002202527650001302549650001902562650001302581650001302594650001702607650002202624650002102646700005902667700006302726700006102789773011202850856008302962852000903045655001203054IND60745931020221121102202.0220802e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074593102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-021-04028-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParajuli, Prakash1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7857-833710aTuning the morphological properties of cellulose aerogels: an investigation of salt-mediated preparation  ap. 7559-7577.  aIn this study, alkali and alkaline earth metal chlorides with different cationic radii (LiCl, NaCl, and KCl, MgClâ, and CaClâ) were used to gain insight into the behavior of cellulose solutions in the presence of salts. The specific focus of the study was on theÂ evaluation of the effect of saltsâ addition on the solâgel transition of the cellulose solutions and on their ability to form monoliths, as well as theÂ evaluation of the morphology (e.g., specific surface area, pore characteristics, and microstructure) of aerocelluloses prepared from these solutions. The effect of the salt addition on the solâgel transition of cellulose solutions was studied using rheology, and morphology of resultant aerogels was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and BrunauerâEmmettâTeller analysis, while the salt influence on the aerocellulosesâ crystalline structure and thermal stability was evaluated using powder X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. The study revealed that the effect of saltsâ addition was dependent on the component ions and their concentration. The addition of salts in the amount below certain concentration limit significantly improved the ability of the cellulose solutions to form monoliths and reduced the solâgel transition time. Salts of lower cationic radii had a greater effect on gelation. However, excessive amount of salts resulted in the formation of fragile monoliths or no formation of gels at all. Analysis of surface morphology demonstrated that the addition of salts resulted in a significant increase in porosity and specific surface area, with salts of lower cationic radii leading to aerogels with much larger (~â1.5 and 1.6-fold for LiCl and MgClâ, respectively) specific surface area compared to aerocelluloses prepared with no added salt. Thus, by adding the appropriate salt into the cellulose solution prior to gelation, the properties of aerocelluloses that control materialâs performance (specific surface area, density, and porosity) could be tailored for a specific application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaerogels 3aalkaline earth metals 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3agelation 3amicrostructure 3aporosity 3arheology 3asurface area 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aAcharya, Sanjit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3135-830X1 aShamshina, Julia L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0708-764X1 aAbidi, Noureddine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5642-63320 tCellulose.g2021 Aug., v. 28, no. 12 p.7559-7577dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-04028-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245009800173300001900271520200700290592002802297650002502325650001902350650002402369650002002393650002502413650002702438650001202465650001802477650001102495650001302506650001302519650001402532650002002546650003102566650001802597650001902615650002202634700001602656700001702672700002402689700002302713773009902736856008802835990002302923852000902946655001202955IND60098580220221119133934.0141104e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009858022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.11.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrady, Rosheen10aElective single embryo transfer and perinatal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 324-331.e8.  aOBJECTIVE: To determine whether elective single embryo transfer (eSET) lowers the risk of poor perinatal outcomes associated with IVF, when [1] compared with double embryo transfer (DET) or multiple embryo transfer (MET), and separately, [2] compared with spontaneous conceptions. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: Centers for reproductive care. PATIENT(S): Infertility patients. INTERVENTION(S): MEDLINE, Embase, and bibliographies were searched for the period 1978â2011. Two reviewers independently assessed titles, abstracts, and full studies, extracted data, and assessed quality. Dichotomous data were pooled using relative risks and continuous data with mean differences using a random effects model. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), caseâcontrol studies, and cohort studies that examined any of the primary or secondary outcomes in singleton, twin, or multiple-order infants conceived by eSET as compared with [1] those conceived by DET or MET or [2] spontaneously conceived singleton gestations were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary outcomes were preterm birth (PTB, <37 weeksâ gestation) and low birth weight (LBW, <2,500 g). RESULT(S): Sixteen studies were included (eight RCTs, eight cohort studies). Compared with DET-conceived infants, eSET-conceived singletons were less likely to be born either preterm (RCT-based relative risk [RR] 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25â0.55) or with LBW (RCT-based RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15â0.45; cohort study RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29â0.91). However, compared with spontaneously conceived singletons, eSET gestations had higher risks of PTB (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.26â3.61), placenta previa (RR 6.02, 95% CI 2.79â13.01), gestational diabetes (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.19â2.42), and ectopic pregnancy (RR 6.40, 95% CI 4.38â9.35). CONCLUSION(S): Elective single embryo transfer is associated with decreased risks of PTB and LBW compared with DET but higher risks of PTB compared with spontaneously conceived singletons.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase-control studies 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3aembryo transfer 3agestational diabetes 3ain vitro fertilization 3ainfants 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3apatients 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3apremature birth 3arandomized clinical trials 3arelative risk 3arisk reduction 3asystematic review1 aAlavi, Nika1 aVale, Rachel1 aKhandwala, Mohammad1 aMcDonald, Sarah D.0 tFertility and sterility.g2012 Feb., v. 97, no. 2 p.324-331.e8dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.11.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03760naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002800125040001800153100004300171245009900214300001600313506007600329506003100405520177900436592002802215596010502243596004502348596004402393506003702437650001902474650002102493650001402514650001702528650000902545650001502554650001202569650002102581650002102602650001002623650001802633650001602651650001302667650001602680650001802696653001802714653002502732653001802757653001902775653001702794700003602811700003502847700002002882700002302902773013602925856007503061961001303136852000903149655001203158IND60743117920221207061924.0210707e20210414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074311792DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/nvab0282chorus7 a10.1093/ee/nvab0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacÃªdo Dos Santos, Maria Ãngela Cruz10aBehavioral Responses of Asian Citrus Psyllid (Hemiptera: Liviidae) to Salinity-Stressed Citrus  ap. 719-731.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aMost commercial citrus varieties are intolerant of salinity stress, but some rootstocks, such as Rangpur lime, tolerate moderately saline irrigation water. Development of salinity-tolerant citrus may allow for citriculture in semiarid and arid regions where salinity stress is problematic. Because salinity stress influences shoot growth in citrus, we compared the behavioral responses of Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, to salinity-stressed versus nonstressed Rangpur lime seedlings. The effects of salinity stress on key physiological processes in the seedlings were also examined. Seedlings in the control group were fertilized with a solution having a salinity of 1.7 dS mâÂ¹ while seedlings in the salinity-stressed group were fertilized with a solution having a salinity of 10 dS mâÂ¹. The seedlings were exposed to salinity stress for increasing durations (15, 20, or 60 d). Seedlings presented differential physiological responses 15 d after the imposition of salinity stress, and differences in psyllid settling rate on control versus salinity-stressed seedlings were discernable within 1 h following the imposition of salinity stress. The levels of settling, oviposition, and egg survivorship were significantly lower on salinity-stressed versus control seedlings. Olfactometer tests showed that female psyllids preferred the odor from control seedlings, suggesting that the odors of control and salinity-stressed seedlings were different. The results showed that D. citri avoids salinity-stressed seedlings; this suggests the possibility of using moderate salinity stress as a management strategy to minimize psyllid settlement and reproduction and to reduce the spread of huanglongbing, especially in citrus grown in semiarid and arid areas.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Council for Scientific and Technological Developmentdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cBahia State Research Support Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCitrus limonia 3aDiaphorina citri 3aPsyllidae 3acitriculture 3aeggs 3aentomology 3afemales 3agreening disease 3airrigation water 3aodors 3aolfactometers 3aoviposition 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asurvival rate 0ahuanglongbing 0ahost plant selection 0abiotic stress 0aabiotic stress 0aolfactometer1 aCoelho Filho, Mauricio AntÃ´nio1 aNunes Modesto, Francisco JosÃ©1 aPatt, Joseph M.1 aFancelli, Marilene0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2021 Apr. 14, v. 50, no. 3 p.719-731dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl3243x0046-225X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvab0283Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013500175300001600310520115900326592002801485650002001513650001301533650001501546650002001561650001801581650002501599650001401624650001201638650001401650650001201664650001401676653001501690653001801705653001301723653001401736653002001750700002501770700002401795773010701819856008501926852000902011655001202020IND60546062520221119025440.0190516e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054606252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2015.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrowne, Mark Anthony10aOrganophosphorous biocides reduce tenacity and cellular viability but not esterase activities in a non-target prosobranch (limpet)  ap. 208-213.  aDetecting impacts of organophosphorus biocides (OP) is facilitated by analysing âbiomarkersâ â biological responses to environmental insults. Understanding is hampered by studying biomarkers in isolation at different levels of biological response and limited work on ecologically-important species. We tested the relevance of esterases as biomarkers of OP-exposure in limpets (Patella vulgata), abundant prosobranchs that structure the assemblages on rocky shores through their grazing. We characterized esterases in haemolymph and tissue, and quantified their dose-dependent inhibition by chlorfenvinphos (0.1â3.0Â mM) inÂ vitro. To determine whether esterases are useful biomarkers we exposed limpets to chlorfenvinphos (0â10Â Î¼gÂ Lâ1). Despite reduced tenacity (ability to stick to a surface) and haemocyte-viability, esterases remained unaffected. Tenacity was reduced by >50% at 5Â Î¼gÂ Lâ1 and by 95% at 10Â Î¼gÂ Lâ1, whilst haemocyte-viability was more sensitive with >40% reductions at concentrations of 0.5Â Î¼gÂ Lâ1 and above.

Wild-type MV strains generally use human signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM; CD150) as a cellular receptor, while vaccine strains such as the Edmonston strain can use both CD150 and CD46 as receptors. It is not yet known how early in the embryonal differentiation stages these receptors are expressed. We established two hiPSCs (BGU-iPSCs and EMF-iPSCs) which express CD46 and CD150. Both cell types can be infected by MV to form persistent, noncytopathic cell lines that release infectious MV particles. Following MV persistent infection, BGU-iPSCs and EMF-iPSCs remain pluripotent and can differentiate in vitro into the three germ layers. This includes cells expressing the neuronal differentiation markers: NF68 and miRNA-124. Since the MV does not integrate into the cell's genome, it can be utilized as a vehicle to systematically introduce genes into iPSC, to dissect and to define factors regulating lineage differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3aneurons 3aembryonic germ layers 3ahumans 3avaccines 3areceptors 3aMeasles morbillivirus 3achronic diseases 3agenes 3acell lines 3alymphocyte proliferation 0ameasles virus 0ahuman-induced pluripotent stem cells 0apersistent infection 0aMeasles virus1 aRabinski, Tatiana1 aYizhak, Avi1 aMizrahi, Solly1 aAvni, Yonat Shemer1 aTaube, Ran1 aRager, Bracha1 aWeinstein, Yacov1 aRall, Glenn1 aGopas, Jacob1 aOfir, Rivka0 tCellular reprogramming.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 20, no. 1 p.17-26dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:21670x2152-49987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cell.2017.00343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245013500169300001600304520169700320592002802017650000802045650002202053650001502075650001402090650001102104650001002115650002202125650001602147650001302163650002302176650002802199650001202227650001802239653002502257653001502282653001402297653001002311700002402321700002302345700003602368700002602404773012202430856007802552852000902630655001202639IND60644688620221117193151.0190520e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064468862DNAL7 a10.1089/cell.2017.00392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlsalim, Husamaldeen10aEffect of DNA and Histone Methyl Transferase Inhibitors on Outcomes of BuffaloâBovine Interspecies Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer  ap. 256-267.  aSomatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) derived embryos suffer from abnormal epigenetic reprogramming, which handicaps pre- and postimplantation development. It was hypothesized that epigenetic modifiers, including zebularine (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors) and BIX-01294 (histone methyltransferase inhibitors), could decrease the respective levels of 5-methylcytosine and H3K9me2 in reconstructed oocytes (RO). Accordingly, we investigated whether treating RO with zebularine and BIX-01294 for 16 hours after activation could improve developmental competence and quality of buffaloâbovine interspecies SCNT (iSCNT) embryos. Treatment of RO with zebularine but not BIX-01294 significantly increased two-cell formation at 16 hours postactivation. Conversely, early cleaved embryos had significantly lower rate of blastocyst formation in zebularine treated RO compared to their counterparts in control and BIX-01294 groups. Treatment of RO with zebularine and BIX-01294 did not improve blastocyst rate of buffaloâbovine iSCNT embryos compared to their control counterparts. However, these two epigenetic drugs might have some beneficial effects on buffaloâbovine iSCNT compared to bovine SCNT embryos. The quality of iSCNT blastocysts was improved due to significant expression of OCT4 and CDX2 in BIX-01294 and CDX2 in zebularine treated RO. Furthermore, treatment of RO with zebularine and BIX-01294 did not affect DNA fragmentation in derived blastocysts against control group. In conclusion, treatment with zebularine and BIX-01294 did not enhance developmental competence of iSCNT embryos, but may have some beneficial effects on epigenetic makeup and quality of derived blastocysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3ablastocyst 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3adrugs 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aepigenetics 3ahistones 3amethyltransferases 3anuclear transplantation 3aoocytes 3asomatic cells 0aepigenetic modifiers 0azebularine 0aBIX-01294 0aiSCNT1 aJafarpour, Farnoosh1 aTanhaei Vash, Nima1 aNasr-Esfahani, Mohammad Hossein1 aNiasari-Naslaji, Amir0 tCellular reprogramming.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 20, no. 4 p.256-267dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:21670x2152-49987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cell.2017.00393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013000162300001800292520170000310592002802010650001202038650001802050650001602068650002402084650001302108650002102121650001902142700001502161700001402176700001702190773014602207856008202353852000902435655001202444IND60745929220221121093110.0210727e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074592922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-021-02566-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Chao10aEffects of turbulence fluctuation intensity in bioreactor of sewage treatment on physical and chemical properties of biofilms  ap. 1865-1874.  aThe flow velocity plays an important role in the growth and characteristics of biofilm in the bioreactor as well as its treatment efficiency, which has been a hot research topic. In a sewage treatment bioreactor, the type of flow is usually turbulence. According to the methods of Reynolds decomposition, the flow velocity of turbulence consists of the time-mean velocity and fluctuation velocity, which usually exist simultaneously in real flow. However, the current research on the influence of turbulence flow velocity mainly focuses on the time-mean velocity, while the fluctuation velocity has not been reported because of very difficult to control. To this end, in this paper, a laboratory oscillating-grid turbulence (OGT) bioreactor with zero time-mean velocity and only fluctuation velocity was designed. In this bioreactor, the fluctuation velocity could be easily manipulated by varying the operational parameters of the grid. Based on the numerical simulation of Gasâliquid two-phase flow, the distributions of fluctuation velocity and corresponding turbulence fluctuation intensity, gas holdup, and Reynolds stress were obtained. After that, the effects of the turbulent fluctuation intensity on the biofilm thickness, density, and composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were studied experimentally. The results showed that turbulent fluctuation had a significant effect on the physical and chemical properties of biofilms, and the fluctuation velocity promoted the increase in the biofilm density and the content of protein and carbohydrates in EPS. This study was intended to provide theoretical support for the design and operation optimization of bioreactors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3abioprocessing 3abioreactors 3amathematical models 3apolymers 3asewage treatment 3aturbulent flow1 aGuo, Lisha1 aZeng, Shi1 aLong, Tianyu0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2021 Sept., v. 44, no. 9 p.1865-1874dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-021-02566-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03412naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002400167245019000191300001600381520224200397592002802639653001902667653001602686653002602702653002702728653001602755653001702771653001802788653001902806653001302825773012402838856011502962852000903077655001203086IND60130351420221116153403.0151127e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013035142DNAL7 a10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[961:COGRBD]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHARDING, JULIANA M.10aCOMPARISON OF GROWTH RATES BETWEEN DIPLOID DEBY EASTERN OYSTERS (CRASSOSTREA VIRGINICA, GMELIN 1791), TRIPLOID EASTERN OYSTERS, AND TRIPLOID SUMINOE OYSTERS (C. ariakensis, FUGITA 1913)  ap. 961-972.  aOyster size and morphology affect individual oyster physiology, reproductive biology, and habitat production as well as population ecological services and availability for commercial harvest. Options for oyster restoration and fishery facilitation for eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) populations in the Chesapeake Bay include the use of disease resistant diploid eastern oysters (DEBY strain), triploid eastern oysters, and triploid Suminoe oysters (Crassostrea ariakensis) with the objective of providing a marketable product in a reasonable time frame. Shell height-at-age, growth in shell height in relation to environmental conditions, ontogenetic changes in morphology, and changes in biomass for groups of triploid Suminoe, triploid eastern, and diploid DEBY eastern oysters held at identical grow out conditions for the first two years of their lives were evaluated.Triploid Suminoe oysters reached shell heights of 76 mm (market size in Virginia of 3 in) at 1.1 y with triploid eastern oysters and diploid DEBY oysters attaining the same size at 1.2 y and 1.5 y, respectively. Increases in shell height were positively correlated with water temperature and salinity with the largest increases in shell height typically occurring in warmer months. Holding density significantly affected ratios of shell height (SH) to shell width (SW) and SH to shell inflation (SI) for all three oyster populations. Oysters at lower densities showed a decrease in SH:SI ratio indicative of increased cupping as well as a reduction in SH:SW indicating a trend toward more discoid or rounded form. Tissue dry weight (g) and ash free dry tissue weight (g) increased nonlinearly with size within each population and were statistically different across the three populations examined. Triploid Suminoe oysters had higher tissue weights than either triploid or diploid DEBY eastern oysters of similar ages. Both triploid eastern and Suminoe oysters had higher tissue weights than diploid DEBY oysters of similar age. Observed differences in growth rates and morphology between these groups of oysters affect both the ecological services they provide (filtration rates as well as habitat) as well as their fishery potential (time to market size).  aPublisher supplied data 0aEastern oyster 0aCrassostrea 0aCrassostrea virginica 0aCrassostrea ariakensis 0aDEBY strain 0agrowth rates 0aheight-at-age 0aChesapeake Bay 0atriploid0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2007 Dec., v. 26, no. 4 p.961-972dNational Shellfisheries Associationx0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983%2F0730-8000%282007%2926%5B961%3ACOGRBD%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009700170300001200267520108100279592002801360650002701388650002901415650001301444650001901457650001801476650001801494650002601512650001901538650003701557650001101594650001501605650001301620650003301633650001501666650001301681653002101694653002801715653002701743653002001770700002401790700002001814700002301834700002301857700002201880773011101902856008302013852000902096655001202105IND60544610520221119153827.0190417e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054461052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2013.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatiÃ±o, Jairo H.10aEvaluation of polyamide composite casings with silverâzinc crystals for sausages packaging  ap. 3-9.  aThis study assessed the manufacture of polyamide (PA-6) composite casings based on silverâzinc crystals with potential application in sausages packaging. The antimicrobial activity of silverâzinc crystals was estimated by the minimum inhibitory concentration method for microbial strains related with the spoilage of meat products. PA-6 films were prepared as a multilayer film by bubble film sheet co-extrusion (130Â°Câ14,000kPa), identified according to the layers distribution as control and active casings by adding 3% (w/w) of silverâzinc crystals to obtain a film with good barrier and mechanical properties. DSC, DMTA and SEM were also evaluated for determining the effects of microparticles in the polymeric matrix. Silverâzinc crystals inhibited the growth of various microbial strains, being Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 which presented greatest resistance. Silverâzinc crystals were well impregnated in PA-6 films. Inclusion of silverâzinc crystals did not modify the mechanical properties and decreased the oxygen transmission rate of the films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aantimicrobial properties 3acrystals 3afood packaging 3amanufacturing 3ameat products 3amechanical properties 3amicroparticles 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aoxygen 3apolyamides 3asausages 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 0aActive packaging 0aAntimicrobial packaging 0aSilverâzinc crystals 0aPolyamide films1 aHenrÃ­quez, Luis E.1 aRestrepo, Diego1 aMendoza, MarÃ­a P.1 aLantero, MarÃ­a I.1 aGarcÃ­a, Mario A.0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2014 Mar., v. 1, no. 1 p.3-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2013.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009300161300002000254520111800274592002801392650002301420650002201443650001501465650002401480650002101504650001101525650001801536650001001554650001301564650001801577650001701595650001101612650001901623650001901642650001701661650002301678650002101701700003101722700001901753773012401772856007401896852000901970655001201979IND60664440220221122094717.0190912e20130715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066444022DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra23347b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSajjad, Shamaila10aCopper impregnated ionic liquid assisted mesoporous titania: visible light photocatalyst  ap. 12678-12687.  aMesoporous titania (Ms-TiOâ) is successfully prepared using water immiscible room-temperature ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium-tetrafluoroborate as a template and an effective additional solvent via the solâgel method at low temperature.

Cu/Ms-TiOâ samples exhibit superior visible light photocatalytic activities to Ms-TiOâ, P-25 and 2.0% Cu/P-25 in the case of 2,4-dichlorophenol and methyl orange.

A novel and especially virulent strain â IVb â appeared in the Great Lakes in 2003, has killed many game fish species in a series of outbreaks in subsequent years, and shut down interstate transport of baitfish. Cell culture is the diagnostic method approved by the USDA-APHIS, which takes a month or longer, lacks sensitivity, and does not quantify the amount of virus. We thus present a novel, easy, rapid, and highly sensitive real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay that incorporates synthetic competitive template internal standards for quality control to circumvent false negative results. Results demonstrate high signal-to-analyte response (slopeâ=â1.00Â±0.02) and a linear dynamic range that spans seven orders of magnitude (R 2 =â0.99), ranging from 6 to 6,000,000 molecules. Infected fishes are found to harbor levels of virus that range to 1,200,000 VHSv molecules/10 6 actb1 molecules with 1,000 being a rough cut-off for clinical signs of disease. This new assay is rapid, inexpensive, and has significantly greater accuracy than other published qRT-PCR tests and traditional cell culture diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service 3aViral hemorrhagic septicemia virus 3abaitfish 3acell culture 3adiagnostic techniques 3aestuarine fish 3afluorometry 3afreshwater 3agame fish 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avirulent strains 3aviruses 3aEurasia 3aGreat Lakes 3aNorth America1 aWilley, James C.1 aPalsule, Vrushalee V.1 aYeo, Jiyoun1 aShepherd, Brian S.1 aCrawford, Erin L.1 aStepien, Carol A.1 aQiu, Jianming0 tPloS one.g, v. 8, no. 8dPublic Library of Sciencex1932-62037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00718513Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245016500155300001800320520118600338592002801524650001201552650001501564650001901579650001701598650001501615650002601630650001401656650001101670650002201681650001801703650001701721650001601738650001601754700001901770700001801789700001401807700001801821700001801839773010501857856007501962852000902037655001202046IND60534049020221119030619.0160802e20131121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053404902DNAL7 a10.1021/ef401374y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Weijie10aExperiments on Measurement of Temperature and Emissivity of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Combustion by Spectral Analysis and Image Processing in Visible Spectrum  ap. 6754-6762.  aThis paper presents an experimental investigation on the measurement of temperature and emissivity in a 46 ton/h Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) incinerator using a spectrometer system and a flame image detection system. The spectroscopy analysis shows that strong Na (590 nm) and K (767 nm) emission occurs in the visible spectrum of the flame in the MSW incinerator, which demonstrates a typical nongray property of radiation. The two-color method is used to calculate the temperature and emissivity of the flame from the continuous spectrum and the visible flame image, and the results indicate that except for the Na (590 nm) and K (767 nm) emission lines, the continuous spectrum from the particulate medium in the flame meets the gray property. Since the strong but narrow Na and K emission lines deviate away from the central wavelengths of red (R) and green (G) in the spectral response curves of the CCD camera, the two-color method can be used to calculate the temperature and emissivity images by the flame image detection system. The preliminary experimental results show that these two techniques will be helpful for combustion research and monitoring in MSW incinerators.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3acombustion 3aimage analysis 3aincinerators 3amonitoring 3amunicipal solid waste 3apotassium 3asodium 3aspectral analysis 3aspectrometers 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3awavelengths1 aZhou, Huaichun1 aJiang, Zhiwei1 aLou, Chun1 aZhang, Xiaoke1 aChen, Donglin0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2013 Nov. 21, v. 27, no. 11 p.6754-6762dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef401374y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245013700162300001600299500002000315520134400335592002801679650002201707650003201729650001901761650002601780650001401806650002301820650004301843650001101886650002501897650003701922650001201959650001001971650001801981650001901999700002902018700002102047700002202068700002202090700002402112700002602136700002202162700001802184700002202202773010302224856007202327852000902399655001202408IND60572140720221121023749.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057214072DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.57392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimonetti, Giovanna10aAntiâDermatophyte and AntiâMalassezia Activity of Extracts Rich in Polymeric Flavanâ3âols Obtained from Vitis vinifera Seeds  ap. 124-131.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSeveral human skin diseases are associated with fungi as dermatophytes and Malassezia. Skin mycoses are increasing and new alternatives to conventional treatments with improved efficacy and/or safety profiles are desirable. For the first time, the antiâdermatophytes and the antiâMalassezia activities of Vitis vinifera seed extracts obtained from different table and wine cultivars have been evaluated. Geometric minimal inhibitory concentration ranged from 20 to 97âÂµg/mL for dermatophytes and from 32 to 161âÂµg/mL for Malassezia furfur. Dried grape seed extracts analyzed by HPLC/DAD/ESI/MS showed different qualiâquantitative compositions in terms of monomeric and polymeric flavanâ3âols. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for Trichophyton mentagrophytes and for M.âfurfur were inversely correlated with the amount of the polymeric fraction (râ=ââ0.7639 and râ=ââ0.7228, respectively). Differently, the antifungal activity against T.âmentagrophytes was not correlated to the content of flavanâ3âol monomers (râ=â0.2920) and only weakly correlated for M.âfurfur (râ=ââ0.53604). These results suggest that extracts rich in polymeric flavanâ3âols, recovered from V. vinifera seeds, could be used for the treatment of skin fungal infections.

Bare patches are the most obvious features indicating the degree of degradation. Previous studies mainly focus on bare patchesâ overall status, i.e., the fractional bare patches (or fractional vegetation cover). However, our understanding of individual bare patchesâ change rates and their relationship with pika disturbances is insufficient. In this study, aerial photos were taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) within a typical alpine meadow ecosystem, over four monitoring sites with different area fraction of bare patches: almost no bare patches (NBP, < 5%), low bare patches (LBP, 5%Â ~Â 20%), moderate bare patches (MBP, 20%Â ~Â 60%) and high bare patches (HBP, > 60%) during 2015 and 2018. The relationship between the changes of pika disturbances and bare patches were analyzed based on these aerial photos. Results showed that: 1) changes of pika holes and bare patches were not significant (PÂ >Â 0.05) at MBP and HBP, while they increased significantly (PÂ <Â 0.05) at NBP, which suggested that the increase of bare patches could be ascribed to increase of pika holes. However, both pika holes and bare patches almost disappeared at LBP in three years, implying a high resilience of this site; 2) the differences in correlations between the pika hole density and the area fraction of bare patches were remarkable among different sites. Specifically, there were significant linear correlation at NBP (yÂ =Â 642.01xÂ +Â 506.52, RÂ²Â =Â 0.91; PÂ <Â 0.05) and HBP (yÂ =Â â29.036xÂ +Â 2983.9, RÂ²Â =Â 0.72, PÂ <Â 0.01), and a significant negative correlation in exponential form at MBP (yÂ =Â 2632.3eâ»â°.â°Â²Â²Ë£, RÂ²Â =Â 0.50, PÂ <Â 0.05), while no significant correlation was observed between the two at LBP. We concluded that the changes in bare patches and their relationship with pika disturbances were diverse over a short period. Therefore, long-term repeated aerial photographing over grasslands at different stages of degradation is required for further research, and UAV is a feasible tool to fulfill the task.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOchotona curzoniae 3aalpine meadows 3aecosystems 3afractional vegetation cover 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aAlpine meadow 0aUAV aerial Photo 0aPlateau pika 0aBare patches 0aFragMAP1 aLiu, Dawei1 aMeng, Baoping1 aChen, Jianjun1 aWang, Xiaoyun1 aJiang, Hui1 aYu, Yue1 aYi, Shuhua0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2021 Apr., v. 26 p.e01517-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e015173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009800171300001400269520102100283592002801304650001801332650001901350650001001369650001101379650002001390650002201410650000901432650002001441650002301461653000701484653000901491653000801500653000801508653000801516653004201524653005301566653004601619653003301665653003501698653001801733653001401751653002201765653001001787653001301797653003301810700002401843700001801867700001901885700002001904773009801924856008702022961001202109852000902121655001202130IND60560447620221122064451.0190402e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056044762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.12.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, T.L.10aComparison between titrimetric and spectrophotometric methods for quantification of vitamin C  ap. 92-96.  aVitamin C is usually quantified by titrimetric or chromatographic methods. However, these methods have limitations: food color interferes with the titrimetric method and the chromatographic method is costly. The aim of this study was to compare a spectrophotometric method, based on reduction of cupric ions in the presence of cuproine complex, with a titrimetric method, based on reduction of 2,6-dicholorophenolindophenol. Linearity, precision, accuracy, and limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were evaluated using a standard vitamin C solution. Both methods were also applied for AA quantification in industrialized orange and pineapple juices. The methods were precise and accurate when applied to the standard solution. The spectrophotometric method was more sensitive, with lower values for LOD (0.002mgmLâ1) and LOQ (0.010mgmLâ1), and more accurate with error less than 5% while results from the titrimetric method were affected by the juice color, which generated errors in excess of 15%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3achromatography 3acolor 3acopper 3adetection limit 3aindustrialization 3aions 3apineapple juice 3aspectrophotometers 0aAA 0aDCPI 0aDHA 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0aAscorbic acid (PubChem CID: 54670067) 0a2,6-Dichlorophenolindophenol (PubChem CID:13726) 0aDehydroascorbic acid (PubChem CID:440667) 0aCuproine (PubChem CID: 8412) 0aOxalic acid (PubChem CID: 971) 0aAscorbic acid 0aTitration 0aSpectrophotometry 0aJuice 0aCuproine 0a2,6-Dichlorophenolindophenol1 aAguiar-Oliveira, E.1 aMazalli, M.R.1 aKamimura, E.S.1 aMaldonado, R.R.0 tFood chemistry.g2017 June 01, v. 224 p.92-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.12.0523Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/DA  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012600172520113900298592002801437650002001465650002101485650002601506650001501532650002201547650001501569650001301584650001201597650001501609650003001624650002501654650001901679650000901698650001901707650002801726650001001754651001001764653001701774653002101791653002501812653002401837700001601861700002001877700002301897700002501920773011301945856008602058852000902144655001202153IND60702696920221118000631.0201024e20201120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070269692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1231352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgarwal, Sucheta12aA qualitative approach towards crucial factors for sustainable development of women social entrepreneurship: Indian cases  aWomen entrepreneur has exceptional capabilities and proficiencies such as innovative and creative orientation, leadership qualities, self and social awareness, ability to identify opportunities, risk taking capacity equipped with ability to commercialize resources through the production of goods and services to meet the present market needs.

Due to the rapid adoption of high-throughput sequencing methods over the last decade, the number of protein sequences in GenBank and other public databases has increased dramatically. Many of these protein sequences are the product of whole genome sequencing efforts, coupled with automated protein sequence prediction and annotation pipelines. Published genome sequencing studies provide a rich and expanding foundation of new source organisms and proteins for insect control or other desirable traits in GM products. However, data generated by automated pipelines can also confound regulatory safety assessments that employ bioinformatics. Largely this issue does not arise due to underlying sequence, but rather its annotation or associated metadata, and the downstream integration of that data into existing repositories. Observations made during bioinformatic safety assessments are described.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acid sequences 3aautomation 3abioinformatics 3agenome 3ainsect control 3ainvertebrates 3ametadata 3aprediction 3aproduct safety 3asafety assessment 0aBioinformatics 0aToxin database 0aAllergen database 0aPore-forming protein 0aGenetically modified (GM) 0aSafety assessment1 aSilvanovich, Andre0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2021 Nov., v. 186 p.107587-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2021.1075873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002500148245012200173300001600295500001500311520191000326592002802236650001402264650002302278650002602301650002102327650001502348650001702363650001102380650001402391650001502405650001502420650001002435650002102445650001502466650001002481650001802491650003002509650002302539650001702562650001702579651001202596651001102608651001202619651001102631653002202642700001602664773011102680856008402791852000902875655001202884IND4460649520221122055345.0141112e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446064952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2011.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZimmer, Christoph T.10aCytochrome P450 mediated pyrethroid resistance in European populations of Meligethes aeneus (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae)  ap. 264-272.  a2019-12-06  aPollen beetle, Meligethes aeneus (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) is a major pest on several million hectares in European winter oilseed rape cultivation. Synthetic pyrethroids have been successfully used for many years to keep them under economic damage thresholds. Recently wide-spread resistance development to pyrethroids in pollen beetle populations was described in many European countries, including Germany, France, Poland, Denmark and others. Resistance monitoring is conducted by incubating beetles for 24h in glass vials coated with different concentrations of lambda-cyhalothrin. Using such an assay format we were able to show cross-resistance to other pyrethroids, such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and to a somewhat lower extent bifenthrin, etofenprox and tau-fluvalinate. Here we also investigated in more detail in 27 different populations the biochemical mechanism of pyrethroid resistance. Synergism experiments revealed a high synergistic potential for piperonyl butoxide in vivo, whereas other compounds such as S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate and diethylmaleimide failed to suppress pyrethroid resistance. Incubating microsomal fractions of pollen beetle with deltamethrin and subsequent LCÃ¢ÂÂMS/MS analysis revealed 4-OH-deltamethrin as the major metabolite. Metabolite formation in vitro and pyrethroid resistance in vivo is correlated and inhibition trials with piperonyl butoxide, tebuconazole and aminobenzotriazole suggest the involvement of cytochrome P450Ã¢ÂÂ²s. Furthermore we were able to show cross-resistance to tau-fluvalinate which is supported by the competitive inhibition of 4-OH-deltamethrin formation by increasing concentrations of tau-fluvalinate in microsomal hydroxylation assays. Although we provided clear experimental evidence for an oxidative mechanism of resistance in numerous populations, other mechanisms might be involved based on the data discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomics 3alambda-cyhalothrin 3aBrassicogethes aeneus 3across resistance 3apyrethrins 3adeltamethrin 3apollen 3asynergism 3amonitoring 3aetofenprox 3aglass 3acytochrome P-450 3abifenthrin 3apests 3ahydroxylation 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3apiperonyl butoxide 3atebuconazole 3acypermethrin 3aGermany 3aFrance 3aDenmark 3aPoland 0aMeligethes aeneus1 aNauen, Ralf0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2011 July, v. 100, no. 3 p.264-272dElsevier Inc.x0048-35757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2011.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245006600159300001400225500001100239520148000250592002801730650002001758650001701778650002001795650001401815650001501829650001901844650001901863650001101882650001701893650001301910650001701923650001701940650001601957650001401973650002201987650002602009651001002035700002102045700002202066700002102088700002402109700002402133773010102157856007202258852000902330655001202339IND60572140920221121034353.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057214092DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.57342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMannucci, Carmen10aClinical Pharmacology of Citrus bergamia: A Systematic Review  ap. 27-39.  aREVIEW  aCitrus bergamia Risso et Poiteau (âBergamotâ) originated from the Mediterranean ecoregion (southern Italy, Calabria). Bergamot essential oil (BEO) is used in perfumes, cosmetics, and for stress reduction. Juice from C.âbergamia has been used for hyperlipidemia. We evaluated literature published on C.âbergamia clinical applications. Clinical trials on C.âbergamia not combined with other substances, published in English, were searched. We selected ten articles, six describing BEO effects on stress, three reporting effects of polyphenolic fraction of C.âbergamia juice in hyperlipidemia and the last describing BEO effects in chronic psoriasis. Clinical studies were analyzed following Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for herbal therapy. Studies were conducted on small sample sizes and not have high quality level. Analysis indicates that BEO aromatherapy could be safe and useful to reduce stress symptoms. One study suggests its potential supportive role in ultraviolet B therapy against psoriasis. Supplementation with polyphenols from bergamot juice reduces plasma lipids and improves lipoprotein profile in moderate hyperlipidemia. Effectiveness and safety of C.âbergamia cannot be definitively drawn because of publication bias and low quality level of the majority of studies. Further largeâscale trials with rigorous design are required to define the role of C.âbergamia in clinical practice.

Countries reporting outbreaks included Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, France, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, Serbia, and the United States. Together, these outbreaks resulted in 1946 reported human illnesses, 128 hospitalizations and two deaths. Infants/children were the primary population segments impacted by 36% (5/14) of spice-attributed outbreaks. Four outbreaks were associated with multiple organisms. Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica was identified as the causative agent in 71% (10/14) of outbreaks, accounting for 87% of reported illnesses. Bacillus spp. was identified as the causative agent in 29% (4/10) of outbreaks, accounting for 13% of illnesses. 71% (10/14) of outbreaks were associated with spices classified as fruits or seeds of the source plant. Consumption of ready-to-eat foods prepared with spices applied after the final food manufacturing pathogen reduction step accounted for 70% of illnesses. Pathogen growth in spiced food is suspected to have played a role in some outbreaks, but it was not likely a contributing factor in three of the larger Salmonella outbreaks, which involved low-moisture foods. Root causes of spice contamination included contributions from both early and late stages of the farm-to-table continuum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aSalmonella enterica 3achildren 3afarm to fork 3afood processing 3afoodborne illness 3afruits 3ahumans 3ainfants 3amanufacturing 3amicrobial contamination 3apathogens 3aready-to-eat foods 3aseeds 3aspices 2aBacillusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aFood Contaminationxanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 2aFoodborne Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aHospitalization 2aHumans 2aSalmonellaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSpicesxmicrobiology 3aCanada 3aDenmark 3aEngland 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aNew Zealand 3aNorway 3aSerbia 3aUnited States 3aWales 0aAsiaxepidemiology. 0aEuropexepidemiology. 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology. 0aFoodborne illness 0aSpice 0aSalmonella 0aFood safety 0aMicrobial contaminants1 aNeil, Karen P.1 aParish, Mickey1 aGieraltowski, Laura1 aGould, L.

Recent data suggests that neoagarooligosaccharides (NAOs) can exert anti-obesity effect. However, the effects of NAOs on the gut microbiota and its association with metabolic syndrome have never been explored yet. Therefore, metabolic changes and the modulation of the gut microbiome after NAOs feeding to obese rats was investigated. NAOs supplementation reduced body weight, and improved lipogenesis, cholesterol and glucose levels. In addition, NAOs administration enriched several taxa negatively associated with obesity, specifically Eubacterium fissicatena and Ruminococcaceae UCG-005. The results indicated that the effects of NAOs on the improvement of obesity and glucose/lipid metabolism in obese rats may be associated with their modulatory effect on gut microbiome. The present findings provide novel insights on the anti-obesity mechanism of NAOs through gut microbiome modulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRuminococcaceae 3aanti-obesity effects 3abody weight changes 3acholesterol 3adysbiosis 3aglucose 3ahigh fat diet 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipogenesis 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3aoligosaccharides 3aprebiotics 0aNeoagarooligosaccharides 0aFaecal microbiota 0aRat 0aACE 0aALT 0aAST 0aELISA 0aFFAs 0aHDL-C 0aHFD 0aHs-CRP 0aHOMA-IR/G1 0aKEGG 0aLEfSe 0aLDL-C 0aNAO 0aPCoA 0aQIIME 0aTC 0aTG1 aVasquez, Robie1 aKim, Sang Hoon1 aLee, Je Hyeon1 aKim, Å¬n-ju,1 aHong, Soon-Kwang1 aKang, Dae-Kyung0 tJournal of functional foods.g2022 Jan., v. 88 p.104869-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.1048693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013800174300001600312520119500328592002801523650001901551650001101570650001501581650001201596650001201608650001801620650002501638650002301663650001501686650001701701650001901718650001901737650001801756650002601774650002801800650000701828650002101835650001101856653001601867653002401883653003201907653001701939700002101956700002401977700002302001700002402024773010002048856008602148852000902234655001202243IND60676785220221119203236.0200318e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067678522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2019.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNdukwe, Johnson K.10aMechanisms of weak acid-induced stress tolerance in yeasts: Prospects for improved bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass  ap. 118-130.  aWeak acids are known to have a negative impact on yeast performance, restraining production efficiency during the production of bioethanol and other fermentative yeast-derived products. These acids, which might be hydrophilic or lipophilic exert negative effects on yeasts when they diffuse into the cell in their unionized state as a result of their pH being lower than the pka of yeast growth medium. Consequently, the unionized acids dissociate into their respective cations and anions, as intracellular pH is typically neutral. Further, proton accumulation tends to reduce intracellular pH. As a result, the anions destabilize the internal cell machinery, thus affecting cellular metabolism on various levels. Overcoming this acid-mediated stress in budding yeast would in part, harness the potential of using lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysate â which is typically acetic acid-rich â as a cheaper feedstock for large-scale bioethanol production. Since organic acids are key intermediates in ethanol fermentation, this review focuses on the prospects of bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass using weak acid-tolerant strains of yeasts derived by metabolic engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid tolerance 3aanions 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3acations 3aculture media 3aethanol fermentation 3aethanol production 3afeedstocks 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrophilicity 3alignocellulose 3alipophilicity 3ametabolic engineering 3aorganic acids and salts 3apH 3astress tolerance 3ayeasts 0aAcetic acid 0aWeak acid tolerance 0aLigcocellulosic hydrolysate 0aFermentation1 aAliyu, Godwin O.1 aOnwosi, Chukwudi O.1 aChukwu, Kenechi O.1 aEzugworie, Flora N.0 tProcess biochemistry.g2020 Mar., v. 90 p.118-130dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2019.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245007300163300001600236520127800252592002801530650001801558650001101576650002101587650001301608650000801621650001401629650001701643651002901660700002201689700001901711700001901730700001801749700002501767700002001792700001701812700002001829700002001849700002001869773009801889856008101987852000902068655001202077IND4472491020221122055356.0141111e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447249102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2012.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakurte, Ilva10aDiscovery of lunasin peptide in triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack)  ap. 510-514.  aLunasin is a novel, cancer-preventive, anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-reducing peptide that was originally isolated from soy and later from barley, wheat and rye. We report the first discovery of lunasin in triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack). Moreover, we report first data of lunasin content in winter rye and wheat genotypes grown in Northern Europe. These data are novel as previously published data on finding of lunasin in cereals were obtained in genotypes grown in Korea. Lunasin content was uncovered using a previously published procedure for isolation from cereals and identified by LC-MS/MS assay. We found that triticale was the most lunasin-rich cereal, with the tested genotypes displaying the following trend in lunasin content: genotype 0002-26ÃÂ >ÃÂ DinaroÃÂ >ÃÂ DSGU 10/94ÃÂ >ÃÂ 0213-22ÃÂ >ÃÂ 0317-14ÃÂ >ÃÂ 0006-31. The greatest lunasin content was 6.46ÃÂ mg/g in the grain of triticale genotype 0002-26. In comparison, the highest lunasin content in rye variety Dankovske Diament was 1.5ÃÂ mg/g, and the highest lunasin content in the winter wheat variety Fredis was 0.23ÃÂ mg/g. We conclude that triticale can play a significant role as functional food, with great potential for the use of triticale products in human and animal diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticosecale 3abarley 3afunctional foods 3agenotype 3arye 3atriticale 3awinter wheat 3aNorthern European region1 aKlavins, Kristaps1 aKirhnere, Inga1 aNamniece, Jana1 aAdlere, Liene1 aMatvejevs, Jaroslavs1 aKronberga, Arta1 aKokare, Aina1 aStrazdina, Vija1 aLegzdina, Linda1 aMuceniece, Ruta0 tJournal of cereal science.g2012 Sept., v. 56, no. 2 p.510-514dElsevier Ltdx0733-52107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2012.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009400174300001800268520054700286592002800833650002300861650002300884650002400907650002400931650002200955653001400977653001300991653002001004653001001024653001901034653003201053653003201085653003201117653003201149653003201181653003201213653003201245653003201277653003201309653003201341653003201373653003201405653003201437653003201469653003201501653003201533700002501565700002801590700002401618773008101642856008101723852000901804655001201813IND60551352120221117215920.0161018e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055135212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.01.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz-Carretero, Amparo10aMicrowave-assisted selective and efficient synthesis of 1,3,5-triazinyl mono and bisureas  ap. 1733-1739.  aAn efficient and sustainable microwave-assisted approach for the one-step preparation of a wide range of 1,3,5-triazinyl mono- and bisureas has been developed, combining solvent-free conditions and microwave irradiation.

Though the role of Hsp70s in the prion maintenance is well studied, how Hsp90 chaperone machinery affects yeast prions remains unclear. In the current study, we examined the role of Hsp90 and its co-chaperones on yeast prions [PSIâº] and [URE3]. We show that the overproduction of Hsp90 co-chaperone Tah1, cures [URE3] which is a prion form of native protein Ure2 in yeast. The Hsp90 co-chaperone Tah1 is involved in the assembly of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNP) and chromatin remodelling complexes. We found that Tah1 deletion improves the frequency of de novo appearance of [URE3]. The Tah1 was found to interact with Hsp70. The lack of Tah1 not only represses antagonizing effect of Ssa1 Hsp70 on [URE3] but also improves the prion strength suggesting role of Tah1 in both fibril growth and replication. We show that the N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain of Tah1 is indispensable for [URE3] curing. Tah1 interacts with Ure2, improves its solubility in [URE3] strains, and affects the kinetics of Ure2 fibrillation in vitro. Its inhibitory role on Ure2 fibrillation is proposed to influence [URE3] propagation. The present study shows a novel role of Tah1 in yeast prion propagation, and that Hsp90 not only promotes its role in ribosomal RNA processing but also in the prion maintenance.Prions are self-perpetuating infectious proteins. What initiates the misfolding of a protein into its prion form is still not clear. The understanding of cellular factors that facilitate or antagonize prions is crucial to gain insight into the mechanism of prion formation and propagation. In the current study, we reveal that Tah1 is a novel modulator of yeast prion [URE3]. The Hsp90 co-chaperone Tah1, is required for the formation of small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complex. We show that the absence of Tah1 improves the induction of [URE3] prion. The overexpressed Tah1 cures [URE3], and this function is promoted by Hsp90 chaperones. The current study thus provides a novel cellular factor and the underlying mechanism, involved in the prion formation and propagation  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatin 3amolecular biology 3aprions 3aribonucleoproteins 3aribosomal RNA 3asolubility 3atetratricopeptide repeats 3ayeasts 0aTah1 0aHsp90 0aR2TP Complex 0a[URE3] prion 0aFibrils1 aSingh, Priyanka1 aKumar, Navinder1 aKumar, Rajesh1 aSharma, Deepak1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1104-575X0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2021 June 25, v. 433, no. 13 p.166976-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2021.1669763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04043naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003400113040001800147100002500165245015000190300001600340520161200356592002801968650003101996650002602027650002502053650002802078650002302106650002802129650004302157650002602200650001802226650001702244650001002261650001602271650001302287650001502300650001102315650001402326650001502340650000902355650001302364650004002377650001702417650008402434650002402518650003002542650004002572650003202612650003102644650002202675651001802697651002402715653002502739653002202764653002602786653002602812653001602838653000902854653001002863653004302873700003502916700001902951700001702970700001702987700001903004700001903023700002003042773012103062856008103183852000903264655001203273IND60112530820221119023146.0190405e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011253082DNAL7 a240106302pmid7 a10.1016/j.fm.2013.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMicallef, Shirley A.10aDiversity, distribution and antibiotic resistance of Enterococcus spp. recovered from tomatoes, leaves, water and soil on U.S. Mid-Atlantic farms  ap. 465-474.  aAntibiotic-resistant enterococci are important opportunistic pathogens and have been recovered from retail tomatoes. However, it is unclear where and how tomatoes are contaminated along the farm-to-fork continuum. Specifically, the degree of pre-harvest contamination with enterococci is unknown. We evaluated the prevalence, diversity and antimicrobial susceptibilities of enterococci collected from tomato farms in the Mid-Atlantic United States. Tomatoes, leaves, groundwater, pond water, irrigation ditch water, and soil were sampled and tested for enterococci using standard methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the Sensititre microbroth dilution system. Enterococcus faecalis isolates were characterized using amplified fragment length polymorphism to assess dispersal potential. Enterococci (nÂ =Â 307) occurred in all habitats and colonization of tomatoes was common. Seven species were identified: Enterococcus casseliflavus, E.Â faecalis, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avis, Enterococcus hirae and Enterococcus raffinosus. E.Â casseliflavus predominated in soil and on tomatoes and leaves, and E.Â faecalis predominated in pond water. On plants, distance from the ground influenced presence of enterococci. E.Â faecalis from samples within a farm were more closely related than those from samples between farms. Resistance to rifampicin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was prevalent. Consumption of raw tomatoes as a potential exposure risk for antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus spp. deserves further attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus casseliflavus 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aEnterococcus gallinarum 3aEnterococcus hirae 3aEnterococcus raffinosus 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aantibiotic resistance 3aciprofloxacin 3afarm to fork 3afarms 3agroundwater 3ahabitats 3airrigation 3aleaves 3apathogens 3arifampicin 3arisk 3atomatoes 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBiodiversity 2aEnterococcusxclassificationxdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFruitxmicrobiology 2aGroundwaterxmicrobiology 2aSolanum lycopersicumxmicrobiology. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiology 2aSoil Microbiology 3aUnited States 0aMid-Atlantic Region 0aPre-harvest tomatoes 0aEnterococcus spp. 0aEnterococcus faecalis 0aAntibiotic resistance 0aFood safety 0aSoil 0aWater 0aAmplified fragment length polymorphism1 aRosenberg Goldstein, Rachel E.1 aGeorge, Ashish1 aEwing, Laura1 aTall, Ben D.1 aBoyer, Marc S.1 aJoseph, Sam W.1 aSapkota, Amy R.0 tFood microbiology.g2013 Dec., v. 36, no. 2 p.465-474dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2013.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008000162300001800242520200600260592002802266650001202294650002102306650001502327650001502342650002502357650001402382650001402396650002302410650001102433650002702444650002102471650000902492650001802501650001902519650001102538650001002549650001602559650001202575650001802587700002302605700002002628700002002648700001802668773010502686856007502791852000902866655001202875IND60534049320221119030716.0160802e20131121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053404932DNAL7 a10.1021/ef401410v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManuale, Debora
L.10aAdjustment of the Biodiesel Free Fatty Acids Content by Means of Adsorption  ap. 6763-6772.  aThe elimination of free fatty acids (FFAs) and water from biodiesel is usually performed in industrial practice using different units for neutralization with caustic, washing, and drying of the fuel. Adjustment of the acidity, however, can be performed in only one operation using bleaching tanks and commercial adsorbents. The current article explores the use of several adsorbents (TriSyl commercial silicas, diatomaceous earth, impregnated activated carbon) and varying process conditions (temperatures, vacuum levels, residence times) for the removal of FFAs from commercial biodiesel fuel. It was found that silica TriSyl 3000 was the best performing adsorbent, with a capacity for the removal of FFAs of about 1 g gâÂ¹ at high values of biodiesel acidity. The two factors influencing the capacity for FFA adsorption are the temperature and the silica residual water content. The latter depends on both the temperature and especially the vacuum level of the pretreatment step. The FFA uptakes over TriSyl silicas in a vacuum were 3â4 times larger than that obtained at atmospheric pressure. The adsorption curves were linear in the range of interest (0â2% acidity), and hence, Henryâs law could be used. Values of the Henryâs constant of 30.0â47.6 (dimensionless) were measured for TriSyl 3000 silica, along with a heat of adsorption of â5.7 kcal molâÂ¹. From the kinetic point of view, FFA adsorption is rather slow despite the small diameter of the particles used. The system was found to be highly constrained either by intrinsic slow kinetics or by intraparticle mass-transfer resistance. An unfavorable adsorption equilibrium leading to high adsorbent consumption in one-bleacher operation suggested the use of a countercurrent liquidâsolid mode of operation with multiple bleachers. Simulation of two and three serial bleachers working in countercurrent mode revealed that savings greater than 60% can be obtained by using three bleachers operating in countercurrent flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aatmospheric pressure 3abiodiesel 3ableaching 3adiatomaceous earth 3adrying 3afatty acid composition 3afree fatty acids 3aheat 3amass transfer 3aneutralization 3asilica 3atanks 3atemperature 3awashing 3awater content1 aTorres, Gerardo C.1 aBadano, Juan M.1 aVera, Carlos R.1 aYori, Juan C.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2013 Nov. 21, v. 27, no. 11 p.6763-6772dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef401410v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04417naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014900168300001300317520227200330592002802602650002502630650001402655650002002669650002902689650001002718650001302728650002702741650001102768650001402779650003302793650001902826653001602845653001602861653002402877653002102901700002502922700006302947700002003010700001803030700002703048700002203075700002403097700001903121700002303140700002203163700002503185700002003210700002003230700002603250700002403276700002703300700003003327700002303357700002303380700006203403700002203465700002203487700001603509700001903525773009703544856008103641852000903722655001203731IND60544610920221119153537.0190417e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054461092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cpb.2014.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzakonyi, DÃ³ra,14aThe KnownLeaf literature curation system captures knowledge about Arabidopsis leaf growth and development and facilitates integrated data mining  ap. 1-11.  aThe information that connects genotypes and phenotypes is essentially embedded in research articles written in natural language. To facilitate access to this knowledge, we constructed a framework for the curation of the scientific literature studying the molecular mechanisms that control leaf growth and development in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). Standard structured statements, called relations, were designed to capture diverse data types, including phenotypes and gene expression linked to genotype description, growth conditions, genetic and molecular interactions, and details about molecular entities. Relations were then annotated from the literature, defining the relevant terms according to standard biomedical ontologies. This curation process was supported by a dedicated graphical user interface, called Leaf Knowtator. A total of 283 primary research articles were curated by a community of annotators, yielding 9947 relations monitored for consistency and over 12,500 references to Arabidopsis genes. This information was converted into a relational database (KnownLeaf) and merged with other public Arabidopsis resources relative to transcriptional networks, proteinâprotein interaction, gene co-expression, and additional molecular annotations. Within KnownLeaf, leaf phenotype data can be searched together with molecular data originating either from this curation initiative or from external public resources. Finally, we built a network (LeafNet) with a portion of the KnownLeaf database content to graphically represent the leaf phenotype relations in a molecular context, offering an intuitive starting point for knowledge mining. Literature curation efforts such as ours provide high quality structured information accessible to computational analysis, and thereby to a wide range of applications.DATA: The presented work was performed in the framework of the AGRON-OMICS project (Arabidopsis GRO wth Network integrating OMICS technologies) supported by European Commission 6th Framework Programme project (Grant number LSHG-CT-2006-037704).

In this study, we demonstrate that NAADP-AM, a membrane-permeant analogue of the new second messenger nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), mobilizes CaÂ²âº in astrocytes and that the response is blocked by Ned-19, an antagonist of NAADP signalling. We also show that NAADP receptors are expressed in lysosome-related acidic vesicles. Pharmacological disruption of either NAADP or lysosomal signalling reduced CaÂ²âº responses induced by ATP and endothelin-1, but not by bradykinin. Furthermore, ATP increased endogenous NAADP levels. Overall, our data provide evidence for NAADP being an intracellular messenger for agonist-mediated calcium signalling in astrocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aantagonists 3aastrocytes 3abradykinin 3acalcium 3acalcium signaling 3areceptors 3asynaptic transmission1 aLewis, Alexander M.1 aGubern, Albert1 aBarneda, David1 aBloor-Young, Duncan1 aPicatoste, Fernado1 aChurchill, Grant C.1 aClaro, Enrique1 aMasgrau, Roser0 tFEBS letters.g2011 July 21, v. 585, no. 14 p.2300-2306dElsevier B.V.x0014-57937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2011.05.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245014700176300001600323520191400339592002802253650003002281650002102311650001502332650001702347650002402364650001302388650001302401650001502414650002102429650001502450650001202465650002002477650001502497650000902512650001702521650001302538650002002551650001802571650001502589650001802604650002002622651001402642653002702656653003802683653001702721653001902738653003002757653002302787700002202810700002102832773011602853856008502969852000903054655001203063IND60611994620221121223739.0200515e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061199462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcEachran, Zachary P.10aFrom skid trails to landscapes: Vegetation is the dominant factor influencing erosion after forest harvest in a low relief glaciated landscape  ap. 299-311.  aWater quality in working forested watersheds is generally high, but forestry activities may cause sedimentation of surface water if best management practices (BMPs) are not implemented during harvesting. As water resources are often managed at a landscape scale (such as by ecoregion or watershed), and BMPs are often implemented at the feature scale (such as forest road or skid trail), it is imperative to understand how biophysical factors influencing erosion (e.g., slope, soil properties, rainfall, and vegetation) behave across multiple scales. Our objective was to identify which biophysical factors determine whether erosion occurs after forest harvesting in a low relief glaciated region at the feature, harvest site, and landscape scales in order to aid in BMP optimization and ecological assessment of erosion dynamics in working forested watersheds. We analyzed monitoring data from forest roads, skid trails, and log landings on spatially referenced harvest sites in Minnesota, USA collected between 2004 and 2016 to identify major erosion risk factors. Post-harvest vegetative cover levels are more important than slope, soils, and climate factors at all spatial scales for explaining the occurrence of erosion. At the landscape scale, we identified a moderate inverse relationship between mean erosion and vegetative cover levels on sites located in different ecoregions (rÂ²â¯=â¯0.66) and a strong relationship for sites located on different glacial landforms (rÂ²â¯=â¯0.90). Vegetative cover is a dominant factor controlling erosion occurrence after forest harvesting in low relief glaciated regions, and glacial history is an important driver of both erosion and vegetation dynamics at the landscape scale for these regions. Revegetation BMPs and harvest practices that promote revegetation should be focused on high-erosion landscapes to reduce erosion where it is most likely to occur.  aPublisher supplied data 3abest management practices 3aclimatic factors 3aecoregions 3aforest roads 3aforested watersheds 3aforestry 3aglaciers 3aharvesting 3aland restoration 3alandscapes 3alogging 3aman-made trails 3amonitoring 3arain 3arisk factors 3askidders 3asoil properties 3asurface water 3avegetation 3awater quality 3awater resources 3aMinnesota 0aForestry water quality 0aWatershed management and planning 0aForest roads 0aTimber harvest 0aBest management practices 0aErosion risk areas1 aSlesak, Robert A.1 aKarwan, Diana L.0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 430 p.299-311dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002000165245009200185300001600277520090400293592002801197650003701225650001901262650002501281650001001306650002001316650001201336650001801348650001201366650003101378650006401409650002001473650001201493650002501505700002301530700002101553700002301574773011301597856008201710852000901792655001201801IND4461284720221123002640.0141112e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446128472DNAL7 a208259602pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeixeira, Luzia12aA simple and rapid method for isolation of caliciviruses from liver of infected rabbits  ap. 164-166.  aRabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV), a member of the Caliciviridae family, is the etiologic agent of Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD); this viral disease is highly contagious and kills more than 90% of infected adult rabbits. Research on experimental calicivirus infection uses inocula obtained from livers of rabbits dying from calicivirus infection. This implies that caliciviruses have to be purified from liver homogenates. Current methods to isolate caliciviruses from rabbit livers are time consuming. We propose here a new procedure for fast purification of rabbit caliciviruses from liver homogenates that uses centrifugation through an iodixanol gradient. This method offers in approximately 2h a sample with a high degree of calicivirus purity, as shown by its biochemical and immunocytochemistry analysis, which is also able to kill adult rabbits from RHD within 48h of inoculation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 3acentrifugation 3aisolation techniques 3aliver 3arabbit diseases 3arabbits 3arapid methods 2aAnimals 2aCentrifugationxveterinary 2aHemorrhagic Disease Virus, Rabbitxisolation & purification 2aLiverxvirology 2aRabbits 2aTriiodobenzoic Acids1 aMarques, Raquel M.1 aÃguas, Artur P.1 aFerreira, Paula G.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2011 Aug., v. 91, no. 1 p.164-166dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0034-52887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013000170300001200300520223500312592002802547650003002575650002002605650001902625650003002644650001902674650001402693650001102707650001702718650001502735650001402750650001702764650001502781650000902796650002602805650001502831650001602846650002502862653001102887653001402898653001802912653002702930700001402957700001802971773008802989856008403077852000903161655001203170IND60547583420221122222612.0160903s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054758342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2015.07.1252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuraweera, D.D.10aImpact of Elevated Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Water Deficit on Flower Development and Pyrethrin Accumulation in Pyrethrum  ap. 5-6.  aCrop responses in a changing climate reflect the interplay among rising temperature, changing rainfall patterns and increasing atmospheric Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Exposure of plants to elevated atmospheric CO2 not only induces the changes in primary metabolism, but also leads to complex alterations in secondary metabolism. Elevated CO2 could delay the onset of water deficit and counterbalance negative effects of water deficit on plant growth by increasing water use efficiency. Pyrethrum (Tanacetum cinerariifolium) is commercially grown for extraction of pyrethrin in the achenes of the flower heads. Pyrethrin is classified as terpenoid and widely used as a natural insecticide. The response of pyrethrum, a perennial crop producing important secondary metabolites, to climate change is not known. In this experiment, plants were subjected to two water treatments (well-watered and water deficit) at two atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ambient CO2: 390ppm and elevated CO2: 700ppm). Watering treatments were applied throughout the flowering period, until physiological maturity of flowers. Selected growth, yield, phenological and physiological traits were measured to understand the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and water deficit on flower development and pyrethrin accumulation. The results of this experiment showed that exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2 throughout the flowering period, significantly increased flower yield and pyrethrin yield per plant (Figure. 1) at physiological maturity due to the production of more flowers. Elevated CO2 treatments significantly increased the rate of flower development resulting in shorter flowering period and lower pyrethrin yield per flower compared to ambient CO2 treatments. Exposure to water deficit during the post-anthesis period significantly reduced flower yield and total pyrethrin yield compared to well-watered treatments. The interaction of water deficit with elevated atmospheric CO2 increased the rate of flower development resulting in shorter flowering period and lower pyrethrin yield. Adequate soil moisture for flower development increased the rate and duration of pyrethrin accumulation resulting in higher pyrethrin yield per flower.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTanacetum cinerariifolium 3aadverse effects 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate change 3aflowering 3afruits 3ainsecticides 3ametabolism 3aphenology 3aplant growth 3apyrethrins 3arain 3asecondary metabolites 3asoil water 3atemperature 3awater use efficiency 0aachene 0apyrethrin 0apost-anthesis 0aphysiological maturity1 aGroom, T.1 aNicolas, M.E.0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2015, v. 29 p.5-6dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2015.07.1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012500162300001600287500002000303520131200323592002801635650002001663650002401683650001101707650001401718650001001732650002201742650002901764650001201793700002101805700002001826700002601846700002301872700002701895773011201922856007802034852000902112655001202121IND60585639520221116150358.0171112e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058563952DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2017000722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousuf, Jesmi10aNitrogen fixing potential of various heterotrophic Bacillus strains from a tropical estuary and adjacent coastal regions  ap. 922-932.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the present study, we report the nitrogen fixing potential of heterotrophic diazotrophs isolated from a tropical estuary and adjacent coastal sea. Results of the study revealed that most of the species that are capable of fixing nitrogen in the study area belongs to the genus Bacillus. The isolates from the estuary showed maximum homology with Bacillus megaterium, B. cereus, B. safencis, B. licheniformis, B. aerophilus, B. oceanisediminis, B. flexus, B. aquimaris, B. vietnamensis, and B. subterraneaus, whereas the diazotrophic isolates from coastal samples were closely related to B. subtilis, B. megaterium, B. circulans, B. aerophilus, B. flexus, and B. oceanisediminis. Experimental studies to determine the nitrogen fixation potential of isolates revealed considerable variation among different strains and the highest nitrogen fixing potential was recorded in B. megaterium (210.05âÂ±â7.0ânmol CâHâ/mg protein/day) followed by B. flexus (108.76âÂ±â3.66ânmol CâHâ/mg protein/day) and B. circulans (98.28âÂ±â4.32ânmol CâHâ/mg protein/day).

An attempt is madse to state explicitly the conditions under which it would apply. A consideration of the kinetics of food uptake leads to the interpretation of the constant A as representing a ratio of two rate constants, kâ/kâ where kâ is the rate constant associated with first step in food uptake and kâ is associated with the second step which results in the freeing of the adsorption site. The constant r represents a composite expression, kâcâ/(qn) where câ/n is the number of adsorption sites per individual, and q is the amount of food required to produce a new individual. Density dependent population growth models must always include a second equation which describes the effect of population growth on the environment (in this case food supply). The failure of the logistic equation to provide the necessary generality for this effect is pointed out. The applicability of this model for a number of different bacterial populations using a variety of both energetic and substantive food as the growthâlimiting factor has been established for several years. Data are presented to show that it is also applicable to the unicellular alga, Isochrysis galbana, growing under limiting nitrate concentration and to several species of phytoplankton growing under limiting light intensity. The quantitative effects of preconditioning light intensity on chlorophyll per cell (câ/n) and on kâ are noted as examples of the usefulness of this more detailed consideration of the growth constants, r and A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsochrysis galbana 3aadsorption 3aalgae 3achlorophyll 3aequations 3afood availability 3agrowth models 3alight intensity 3amicroorganisms 3anitrates 3aphytoplankton 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth0 tEcology.g1967 Sept., v. 48, no. 5 p.715-722dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19337283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245009600156300001600252520167100268592002801939650002301967650002501990650001102015650001902026650002502045650001102070650002202081650001502103650001202118650001802130650002902148650001102177650001502188650002202203650001302225650001802238650002402256650001302280650000902293650001002302650001502312650001702327651001502344653001302359653002002372653003002392653002902422653002202451653001802473700002002491773008802511856007102599852000902670655001202679IND60523512920221119072716.0160623s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052351292DNAL7 a10.1071/RJ150842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGowen, Rebecca10aBioeconomic modelling of woody regrowth carbon offset options in productive grazing systems  ap. 307-317.  aAgricultural land has been identified as a potential source of greenhouse gas emissions offsets through biosequestration in vegetation and soil. In the extensive grazing land of Australia, landholders may participate in the Australian Governmentâs Emissions Reduction Fund and create offsets by reducing woody vegetation clearing and allowing native woody plant regrowth to grow. This study used bioeconomic modelling to evaluate the trade-offs between an existing central Queensland grazing operation, which has been using repeated tree clearing to maintain pasture growth, and an alternative carbon and grazing enterprise in which tree clearing is reduced and the additional carbon sequestered in trees is sold. The results showed that ceasing clearing in favour of producing offsets produces a higher net present value over 20 years than the existing cattle enterprise at carbon prices, which are close to current (2015) market levels (~$13t-1 CO2-e). However, by modifying key variables, relative profitability did change. Sensitivity analysis evaluated key variables, which determine the relative profitability of carbon and cattle. In order of importance these were: the carbon price, the gross margin of cattle production, the severity of the treeâgrass relationship, the area of regrowth retained, the age of regrowth at the start of the project, and to a lesser extent the cost of carbon project administration, compliance and monitoring. Based on the analysis, retaining regrowth to generate carbon income may be worthwhile for cattle producers in Australia, but careful consideration needs to be given to the opportunity cost of reduced cattle income.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioeconomic models 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3acarbon sequestration 3acattle 3acattle production 3acompliance 3agrazing 3agrazing lands 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aincome 3amonitoring 3aopportunity costs 3apastures 3aprofitability 3aprofits and margins 3aregrowth 3asoil 3atrees 3avegetation 3awoody plants 3aQueensland 0abrigalow 0abeef production 0aclimate change mitigation 0agreenhouse gas emissions 0aoptions modelling 0asequestration1 aBray, Steven G.0 tRangeland journal.g2016, v. 38, no. 3 p.307-317dCSIRO Publishingx1036-98727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ150843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245006700179300001600246500001900262500002000281520119900301592002801500650001801528650001901546650001701565650002501582650001601607650001501623650001001638650002201648650003301670650001401703650001101717650003001728650002201758650002401780651001201804651001901816700002401835700001901859700001801878773011501896856008802011852000902099655001202108IND60734343620221119104156.0210417e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073434362DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1469-8137.2001.00038.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWirsel, Stefan G.

There were differences in distribution between dry and flooded sites. Trichoderma sp. and Cylindrocarpon sp. were almost exclusively recovered from roots of reed growing at dry sites, whereas Microdochium sp. and Cladosporum sp. were more frequently found at flooded sites. The preference of Trichoderma sp. for drier sites was confirmed by a nested PCR assay targeting the variable ITS region. â¢ A diverse assemblage of endophytic fungi that differ in distribution between aerated and nonaerated soils is found in reed habitats. The rich mycoflora associated with roots in completely anaerobic soils might depend on downward oxygen transport via an aerenchymaâbased ventilation system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBasidiomycota 3aCylindrocarpon 3aMicrodochium 3aPhragmites australis 3aTrichoderma 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agenetic variation 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amycobiota 3aoxygen 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aventilation systems 3aGermany 3aLake Constance1 aLeibinger, Wolfgang1 aErnst, Michael1 aMendgen, Kurt0 tnew phytologist.g2001 Mar., v. 149, no. 3 p.589-598dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2001.00038.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245011700160520131300277592002801590650002401618650001701642650001701659650001501676650001101691650002101702650001601723650001101739650002001750650001001770651001201780700002201792773011901814856007201933852000902005655001202014IND60648818120221119033639.0190701e20180113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064881812DNAL7 a10.3390/f90100312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSladonja, Barbara10aCitizen Science as a Tool in Biological RecordingâA Case Study of <em>Ailanthus altissima</em> (Mill.) Swingle  aNon-native invasive species frequently appear in urban and non-urban ecosystems and may become a threat to biodiversity. Some of these newcomers are introduced accidentally, and others are introduced through a sequence of events caused by conscious human decisions. Involving the general public in biodiversity preservation activities could prevent the negative consequences of these actions. Accurate and reliable data collecting is the first step in invasive species management, and citizen science can be a useful tool to collect data and engage the public in science. We present a case study of biological recording of tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle) using a participatory citizen model. The first goal in this case study was to develop a cheap, widely accessible, and effective inventory method, and to test it by mapping tree of heaven in Croatia. A total of 90.61 km of roads and trails was mapped; 20 single plants and 19 multi-plant clusters (mapped as polygons) were detected. The total infested area was 2610 m2. The second goal was to educate citizens and raise awareness of this invasive species. The developed tool and suggested approach aided in improving invasive risk management in accordance with citizen science principles and can be applied to other species or areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAilanthus altissima 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3ahumans 3ainvasive species 3ainventories 3amodels 3arisk management 3aroads 3aCroatia1 aPoljuha, Danijela0 tForests.g2018 Jan. 13, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90100313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009500162300001800257520184800275592002802123650002502151650002102176650003002197650001302227650001902240650001502259650001102274650001102285650001302296650001802309650003102327650001502358650002002373773012202393856007402515852000902589655001202598IND60664440920221122231759.0190912e20130430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066444092DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra23372c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoukhvalov, D. W.10aDFT modeling of the covalent functionalization of graphene: from ideal to realistic models  ap. 7150-7159.  aThe production of multiple types of graphene, such as free standing, epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide and metals, graphene in solution, chemically grown graphene-like molecules, various graphene nanoribbons, and graphene oxide with different levels of reduction and various chemical composition, demonstrate the need for additional investigation beyond the basic principles of graphene functionalization for avoidance of occasional contradictions between the predictions from first-principles simulations and experimental results. Herein, we discuss the current state of modeling of the different types of graphene using density functional theory (DFT) methods. We focus on the static (substrate, shape, curvature, strain and doping) and dynamic (starting point of functionalization, migration barriers and stability of configurations) aspects that provide a more correct and selective modeling of the chemisorption of various chemical species on the graphene scaffold. Based on the recent modeling of experimentally realized functionalization of different types of graphene we can conclude that the formation of uniform one- or two-sided functionalized graphene discussed in earlier studies is an exception to the typical scenarios of graphene chemistry. The presence of different substrates, defects and lattice distortions, such as ripples and strain, results in the formation of clusters or lines from the functional groups. Several configurations of the chemical species on the graphene substrate have been found to exist with ideal models but are only stable for graphene functionalized under special conditions. The role of the technical parameters, such as the functionals and computational methods employed, and the important guidelines for the modeling of the chemical properties of various types of graphene are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3achemical species 3adensity functional theory 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aguidelines 3ametals 3amodels 3amoieties 3ananomaterials 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprediction 3asilicon carbide0 tRSC advances.g2013 Apr. 30, v. 3, no. 20 p.7150-7159dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra23372c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245019100155300001600346520107900362592002801441650000901469650001601478650001801494650002901512650001001541650002001551650001501571650002001586650001301606650001801619650001501637651001501652653003201667653002501699653002501724653002901749653002101778653002501799653002901824653001501853700002201868700002401890700002101914700002001935700002101955700002201976700002101998700002202019700002502041773008802066856007102154852000902225655001202234IND60523513020221119072610.0160623s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052351302DNAL7 a10.1071/RJ150932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolfe, Joe W.10aRangeland profitability in the northern Gulf region of Queensland: understanding beef business complexity and the subsequent impact on land resource management and environmental outcomes  ap. 261-272.  aThe farm-gate value of extensive beef production from the northern Gulf region of Queensland, Australia, is ~$150million annually. Poor profitability and declining equity are common issues for most beef businesses in the region. The beef industry relies primarily on native pasture systems and studies continue to report a decline in the condition and productivity of important land types in the region. Governments and Natural Resource Management groups are investing significant resources to restore landscape health and productivity. Fundamental community expectations also include broader environmental outcomes such as reducing beef industry greenhouse gas emissions. Whole-of-business analysis results are presented from 18 extensive beef businesses (producers) to highlight the complex social and economic drivers of management decisions that impact on the natural resource and environment. Business analysis activities also focussed on improving enterprise performance. Profitability, herd performance and greenhouse emission benchmarks are documented and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3abeef cattle 3abeef industry 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aherds 3aland management 3alandscapes 3ameat production 3apastures 3aprofitability 3arangelands 3aQueensland 0abusiness management records 0abusiness performance 0aequity and expansion 0agreenhouse gas emissions 0aherd performance 0aseasonal variability 0astocking rate management 0asuccession1 aLarard, Alison E.1 aEnglish, Bernard H.1 aHegarty, Emma S.1 aMcGrath, Tim B.1 aGobius, Niilo R.1 aDe Faveri, Joanne1 aSrhoj, Joanna R.1 aDigby, Michael J.1 aMusgrove, Richard J.0 tRangeland journal.g2016, v. 38, no. 3 p.261-272dCSIRO Publishingx1036-98727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ150933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002200168245009400190300001600284500000900300520175200309592002802061650002102089650002302110650001602133700001802149773012102167852000902288856009802297655001202395991615879180742620221120233240.0191122e197211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7391346762DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1972.0011183X001200060013x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiesner, Loren E.10aEffect of Temparature Preconditioning and Cultivar on Ryegrass (Lolium sp.) Seed Dormancy  ap. 760-764.  aepub  aThis study was conducted to determine if cultivar differences in seed dormancy existed in ryegrass (Lolium sp.), and whether seasonal differences in dormancy could be related to temperature during the seed development period. Field-grown ryegrass cultivars differed in degree of seed dormancy when grown under the same field environment. âGulf,â âFlorida Rust-Resistant,â and âMagnoliaâ annual and âNK-100,â âManhattan,â âAtempo,â âPetra,â and âPeloâ perennial ryegrass cultivars were considered dormant. âObahikariâ annual and âVerna Pajdjergâ and âLinnâ perennial ryegrass cultivars were nearly nondormant. Temperature preconditioning during seed development and maturation affected the degree of dormany present in freshly harvested seed. These studies were conducted using a detached culm technique in growth chamber and greenhouse facilities. The dormancy response of Gulf seed produced on detached culms was similar to that of seeds from intact plants, lending validity to the use of this technique. Gulf seeds developed at low temperatures were dormant, but those developed at high temperatures were nondormant. The duration of exposure to different temperatures and the stage of development at which the seeds were exposed to high or low temperature also influenced the degree of dormancy. Exposure to 1 week of low temperature during ripening increased seed dormancy, but at anthesis reduced dormancy. Extended periods of low temperature during seed development increased seed weight. Seed weight was reduced when seeds were exposed to high temperatures during the 2nd week of seed development. A multi-temperature technique was used to characterize the degree of dormancy present in the seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3afield crops1 aGrabe, Don F.0 tCrop science.g1972 Nov., v. 12, no. 6 p.760-764dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1972.0011183X001200060013x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02604naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009800163300001400261520111200275592002801387650002301415650001401438650001201452650001901464650001301483650001901496650001601515650002201531650002201553650002301575650001501598650001101613650002001624650002401644653001901668653002801687653003401715700002101749700001401770700005801784700005401842700002101896773011301917856008302030852000902113655001202122IND60544611020221119153753.0190417e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054461102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2013.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucera, A.10aEffect of active coating on microbiological and sensory properties of fresh mozzarella cheese  ap. 25-29.  aThe effectiveness of active coating on microbiological and decay of sensory quality in mozzarella cheese was investigated. The work was divided into two subsequent experimental steps: the first one was aimed at selecting the optimal active compound among different substances, such as potassium sorbate (PS), sodium benzoate (SB), calcium lactate (CL) and calcium ascorbate (CA). In the second trial, three different concentrations (1%, 2%, 3%, w/v) of the best selected compound (PS) were tested. All active compounds were dispersed in a sodium alginic acid solution before coating the cheese. Fresh mozzarella without coating was also used as the control. During storage at a temperature of 8Â±1Â°C, microbiological and sensory quality was monitored. Results obtained from the first step showed that CL and CA did not improve mozzarella cheese quality; whereas, the PS and SB showed good results. In the second trial, the coating with PS (3%) showed a certain inhibition on microbial proliferation and samples remained acceptable for 8 days with respect to the control that was refused after about 4 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aalginates 3acalcium 3acheese quality 3acoatings 3afood packaging 3alactic acid 3amozzarella cheese 3apotassium sorbate 3asensory properties 3ashelf life 3asodium 3asodium benzoate 3astorage temperature 0aActive coating 0aFresh mozzarella cheese 0aMicrobial and sensory quality1 aMastromatteo, M.1 aConte, A.1 aZambrini, A.V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1452-70921 aFaccia, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9496-91511 aDel Nobile, M.A.0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2014 Mar., v. 1, no. 1 p.25-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2013.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002800138245008600166520194200252592002802194650001702222650002202239650001802261650001102279650002502290650002602315650001502341650003202356650001002388650002102398651001202419700002302431700002602454773011902480856007202599852000902671655001202680IND60648818220221119033602.0190701e20180114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064881822DNAL7 a10.3390/f90100332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyá»n, Há»ng Háº£i,10aNearest Neighborhood Characteristics of a Tropical Mixed Broadleaved Forest Stand  aStructural complexity and local biodiversity of species-rich tropical forests can be characterized by their spatial patterns, which contribute to species intra- and interspecific interactions. Aiming to describe spatial patterns of species at fine spatial scales, we applied the quantitative analyses based on the relationships of nearest neighbors of conspecific and heterospecific trees. In a two-hectare plot of a tropical broadleaved forest stand in central Vietnam with minimal human influence, all tree individuals with diameter at breast height â¥ 2.5 cm were mapped and their characteristics were recorded. We applied two different types of analyses: (1) Intraspecific structural characteristics using nearest neighbor statistics; (2) overall interspecific associations through a classification scheme based on bivariate nearest neighbor distribution function D<inf>12</inf>(r) and Ripleyâs K function K<inf>12</inf>(r). The findings showed that: (1) Most of studied species in the forest were highly mixed with other species, while conspecifics were regular to aggregated distribution at small spatial scales. Tree individuals with different diameter values were surrounded by heterospecific trees; (2) The majority of 306 species-species pairs showed spatial independence (66.7%), whereas 29.8% of all species showed an overall positive association and negative association consisted only a small percentage (3.5%) up to spatial scales of 50 m. We found significant evidences of the main ecological theories such as dispersal limitation, Neutral theory, Janzen-Connell hypothesis, and other effects like the stochastic dilution. We suggest using both the bivariate distribution of the structural parameters and the spatial point pattern analysis based on nearest neighbor distance as advantageous approaches for further understanding of population structure, as well as discovering and protecting biodiversity in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3adeciduous forests 3aforest stands 3ahumans 3apopulation structure 3aquantitative analysis 3astatistics 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3atropical forests 3aVietnam1 aErfanifard, Yousef1 aPetritan, Ion Catalin0 tForests.g2018 Jan. 14, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90100333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001600171245015600187300001600343520099100359592002801350650001401378650002401392650002301416650002701439650002501466650000901491650002601500650002201526650002701548650001501575650001401590650003801604650004601642650002201688650003601710650004901746650003101795650002201826650002601848650001301874653001901887653002401906653001901930653002301949653002901972700001902001700001602020773010602036856008702142852000902229655001202238IND50062730720221121030800.0190409e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006273072DNAL7 a233479252pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.12.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Yunjun10aEnhanced catalysis of Yarrowia lipolytica lipase LIP2 immobilized on macroporous resin and its application in enrichment of polyunsaturated fatty acids  ap. 179-187.  aAn immobilization strategy was employed to improve activity and operational stability of Yarrowia lipolytica lipase LIP2 (YlLIP2) by using macroporous resins as carrier. D152H, a cation-exchange resin, was the best support. Under the optimized conditions, the immobilization efficiency was 89.81% and the specific activity was 809,751U/g, being 2.1-fold higher than that of the free lipase. Bioimprinting and interfacial activation were used to further boost the catalytic activity of YlLIP2, respectively enhanced 21.5-fold, 231.2% and 107.2% compared to the free, non-bioimprinted and non-interfacial-activated lipases. The immobilized lipase exhibited much better thermal and pH stability and broader substrate specificity; when used to enrich docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from Chlorella protothecoides oil, it could increase 1.66-fold of DHA content and show good operational stability. These indicate that the immobilized YlLIP2 offers a promising approach for the enrichment of DHA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3acatalytic activity 3acation exchange resins 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aoils 3asubstrate specificity 3athermal stability 3atriacylglycerol lipase 2aAdsorption 2aCatalysis 2aCation Exchange Resinsxchemistry 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxchemical synthesis 2aEnzyme Activation 2aEnzymes, Immobilizedxchemistry 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxchemical synthesis 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistry 2aLipasexchemistry 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aPorosity 0aDHA enrichment 0aHydrolysis reaction 0aImmobilization 0aIon exchange resin 0aYarrowia lipolytica LIP21 aZhang, Xiaoyan1 aChen, Dawei0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Mar., v. 131 p.179-187dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.12.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01539naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245005600162300001600218520063200234592002800866650002200894650001100916650001100927653002500938653003400963653001600997773015001013856007701163852000901240655001201249IND60521670420221119141210.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052167042DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1982-03012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJansen, Martin10aNeue Silber(I)-germanate / New Silver(I)-germanates  ap. 265-266.  aFour silver(I)-germanates have been prepared from the binary components AgâO and GeOâ by solid state reaction applying elevated oxygen pressures (2500-3000 bar).

However, undesirable properties, including high cost, complicated fabrication processes, and insufficient yields, have greatly restricted the large-scale practical applications of such supercapacitors. In this study, a facile and exclusive approach is presented toward the scalable preparation of novel 3D porous carbon networks using relatively low-cost commercial cotton. Capacitive electrode materials for supercapacitors and corresponding flexible devices have been achieved based on tailoring the chemical composition, surface area and pore size distribution of the carbon networks via conventional carbonization and activation. These exceptional 3D porous carbon networks with controllable properties have shown high specific surface areas of up to 1563 mÂ² gâ»Â¹ and optimized energy storage capabilities of 314 and 170 F gâ»Â¹ at current densities of 0.1 and 10 A gâ»Â¹ in 6 mol Lâ»Â¹ KOH electrolyte, respectively. Consequently, these advantageous features allow the carbon networks to be directly utilized in flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors, which exhibit considerably satisfactory energy storage performance and excellent cycling stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3acarbon nanotubes 3acarbonization 3achemical composition 3acotton 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aporosity 3apotassium hydroxide 3asurface area1 aSong, Wei-Li1 aFan, Li-Zhen0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 July 28, v. 3, no. 31 p.16104-16111dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta03899e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011400161300001400275520093500289592002801224650001901252650001601271650001901287650001301306650001801319650001701337650002601354653002601380653003401406653002601440653002301466653002601489653002001515700001701535700001901552700001801571700001601589700001501605700001701620700001501637700001601652773012001668856007901788852000901867655001201876IND60644687620221117193736.0190520e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064468762DNAL7 a10.1089/cell.2018.00522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mingyu10aPotential Strategies for Cardiac Diseases: Lineage Reprogramming of Somatic Cells into Induced Cardiomyocytes  ap. 63-77.  aLineage reprogramming has become a potential strategy for therapy of cardiac diseases. Somatic cells can be directly converted into the induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) without passing through an induced pluripotent stem cell stage; this strategy has some advantages such as directional differentiation and preferable security. However, there are still many challenges which need to be further studied, such as identification of safer induced factors, exploration of molecular mechanisms, improvement of the mature level of iCMs and so on. Therefore, the structures of key factors, including transcription factors, microRNAs (miRNAs), epigenetic regulators and small molecules and their functions in the cardiac development and lineage reprogramming, molecular mechanisms underlying lineage conversion, strategies for generating matured iCMs, and major challenges were reviewed to lay the foundation for further applications of iCMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiomyocytes 3aepigenetics 3aheart diseases 3amicroRNA 3asomatic cells 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factors 0alineage reprogramming 0ainduced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) 0atranscription factors 0amicroRNAs (miRNAs) 0aepigenetic regulators 0asmall molecules1 aLing, Wenhui1 aXiong, Chunxia1 aXie, Dengfeng1 aChu, Xinyue1 aLi, Yunxin1 aQiu, Xiaoyan1 aLi, Yuemin1 aXiao, Xiong0 tCellular reprogramming.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 21, no. 2 p.63-77dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:21670x2152-49987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cell.2018.00523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007900163300001400242520142000256592002801676650001801704650001801722650001501740650001901755650001901774650002401793650002101817650001401838650001001852650002201862650001301884650002501897650001801922650002601940650002401966650001801990650001202008653002902020653001602049653001902065653001002084653001002094700001602104700005802120773009902178856008102277852000902358655001202367IND60544609820221118033416.0190417e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054460982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cpb.2014.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Hyosub10aEvolution of endogenous non-retroviral genes integrated into plant genomes  ap. 55-59.  aNumerous comparative genome analyses have revealed the wide extent of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in living organisms, which contributes to their evolution and genetic diversity. Viruses play important roles in HGT. Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) are defined as viral DNA sequences present within the genomes of non-viral organisms. In eukaryotic cells, the majority of EVEs are derived from RNA viruses using reverse transcription. In contrast, endogenous non-retroviral elements (ENREs) are poorly studied. However, the increasing availability of genomic data and the rapid development of bioinformatics tools have enabled the identification of several ENREs in various eukaryotic organisms. To date, a small number of ENREs integrated into plant genomes have been identified. Of the known non-retroviruses, most identified ENREs are derived from double-strand (ds) RNA viruses, followed by single-strand (ss) DNA and ssRNA viruses. At least eight virus families have been identified. Of these, viruses in the family Partitiviridae are dominant, followed by viruses of the families Chrysoviridae and Geminiviridae. The identified ENREs have been primarily identified in eudicots, followed by monocots. In this review, we briefly discuss the current view on non-retroviral sequences integrated into plant genomes that are associated with plant-virus evolution and their possible roles in antiviral resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysoviridae 3aGeminiviridae 3aLiliopsida 3aPartitiviridae 3abioinformatics 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aeukaryotic cells 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3anucleotide sequences 3aplant biology 3areverse transcription 3asingle-stranded DNA 3assRNA viruses 3aviruses 0aHorizontal gene transfer 0aIntegration 0aNon-retroviral 0aPlant 0aVirus1 aJo, Yeonhwa1 aCho, Won Kyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8416-51730 tCurrent plant biology.g2014 Aug., v. 1 p.55-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23302x2214-66287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpb.2014.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01949naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008200164300002000246520076500266592002801031650001101059650001001070650002601080650001301106650001101119650001301130650001301143650001501156650002201171700002401193700002301217700002901240700002601269700002701295700002201322773012401344856007401468852000901542655001201551IND60664439420221119201136.0190912e20130624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066443942DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra23325a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShtansky, Dmitry V.10aRecent progress in the field of multicomponent bioactive nanostructured films  ap. 11107-11115.  aMulticomponent bioactive nanostructured films (MuBiNaFs) with an excellent combination of chemical, mechanical, tribological, and biological properties were developed and deposited by sputtering of composite targets produced via the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis method.

Data on leaf photosynthetic rate and solar irradiance were taken from the literature. At a leaf area index of 9, the calculated canopy photosynthetic rate of the most erect strain (P 407) was 10% greater than that of Caprock. At a leaf area index of 3, the rate for Caprock was slightly greater. The dry matter yields measured by Havelka at the end of his experiment differed by almost the same amounts.

The adaptation of plant root systems to environmental constraints largely depends on the growth and development of lateral roots (LRs). MADS-box transcription factors (TFs) are important known regulators of plant growth, development, and response to environmental stimuli. However, the potential mechanisms by which they regulate LRs development remain poorly understood. Here, we identified a MADS-box chrysanthemum gene CmANR1, homologous to the Arabidopsis gene AtANR1, which plays a key role in the regulation of LR development. qRT-PCR assays indicated that CmANR1 was primarily expressed in chrysanthemum roots and was rapidly induced by exposure to high nitrate concentrations. Ectopic expression of CmANR1 in Arabidopsis significantly increased the number and length of emerged LRs compared to the wild-type (col) control, but had no obvious affect on primary root (PR) development. We also found that CmANR1 positively influenced auxin accumulation in LRs at least partly by improving auxin biosynthesis and transport, thereby promoting LR development. Furthermore, we found that ANR1 formed homo- and heterodimers through interactions with itself and AGL21 at its C-terminal domain. Overall, our findings provide considerable new information about the mechanisms by which the chrysanthemum MADS-box TF CmANR1 mediates LR development by directly altering auxin accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aChrysanthemum 3aagronomic traits 3aamino acid sequences 3aauxins 3abiosynthesis 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3anitrates 3anutrients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asoil 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aMADS-box 0aCmANR1 0aLateral root development 0aNitrate 0aAuxin 0aChrysanthemum1 aYu, Jian-Qiang1 aWen, Li-Zhu1 aGuo, Yun-Hui1 aSun, Xia1 aHao, Yu-Jin1 aHu, Da-Gang1 aZheng, Cheng-Shu0 tPlant science.g2018 Jan., v. 266 p.27-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2017.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245016100175300001500336520163400351592002801985650002002013650001202033650001302045650001002058650002502068650001202093650001502105650001602120650001602136650001502152650001602167650001102183650001502194650001502209650001802224650001902242650002402261650002102285650002002306650001802326653003302344653002702377653002402404653003002428653002202458700001502480700001702495700001502512700002202527700002102549700002002570700001902590700002102609773009202630856009102722852000902813655001202822IND60629102020221123031538.0200601e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062910202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Ming-Yin10aHierarchically targetable polysaccharide-coated solid lipid nanoparticles as an oral chemo/thermotherapy delivery system for local treatment of colon cancer  ap. 86-100.  aAlthough oral formulations of anticancer chemotherapies are clinically available, the therapeutic action relies mostly on drug absorption, being inevitably accompanied with systemic side effects. It is thus desirable to develop oral therapy systems for the local treatment of colon cancers featured with highly selective delivery to cancer cells and minimized systemic drug absorption. The present study demonstrates the effective accumulation and cell uptake of the doxorubicin and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles-loaded solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) delivery system for chemo/magnetothermal combination therapy at tumors by hierarchical targeting of folate (FA) and dextran coated on SLN surfaces in a sequential layer-by-layer manner. Both the in vitro and in vivo characterizations strongly confirmed that the dextran shells on SLN surfaces not only retarded the cellular transport of the FA-coated SLNs by the proton-coupled FA transporter on brush border membranes in small intestine, but also enhanced the particle residence in colon by specific association with dextranase. The enzymatic degradation and removal of dextran coating led to the exposure of the FA residues, thereby further facilitating the cellular-level targeting and uptake of the SLNs by the receptor-mediated endocytosis. The evaluation of the in vivo antitumor efficacy of the hierarchically targetable SLN therapy system by oral administration showed the effective inhibition of primary colon tumors and peritoneal metastasis in terms of the ascites volume and tumor nodule number and size, along with the absence of systemic side effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aascites 3acoatings 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adextran 3adextranase 3adoxorubicin 3aendocytosis 3afolic acid 3airon oxides 3alipids 3ametastasis 3amicrovilli 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3asmall intestine 3athermotherapy 0aLocal colon cancer treatment 0aHierarchical targeting 0aCombination therapy 0aSolid lipid nanoparticles 0aOral formulations1 aLiu, Deyi,1 aYu, Ting-Wei1 aKv, Reesha1 aChiang, Wen-Hsuan1 aTsai, Yuan-Chung1 aChen, Hsin-Hung1 aLin, Sung-Chyr1 aChiu, Hsin-Cheng0 tBiomaterials.g2019 Mar., v. 197 p.86-100dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009300166300001400259520142500273592002801698650002201726650002201748650002001770650003801790650001001828650000901838650001101847650001601858653002901874653001401903653000801917653002601925700001901951773010001970856008102070852000902151655001202160IND60606346520221123033253.0180725e20160510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060634652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2016.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvoboda, Roman10aHow nucleation-growth kinetics is influenced by initial degree of material crystallinity  ap. 28-35.  aDifferential scanning calorimetry was used to investigate the effect of initial partial crystallinity on the non-isothermal nucleation-growth Johnson-Mehl-Avrami kinetics â selected Se-Te chalcogenide glasses were used as model systems. Different reproducible degrees of initial crystallinity were achieved by non-isothermal heating to a selected temperature. In case of the materials that primarily crystallize from mechanically induced defects, no change of the activation energy or kinetic mechanism was observed with increasing degree of initial crystallinity. On the other hand, material that showed complex crystallization behavior consisting from two competing overlapping crystal growth processes originating from volume-located nuclei and mechanical defects, respectively, exhibited marked shift in the dominance between the two kinetic mechanisms. In particular, with the increasing degree of initial crystallinity the defects-based crystallization mechanism started to dominate over the classical classic-nucleation-theory-based nucleation-growth crystallization mechanism. Increased amount of defects-based crystallization centers formed during the primary pre-crystallization appears to be the key factor for this change of the kinetic mechanism, rather than decreased activation energy (associated with the already existing crystal/glass interface) accelerating the actual crystal growth micro-mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aglass 3aheat 3amodels 3atemperature 0aCrystallization kinetics 0aJMA model 0aDSC 0aPartial crystallinity1 aMÃ¡lek, JiÅÃ­0 tThermochimica acta.g2016 May 10, v. 631 p.28-35dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2016.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245008900159300001600248520134300264592002801607650002501635650001901660650001201679650001501691650001801706650001601724650000901740650001101749650001401760650001701774650001001791650001601801650002601817650001601843650001401859653001101873653000901884653001901893653001701912653001701929653002601946700002301972700002401995700002602019700002302045773009502068856007102163852000902234655001202243IND60523511820221119072546.0160623s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052351182DNAL7 a10.1071/FP152752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVisscher, Anne M.10aDry seeds and environmental extremes: consequences for seed lifespan and germination  ap. 656-668.  aIn the context of climate change, food security and long-term human space missions, it is important to understand which species produce seeds that can tolerate extreme environmental conditions. Here we consider dry seed survival of extreme conditions encountered in both natural and artificially controlled environments. Considerable overlap exists between the two: for example, ultra-dry and anoxic conditions can be artificially imposed during seed storage and also occur naturally in the vacuum of space environments. Aside from ultra-drying and anoxia, dry seeds of many species may experience extremely high temperatures due to heat from wildfires or when exposed to solar heat in biomes such as deserts. In addition, seeds can be irradiated by UV-A and UV-B at the surface of the Earth and by the shorter wavelengths of UV-C in outer space. We focus on the effects of these extreme environmental conditions on dry seed lifespan and germination. Although it is clear that seeds from particular plant species and families can tolerate exposures to ultra-drying, high temperatures (at least 32 families) or UV radiation with minimal consequences for subsequent germination ability, further research is needed to elucidate many of the mechanisms underlying extreme tolerance of these environmental conditions found on Earth or in space.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3aclimate change 3adeserts 3aecosystems 3afood security 3agermination 3aheat 3ahumans 3alongevity 3aseed storage 3aseeds 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 3awavelengths 3awildfires 0aanoxia 0aheat 0amagnetic field 0aspace vacuum 0aultra-drying 0aultraviolet radiation1 aSeal, Charlotte E.1 aNewton, Rosemary J.1 aFrances, Alba Latorre1 aPritchard, Hugh W.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2016, v. 43, no. 7 p.656-668dCSIRO Publishingx1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP152753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245010800174300001600282520183200298592002802130650001702158650001302175650002302188650002302211650001502234650001502249650002202264650001202286650001602298650001702314651001102331653002202342653001702364653002602381653002102407653002202428653002102450700002002471700002002491773011002511856009002621852000902711655001202720IND60585391120221119223458.0190318e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058539112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalkinson, Dan10aFrom rural-urban gradients to patch â matrix frameworks: Plant diversity patterns in urban landscapes  ap. 260-268.  aStudies have attempted to disentangle the relationships between urban properties and species richness patterns by studying them within the urban-rural gradient context, the Island Biogeography framework, or the patch-matrix approach. We compared and contrasted these frameworks, to highlight their attributes. We assessed the role of patch properties and matrix characteristics, in light of these approaches, to identify the relative roles of different drivers in dictating urban plant species richness patterns.Vegetation surveys were conducted in 41 open space patches within the city boundaries of Haifa, Israel. Plants were classified into three categories: rare, native and non-native. Patch properties, distance to nearest neighboring patch, distance to city boundary, within patch heterogeneity and percentage of sealed surface buffering the patch were evaluated in relation to species richness. Non-linear regressions indicated that total, rare and native species richness were best explained by a combination of patch area, sealed surface and patch habitat heterogeneity. Non-native species richness was best explained indirectly by the proportion of sealed surface. No clear cut distinctions between the three frameworks were observed. The results point to the existence of non-linear interactive relationships between the drivers and species richness, which depend on patch and urban matrix properties, particularly on degree of urbanization. We conclude that patch-matrix mechanisms interact with the urban-rural gradient approach to determine plant richness patterns in urban landscapes. Additionally, the degree of urbanization is differentially associated with richness patterns, where rare and native species are negatively associated with it, and non-native species are positively associated with urbanization.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3alandscapes 3aopen space 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aIsrael 0aNon-linear models 0aPatch-matrix 0aRural-urban gradients 0aSpecies richness 0aUrban open spaces 0aUrban vegetation1 aKopel, Daniella1 aWittenberg, Lea0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2018 Jan., v. 169 p.260-268dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01707naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245014100163300001400304500001900318520055400337592002800891650002100919650002300940650001800963700001800981700002000999700001301019700001701032700005501049700005701104773011601161856008301277852000901360655001201369IND60722343920221118223832.0210101e20201222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072234392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c035172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Gang10aHighly Chemo- and Enantioselective Rh-Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Î²-Sulfonyl-Î±,Î²-unsaturated Ketones: Access to Chiral Î³-Ketosulfones  ap. 19-24.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRh-catalyzed highly chemo- and enantioselective hydrogenation of Î²-sulfonyl-Î±,Î²-unsaturated ketones was first successfully developed.

The purpose of this study is to systematically characterize the chemical profiling and pharmacological activities of N. nucifera. Herein, we critically reviewed and analysed the phytochemical and pharmacological reports of N. nucifera. Our search for the keyword âNelumbo nucifera pharmacologyâ in all databases reported in Web of Science yielded 373 results excluding reviews and abstracts in document types. Two hundred and fortyâthree spectrum natural compounds from different parts of N. nucifera belonging to diverse chemical groups, including alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, terpenoids, steroids, fatty acids, proteins, minerals, and vitamins have been reported. In addition, distinct pharmacological activities, mainly against cancer, microbial infection, diabetes, inflammation, atherosclerosis, and obesity, have been associated with crude extracts, fractions, and isolated compounds. This review highlights potential use of neferine, liensinine, isoliensinine, and nuciferine in clinical trials. In depth, mechanism of the potential chemical entities from N. nucifera via structure activity relationship needs to be explored to guarantee the stability and safety for the clinical use.

Changes in plant quality influence herbivore performance, which affects prey availability and quality for natural enemies. Parasitoid wasps are particularly vulnerable to these changes since their development is inextricably linked to that of their prey. However, we know little about the indirect effects of plant water limitation on parasitoid performance, especially the consequences of mild water limitation. This study investigated the ability of a parasitoid wasp (Aphidius colemani Viereck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)) to suppress aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L. (Hemiptera: Aphididae)) populations on well-watered, mildly stressed, or highly stressed wheat (Triticum aestivum L. (Poales: Poaceae)). We then investigated the role that aphid body size and behavioral interactions might play in wasp acceptance of aphid hosts. We found improved aphid suppression under mild and high-water limitation, but the underlying mechanisms were different. Mild-stress appeared to maximize parasitoid performance, as indicated by the highest mummy production. Aphids were larger when feeding on mildly stressed plants than on any other treatment, which suggests improved aphid quality for parasitoids. Improved aphid suppression under high-stress may have been driven by enhanced nonconsumptive effects. Despite improved aphid suppression, mummy formation was lowest on highly stressed plants. High-stress conditions have been shown to negatively affect aphid performance, so improved aphid suppression may be driven by poor aphid performance exacerbating the cost of interactions with parasitoids, such as stinging. No differences were observed in parasitoid foraging behaviors such as antennation or stinging across any treatments. This study highlights the importance of plant water stress intensity in affecting outcomes of parasitoidâhost interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAphidius colemani 3aBraconidae 3aRhopalosiphum padi 3aTriticum aestivum 3aantennating 3abody size 3adrought 3aentomology 3aherbivores 3aparasitic wasps 3aplant stress 3awasps 3awater stress 3awheat 0atri-trophic interactions 0aabiotic stress 0ainsect behavior 0aparasitic wasp1 aWard, Mason1 aLaFond, Harper1 aFinke, Deborah L.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2021 Feb. 9, v. 50, no. 3 p.713-718dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl3243x0046-225X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvab0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03515naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006400149245010200213300001600315520165500331592002801986650001902014650002202033650001902055650002202074650001202096650002202108650002302130650003102153650001302184650001302197650002002210650004302230650005202273650001002325650002202335650001102357650001702368650001202385650002602397651001302423653001202436653001902448653002102467653001702488653000802505700006002513700001702573700002002590700002102610700002002631700005902651773012202710856008402832852000902916655001202925IND60628405920221122193315.0190318e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062840592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2018.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinelli, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3981-056710aIdentification of miRNAs linked with the drought response of tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter]  ap. 163-172.  aTef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter], a staple food crop in the Horn of Africa and particularly in Ethiopia, has several beneficial agronomical and nutritional properties, including waterlogging and drought tolerance. In this study, we performed microRNA profiling of tef using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, analyzing both shoots and roots of two tef genotypes, one drought-tolerant (Tsedey) and one drought-susceptible (Alba). We obtained more than 10 million filtered reads for each of the 24 sequenced small cDNA libraries. Reads mapping to known miRNAs were more abundant in the root than shoot tissues. Thirteen and 35 miRNAs were significantly modulated in response to drought, in Alba and Tsedey roots, respectively. One miRNA was upregulated under drought conditions in both genotypes. In shoots, nine miRNAs were modulated in common between the two genotypes and all showed similar trends of expression. One-hundred and forty-seven new miRNA mature sequences were identified in silico, 22 of these were detected in all relevant samples and seven were differentially regulated when comparing drought with normal watering. Putative targets of the miRNA regulated under drought in root and shoot tissues were predicted. Among the targets were transcription factors such as CCAAT-HAP2, MADS and NAC. Verification with qRT-PCR revealed that five of six potential targets showed a pattern of expression that was consistent with the correspondent miRNA amount measured by RNA-Seq. In general, candidate miRNAs involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of the tef response to drought could be included in next-generation breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEragrostis tef 3abreeding programs 3acDNA libraries 3acomplementary DNA 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aflooded conditions 3agene expression regulation 3agenotype 3amicroRNA 3anutritive value 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3asequence analysis 3ashoots 3astaple crops 3atissues 3atranscription factors 3aEthiopia 0aDrought 0aEragrostis tef 0amicroRNA (miRNA) 0amiRNA target 0aTef1 aCannarozzi, Gina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0704-663X1 aBalan, Bipin1 aSiegrist, Fredy1 aWeichert, Annett1 aBlÃ¶sch, Regula1 aTadele, Zerihun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3686-36980 tJournal of plant physiology.g2018 May,  June, v. 224-225 p.163-172dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2018.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
