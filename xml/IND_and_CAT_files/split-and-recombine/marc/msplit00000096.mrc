In this case, polygons can be selected as sampling units to match the conceptual model of the map. However, little attention has been paid to the use of polygons for the validation of those maps. In this paper, we quantitatively assess the prediction of the primary thematic accuracy indices when the sampling unit is a polygon. The variable size of the sample polygons is a major concern for the prediction of the accuracy indices. Indeed, the classification accuracy, in addition to being class-dependent, depends on the polygon area. A practical solution supported by a theoretical framework that is conditional to the sample dataset is proposed in this study. This new predictor takes advantage of the known classification results for an improved efficiency. Empirical results based on synthetic maps show that the new predictor outperforms alternative methods for overall accuracy. The RMSE of the area weighted predictor was achieved with 50% less sample polygons thanks to our new predictor.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3aland cover 3aland use 3amodels 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 0aGEOBIA 0aObject-based 0aImage-segment 0aUser accuracy 0aProducer accuracy 0aOverall accuracy 0aProbabilistic sample 0aLand cover map1 aBogaert, Patrick0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Feb. 25, v. 142 p.9-19dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.10.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009600169300001600265520106100281592002801342650002501370650001101395650001601406650002101422650001901443650001001462650001801472650002401490650001101514650001101525650002501536650001601561650001501577651001401592653001901606653001401625653002101639653002501660653001601685700001801701700002301719700001901742700002201761773009701783856008201880852000901962655001201971IND60546559720221122143703.0160903e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054655972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2014.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouffard, Damien10aNear-inertial wave driven dissolved oxygen transfer through the thermocline of a large lake  ap. 300-307.  aThe offshore regions of large temperate lakes are characterized by strong summer temperature stratification that limits vertical mass flux, and enables near-inertial internal wave motions. Here, we investigate the contribution of near-inertial baroclinic velocity shear on enhancing the vertical transport of dissolved oxygen (DO) through the thermocline of the central basin of Lake Erie. The lake is prone to severe annual hypoxia in the hypolimnion and also has strong near-inertial Poincaré wave activity. Using field measurements, analytical arguments and a numerical model under idealized conditions, we show that the near-inertial waves drive baroclinic shear instabilities that enhance the vertical turbulent diffusivity and reduce the rate of DO depletion in the hypolimnion by up to 12% over the entire basin. Results from modeling large-spatial variability in the enhanced thermocline flux to match the distribution of near-inertial wave energy density, indicate that the observed oxygen budgets will vary as a function of location of sampling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3abasins 3adiffusivity 3adissolved oxygen 3aenergy density 3alakes 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3aoxygen 3asummer 3atemperature profiles 3awater power 3awatersheds 3aLake Erie 0aPoincaré wave 0aLake Erie 0aOxygen depletion 0aVertical diffusivity 0aThermocline1 aBoegman, Leon1 aAckerman, Josef D.1 aValipour, Reza1 aRao, Yerubandi R.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2014 June, v. 40 p.300-307dElsevier B.V.x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2014.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245013000170520195300300592002802253650001402281650001202295650001602307650001702323650001302340650001602353650001502369650001302384650001602397650001502413651001002428653002102438653001602459653001502475653002702490653002002517653002002537700001302557700001902570700001602589700001602605700001402621773011802635856008802753852000902841655001202850IND60765976520221121232021.0220606e20220520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076597652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1535782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Xiaoyan10aCritical role of groundwater discharge in sustaining streamflow in a glaciated alpine watershed, northeastern Tibetan Plateau  aAs the hydrologic buffering capacity of glaciers diminishes on climate warming, groundwater stored in the glaciated alpine watersheds becomes an important source of streamflow, quantifying the groundwater contribution to this streamflow is significant for better predictions of the impact of rapidly disappearing glaciers on regional water resources. However, the role of groundwater in sustaining streams remains unclear. Here, we selected the upper Shule River Basin (USRB) on the northeast Tibetan Plateau (NETP) as a case to address this knowledge gap through a comprehensive study of geochemistry and stable isotopes data, the application of an end member mixing model and the baseflow hydrograph separation program (HYSEP). Our results indicate that even though the potential sources of streamflow exhibited distinct monthly differences during December 2012‐December 2013, the groundwater was the dominant contributor to streamflow generation in the USRB. The groundwater contributed 45% to 100% of the monthly mean streamflow, and the annual mean value of 70%. By contrast, the glacier-snow meltwater and precipitation only contributed 12% and 18% of the annual discharge. The volume contributed by groundwater was calculated as 9.93 × 10⁸ m³, approximately six times higher than the input of the glacier-snow meltwater (i.e., 1.63 × 10⁸ m³). From 1954 to 2018, the volume of the groundwater discharge to the streamflow in the USRB continuously increased from 4.83 × 10⁸ m³/a (65% of total streamflow) in the 1950s to 10.34 × 10⁸ m³/a (71% of total streamflow) in the 2010s, an increase of 2.14 times. The retreating glacier, as well as increasing precipitation and temperature, were determined to be the main reasons for the increase in groundwater discharge to the streamflow. Our findings suggest that groundwater contribution is more important than was previously thought in the glaciated alpine watersheds on the NETP.  aPublisher supplied data 3abase flow 3aclimate 3aenvironment 3ageochemistry 3aglaciers 3agroundwater 3ahydrograph 3asnowmelt 3atemperature 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aAlpine watershed 0aGroundwater 0aStreamflow 0aHydrological processes 0aStable isotopes 0aTibetan Plateau1 aFeng, Qi1 aYin, Zhenliang1 aSi, Jianhua1 aXi, Haiyang1 aZhao, Yan0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 May 20, v. 822 p.153578-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1535783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014400170300001600314520171900330592002802049650001902077650001302096650002402109650001202133650001702145650001402162650001302176650002402189650001402213650002002227650001002247650001202257650001902269650002102288650001402309650001802323650005202341650001402393650002102407650001102428650001502439651001602454653001702470653001202487653002102499653001802520653001802538653001602556700001902572773009702591856008202688852000902770655001202779IND60546559920221122143659.0160903e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054655992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2014.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKutovaya, Olga A.10aDevelopment and application of a molecular assay to detect and monitor geosmin-producing cyanobacteria and actinomycetes in the Great Lakes  ap. 404-414.  aGeosmin is a potent earthy-smelling sesquiterpene responsible for the majority of biologically induced taste-and-odor (T/O) episodes in drinking and recreational water, and major economic losses to commercial, farmed and sports fisheries. Geosmin is produced by a range of microorganisms, notably by cyanobacteria and actinomycetes. However, the effective management of geosmin T/O episodes has been hindered by our inability to identify the major biological sources, and absence of sensitive methods for early detection of T/O events. The main goal of this study was to develop taxon-specific PCR and RT-PCR assays that facilitate early detection of potential geosmin releases and identification of the likely biological sources. We developed a molecular assay for the detection and expression of geosmin synthase (geoA), a gene involved in geosmin biosynthesis in cyanobacteria and actinomycetes. Using the molecular probes, we detected geoA in a wide range of geosmin-producing taxa in both laboratory cultures and environmental samples which provided an important new database of geoA sequences from a diversity of GSM producers, allowing an evaluation of their phylogenetic relationships based on this gene. This study indicated that potential geosmin producers in the Laurentian Great Lakes water and sediment samples are predominantly represented by members of the Nostocaceae, and in particular Anabaena spp. No correlations were apparent between gene expression and ambient temperature, nutrient concentrations and total phytoplankton biomass. Rather, evaluation of the geoA expression pattern in the environmental samples tested from various watersheds and seasons suggested constitutive gene expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aAnabaena 3aambient temperature 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3adatabases 3adrinking 3afinancial economics 3afisheries 3agene expression 3agenes 3ageosmin 3amicroorganisms 3anutrient content 3aphylogeny 3aphytoplankton 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asediments 3asesquiterpenoids 3asports 3awatersheds 3aGreat Lakes 0aTaste–odor 0aGeosmin 0aGeosmin synthase 0aCyanobacteria 0aActinomycetes 0aGreat Lakes1 aWatson, Sue B.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2014 June, v. 40 p.404-414dElsevier B.V.x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2014.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001800167245008600185300001800271520144400289592002801733650001601761650002501777650002101802650001601823650001501839650002501854650004501879650004201924650001601966650003801982650002902020650002102049650003102070650002502101650002702126650001602153700001702169700002002186773010502206856008202311852000902393655001202402IND60091470320221118033012.0141103e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009147032DNAL7 a206275132pmid7 a10.1016/j.bios.2010.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Shaoan10aElectricity generation of single-chamber microbial fuel cells at low temperatures  ap. 1913-1917.  aPractical applications of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for wastewater treatment will require operation of these systems over a wide range of wastewater temperatures. MFCs at room or higher temperatures (20–35°C) are relatively well studied compared those at lower temperatures. MFC performance was examined here over a temperature range of 4–30°C in terms of startup time needed for reproducible power cycles, and performance. MFCs initially operated at 15°C or higher all attained a reproducible cycles of power generation, but the startup time to reach stable operation increased from 50h at 30°C to 210h at 15°C. At temperatures below 15°C, MFCs did not produce appreciable power even after one month of operation. If an MFC was first started up at temperature of 30°C, however, reproducible cycles of power generation could then be achieved at even the two lowest temperatures of 4°C and 10°C. Power production increased linearly with temperature at a rate of 33±4mW°C⁻¹, from 425±2mWm⁻² at 4°C to 1260±10mWm⁻² at 30°C. Coulombic efficiency decreased by 45% over this same temperature range, or from CE=31% at 4°C to CE=17% at 30°C. These results demonstrate that MFCs can effectively be operated over a wide range of temperatures, but our findings have important implications for the startup of larger scale reactors where low wastewater temperatures could delay or prevent adequate startup of the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3amicrobial fuel cells 3apower generation 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 2aBioelectric Energy Sourcesxmicrobiology 2aElectric Power Suppliesxmicrobiology 2aElectricity 2aElectrochemistryxinstrumentation 2aElectrodesxmicrobiology 2aEquipment Design 2aEquipment Failure Analysis 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aShewanellaxphysiology 2aTemperature1 aXing, Defeng1 aLogan, Bruce E.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 26, no. 5 p.1913-1917dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2010.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04569naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245018200168500001900350520256300369592002802932650002402960650001502984650001702999650001203016650002803028650002403056650001603080650001103096650002203107650001503129650002103144650001903165650000903184650003003193650002103223650001303244650002803257650002103285650002403306650001203330650001803342650001703360650001903377650001203396650001803408650002103426650001803447653001703465653002203482653002503504653001903529653003303548653003003581700001903611700002503630700001703655700002603672773011603698856008403814852000903898655001203907IND60717111220221122145531.0201216e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071711122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1066092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinhas, P.

We monitored the changes in soil physical, chemical, and hydraulic characteristics of a sandy loam soil irrigated for the last two decades with two types of alkali waters (AW₁, AW₂) having similar salts (total electrolyte concentration, TEC=30 me L⁻¹) and sodium adsorption ratio (SARiw 10 mmol L⁻¹) but varying in residual sodium carbonate, RSC (5 me L⁻¹ in AW₁ and 10 me L⁻¹ in AW₂), and when latter irrigation water (AW₂) was ameliorated to neutralize RSC equivalent to 5 me L⁻¹ with either sulfuric acid (AW₂ +SA) or gypsum (AW₂ +GYP). Deterioration of overall soil quality was evidenced by increased bulk density and penetration resistance, decreased aggregate stability, increased soil pH and sodicity, and decline in accumulation of soil organic carbon, especially with AW₂. Exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) build up ranged between 2.1 and 3.3 times SARiw. The steady infiltration rate (IR) in soil irrigated with good quality water, GQW (Electrical conductivity, ECiw=0.52dSm⁻¹; RSC=1.2 me L⁻¹), was 5.4 mm h⁻¹ (IR-GQW) while it reduced to 2.2, 1.0, 1.7, and 1.8 mm h⁻¹ with AW₁, AW₂, AW₂ +SA, and AW₂ +GYP, respectively. The adverse effects of soil sodification exacerbated with rainwater (RW; simulated with deionized water, EC <0.03dSm⁻¹) infiltration, further reducing the IR to 1.1, 0.7, 1.4, and 1.0 mm h⁻¹ for AW₁, AW₂, AW₂ +SA, and AW₂ +GYP, respectively. The recovery of IR was only a little (2–11%) when RW was replaced with respective irrigation waters, even when the surface 5 cm was tilled to break soil crusts (ST). This indicates permanent damage to soil structure and water transmission characteristics through the development of sub-soil throttles with moved-in clays. Power functions described the surface soil ESP to control IR (R² =0.53–0.83 **), and the ESP values for 0.25 IR-GQW were 24.5, 15.8, 17.4, 14.5 and 14.4 for IW (respective irrigation waters), RW, IW-RW, RW-IW, and RW-IW-ST-IW sequences of infiltration events, respectively. There were considerable reductions in post-infiltration water storage in the soil profile, and a slowed down redistribution of infiltrated water were also observed. The neutralization of RSC with either sulfuric acid or gypsum improved the hydro-physical properties; the impact of gypsum being slightly better especially in improving soil stability characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregate stability 3aalkalinity 3abulk density 3adecline 3aelectrical conductivity 3aexchangeable sodium 3agroundwater 3agypsum 3ainfiltration rate 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3aneutralization 3arain 3aresistance to penetration 3asandy loam soils 3asodicity 3asodium adsorption ratio 3asodium carbonate 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3asoil profiles 3asoil quality 3asoil structure 3asubsoil 3asulfuric acid 3awater management 3awater storage 0aAlkali water 0aSoil sodification 0aHydraulic properties 0aSoil stability 0aInfiltration characteristics 0aBrackish water irrigation1 aBali, Aradhana1 aBhardwaj, Ajay Kumar1 aAwtar Singh,1 aYadav, Rajender Kumar0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 244 p.106609-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1066093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245015700207300001800364520174600382592002802128650001502156650001302171650001202184650001102196650002102207650002302228650001302251650004402264650001102308650001602319650001202335650001202347650002202359650001302381700001702394700001702411700001702428700005402445700005102499773013502550856008002685852000902765655001202774IND60685669420200413000000.0200305e20200211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068566942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b110812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiménez-Ruiz, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9856-807X10aEvidence of Hydronium Formation in Water–Chabazite Zeolite Using Inelastic Neutron Scattering Experiments and ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Simulations  ap. 5436-5443.  aA combined study of inelastic neutron scattering and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations has been performed in order to study the water–acid site interaction in zeolite chabazite with a ratio Si/Al = 16 that corresponds to 2 protons/uc with two different water coverages with the number of water molecules being lower and higher than that of proton sites. These results have provided a clear picture of the water–acid site interaction, and it has been demonstrated that there are two regimens of water adsorption, which depend on the water loading. (i) At low water coverage (water/acid site ∼0.5), the main interactions between water and the zeolitic acid sites are established through hydrogen bond and there is no proton transference to water. (ii) At relatively high water loading (water/acid site ∼3), the clustering of water molecules and hydronioum cations formed by the complete transference of the zeolitic proton to the water molecules has been observed. The formation of water–hydronium clusters interacting with oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework provides the stabilization energy needed for the protonation of water molecules confined in the cavities of chabazite. These results are the experimental evidence obtained from INS of proton transfer from the zeolitic acid site and the hydronium formation and are in agreement with a previous computational study (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.2009, 11, 1702−1712) and very recent solid state NMR spectroscopy studies (J. Am. Chem. Soc.2019, 141, 3444−3455). The inspection of the low energy bands (translational and optic modes) and librational bands of the experimental results allows obtaining information about the H-bond network of the hydronium–water cluster.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3acations 3aenergy 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular dynamics 3aneutrons 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3aprotonation 3aprotons 3asilicon 3asimulation models 3azeolites1 aGahle, D.

We phenotyped the Dicktoo × Morex (D×M) mapping population under controlled freezing conditions and in addition to the previously reported 5H-L Fr-H1 QTL, observed three additional LT tolerance QTLs on 1H-L, 4H-S, and 4H-L. We identified and assigned either linkage map or chromosome locations to 1 ICE1 homolog, 2 ZAT12 homologs, and 17 of 20 CBF homologs. Twelve of the CBF genes were located on 5H-L and the 11 with assigned linkage map positions formed 2 tandem clusters on 5H-L. A subset of these CBF genes was confirmed to be physically linked, validating the map position clustering. The tandem CBF clusters are not candidates for the D×M LT tolerance Fr-H1 QTL, as they are ~30 cM distal to the QTL peak. No LT tolerance QTL was detected in conjunction with the CBF gene clusters in Dicktoo × Morex. However, comparative mapping using common markers and BIN positions established the CBF clusters are coincident with reported Triticeae LT tolerance and COR gene accumulation QTLs and suggest one or more of the CBF genes may be candidates for Fr-H2 in some germplasm combinations. These results suggest members of the CBF gene family may function as components of winterhardiness in the Triticeae and underscore both the importance of extending results from model systems to economically important crop species and in viewing QTL mapping results in the context of multiple germplasm combinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aquantitative trait loci 3awinter hardiness 3abarley 3aalleles 3aregulator genes 3aHordeum vulgare 3alinkage groups 3achromosome mapping 2aAlleles 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCold Temperature 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Linkage 2aHordeumxclassificationxgenetics. 2aMultigene Family 2aPhylogeny 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 0agenes 0acold tolerance1 aSzűcs, Péter,1 avon Zitzewitz, Jarislav1 aMarquez-Cedillo, Luis1 aFilichkin, Tanya1 aStockinger, Eric J.1 aThomashow, Michael F.1 aChen, Tony H.

The developed model is validated with real information stemming from industrial and institutional partners and consequently applied to a multisite case study covering the whole Swiss industrial waste-to-energy network. Due to the sparse nature of its chemical and pharmaceutical industry, and to centralized incineration facilities, this can be considered as an ideal case for testing the application of developed methodology to complex systems. A set of objective functions is used to investigate the implications of diverging goals on economic, environmental, and safety aspects, with particular focus on investments and possible synergies. Results indicate the importance of investments in oxy-combustion that, together with a more cooperative management of the network including the cement industry, enable a more local waste treatment with a consequent reduction of shipments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acement 3acollaborative management 3amodel validation 3apharmaceutical industry 3aprocess design 3awaste treatment1 aCapón-García, Elisabet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4469-78451 aRoca-Puigros, Marta1 aGazzola, Aline1 aHungerbühler, Konrad0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Jan. 08, v. 58, no. 9 p.3735-3753dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b031293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245021600177506011700393506007600510520158600586592002802172506003702200650001302237650001802250650001002268650002502278653003702303653001602340653001302356653001302369653001902382653000902401653002502410700006302435700001802498700002302516700002102539700002402560773009302584856008602677852000902763655001202772IND60783559520221207071544.0221004e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078355952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e099872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDömötör, Zsuzsanna13aAn idiographic approach to idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF) part I.

There is a growing evidence that this condition is characterized by marked individual differences thus a within-subject approach might add important information beyond the widely used nomothetic method. A mixed qualitative/quantitative idiographic protocol with a threefold diagnostic approach was tested with the participation of three individuals with severe IEI-EMF. In this qualitative paper, the environmental, psychosocial, and clinical aspects are presented and discussed (results of ecological momentary assessment are discussed in Part II of this study). For two participants, psychopathological factors appeared to be strongly related to the condition. Psychological assessment indicated a severe pre-psychotic state with paranoid tendencies, supplemented with a strong attentional focus on bodily sensations and health status. The psychological profile of the third individual showed no obvious pathology. Overall, the findings suggest that the condition might have uniformly been triggered by serious psychosocial stress for all participants. Substantial aetiological differences among participants with severe IEI-EMF were revealed. The substantial heterogeneity in the psychological and psychopathological profiles associated with IEI-EMF warrants the use of idiographic multimodal assessments in order to better understand the different ways of aetiology and to facilitate person-taylored treatments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aetiology 3ahealth status 3apaper 3apsychological stress 0aElectromagnetic hypersensitivity 0aIdiographic 0aClinical 0aParanoid 0aHealth anxiety 0aMMPI 0aIndividual aetiology1 aSzabolcs, Zsuzsanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8521-82091 aBérdi, Márk1 aWitthöft, Michael1 aKöteles, Ferenc1 aSzemerszky, Renáta0 tHeliyon.g2022 July, v. 8, no. 7 p.e09987-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e099873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01392naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245004700160300001600207520041600223592002800639650001700667650001200684650002000696650001900716650001400735650001300749700002800762700001900790700002100809700001900830773012200849856007400971852000901045655001201054IND60662595320221118033756.0190906e20110208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066259532DNAL7 a10.1039/c0gc00595a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollmann, Frank10aEnzyme-mediated oxidations for the chemist  ap. 226-265.  aBiocatalysis is an enabling technology adding to organic oxidation chemistry.

Initially, HC was employed for the evaluation of the reagent used in alkaline pretreatment. Alkalis (NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3, Ca(OH)2) and NaOH recycled black liquor (successive batches) were used and their pretreatment effectiveness was assessed considering the solid composition and its enzymatic digestibility. In SSF process using NaOH-HC pretreatment SCB, 62.33% of total carbohydrate fractions were hydrolyzed and 17.26g/L of ethanol production (0.48g of ethanol/g of glucose and xylose consumed) was achieved. This proposed scheme of HC-assisted NaOH pretreatment together with our interconnected column reactors showed to be an interesting new approach for biorefineries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScheffersomyces stipitis 3aalkali treatment 3aalkalis 3abiorefining 3acalcium hydroxide 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3aglucose 3ahydrodynamics 3apotassium hydroxide 3araw materials 3asaccharification 3asodium carbonate 3asodium hydroxide 3asugarcane bagasse 3awaste liquors 3axylose 0aHydrodynamic cavitation 0aAlkaline pretreatment 0aSugarcane bagasse 0aInterconnected column reactors 0aSSF process1 aIenny, João Vitor1 aMarcelino, Paulo Franco1 aAhmed, Muhammad Ajaz1 aAntunes, Felipe A.F.1 aSilva, Silvio Silvério da,1 aSantos, Júlio César dos,0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Nov., v. 243 p.652-659dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.06.1593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245004700172300001600219520128900235592002801524650001301552650001601565650001101581650001101592650001701603650001001620650001501630650001401645650001001659653001401669653002401683653004401707653002301751653005001774773009101824856008501915852000902000655001202009IND60551303220221119151110.0161018e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055130322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuBois, Grant E.10aMolecular mechanism of sweetness sensation  ap. 453-463.  aThe current understanding of peripheral molecular events involved in sweet taste sensation in humans is reviewed. Included are discussions of the sweetener receptor T1R2/T1R3, its agonists, antagonists, positive allosteric modulators, the transduction of its activation in taste bud cells and the coding of its signaling to the CNS. Areas of incomplete understanding include 1) signal communication with afferent nerve fibers, 2) contrasting concentration/response (C/R) functions for high-potency (HP) sweeteners (hyperbolic) and carbohydrate (CHO) sweeteners (linear), 3) contrasting temporal profiles for HP sweeteners (delayed onset and extinction) and CHO sweeteners (rapid onset and extinction) and 4) contrasting adaptation behaviors for HP sweeteners (moderate to strong adaptation) and CHO sweeteners (low adaptation). Evidence based on the sweet water aftertastes of several novel sweetness inhibitors is presented providing new support for constitutive activity in T1R2/T1R3. And a model is developed to rationalize the linear C/R functions of CHO sweeteners and hyperbolic C/R functions of HP sweeteners, where the former may activate T1R2/T1R3 by both binding and constitutive activity modulation (i.e., without binding) and the latter activate T1R2/T1R3 only by binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3ahumans 3amodels 3anerve fibers 3apalps 3asweeteners 3asweetness 3ataste 0aSweetener 0aSweetness inhibitor 0aSweetener positive allosteric modulator 0aSweetener receptor 0aSweetness mechanism and constitutive activity0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 164 p.453-463dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245013200208506011700340506007600457520150000533592002802033506003702061650001302098650001502111650002002126650001702146653001802163653002502181653001602206653001702222653002102239700002002260700005602280700005702336773009302393856008602486852000902572655001202581IND60779940620221207103059.0220906e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077994062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e096832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaris, Hossam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4261-812710aAutomatic symptoms identification from a massive volume of unstructured medical consultations using deep neural and BERT models  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAutomatic symptom identification plays a crucial role in assisting doctors during the diagnosis process in Telemedicine. In general, physicians spend considerable time on clinical documentation and symptom identification, which is unfeasible due to their full schedule. With text-based consultation services in telemedicine, the identification of symptoms from a user's consultation is a sophisticated process and time-consuming. Moreover, at Altibbi, which is an Arabic telemedicine platform and the context of this work, users consult doctors and describe their conditions in different Arabic dialects which makes the problem more complex and challenging. Therefore, in this work, an advanced deep learning approach is developed consultations with multi-dialects. The approach is formulated as a multi-label multi-class classification using features extracted based on AraBERT and fine-tuned on the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network. The Fine-tuning of BiLSTM relies on features engineered based on different variants of the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). Evaluating the models based on precision, recall, and a customized hit rate showed a successful identification of symptoms from Arabic texts with promising accuracy. Hence, this paves the way toward deploying an automated symptom identification model in production at Altibbi which can help general practitioners in telemedicine in providing more efficient and accurate consultations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3aautomation 3aneural networks 3atelemedicine 0aDeep learning 0aMulti-classification 0aMulti-label 0aTelemedicine 0aMachine learning1 aFaris, Mohammad1 aHabib, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9642-95971 aAlomari, Alaa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9148-35430 tHeliyon.g2022 June, v. 8, no. 6 p.e09683-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e096833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006500151245016300216300001400379520139200393592002801785650001301813650001901826650002901845650002101874650002001895650002601915650000901941653001901950653001501969653002601984653002202010653002102032700002302053700002802076700006102104700002502165700005602190773009602246856008502342852000902427655001202436IND60554506020221119102410.0161024e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055450602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnanthula, Suryatheja1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7748-893810aDevelopment and validation of sensitive LC/MS/MS method for quantitative bioanalysis of levonorgestrel in rat plasma and application to pharmacokinetics study  ap. 47-53.  aRapid, sensitive, selective and accurate LC/MS/MS method was developed for quantitative determination of levonorgestrel (LNG) in rat plasma and further validated for specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, matrix effect, recovery efficiency and stability. Liquid–liquid extraction procedure using hexane:ethyl acetate mixture at 80:20 v:v ratio was employed to efficiently extract LNG from rat plasma. Reversed phase Luna column C18(2) (50×2.0mm i.d., 3μM) installed on a AB SCIEX Triple Quad™ 4500 LC/MS/MS system was used to perform chromatographic separation. LNG was identified within 2min with high specificity. Linear calibration curve was drawn within 0.5–50ng·mL−1 concentration range. The developed method was validated for intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision whose values fell in the acceptable limits. Matrix effect was found to be minimal. Recovery efficiency at three quality control (QC) concentrations 0.5 (low), 5 (medium) and 50 (high) ng·mL−1 was found to be >90%. Stability of LNG at various stages of experiment including storage, extraction and analysis was evaluated using QC samples, and the results showed that LNG was stable at all the conditions. This validated method was successfully used to study the pharmacokinetics of LNG in rats after SubQ injection, providing its applicability in relevant preclinical studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3achromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3apharmacokinetics 3aquality control 3aquantitative analysis 3arats 0aLevonorgestrel 0aRat plasma 0aLiquid chromatography 0aMass spectroscopy 0aPharmacokinetics1 aJanagam, Dileep R.1 aJamalapuram, Seshulatha1 aJohnson, James R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3961-235X1 aMandrell, Timothy D.1 aLowe, Tao L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2882-04090 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 1003 p.47-53dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01933naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245008700173520079600260592002801056653000901084653001101093653002001104653002001124653002101144653003201165700006001197700001901257700001901276700002001295700001401315700002301329700002201352773010401374856008401478852000901562655001201571IND60720405620221122034009.0211227e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072040562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.egycc.2020.1000222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergero, Candelaria13aAn integrated assessment of a low coal low nuclear future energy system for Taiwan  aThe goal of this study is to analyze decarbonization pathways for Taiwan, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement: achieving a 2 °C increase by 2100, aiming for 1.5 °C.

We find that, if Taiwan wants to be consistent with Paris’ goals, it needs an aggressive electrification of end-use sectors, a rapid scale-up of renewable energies, as well as increased efficiencies in buildings, transportation and industry. Transportation and industry present greater decarbonization challenges than buildings, and negative emission technologies become crucial.

However, its use may go beyond being a habit, leading to compulsive use behaviours that jeopardize the well-being of an individual and the whole society. This study proposes and evaluates a theoretical model that examines the four dimensions of social capital, mediated by bonding and bridging social capital, as drivers of compulsive use of online social networks in the context of civil unrest. We evaluate the model using partial least squares structural equation modelling with data collected from a developing country. We found that reciprocity is the most important driver for bonding and bridging social capital with online members. Whereas trust, contradicting most of the literature in the field, was not statistically significant over bonding and bridging social capital. Bonding social capital shows a significant association with compulsive use behaviour. On the other hand, the effect of bridging social capital on compulsive use behaviour, although not significant, may become significant in the presence of a strong usage habit.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asocial capital 3asociety 3atheoretical models 0aSocial capital theory 0aSocial networking sites (SNS) 0aPartial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) 0aBridging social capital 0aBonding social capital 0aCompulsive usage behaviour1 aAcedo, Albert1 aLascano, Jorge Edison1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0200-75430 tHeliyon.g2022 July, v. 8, no. 7 p.e09990-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e099903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04083naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245005300167300001600220520257200236592002802808650001402836650001402850650001102864650002402875650002702899650001502926650002102941650002002962650000902982650001802991650001303009650001103022650000903033650002003042650001403062650001403076650002403090650002103114650001603135650002403151653002103175653001903196653001403215653002403229653001303253700001703266700001903283773014803302856008203450852000903532655001203541IND60591241620221122101304.0180904e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059124162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2018.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, Appurva10aBiodiesel production in micro-reactors: A review  ap. 143-161.  aIn recent years, biodiesel, as a renewable and environment-friendly fuel has emerged as one of the most investigated bio-fuel with a goal to decrease our dependence on petroleum fuels and reduce environmental pollution. The current commercial technique of biodiesel production via transesterification is constrained by high operating cost and energy requirements, long residence time and limited conversion due to equilibrium limitations. On the other hand, the process intensification using the micro-reactor technology demonstrated an excellent performance ascribed to short diffusion distance and high surface area-to-volume ratio that can lead to high heat and mass transfer rates and improved mixing compared to the conventional reactors. This review provides an overview of the current status of biodiesel production in micro-reactors. It includes various types of micro-reactors used in the production of biodiesel, factors affecting the biodiesel production (i.e., temperature, residence time, alcohol to oil molar ratio, micro-channel size, inlet mixer type, internal geometries, co-solvent, catalyst type and concentration). This review also includes the factors affecting the liquid-liquid flow patterns and application of micro-reactor technology in the purification of biodiesel. Some of the critical observations from this review are, 1) inlet mixer type, channel size, and internal channel geometry (zig-zag, omega, and tesla shaped channels) have shown a significant effect on mixing in micro-channels. 2) In case of base-catalyzed transesterification, the biodiesel yield was found to increase up to the reaction temperature of 60–65 °C. 3) Homogeneous alkaline catalyst (NaOH, KOH, CH3ONa) was preferred for the feedstock with low free fatty acid content (<1 wt%). However, an acid catalyst with high concentration, a significant amount of methanol and long reaction time were required for high free fatty acid feedstock (>1 wt%). Therefore, the current research is more focused on the investigation of heterogeneous catalysts in micro-reactors to develop an ecologically friendly process for the production of biodiesel. 4) Also, the reaction temperature and inlet mixer type had shown a significant effect on liquid-liquid flow patterns. This review also addressed the following literature gaps; a numbering-up technique to increase the throughput; catalyst development for high free fatty acid feedstock; continuous production of biodiesel in micro-reactors with in-line purification step to meet the energy demand and quality standards.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3aenergy 3aenergy requirements 3afatty acid composition 3afeedstocks 3afree fatty acids 3afuel production 3aheat 3amass transfer 3amethanol 3amixing 3aoils 3aoperating costs 3apetroleum 3apollution 3apotassium hydroxide 3asodium hydroxide 3atemperature 3atransesterification 0aRenewable energy 0aMicro-reactors 0aBiodiesel 0aTransesterification 0aBio-fuel1 aRajesh, V.M.1 aYadav, Sanjeev0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2018 Apr., v. 43 p.143-161dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2018.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010100171300001600272520123900288592002801527650001201555650002501567650002201592650002301614650003401637650001401671650002401685650001201709650001901721650001001740650002001750700001901770700002401789700002201813773010401835856004801939852000901987655001201996IND50071652220221120184805.0140104e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007165222DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-012-1033-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilkin, Jonathan D.10aStorage Stability of Whole and Nibbed, Conventional and High Oleic Peanuts (Arachis hypogeae L.)  ap. 105-113.  aPeanuts are increasingly being used as nibbed ingredients in cereal bars, confectionery and breakfast cereals.

Storage trials to determine the stability to oxidation were carried out on whole and nibbed kernels of conventional (CP) and high oleic (HOP) peanuts, with respect to temperature and modified atmosphere packaging. HOP exhibited the highest oxidative stability, with a lag phase in whole kernels of 12-15 weeks before significant oxidation occurred. HOP also showed higher levels of intrinsic antioxidants, a trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) of 70 mMol equivalence and radical scavenging percentage (RSP) of 99.8 % at the beginning of storage trials, whereas CP showed values of 40 mMol and 81.2 %, respectively. The intrinsic antioxidants at the beginning of these storage trials were shown to affect the peroxide value (PV), where RSP and TEAC decreased, and PV increased. Therefore, in peanuts the processing format (nibbed or whole) had the highest influence on susceptibility of lipid oxidation, highest to lowest importance: processing format > temperature > atmospheric conditions. ©Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis 3aantioxidant activity 3abreakfast cereals 3alipid peroxidation 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apeanuts 3aperoxide value 3aseeds 3astorage quality1 aAshton, Ian P.1 aFielding, Louise M.1 aTatham, Arthur S.0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2014 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.105-113dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-012-1033-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245017200181300001600353520088900369592002801258650001501286650001101301650001301312650001301325650001601338650001601354650001301370650001201383650001101395650005001406650000901456651001701465651001401482651001001496651001301506651001201519700001601531773009701547856004801644852000901692655001201701IND50064049020221118022959.0130325e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006404902DNAL7 a239497512pmid7 a10.1007/s13744-013-0109-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibon, F M10aContribution to the Knowledge of the Andean Stonefly Genus Claudioperla Illies, with Description of New Apterous and Micropterous Species (Plecoptera: Gripopterygidae)  ap. 170-177.  aThe genus Claudioperla (Plecoptera: Gripopterygidae), which has been reported from Chile and Argentina to Colombia, was until now monospecific. The study of adults from various localities of the Bolivian Altiplano has resulted in the discovery of four distinct species. Three are new and described: Claudioperla rosalesi n. sp., Claudioperla moyai n. sp., and Claudioperla ruhieri n. sp. The fourth, Claudioperla tigrina (Klapálek), presents morphological variations with previous descriptions that are exposed and discussed. One of the new species, C. ruhieri, is apterous. The male of C. moyai is micropterous. Among South American stoneflies, they are the first cases of aptery and microptery reported outside of Patagonia. Adapted to extreme conditions of temperature and altitude, C. moyai and C. ruhieri are particularly threatened by the recent evolution of Bolivian glaciers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlecoptera 3aadults 3aaltitude 3aglaciers 3anew species 3atemperature 2aAltitude 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aInsectaxanatomy & histologyxclassification. 2aMale 3aAndes region 3aArgentina 3aChile 3aColombia 0aBolivia1 aMolina, C I0 tNeotropical entomology.g2013 Apr., v. 42, no. 2 p.170-177dSpringer-Verlagx1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-013-0109-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245011700167300001400284520112100298592002801419506003701447650001901484650001501503650001501518650001501533650002001548650001201568650001701580650004301597700001501640700001901655773012401674856008101798852000901879655001201888IND60774720620221207120907.0220422e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077472062DNAL7 a10.1177/02611929198629362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerbrugghe, Elin10aReference Gene Validation for Quantitative Real-time PCR Studies in Amphibian Kidney-derived A6 Epithelial Cells  ap. 63-70.  aQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction is a widely used technique that relies on reference genes for the normalisation of gene expression. These reference genes are constitutively expressed and must remain stable across all samples and treatments. Stability of housekeeping genes may vary and must be optimised for a specific tissue, sample or cell line. Here we present a study screening for possible reference gene candidates, eef1a1, rpl8, sub1.L, clta, H4 and odc1, in the Xenopus laevis (A6) kidney cell line. Quantification cycle results were analysed using geNorm to calculate the average expression stability and the coefficient of variation (CV) for each candidate reference gene. All of the tested genes met the guidelines for stable reference genes, namely an average expression stability of < 0.5 and a CV value of < 0.2, with eef1a1 > sub1.L > rpl8 > clta > odc1 > H4. By using pairwise variation analysis, the optimal number of reference targets was determined to be 2. As such, we report that the reference genes eef1a1 and sub1.L should be used to achieve optimal normalisation in A6 cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aXenopus laevis 3aamphibians 3acell lines 3aepithelium 3agene expression 3akidneys 3alaboratories 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction1 aMartel, An1 aPasmans, Frank0 tATLA.

Fish were dispersed into 24, 110‐L aquaria (n = 20/tank) configured as a recirculating system. Aquaria were arbitrarily allocated to dietary treatments in triplicate (n = 60/fish diet). The FM component of experimental diets was replaced using poultry by‐product meal and soy protein concentrate. One experimental diet contained FO, whereas in others, FO was replaced with canola, flax and/or algal oil or combinations thereof. At trial end, there were no differences among fish‐fed various diets in terms of feed conversion or protein efficiency ratios. Weight gain and survival were similar for experimental groups, and LMB fed the Xinxin commercial feed, but the Coppens feed returned inferior (p < 0.05) weights and higher mortality. Condition factor, fillet yield and intraperitoneal fat ratios were unaffected by diet but hepatosomatic index varied. The Coppens feed caused greatest differences in whole‐body protein, lipid and ash contents (p < 0.001). Whole‐body fatty acid profiles reflected those of the diet, with algal oil enriched feed illustrating enhanced DHA:EPA ratios.  aPublisher supplied data  aN/AcAnthropocene Institute 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aalgal oils 3aaquaculture 3acanola 3acondition factor 3aexperimental diets 3afatty acids 3afeed conversion 3afillets 3afish 3afish meal 3aflax 3ahepatosomatic index 3amortality 3apoultry meal 3aresearch 3asoy protein concentrate 3aweight gain1 aAlfrey, Kelly B.1 aGatlin, Delbert M., IIIcIII1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2534-64221 aBarrows, Frederick T.0 tAquaculture research.g2022 June, v. 53, no. 8 p.3036-3047dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.158153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03531naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245012800199300001400327520222000341592002802561650001302589650001102602650001902613650001202632650001602644650001802660650001902678650000902697650001402706650001002720650001102730650002002741650002802761650001502789650001102804650002302815650001002838700005802848773010302906856007903009852000903088655001203097IND60720406020221122054649.0210421e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072040602DNAL7 a10.3168/jdsc.2020-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUddin, M.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8179-894410aEffect of source and level of forage in the diet on in vitro ammonia emission from manure of Holstein and Jersey dairy cows  ap. 16-20.  aReducing overall reactive N losses from dairy production systems depends substantially on reducing the atmospheric emission of manure ammonia (NH₃). The objective of this study was to determine potential NH₃-N emission of reconstituted manure using an in vitro protocol. Feces and urine were collected from a companion study designed as a Latin square in which 4 Holstein and 4 Jersey cows were fed diets containing 2 levels of forage neutral detergent fiber (NDF) [low-forage NDF (19%) vs. high-forage NDF (24%; dry matter basis)] from either alfalfa silage or corn silage (70:30 vs. 30:70 ratio of alfalfa silage NDF:corn silage NDF) arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial. All diets contained similar levels of crude protein (17%) and starch (23%), and had forage-to-concentrate ratios of 55:45 and 68:32 for low- and high-forage NDF diets, respectively. Measurements of NH₃-N emission were conducted in a laboratory-scale chamber with 16 g of reconstituted manure (urine plus feces) incubated for 48 h at 15°C with sampling at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Hourly NH₃-N emissions data were analyzed using a repeated-measures mixed model in R (https://www.r-project.org/). The fixed effects were breed, forage NDF level, forage NDF source, time of sampling, and all possible interactions; cow was included as a random term. The cumulative 48-h NH₃-N emissions and the scaled-up emissions accounting for daily output of manure from each cow were analyzed using the same model but without time of sampling. Level and source of forage in the diet tended to influence the pattern in hourly rate and 48-h cumulative emission, respectively. Accounting for daily manure volume differences, low-forage NDF diets led to lower estimates of daily NH₃-N emissions than high-forage NDF diets (20% on a cow basis, 15% on a raw manure basis, and 18% on a manure-N basis). Compared with Holsteins, Jerseys emitted 17% lower estimated NH₃-N on a cow basis, mainly due to lower manure excretion but tended to emit 15% more NH₃-N expressed on a manure-N basis. Findings of this study suggested that cow breed and dietary forage NDF level should be considered in the prediction of NH₃-N emission from the dairy industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aJersey 3aalfalfa silage 3aammonia 3acorn silage 3acrude protein 3adairy industry 3adiet 3aexcretion 3afeces 3aforage 3amilk production 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aprediction 3astarch 3astatistical models 3aurine1 aWattiaux, M.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8713-16410 tJDS communications.g2021 Jan., v. 2, no. 1 p.16-20dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27587x2666-91027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jdsc.2020-00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009000169300001400259520152500273592002801798650001801826650002201844650002601866650001201892650002401904650002001928650004301948650002201991650001102013650002102024650001302045650002502058650001102083653003302094653004702127653002402174653001402198653003202212700001402244700001702258700001502275700005602290773009602346856008502442852000902527655001202536IND60554506420221119102350.0161024e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055450642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Sainan10aCrystallization-induced dynamic resolution R-epimer from 25-OCH3-PPD epimeric mixture  ap. 39-46.  a25-OCH3-PPD is a promising antitumor dammarane sapogenin isolated from the total saponin-hydrolyzed extract of Panax ginseng berry and Panax notoginseng leaves. 20(R)-25-OCH3-PPD was more potent as an anti-cancer agent than 20(S)-25-OCH3-PPD and epimeric mixture of 25-OCH3-PPD. This paper describes the rapid separation process of the R-epimer of 25-OCH3-PPD from its epimeric mixture by crystallization-induced dynamic resolution (CIDR). The optimized CIDR process was based on single factor analysis and nine well-planned orthogonal design experiments (OA9 matrix). A rapid and sensitive reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with evaporative light-scattering detector (ELSD) was developed and validated for the quantitation of 25-OCH3-PPD epimeric mixture and crystalline product. Separation and quantitation were achieved with a silica column using a mobile phase consisting of methanol and water (87:13, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0mL/min. The ELSD detection was performed at 50°C and 3L/min. Under conditions involving 3mL of 95% ethanol, 8% HCl, and a hermetically sealed environment for 72h, the maximum production of 25(R)-OCH3-PPD was achieved with a chemical purity of 97% and a total yield of 87% through the CIDR process. The 25(R)-OCH3-PPD was nearly completely separated from the 220mg 25-OCH3-PPD epimeric mixture. Overall, a simple and steady small-batch purification process for the large-scale production of 25(R)-OCH3-PPD from 25-OCH3-PPD epimeric mixture was developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax ginseng 3aPanax notoginseng 3aantineoplastic agents 3aethanol 3aexperimental design 3afactor analysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrochloric acid 3aleaves 3alight scattering 3amethanol 3apurification methods 3asilica 0a25-OCH3-PPD epimeric mixture 0aCrystallization-induced dynamic resolution 0aAnticancer activity 0aHPLC-ELSD 0aSeparation and quantitation1 aTang, Yun1 aCao, Jiaqing1 aZhao, Chen1 aZhao, Yuqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7683-52480 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 1005 p.39-46dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01969naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011100171300001400282520079700296592002801093650001701121650002101138650002601159650001601185650001101201650002201212650001301234650001301247650001201260653002001272653002101292653002701313653001401340700002001354773011401374856008601488852000901574655001201583IND60602675120221120213152.0180711e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060267512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlawid, Rosana10aConstruction of an infectious clone of a plant RNA virus in a binary vector using one-step Gibson Assembly  ap. 11-15.  aThe construction of full-length infectious clones of RNA viruses is often laborious due to the many cloning steps required and the DNA exclusion within the plasmid during Escherichia coli transformation. We demonstrate single-step cloning procedure of an infectious cDNA of the tomato blistering mosaic virus (ToBMV) using Gibson Assembly (GA), which drastically reduces the number of cloning steps. By agro-inoculation with the construct obtained by this procedure, ToBMV was recovered six days post-inoculation in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. The symptoms induced by the recovered virus were indistinguishable from those caused by the wild-type virus. We conclude that the GA is very useful method particularly to construct a full-length cDNA clone of a plant RNA virus in a binary vector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA assembly 3aEscherichia coli 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aRNA viruses 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3aplasmids 3atomatoes 3aviruses 0aGibson Assembly 0aSeamless cloning 0aFull-length cDNA clone 0aTymovirus1 aNagata, Tatsuya0 tJournal of virological methods.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 222 p.11-15dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010300173300001400276520120700290592002801497650002001525650002201545650002001567650002001587650000901607650001201616650001201628650001001640650001601650650000901666653002601675653001401701653001901715653002201734653002101756653001501777700002001792773011401812856008701926852000902013655001202022IND60532454920221119223707.0190318e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053245492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2014.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreton, Grégory10aInfluence of enclosure size on the distances covered and paced by captive tigers (Panthera tigris)  ap. 66-75.  aIn the wild, tigers live in large individual territories ranging from 7 to 1000km2 depending on the region and prey abundance. However, in captivity, the animal's environment is strongly reduced, and the size of the enclosure provided varies between zoos. It has been shown that animals occupying large territories in the wild, like tigers, are more vulnerable to problems of stress in captivity. Movement in captive cats has not been the subject of extensive studies, and the aim of this one was to determine the impact of the size of the enclosure on the movement of 38 captive tigers. This study shows a positive correlation between the size of the enclosure and the total distance covered by the animals and also that males covered greater distances than females. Moreover, the analysis also revealed that pacing, a form of stereotypy, has the potential to develop from the time the animals are old enough to disperse, and that this abnormal behaviour was negatively correlated with the size of the enclosure. Finally, an index, calculated with distances covered and paced, was created and can become a good tool for zoos that want to quantify and reduce abnormal pacing performed by their animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanthera tigris 3aabnormal behavior 3aanimal behavior 3acaptive animals 3acats 3aelderly 3afemales 3amales 3azoo animals 3azoos 0aTiger Panthera tigris 0aCaptivity 0aEnclosure size 0aCovered distances 0aPacing distances 0aStereotypy1 aBarrot, Salomé0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2014 May, v. 154 p.66-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2014.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001800169245021800187300001500405520159100420592002802011650002602039650001002065650001502075650001602090650002602106650001702132650001302149650001302162650002002175650001102195650001102206650001102217650001602228650001102244650001202255650001002267650001402277650001102291650000902302650002902311650001302340650000902353650002202362650001402384650001702398650001602415700002102431700001902452773009902471856008602570852000902656655001202665IND4478871220221116141807.0141110e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447887122DNAL7 a220753902pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Seiji10aRe-examination of the roles of environmental factors in the control of body-color polyphenism in solitarious nymphs of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria with special reference to substrate color and humidity  ap. 89-101.  aThis study re-examines the effects of environmental factors including substrate color, humidity, food quality, light intensity and temperature on the green–brown polyphenism, black patterning and background body color of solitarious (isolated-reared) nymphs of Schistocerca gregaria. All individuals reared in yellow–green or yellow containers became green morphs, whereas those reared in white, ivory-colored, blue, grey, brown, zinc-colored and black containers produced brown morphs in similar proportions. The intensity of black patterns was negatively correlated with the brightness of the substrate color of the containers. Humidity, which previous studies claimed controls green–brown polyphenism in this species, exerted no significant influence on either the green–brown polyphenism or the black patterning. Food quality also had little effect on body color. High temperature tended to inhibit darkening. The background body color on the thorax was greatly influenced by the substrate color of rearing containers and a close correlation was found between these two variables, indicating that, in contrast to what has been suggested by others, this species exhibits homochromy to match the body color to the substrate color of its habitat. Similar responses were observed in another strain, although some quantitative differences occurred between the two strains examined. Based on these results, a new model explaining the control of body-color polyphenism in this locust is proposed and the ecological significance of black patterns in solitarious nymphs is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistocerca gregaria 3acolor 3acontainers 3acorrelation 3aenvironmental factors 3afood quality 3ahabitats 3ahumidity 3alight intensity 3amodels 3amorphs 3anymphs 3atemperature 3athorax 2aAnimals 2aColor 2aEcosystem 2aFemale 2aFood 2aGrasshoppersxphysiology 2aHumidity 2aMale 2aNymphxphysiology 2aPhenotype 2aPigmentation 2aSex Factors1 aHarano, Ken-ichi1 aNishide, Yudai0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2012 Jan., v. 58, no. 1 p.89-101dElsevier Ltdx0022-19107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005500139245012700194300001800321500002000339520136200359592002801721596005601749596005901805596005901864650002401923650001601947650001401963650001001977650001401987650002302001650001002024650001502034650003002049650001202079650001002091650001402101650001302115650002302128650001102151650001302162650001102175650002402186700005202210700005302262700005102315700005402366700005602420773012202476856007402598852000902672655001202681IND60775912620221119204310.0220502e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077591262DNAL7 a10.1111/are.158172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Huamei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3795-777610aIntraperitoneal injection of 17β‐estradiol increases ovarian smad2/3 expression in Yangtze sturgeon Acipenser dabryanus  ap. 3059-3068.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSmad (mothers against decapentaplegic homologue) proteins are the downstream signalling factors involved in TGFβ (transforming growth factor beta) pathways. The present study was aimed to reveal the estradiol feedback regulation of Smad signalling in one of the endangered sturgeon species Acipenser dabyanus. Two receptor‐activated (R‐) smad paralogues, smad2 and smad3 were identified in Yangtze sturgeon, whose full‐length cDNA sequences were 1,824 and 1,876 base pairs, encoding 467 and 426 amino acids respectively. Multiple sequence alignment suggested that both Smad2 and Smad3 were highly conserved among vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Smad2 was more conserved than Smad3 in Yangtze sturgeon. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that both smad2 and smad3 transcribed ubiquitously in heart, liver, spleen, kidney, intestine, testis, ovary, midbrain and pituitary. Transcription levels of smad2 and smad3 in the ovary were increased significantly after 17β‐estradiol (E2) intraperitoneal injection (p < 0.05). Besides, transcriptions of aromatase (cyp19a1a), and oestrogen receptor beta (erβ) were decreased due to E2 injection (p < 0.05). These results indicate that E2 exerts positive feedback effect on R‐smad signalling, potentially through the downregulation of aromatase and ERβ, in the ovary of sturgeons.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0901205cNational Key R & D Program of China  a31802282cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31902353cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aAcipenser dabryanus 3aaquaculture 3aaromatase 3abrain 3aestradiol 3aestrogen receptors 3aheart 3aintestines 3aintraperitoneal injection 3akidneys 3aliver 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3asequence alignment 3aspleen 3asturgeon 3atestes 3atissue distribution1 aYe, Huan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1626-06511 aRuan, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7607-73251 aDu, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0018-17401 aWei, Qiwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6366-10201 aLi, Chuangju1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9531-46830 tAquaculture research.g2022 June, v. 53, no. 8 p.3059-3068dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.158173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01611naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245009700212300001800309520051000327592002800837650001300865650001200878650001700890650002700907650001700934650001300951650001100964700003200975700002801007700002801035773009501063856008201158852000901240655001201249IND60530805920221118044101.0210124e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053080592DNAL7 a271825382pmid7 aPMC48572192pmcid7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVentura, Patrícia,10aUpcycling potato peel waste – Data of the pre-screening of the acid-catalyzed liquefaction  ap. 1455-1457.  aHerein, the data acquired regarding the preliminary and exploratory experiments conducted with potato peel as a biomass source for the direct thermochemical liquefaction is disclosed.

However, in some cases current nucleic acid probes fail to detect allele-specific mutations, for example, human platelet antigens, HPA-15a (TCC) and HPA-15b (TAC) alleles associated with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. Towards this, it is necessary to develop a novel assay for detection of allele-specific mutations. In this study, we investigated the potential of unlocked nucleic acid (UNA)-modified primers in SNP detection utilising an enzymatic polymerisation-based approach. Our results of primer extension and asymmetric polymerase chain reaction by KOD XL DNA polymerase revealed that UNA-modified primers achieved excellent allele-specificity in discriminating the human platelet antigen DNA template, whereas the DNA control primers were not able to differentiate between the normal and mutant alleles, demonstrating the scope of this novel UNA-based enzymatic approach as a robust methodology for efficient detection of allele-specific mismatches. Although further evaluation is required for other disease conditions, we firmly believe that our findings offer a great promise for the diagnosis of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia and other SNP-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aalleles 3aantigens 3aenzymatic treatment 3agenotype 3ahumans 3amutants 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apolymerization 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atherapeutics 3athrombocytopenia1 aHughes, Quintin1 aRakesh, Shilpa1 aBaker, Ross1 aJørgensen, Per T.1 aWengel, Jesper1 aVeedu, Rakesh N.0 tRSC advances.g2018 Sept. 21, v. 8, no. 57 p.32770-32774dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra06050a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03854naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010300168520252600271592002802797650002502825650001602850650001102866650002402877650000902901650001702910650001802927650001402945650001002959650002202969650002802991650001103019651001003030653002103040653002503061653001703086653002803103653001403131653001003145700002503155773013503180856008403315852000903399655001203408IND60783560420221117032209.0220902e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078356042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vprsr.2022.1007612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbas, Ibrahim10aTrichostrongyle infections in domestic ruminants from Egypt: A systematic review and meta-analysis  aTrichostrongylid nematodes can cause serious loss in the livestock economy; nevertheless, infections with these ubiquitous nematodes in animals from developing countries are largely neglected. The present paper provides a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the status of trichostrongyle infections in domestic ruminants from Egypt. Out of 626 collected publications, 118 were defined suitable for inclusion in this review and represented trichostrongyle infections in 5 ruminant species (sheep, goats, cattle, buffaloes and camels) from Egypt. Published surveys have mostly focused on sheep, which had the highest (44.8%) pooled prevalence of trichostrongyle infections based on 95% confidence interval (35.9–53.6%) with no significant variations among sheep in different Egyptian regions. Goats had lower infection prevalence (31.2%, 21.5–40.8%) in comparison to sheep, and no significant regional differences were also found. The management and marketing practices likely account for the wide distribution of infection among small ruminants across Egypt. Variable trichostrongyle infection rates were estimated for camels (38.8%, 28.9–48.7%), cattle (27.4%, 14.4–40.3%) and buffaloes (12.2%, 8.0–16.4%). The prevalence of infection was significantly high during winter (52.1%, 32.2–72.1%), which provide favorable conditions for development and survival of larvae on pastures. The most common trichostrongyle identified in infected animals was Haemonchus contortus. The parasite was detected in 38.8% (29.9–47.6%) of infected sheep, 35.3% (24.8–45.7%) of infected goats and in 40.6% (18.6–62.5%) of infected camels. Clinical infections have been reported in a limited number of studies. Analysis of fecal egg counts (FECs) revealed that more than half (52.7%, 30.4–75.0%) of the tested sheep had low counts (<500 eggs per gram EPG), whereas only a few sheep (6.1%, 3.5–8.7%) had high counts >2000 EPG, implying that subclinical infections are common; however, the clinical infections cannot be completely ruled out. Anthelmintic resistance does not appear to be serious in trichostrongyle populations infecting ruminants from Egypt; nonetheless there have been a few cases of albendazole resistance in trichostrongyles infecting sheep. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the epidemiology and economic implications of trichostrongyle infections in ruminants from Egypt, which is crucial for establishing effective control strategies against these ubiquitous nematodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aalbendazole 3acattle 3aconfidence interval 3aeggs 3aepidemiology 3ameta-analysis 3aparasites 3asheep 3asystematic review 3aveterinary parasitology 3awinter 3aEgypt 0aTrichostrongyles 0aHaemonchus contortus 0aEpidemiology 0aAnthelmintic resistance 0aRuminants 0aEgypt1 aHildreth, Michael B.0 tVeterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports.g2022 Sept., v. 34 p.100761-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23280x2405-93907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2022.1007613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245013900201300001400340520180900354592002802163650001302191650001602204650001802220650003302238650002202271650001402293650001702307650002002324700005602344700001802400700005502418700005602473773010302529856007902632852000902711655001202720IND60720406220221122054548.0210421e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072040622DNAL7 a10.3168/jdsc.2020-00242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabrera, E.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4738-535310aHuman chorionic gonadotropin dose response for induction of ovulation 7 days after a synchronized ovulation in lactating Holstein cows  ap. 35-40.  aOur objective was to assess the effect of treatment with GnRH or 4 increasing doses of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on the ovulatory response of a first-wave dominant follicle and subsequent plasma progesterone (P4) concentrations. Lactating Holstein cows were blocked by parity (primiparous vs. multiparous) and randomly assigned to receive no treatment (control, CON; n = 147), 100 μg of GnRH (n = 144), or 1,000 (n = 138), 2,000 (n = 144), 2,500 (n = 142), or 3,300 (n = 139) IU of hCG 7 d after the last GnRH treatment (G2) of a Double-Ovsynch (DO) or Resynch protocol. Blood samples were collected and ovaries were evaluated with transrectal ultrasonography immediately before treatment and 7 d later to assess serum P4 concentrations and ovulatory response to treatment. Data were analyzed using the MIXED and GLIMMIX procedures of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Overall, ovulatory response differed and was 4.8, 79.0, 77.4, 88.9, 92.9, and 95.6% for CON, GnRH, 1,000-, 2,000-, 2,500-, and 3,300-IU hCG treatments, respectively. The increase in plasma P4 concentrations from 7 to 14 d after G2 differed among treatments and was 3.5, 5.9, 5.7, 6.6, 7.0, and 6.5 ng/mL for CON, GnRH, 1,000-, 2,000-, 2,500-, and 3,300-IU hCG treatments, respectively. In conclusion, lactating Holstein cows treated 7 d after G2 with 100 μg of GnRH or 1,000 IU of hCG had similar ovulatory responses (~78%), whereas cows treated with 2,000, 2,500, or 3,300 IU of hCG had increased ovulatory responses (~92%). Ovulatory response of cows treated with 2,000 or 2,500 IU of hCG did not differ, whereas the ovulatory response after 3,300 IU was greater than that after 2,000 IU of hCG. Plasma P4 concentrations and luteal volume 7 d after treatment were increased compared with those of untreated control cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3ablood serum 3adose response 3ahuman chorionic gonadotropin 3aovarian follicles 3aovulation 3aprogesterone 3aultrasonography1 aLauber, M.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4123-32411 aPeralta, E.M.1 aBilby, T.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6102-19701 aFricke, P.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1488-76720 tJDS communications.g2021 Jan., v. 2, no. 1 p.35-40dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27587x2666-91027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jdsc.2020-00243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010700168300001600275520099300291592002801284650002101312650002101333650002101354650001901375650002401394653002101418653002101439653003201460653001901492653001601511653002401527700001501551700001701566773010601583856008701689852000901776655001201785IND60570394820221120104146.0190409e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057039482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.06.1662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhi-Hua10aRespiration adaptation of activated sludge under dissolved oxygen and hypochlorite stressed conditions  ap. 171-178.  aIn this work, the relationship between environmental disturbance and the recovery of activated sludge at a low dissolved oxygen of 0.5mg/l or in the presence of sodium hypochlorite of 1–15mg Cl2/gSS/d was examined. When microorganisms entered their physiological adaptation period, a sharp increase in endogenous respiration rate was observed. The activity recovery potential of sludge depended on the ratio of the endogenous respiration rate to the maximum respiration rate. A subsequent decrease in this ratio after a sharp increase indicates that the disturbance was recoverable. An increase in this ratio to a certain value, e.g., 0.35, suggests that the sludge system could not adapt to the new environments and thus was unrecoverable. In addition, the recoveries of sludge respiration and effluent quality were asynchronous, which was impacted by both sludge activity and operating conditions. These results provide a useful approach for the operation of activated sludge systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3acell respiration 3adissolved oxygen 3amicroorganisms 3asodium hypochlorite 0aActivated sludge 0aDissolved oxygen 0aEndogenous respiration rate 0aRecoverability 0aRespiration 0aStressed conditions1 aMa, Zhi-Bo1 aYu, Han-Qing0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Jan., v. 248 p.171-178dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.06.1663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006000165506010400225506007600329520149600405592002801901506003701929650001601966650001701982650002101999650001902020650001302039650001402052650001502066650000902081650001102090650002002101653002502121653002402146653002502170653001302195653001102208653002002219700002102239700002102260700002502281700002702306700003102333700001902364700003102383700002202414773011002436856008202546852000902628655001202637IND60783560620221207070931.0220906e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078356062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vas.2022.1002652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBui, Samantha10aWarm water treatment increased mortality risk in salmon  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThermal treatment is a controversial method to control sea lice in the Atlantic salmon farming industry. This study aimed to complement the growing evidence base to document the impact of thermal treatments on salmon welfare, behaviour, physiology and health. Here, fish were treated two times (four weeks apart) for 30 s in either 27, 30, or 33 °C warm water, and parameters were compared to a procedural control (exposed to their holding temperature of 14 °C) or a negative control (where no treatments were applied). The fish had a clear behavioural response to the warm water, despite low difference between treatment and holding temperature (Δt = 13, 16 or 19 °C). Eye damages were more prevalent in the warm water treated groups than in the controls. Little difference was recorded between treatment groups in their growth and condition factor, blood plasma values, organ health, and long-term coping ability. There was, however, a significant increase in mortality as a function of temperature after the first treatment (14 °C: 6.5%, 27 °C: 5.3%, 30 °C: 12.4% and 33 °C: 18.9% mortality). The first treatment was performed only two weeks after the fish had been tagged and moved into the experimental holding tanks, while the fish had been allowed to recover for four weeks without any handling before the second treatment. The group of fish that were not subjected to any treatments (the negative control) had no mortality throughout the entire experimental period.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmo salar 3ablood plasma 3acondition factor 3aheat treatment 3aindustry 3amortality 3aphysiology 3arisk 3asalmon 3awater treatment 0aWarm water treatment 0aDelousing treatment 0aMortality, Behaviour 0aInjuries 0aStress 0aAtlantic salmon1 aMadaro, Angelico1 aNilsson, Jonatan1 aFjelldal, Per Gunnar1 aIversen, Martin Haugmo1 aBrinchman, Monica Fengsrud1 aVenås, Birger1 aSchrøder, Merete Bjørgan1 aStien, Lars Helge0 tVeterinary and Animal Science.g2022 Sept., v. 17 p.100265-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23501x2451-943X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vas.2022.1002653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245013500171300001400306520143100320592002801751506003701779650001101816650001101827650001701838700002401855700002101879773012401900856008102024852000902105655001202114IND60774721220221207132106.0220422e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077472122DNAL7 a10.1177/02611929209072262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinikoğlu, Oğuzcan10aPublication and Citation Analysis of Medical Doctors’ Residency Master’s Theses Involving Animal Experiments on Rats in Turkey  ap. 23-28.  aThe number of non-human animals used in research has increased in line with advances in medical technology, although it has previously been shown that these experiments demonstrate poor human utility. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of animal studies on rats that were performed as part of medical doctors’ residency master’s theses prepared in Turkey between January 2006 and December 2015. The number of thesis-derived published papers from each year, as well as the subsequent citation rate of these papers, was determined. Results from 34% of the 656 analysed studies (226/656) were published as papers in PubMed-indexed journals. These 226 studies got 1803 subsequent citations in total. Citation counts were statistically significantly different in 2009 and 2010, as compared to 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Previous studies showed that the usual main objective for carrying out animal studies in Turkey was the preparation of a thesis or the furthering of an academic career (i.e. personal self-interest). In the current study, the publication rate and the number of subsequent citations of these thesis-derived papers were both low, and thus, the contribution of these animal studies to scientific progress is doubtful. It is recommended that institutional research ethics committees should be much more highly selective in approving the use of animals for the purposes of student thesis preparation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aethics 3ahumans 3alaboratories1 aGüven, Yağmur Ö.1 aKilboz, Bekir B.0 tATLA.

Sphingolipids are membrane lipids that participate in many signal transduction pathways. In this paper, the changes in sphingolipids of the human multiple myeloma cell line U266 and the gastric cancer cell line MGC-803 treated with arsenic trioxide were investigated using an HPLC-ESI–MS/MS method. Analytes were separated by an XBridge BEH C8 column used for Cer, HexCer, LacCer and SM chromatographic separation, and a Capcell PAK MG II C18 column was used for Sph, dhSph, S1P and dhS1P chromatographic separation and gradient elution with acetonitrile–water containing 0.1% formic acid as a mobile phase. A tandem mass spectrometer QTrap in SRM mode was employed in combination with RPLC as a detector for quantitative analysis. The ceramide/sphingolipid internal standard (IS) mixture was used to quantify the levels of sphingolipids. The distributions of sphingolipids were found to be different in the human multiple myeloma cell line U266 and the gastric cancer cell line MGC-803. Ceramide (Cer), hexosylceramide (HexCer) and dihexosylceramide (Hex2Cer) levels in U266 cell line are higher than those in MGC-803 cell line. Additionally, sphingomyelin (SM), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and sphinganine-1-phosphate (dhS1P) levels in the MGC-803 cell line are higher than those in the U266 cell line. When treated with arsenic trioxide (1–5μM iAsIII(AsIII ions)), the levels of Hex2Cer in the human multiple myeloma cell line U266 decreased, and the levels of S1P and dhS1P in the human gastric cancer cell line MGC-803 decreased. The decrease of Hex2Cer, S1P and dhS1P in the human multiple myeloma cell line U266 and gastric cancer cell line MGC-803 were observed when the concentration of iAsIII is 1.0μM. Therefore, arsenic trioxide exhibits anti-cancer activity by altering the sphingolipid pathway in the human multiple myeloma cell line U266 and the gastric cancer cell line MGC-803.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3aarsenic 3aceramides 3achromatography 3aformic acid 3ahumans 3aions 3amyeloma 3aquantitative analysis 3asignal transduction 3aspectrometers 3asphingomyelins 3astomach neoplasms 0aDP 0aEP 0aCE 0aCXP 0aiAsIII 0aQTrap 0aSRM 0aCer 0aHexCer 0aHex2Cer 0aSM 0aSph 0adhSph 0aS1P 0adhS1P 0aSphingolipids 0aArsenic trioxide 0aHPLC-ESI–MS/MS 0aHuman multiple myeloma cell line U266 0aHuman gastric cancer cell line MGC-8031 aMa, Xiaoqiong1 aZhang, Guangji1 aShen, Li1 aZhou, Liting1 aYu, Yu1 aZhu, Fanfan1 aChen, Zhe0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 1004 p.98-107dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012500168300001400293520161900307592002801926650002401954650000901978650003101987650001002018650002102028650002102049650001902070650000902089650001802098650001902116650001702135650004102152650001802193650002202211650002602233653000902259653000902268653001002277653000902287653001302296653000902309653004102318653002002359653001902379653003902398653001902437700001802456700002302474700002902497700002202526700002202548700005702570773009402627856008302721852000902804655001202813IND60530172220221116155356.0180830e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053017222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2016.05.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMwita, Liberata10aGene expression regulation in the plant growth promoting Bacillus atrophaeus UCMB-5137 stimulated by maize root exudates  ap. 18-28.  aDespite successful use of Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) in agriculture, little is known about specific mechanisms of gene regulation facilitating the effective communication between bacteria and plants during plant colonization. Active PGPR strain Bacillus atrophaeus UCMB-5137 was studied in this research. RNA sequencing profiles were generated in experiments where root exudate stimulations were used to mimic interactions between bacteria and plants. It was found that the gene regulation in B. atrophaeus UCMB-5137 in response to the root exudate stimuli differed from the reported gene regulation at similar conditions in B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42, which was considered as a paradigm PGPR. This difference was explained by hypersensitivity of UCMB-5137 to the root exudate stimuli impelling it to a sessile root colonization behavior through the CcpA-CodY-AbrB regulation. It was found that the transcriptional factor DegU also could play an important role in gene regulations during plant colonization. A significant stress caused by the root exudates on in vitro cultivated B. atrophaeus UCMB-5137 was noticed and discussed. Multiple cases of conflicted gene regulations showed scantiness of our knowledge on the regulatory network in Bacillus. Some of these conflicted regulations could be explained by interference of non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Search through differential expressed intergenic regions revealed 49 putative loci of ncRNA regulated by the root exudate stimuli. Possible target mRNA were predicted and a general regulatory network of B. atrophaeus UCMB-5137 genome was designed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus atrophaeus 3acorn 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahypersensitivity 3ain vitro culture 3aintergenic DNA 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aroot exudates 3asequence analysis 3atranscription factors 0aGABA 0amRNA 0ancRNA 0aPGPR 0a(p)ppGpp 0arRNA 0aPlant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria 0aTranscriptomics 0aRNA sequencing 0aTranscriptional regulatory network 0aNon-coding RNA1 aChan, Wai Yin1 aPretorius, Theresa1 aLyantagaye, Sylvester L.1 aLapa, Svitlana V.1 aAvdeeva, Lilia V.1 aReva, Oleg N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5459-27720 tGene.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 590, no. 1 p.18-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.05.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245012600153300002000279520091800299592002801217650001601245650002801261650001301289650001001302650001601312650002601328650001001354650001001364650001901374650001801393650003001411650001001441650001501451650000901466650001801475650002401493650002801517700001901545700001401564700001601578700001201594700001701606700001701623700001501640700001601655700001601671700001501687700001401702700002001716700001801736700001801754700001801772773012501790856007401915852000901989655001201998IND60617174620221116190858.0181024e20180906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061717462DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra06058d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Juan10aLipid- and gut microbiota-modulating effects of graphene oxide nanoparticles in high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemic mice  ap. 31366-31371.  aGraphene oxide (GO) suspensions can act as a good dispersant and drug delivery system for effective dispersion and drug sustained release. In this study, we investigated the impact of GO on blood/liver lipids and gut microbiota structure in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hyperlipidemic mice. Oral administration of GO for 28 days remarkably decreased the lipid levels in blood and liver. GO did not decrease the total number of gut bacteria but increased the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria such as Clostridium clusters IV and Allobaculum spp. GO also enhanced the copying of bacterial butyryl coenzyme A transferase (BcoA), a key butyrate-producing gene. Although further pharmacological studies are still needed, these results provided an interesting hint that GO may exert beneficial effects on the host's metabolism via selective modulation of SCFA-producing gut microbes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aacetate CoA-transferase 3abacteria 3ablood 3adispersants 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3agenes 3agraphene oxide 3ahigh fat diet 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aliver 3ametabolism 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aoral administration 3ashort chain fatty acids1 aYang, Shengmei1 aYu, Jiaqi1 aCui, Rongli1 aLiu, Ru1 aLei, Runhong1 aChang, Yanan1 aGeng, Huan1 aQin, Yanxia1 aGu, Weihong1 aXia, Shibo1 aChen, Kui1 aKong, Jianglong1 aChen, Guogang1 aWu, Chongming1 aXing, Gengmei0 tRSC advances.g2018 Sept. 06, v. 8, no. 55 p.31366-31371dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra06058d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012700168300001500295520223500310592002802545650001902573650002002592650001202612650001202624650003102636650000902667650002302676653001302699653000802712653001702720653002302737700001502760700002002775700002102795700001502816700001202831773011502843856008702958852000903045655001203054IND60532455220221119223606.0190318e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053245522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2014.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsher, G.W.14aThe use of GPS data to identify calving behaviour of farmed red deer hinds: Proof of concept for intensively managed hinds  ap. 93-103.  aThis study investigated the utility of GPS data for assigning individual calving dates and times for red deer hinds based on already known generalised movement patterns around parturition. Nineteen hinds expected to calve in early November were fitted with GPS neck collars two weeks before expected calving. Collars were programmed to log positional data at 5-min intervals over the calving period, with data retrieved at collar removal two weeks after completion of calving. Daily visual observations were conducted to record parturient activity, enabling correlation of actual calving times with GPS-based inferred calving times. Positional data were analysed by a variety of methods to independently assign an inferred calving time, including subjective visual assessment of daily tracking plots, daily core occupational areas (COAs) and ‘distance travelled’ graphics, and an objective assessment based on ‘distance travelled’ graphs using a Hidden Markov statistical model (HMM). All assignments were based on an a priori assumption of four movement states around parturition, with particular emphasis on increased ambulatory behaviour immediately prior to calving followed by a marked reduction in movement at and around the time of birthing. Actual calving time was visually observed to within an hour for 10 hinds, within a day for a further eight hinds, and within a 4-day period for one hind. The subjective graphical measures accurately assigned calving date for the 18 hinds in which actual calving date was known, and assigned a similar date for the remaining hind. The visual assessment of ‘distance travelled’ graphics improved the inference of birth timing to within 7h of actual birthing for the 10 hinds that were actually observed giving birth. The objective assessment of birth timing using the HMM also accurately assigned birth date and constrained the inferred timing to within 9h of actually observed births. Extending the interval between GPS positional recordings increases the length of time that GPS units can function and an analysis of frequency of positional recording indicated that half-hourly observations were still able to allow accurate inference of calving using the HMM approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus elaphus 3aanimal behavior 3acalving 3acollars 3aglobal positioning systems 3aneck 3astatistical models 0aRed deer 0aGPS 0aReproduction 0aCalving, Behaviour1 aWall, A.J.1 aO’Neill, K.T.1 aLittlejohn, R.P.1 aBryant, A.1 aCox, N.0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2014 May, v. 154 p.93-103dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2014.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009100164300001600255520130800271592002801579650001501607650001701622650002201639650001501661650001601676650002001692653002701712653002301739653003301762653002201795700002001817700001701837700001501854700001801869700001401887773010801901856008602009852000902095655001202104IND60539683520221120112820.0190318e20140416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053968352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.01.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jun10aMulti-objective optimization of empirical hydrological model for streamflow prediction  ap. 242-253.  aTraditional calibration of hydrological models is performed with a single objective function. Practical experience with the calibration of hydrologic models reveals that single objective functions are often inadequate to properly measure all of the characteristics of the hydrologic system. To circumvent this problem, in recent years, a lot of studies have looked into the automatic calibration of hydrological models with multi-objective functions. In this paper, the multi-objective evolution algorithm MODE-ACM is introduced to solve the multi-objective optimization of hydrologic models. Moreover, to improve the performance of the MODE-ACM, an Enhanced Pareto Multi-Objective Differential Evolution algorithm named EPMODE is proposed in this research. The efficacy of the MODE-ACM and EPMODE are compared with two state-of-the-art algorithms NSGA-II and SPEA2 on two case studies. Five test problems are used as the first case study to generate the true Pareto front. Then this approach is tested on a typical empirical hydrological model for monthly streamflow forecasting. The results of these case studies show that the EPMODE, as well as MODE-ACM, is effective in solving multi-objective problems and has great potential as an efficient and reliable algorithm for water resources applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3ahydrologic models 3aprediction 3astream flow 3awater resources 0aStreamflow forecasting 0aHydrological model 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aModel calibration1 aZhou, Jianzhong1 aLu, Jiazheng1 aZou, Qiang1 aZhang, Huajie1 aBi, Sheng0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Apr. 16, v. 511 p.242-253dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.01.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245010100211506011700312506007600429520159100505592002802096506003702124650001602161650002002177650001102197650002402208650001002232650001102242650001702253650002602270650001702296650001102313650000902324650002102333650001502354653002402369653002502393653003502418653002902453653003402482700002402516700007102540773009302611856008602704852000902790655001202799IND60779941620221215143606.0220906e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077994162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e096932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChavan, Sangeeta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2330-827310aNanopore-based metagenomic analysis of the impact of nanoparticles on soil microbial communities  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe current trend of using nanotechnology products in all spheres of human life, including for crop improvement may have a possible impact on soil microorganisms which influence soil and plant health. Nanopore-based metagenomic study reported here used full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences to assess shifts in community composition of soil microorganisms when treated with silver, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles (S-NP, T-NP, Z-NP, respectively). Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the two dominant phyla in this soil, and there were no significant differences (p < 0.05) observed in these phyla across treatments. However, in the phylum Firmicutes, the abundance of the order Clostridiales showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the presence of S-NP. Similarly, in the phylum Proteobacteria, a significant decrease in the presence of S-NP was seen for two orders, Vibrionales (p < 0.05) and Rhodobacterales (p < 0.01). Analysis at a further depth revealed that abundance of the genus Clostridium (order Clostridiales) decreased in the presence of both S-NP (p < 0.01) and T-NP (p < 0.05). The abundance of the genus Vibrio (order Vibrionales) was likewise impacted in the presence of all the three NPs — S-NP (p < 0.01), T-NP (p < 0.05) and Z-NP (p < 0.05). Analyses at high taxon ranks such as phyla may not give a good representation of the nature of microbial community shifts, and at times may paint an erroneous picture. The use of full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences here yielded a greater taxonomic depth, and some shifts at the lower ranks were discernible.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium 3aRhodobacterales 3aVibrio 3acommunity structure 3agenes 3ahumans 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3aplant health 3asilver 3asoil 3atitanium dioxide 3azinc oxide 0aNanopore sequencing 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aTitanium dioxide nanoparticles 0aZinc oxide nanoparticles 0aMicrobial community diversity1 aSarangdhar, Vishwas1 aVigneshwaran, Nadanathangam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2330-82730 tHeliyon.g2022 June, v. 8, no. 6 p.e09693-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e096933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013300170300001600303520186400319592002802183650001102211650002402222650001202246650002202258650001602280650001602296650001302312650001302325650001102338650001602349650001102365650001702376650001402393650003002407650001702437650001002454651001002464653003602474653003602510653002002546653002002566653002102586700002402607700001702631700002002648700002602668700002402694700002102718773010802739856008602847852000902933655001202942IND60539683620221120092349.0190318e20140416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053968362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.01.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKusano, Yukiko10aOccurrence of old groundwater in a volcanic island on a continental shelf; an example from Nakano-shima Island, Oki-Dozen, Japan  ap. 295-309.  aGroundwater residence times in Nakano-shima Island, Oki-Dozen, Japan, which is situated on the continental shelf, are discussed based on groundwater-age indices (CFCs, 3H, and 14C), stable isotopic ratios of hydrogen (δD), oxygen (δ18O), carbon (δ13C), and noble gases (3He/4He and 4He/20Ne). Samples were taken from springs, shallow wells (up to 5m deep), water-supply wells (about 10–100m deep), and the hot spring well (866m deep). δD and δ18O of all the samples plot along meteoric water lines, indicating a meteoric water-origin. Isotope values of the hot spring water were slightly lower than other samples. Most samples from springs, shallow wells, and the water-supply wells contained higher CFCs and 3H while samples from two water-supply wells (W4 and W7) and the hot spring well showed much lower CFCs concentrations. This result indicates that mixing ratios of old groundwater that is free of CFCs and 3H were higher for these samples. 14C concentrations of samples with lower CFCs were measured, and corrected for addition of 14C-free dissolved inorganic carbon. The corrected 14C concentration of the hot spring water was lower than that of the water-supply well, indicating mixing of much older groundwater in the hot spring water. Because of lower corrected 14C concentration and lower δD and δ18O values, groundwater from the hot spring well is considered to be recharged in a colder climate than present day. Because the island is situated on the continental shelf, the seafloor around the island was most likely widely exposed during the last glacial period. One possible explanation for the existence of groundwater showing lower δD, δ18O, and 14C concentrations, such as the hot spring water, is that fresh groundwater, recharged when sea level was lower, still remains after transgression without being replaced by salt water.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achlorofluorocarbons 3aclimate 3acontinental shelf 3agroundwater 3ahot springs 3ahydrogen 3aisotopes 3amixing 3anoble gases 3aoxygen 3asaline water 3asea level 3atransgressive segregation 3awater supply 3awells 3aJapan 0aGroundwater system in an island 0aIsland on the continental shelf 0aGroundwater age 0aCoastal aquifer 0aSea-level change1 aTokunaga, Tomochika1 aAsai, Kazumi1 aAsai, Kazuyoshi1 aTakahashi, Hiroshi A.1 aMorikawa, Noritoshi1 aYasuhara, Masaya0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Apr. 16, v. 511 p.295-309dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.01.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245016000162300002000322520089600342592002801238650001601266650002201282650001401304650001201318650001301330650001101343650002301354650001301377650001201390650001301402650002401415700002101439700002001460700002001480700002001500700002201520700002001542773013501562856007801697852000901775655001201784IND60580492620221119024031.0170921e20170920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058049262DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b074872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurai, Masahito10aStructural Characterization and Unique Catalytic Performance of Silyl-Group-Substituted Geminal Dichromiomethane Complexes Stabilized with a Diamine Ligand  ap. 13184-13192.  aStabilization by a silyl group on the methylene carbon and a diamine ligand led to the isolation of gem-dichromiomethane species. X-ray crystallography confirmed the identity of the structure of this rare example of reactive gem-dimetalloalkane species. The isolated gem-dichromiomethane complex acted as a storable silylmethylidene carbene equivalent, with reactivity that could be changed dramatically upon addition of a Lewis acid (ZnCl₂) and a base (TMEDA) to promote both silylalkylidenation of polar aldehydes and silylcyclopropanation of nonpolar alkenes. Identification of a key reactive species also identified the catalytic version of these transformations and provided insights into the reaction mechanism. In contrast to Simmons–Smith cyclopropanation, the real reactive species for the current cyclopropanation was a chromiocarbene species, not a chromium carbenoid species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaldehydes 3aalkenes 3acarbenes 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3achromium 3aligands 3amoieties 3areaction mechanisms1 aTaniguchi, Ryuji1 aHosokawa, Naoki1 aNishida, Yusuke1 aMimachi, Hiroko1 aOshiki, Toshiyuki1 aTakai, Kazuhiko0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 139, no. 37 p.13184-13192dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b074873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011100174300001400285520180300299592002802102650002102130650002102151650001002172650001202182650001002194650001102204653001202215653001302227653001402240653002002254653001602274700002102290700002402311700002202335700002302357700002102380700002302401700002402424773008902448856008502537852000902622655001202631IND60551304320221119151030.0161018e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055130432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuckner, Samuel L.10aDo rhythms exist in elbow flexor torque, oral temperature and muscle thickness during normal waking hours?  ap. 12-17.  aThe purpose of the current study was to examine the influence of “time” on isometric elbow flexion torque, body temperature and muscle size without interrupting the sleep wake cycle in college aged males. Two hours following the participants normal wake time, oral temperature was measured, followed by muscle thickness of the upper and lower body using ultrasound, as well as elbow flexor torque via a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Measurements were repeated every 2h for 12h (Time points 1–7). To examine the repeatability of the rhythm, participants returned and completed the same procedures as before within 14days of their first circadian visit (Circadian visit 2). There was no time×day interaction for body temperature (p=0.29), nor were there main effects for time (p=0.15) or day (p=0.74). For MVC, there was no time×day interaction (p=0.93) or main effect for day (p=0.50), however, there was a main effect for time (p=0.01). MVC at time points 1 (86.4±6.4Nm) and 2 (87.1±6.2Nm) was greater than time points 4 (84.2±6.6Nm) and 6 (83.4±6.8Nm, p<0.05). Additionally, time point 5 MVC was greater than time point 4. For upper body muscle thickness, there was no time×day interaction (p=0.34), nor was there a main effect for day (p=0.38), or time (p=0.06). For lower body muscle thickness, there was no time×day interaction (p=0.57), nor was there a main effect for day (p=0.75), or time (p=0.13). Cosinor analyses revealed no group level rhythms for oral temperature, muscle thickness or strength (p>0.05), however, there were some individual rhythms noted for muscle thickness and strength. Results suggest that, when accounting for an individuals normal wake time, circadian rhythms of strength, temperature and muscle thickness are not apparent in most individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody temperature 3acircadian rhythm 3amales 3amuscles 3asleep 3atorque 0aDiurnal 0aStrength 0aCircadian 0aMuscle Function 0aMuscle Size1 aDankel, Scott J.1 aCounts, Brittany R.1 aBarnett, Brian E.1 aJessee, Matthew B.1 aMouser, J.

Various strategies are applied to enrich viral sequences, but there is often a lack of knowledge about their effective influence on the viral discovery sensitivity. We evaluate some convenient and widely used approaches for RNA virus discovery in clinical samples in order to reveal their sensitivity and potential bias introduced by the enrichment or amplifications steps. An RNA virus was artificially spiked at a fixed titer in serum and lung tissue, respectively, low and high nucleic acid content matrices. For serum, a simple DNase treatment on the RNA extract gave the maximum gain in proportion of viral sequences (83×), and a subsequent ribosomal RNA removal nearly doubled once more the proportion of viral sequences. For lung tissue, a ribosomal RNA depletion step on the RNA extract had the biggest gain in proportion of viral sequences (32×). We show also that direct sequencing of cDNA is recommended above an extra random PCR amplification step, and a that the virion enrichment strategy (filtration and nuclease treatment) has a beneficial effect for sequencing-based virus discovery. Our findings provide sample-dependent guidelines for targeted virus discovery strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA viruses 3ablood serum 3acomplementary DNA 3adeoxyribonucleases 3afiltration 3alungs 3ametagenomics 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotocols 3aribosomal RNA 3avirion 3aviruses 0aRNA virus discovery 0aClinical samples 0aViral metagenomics 0aPretreatment 0aNext generation sequencing 0arRNA depletion1 aOzhelvaci, Orkun1 aFreimanis, Graham1 aVan Borm, Steven0 tJournal of virological methods.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 222 p.72-80dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010800167300001600275520087200291592002801163650002101191650001801212650002501230650002101255650002201276650001801298650001301316650002401329650002001353650002101373650004301394650001401437653000801451653001001459653001401469653001601483653000801499653001101507653000901518653000801527653000901535653000901544653000701553653002701560653002801587653001601615653001501631700001701646700001801663700005801681700001701739773009501756856008301851852000901934655001201943IND60530172520221121004010.0180830e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053017252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2016.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Congfen10aNucleopolyhedroviruses (NPV) induce the expression of small heat shock protein 25.4 in Antheraea pernyi  ap. 327-332.  aNucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs) is one group of Baculoviruses. The infection of NPV in silkworm is often lethal. To investigate the effective measures to stop the infection of NPV, we cloned cDNA encoding small heat shock protein 25.4 in Antheraea pernyi (Ap-HSP25.4). The translated amino acid sequence consisted of 223 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 25.4kDa and an isoelectronic point (pI) of 4.93. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to investigate the expression patterns and distribution profiles of Ap-sHSP25.4 before and after challenged with NPV. We found that the inhibitors of eicosanoid synthesis could suppress the transcription of Ap-sHSP25.4 in the fat body in a dose dependent manner. And arachidonic acid induced the expression of Ap-sHSP25.4. Thus, we concluded that sHSPs may be promising candidates to boost insect immunity in practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAntheraea pernyi 3aBaculoviridae 3aamino acid sequences 3aarachidonic acid 3acomplementary DNA 3adose response 3afat body 3aheat shock proteins 3ainsect immunity 3amolecular weight 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asilkworms 0aHSP 0asHSPs 0aA. pernyi 0aAP-sHSP25.4 0aPCR 0aRT-PCR 0aPVDF 0aDEX 0aNDGA 0aIndo 0aAA 0aNucleopolyhedroviruses 0aHeat shock protein 25.4 0aEicosanoids 0aTranscript1 aZhu, Baojian1 aDai, Li shang1 aLiu, Chaoliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7917-17121 aLuo, Xuegang0 tGene.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 591, no. 2 p.327-332dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245012300175300001600298520179100314592002802105650001702133650001202150650001902162650002002181650002502201650001402226650001202240650002002252650002402272650001102296650002202307650001502329650001502344650002602359650002202385650001202407650002402419650000902443651001402452653001002466653001202476653001202488653003202500700002202532773010202554856008702656852000902743655001202752IND60603738220221122020448.0190620e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060373822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Silva, M.M.G.T.10aSocioeconomic Vulnerability to Disaster Risk: A Case Study of Flood and Drought Impact in a Rural Sri Lankan Community  ap. 131-140.  aWhile climate change is a global phenomenon, its negative impacts are more severely felt in poor countries because of their high dependence on natural resources and limited coping capacity to climate variability and extremes. However, investigation of the relationship between poverty, climate variability and water-related disasters is complex. This article investigates the relationship between disaster risk, poverty, and the associated vulnerability of households and communities. The case study on which the article is based was carried out in Sri Lanka, a developing country prone to disasters. Data collected from household surveys conducted in North Central province, Sri Lanka, was examined with the use of cross tabulation and regression analysis techniques. Our study is novel because it considers floods and droughts together and compares their economic impact on socioeconomic groups at a local level.Our findings show that households depend heavily on natural resources for their livelihood, and that those with low income suffer greater losses from floods and droughts than households with high income. On the other hand flood impact is higher on households depend heavily on natural resources for their livelihood, and having lower income. The study uses survey data to examine the relationship between disaster frequency and localized poverty, an issue rarely considered in past literature. We show that low income households that depend fully on natural resources for their livelihood are exposed to more frequent disasters and most vulnerable to financial losses incurred through floods and droughts. To combat the effects of disasters, the Sri Lankan government might encourage members of poor households to seek at least some income from non-agricultural endeavors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adeveloping countries 3adisasters 3adrought 3aeconomic impact 3afinancial economics 3afloods 3ahousehold surveys 3ahouseholds 3alivelihood 3alow income households 3anatural resources 3apoverty 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aSri Lanka 0aFlood 0aDrought 0aPoverty 0aSocioeconomic Vulnerability1 aKawasaki, Akiyuki0 tEcological economics.g2018 Oct., v. 152 p.131-140dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002600136245007700162300001300239500001500252520182400267592002802091650001702119650002402136650002802160650001802188650001402206650002102220650002002241651001202261651002602273653002502299653001302324653002502337653002202362653001702384653003302401653004202434653002602476653002502502700002202527700002002549700002002569700001902589700001902608773010702627856007402734852000902808655001202817IND4436459920221122044109.0151127e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443645992DNAL7 a10.2193/2008-3302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKendall, Katherine C.10aDemography and Genetic Structure of a Recovering Grizzly Bear Population  ap. 3-17.  a2019-12-06  aGrizzly bears (brown bears; Ursus arctos) are imperiled in the southern extent of their range worldwide. The threatened population in northwestern Montana, USA, has been managed for recovery since 1975; yet, no rigorous data were available to monitor program success. We used data from a large noninvasive genetic sampling effort conducted in 2004 and 33 years of physical captures to assess abundance, distribution, and genetic health of this population. We combined data from our 3 sampling methods (hair trap, bear rub, and physical capture) to construct individual bear encounter histories for use in Huggins––Pledger closed mark––recapture models. Our population estimate, N̂ == 765 (95%% CI == 715––831) was more than double the existing estimate derived from sightings of females with young. Based on our results, the estimated known, human-caused mortality rate in 2004 was 4.6%% (95%% CI == 4.2––4.9%%), slightly above the 4%% considered sustainable; however, the high proportion of female mortalities raises concern. We used location data from telemetry, confirmed sightings, and genetic sampling to estimate occupied habitat. We found that grizzly bears occupied 33,480 km² in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE) during 1994––2007, including 10,340 km² beyond the Recovery Zone. We used factorial correspondence analysis to identify potential barriers to gene flow within this population. Our results suggested that genetic interchange recently increased in areas with low gene flow in the past; however, we also detected evidence of incipient fragmentation across the major transportation corridor in this ecosystem. Our results suggest that the NCDE population is faring better than previously thought, and they highlight the need for a more rigorous monitoring program.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrsus arctos 3awildlife management 3apopulation distribution 3aanimal health 3agene flow 3anational forests 3apopulation size 3aMontana 3aRocky Mountain region 0anorthwestern Montana 0agenetics 0aabundance estimation 0agenetic structure 0agrizzly bear 0amark––recapture modeling 0aNorthern Continental Divide Ecosystem 0apopulation monitoring 0anoninvasive sampling1 aStetz, Jeffrey B.1 aBoulanger, John1 aMacleod, Amy C.1 aPaetkau, David1 aWhite, Gary C.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2009 Jan., v. 73, no. 1 p.3-17dThe Wildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193%2F2008-3303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04086naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245015200208506011700360506007600477520219400553592002802747506003702775650001702812650001902829650002002848650001202868650001702880650002002897650001102917650002202928650001102950650001502961650001902976650001602995650001003011651001003021653001103031653002103042653002503063653002203088653001403110653001103124700002403135700001503159700006703174700002103241700002303262700005903285773009303344856008603437852000903523655001203532IND60779941820221207103104.0220906e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077994182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e096952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaudel, Deepa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6447-102610aWhat affects farmers in choosing better agroforestry practice as a strategy of climate change adaptation?

This paper discusses; local understanding of climate change, climatic impacts, and factors that affect farmers’ choices of adaptation strategies, and agroforestry practices. We focused on three districts located in the mid-hills of Nepal, where farmers were adopting agroforestry practices in two forms; traditional and improved practices. We followed three techniques of social survey; household survey (n = 420), focus group discussions (n = 6), and key informant interviews (n = 24). Almost all farmers of the study areas were experiencing climatic challenges, but only 59.29% of them accepted that the challenges are induced by climate change and, likewise, 55.24% have adopted climate change adaptation measures. Diversifying crop production, shifting farming practices, changing occupation, and emigration were local adaptation strategies. Livelihood improvement, income generation, and food production were the primary motives for adopting agroforestry practices in the study area. Agroforestry as an adaptation measure to climate change was considered secondary by most farmers. Statistical analysis using a logit model revealed that age, education, and habit of growing commercial species significantly influenced farmers adopting climate change adaptation strategies. Likewise, age, education, gender, habit of growing commercial species, and income from tree products significantly influenced the choice of improved agroforestry practices as a better option. Though agroforestry was widely considered a strategy to combat climate change, only some farmers accepted it due to their awareness level. Therefore, education programs such as training, farmer field schools, door-to-door visits, etc., should be intensified to sensitize farmers about climate change and encourage them to adopt improved agroforestry practices. The findings of the study could reinforce local, national, and international allied agencies to design operative actions in the days to come.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagroforestry 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3afarmers 3afocus groups 3afood production 3agender 3ahousehold surveys 3aincome 3alivelihood 3alogit analysis 3aoccupations 3atrees 3aNepal 0aIncome 0aClimatic effects 0aTraditional practice 0aImproved practice 0aEducation 0aCombat1 aTiwari, Krishna Raj1 aRaut, Nani1 aBajracharya, Roshan M.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2946-10301 aBhattarai, Suman1 aSitaula, Bishal K.1 aThapa, Shivaraj1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8547-30120 tHeliyon.g2022 June, v. 8, no. 6 p.e09695-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e096953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245009900161300002000260520102200280592002801302650002301330650003401353650001401387650002301401650001101424650001401435650002101449650002201470650001501492650001501507650002201522650001801544700002001562700002401582700001601606700002401622700001601646700002301662700002101685773013501706856007801841852000901919655001201928IND60580492820221119024330.0170921e20170920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058049282DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b076062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaadi, Fadl H.10aOperando Spectroscopic Analysis of CoP Films Electrocatalyzing the Hydrogen-Evolution Reaction  ap. 12927-12930.  aTransition metal phosphides exhibit high catalytic activity toward the electrochemical hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) and resist chemical corrosion in acidic solutions. For example, an electrodeposited CoP catalyst exhibited an overpotential, η, of −η < 100 mV at a current density of −10 mA cm–² in 0.500 M H₂SO₄(aq). To obtain a chemical description of the material as-prepared and also while effecting the HER in acidic media, such electrocatalyst films were investigated using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy both ex situ as well as under in situ and operando conditions in 0.500 M H₂SO₄(aq). Ex situ analysis using the tandem spectroscopies indicated the presence of multiple ordered and disordered phases that contained both near-zerovalent and oxidized Co species, in addition to reduced and oxygenated P species. Operando analysis indicated that the active electrocatalyst was primarily amorphous and predominantly consisted of near-zerovalent Co as well as reduced P.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3afilms (materials) 3aphosphides 3aphosphorus 3aspectral analysis 3asulfuric acid1 aCarim, Azhar I.1 aDrisdell, Walter S.1 aGul, Sheraz1 aBaricuatro, Jack H.1 aYano, Junko1 aSoriaga, Manuel P.1 aLewis, Nathan S.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 139, no. 37 p.12927-12930dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b076063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011600166300001800282500001900300520156500319592002801884650004401912650001201956650001501968650003601983650001202019650000702031650001302038650003702051700001802088700001902106700001502125700001802140700001902158700002202177700006102199700005902260773012402319856008202443852000902525655001202534IND60720407420210419000000.0201214e20200928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072040742DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.0c006292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEymsh, Bisher10aToxic Metamorphosis—How Changes from Lysosomal to Cytosolic pH Modify the Alpha-Synuclein Aggregation Pattern  ap. 4673-4684.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a cytosolic, aggregation-prone protein that is associated with neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Interestingly, the protein can appear in different conformations, including monomeric and oligomeric forms as well as amyloid fibrils. Its individual structural constituents seem to be dependent on various factors and the composition of the respective cellular surroundings. Although under physiological conditions, most aSyn is found in the cytosol and synapses of neurons, aSyn can also be found in lysosomal compartments, where it gets degraded. We here compare the assembly speed, morphology, folding state, and spreading of aSyn at cytosolic pH (pH 7.4) and lysosomal pH (pH 5) using Thioflavin T, transmission electron microscopy, circular dichroism, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Interestingly, we found substantial differences between aSyn aggregation under neutral and acidic pH conditions, like those present in cytosolic and lysosomal cellular compartments. Also, lysosomal aSyn enriched from an aSyn-overexpressing cell line was able to seed aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, we observed that aSyn aggregates formed under in vitro lysosomal pH (pH 5) conditions were not stable at neutral pH and collapsed into partly soluble aggregates with changed structural characteristics. Our findings have meaningful implications in intracellular toxicity events as well as in lysis procedures for molecular and structural characterization of intracellular aSyn conformers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aamyloid 3acell lines 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acytosol 3apH 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aDrobny, Alice1 aHeyn, Timon R.1 aXiang, Wei1 aLucius, Ralph1 aSchwarz, Karin1 aKeppler, Julia K.1 aZunke, Friederike1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0408-63881 aArnold, Philipp1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3273-98650 tBiomacromolecules.g2020 Sept. 28, v. 21, no. 12 p.4673-4684dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c006293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04316naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001600192245016900208300001600377506007600393520241900469592002802888506003702916650001302953650002002966650000902986650002202995650002303017650001703040650001603057650001603073650001103089650001003100650001503110650001203125650002303137650001903160650000903179650001203188650001703200650001603217650001503233650001603248653002503264653002203289653001403311653001403325653001703339653002203356700001403378700001503392700001803407700001503425700005303440773009103493856008503584852000903669655001203678IND60551304520221207104453.0161018e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055130452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.03.0282doi7 aPMC48991132pmcid7 a270392812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarnell, S.10aLunch-time food choices in preschoolers: Relationships between absolute and relative intakes of different food categories, and appetitive characteristics and weight  ap. 151-160.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChildren's appetitive characteristics measured by parent-report questionnaires are reliably associated with body weight, as well as behavioral tests of appetite, but relatively little is known about relationships with food choice. As part of a larger preloading study, we served 4–5year olds from primary school classes five school lunches at which they were presented with the same standardized multi-item meal. Parents completed Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ) sub-scales assessing satiety responsiveness (CEBQ-SR), food responsiveness (CEBQ-FR) and enjoyment of food (CEBQ-EF), and children were weighed and measured. Despite differing preload conditions, children showed remarkable consistency of intake patterns across all five meals with day-to-day intra-class correlations in absolute and percentage intake of each food category ranging from 0.78 to 0.91. Higher CEBQ-SR was associated with lower mean intake of all food categories across all five meals, with the weakest association apparent for snack foods. Higher CEBQ-FR was associated with higher intake of white bread and fruits and vegetables, and higher CEBQ-EF was associated with greater intake of all categories, with the strongest association apparent for white bread. Analyses of intake of each food group as a percentage of total intake, treated here as an index of the child's choice to consume relatively more or relatively less of each different food category when composing their total lunch-time meal, further suggested that children who were higher in CEBQ-SR ate relatively more snack foods and relatively less fruits and vegetables, while children with higher CEBQ-EF ate relatively less snack foods and relatively more white bread. Higher absolute intakes of white bread and snack foods were associated with higher BMI z score. CEBQ sub-scale associations with food intake variables were largely unchanged by controlling for daily metabolic needs. However, descriptive comparisons of lunch intakes with expected amounts based on metabolic needs suggested that overweight/obese boys were at particularly high risk of overeating. Parents' reports of children's appetitive characteristics on the CEBQ are associated with differential patterns of food choice as indexed by absolute and relative intake of various food categories assessed on multiple occasions in a naturalistic, school-based setting, without parents present.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aappetite 3abody mass index 3aboys 3achildhood obesity 3aelementary schools 3afood choices 3afood groups 3afood intake 3afruits 3alunch 3aovereating 3aparents 3apreschool children 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3asatiety 3aschool lunch 3asnack foods 3avegetables 3awhite bread 0aMacronutrient intake 0aAd libitum intake 0aTest meal 0aMeal-time 0aSchool meals 0aAppetitive traits1 aPryor, K.1 aMais, L.A.1 aWarkentin, S.1 aBenson, L.1 aCheng, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6526-72140 tPhysiology & behavior.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 162 p.151-160dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.03.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245017100167300001400338520114600352592002801498506003701526650002001563650001701583650001601600650001201616651001001628651001401638700001701652700001901669700002901688700001801717700002601735700002601761773012401787856008101911852000901992655001202001IND60774721720221207122713.0220422e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077472172DNAL7 a10.1177/02611929209231052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Vijay Pal14aThe Quality of Reporting Raises Questions on the Experimental Validity of Animal Studies Conducted in India and Sri Lanka: Preliminary Analysis of a Systematic Survey  ap. 85-91.  aThe quality of animal experiments in terms of appropriate reporting is a concern, particularly with regard to their validity and the recording of the measures taken to reduce various types of bias. A systematic survey of 1371 and 236 publications from India and Sri Lanka, respectively, which were published between 1905 and 2017 and indexed in NCBI-PubMed, Cinhal, MEDLINE and Scopus, was carried out. The level of detail in the descriptions of animals used and the measures taken to reduce bias were analysed in each article. Selected parameters from the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines, such as age, weight, sex, sample size calculation, blinding and randomisation were considered. The findings revealed poor reporting standards in animal experiments carried out in India and Sri Lanka, confirming the limited impact of the ARRIVE guidelines. These findings emphasise the urgent need for improvements in the peer review process, both prior to a study being set up and in the post-study reporting phase, and for more stringent adherence to the ARRIVE guidelines in the reporting of animal experiments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal research 3alaboratories 3asample size 3asurveys 3aIndia 3aSri Lanka1 aJain, Ayushi1 aGupta, Shubhra1 aVijayakumar, Manudharshy1 aPratap, Kunal1 aMaheshwari, Deepanshu1 aThoradeniya, Tharanga0 tATLA.

Nine dietary groups containing different dosages (g kg⁻¹ diet) of TUR (TUR 2.5, TUR 5 and TUR 10), CUR (CUR 0.075, CUR 0.150 and CUR 0.300) and NMC (NMC 0.075, 0.150 and 0.300) along with the control group made the ten treatments. After nine weeks of feeding, CUR additives decreased the haemolymph triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose and cortisol in shrimps under normal and stress conditions compared with the control group; the lowest and highest values were observed in NMC 0.150 and control group respectively (p < 0.05). Adding TUR, CUR and NMC supplements to the diet increased total protein, total haemocytes count and differential haemocytes count in stressed and non‐stressed shrimps; the highest was observed in NMC 0.150. The lowest and highest activities of antioxidant enzymes including CAT, SOD and GSH‐Px before and after the salinity stress were detected in control group and NMC 0.150 respectively (p < 0.05). After the salinity stress, the experimental treatments increased the survival rate, where NMC 0.150 caused the highest survival (p < 0.05). In conclusion, different forms of dietary CUR improved antioxidant capacity and resistance of P. vannamei to acute salinity stress. Nanomicellar carriers in shrimp nutrition can promote immunity and antioxidant responses under stressful conditions through more efficient delivery of dietary immunostimulants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aantioxidant activity 3aaquaculture 3acholesterol 3acortisol 3acurcumin 3adiet 3aglucose 3ahemocytes 3ahepatopancreas 3aimmunity 3aimmunostimulants 3ananocapsules 3aprotein content 3aresearch 3asalt stress 3ashrimp 3asurvival rate 3aturmeric1 aSourinejad, Iman1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0697-30411 aJohari, Seyed Ali0 tAquaculture research.g2022 June, v. 53, no. 8 p.3127-3139dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.158253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245008800176300001600264520139800280592002801678650001701706650002001723650001501743650001301758650001601771650002401787650002401811650001101835650002101846650001801867650002201885650001201907650001301919653001501932653001901947653001401966653001801980653001901998653002602017700002002043700002502063700001902088700001902107700001802126700001702144700001702161773011602178856008602294852000902380655001202389IND60602676020221120170802.0180711e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060267602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYlihärsilä, Minna10aArray-in-well serodiagnostic assay utilizing upconverting phosphor label technology  ap. 224-230.  aIn this study, a multiplex serological array-in-well assay was constructed for simultaneous detection of serum IgG antibodies against parvovirus B19 and human adenovirus. The array was prepared in streptavidin-coated 96-well microtiter plates by spotting biotinylated parvovirus B19 virus-like-particles, adenovirus type 2 and 5 hexon antigens, negative control of human serum albumin and positive controls of human IgG and anti-human IgG antibodies on the bottom of each well in an array format with a printable area of 2mm×2mm. The array-in-well assay was evaluated with serum samples (n=89) of different antibody status as determined by commercial enzyme immunoassay for parvovirus IgG, and by in-house enzyme immunoassay for adenovirus IgG. The bound serum anti-parvovirus IgG, anti-adenovirus IgG, and total IgG antibodies were detected with anti-human IgG antibody coated photon upconverting nanoparticles and the assay was measured with an anti-Stokes photoluminescence imager. Detection of specific antibodies by the multiplex array-in-well assay was in good agreement (100% for parvovirus B19 and 96% for adenovirus) with the reference results. In conclusion, the array-in-well with upconverting phosphor reporter technology was able to detect antiviral antibodies in human sera, and represents an efficient serodiagnostic concept that is a promising new tool for multiplex serology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aProtoparvovirus 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3aenzyme immunoassays 3ahuman serum albumin 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ananoparticles 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotons 3aserology 0aAdenovirus 0aParvovirus B19 0aMultiplex 0aArray-in-well 0aSerodiagnostic 0aUpconverting phosphor1 aAlaranta, Siina1 aLahdenperä, Susanne1 aLahtinen, Satu1 aArku, Benedict1 aHedman, Klaus1 aSoukka, Tero1 aWaris, Matti0 tJournal of virological methods.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 222 p.224-230dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245013500161300001800296500001900314520141300333592002801746650001601774650001301790650000901803650002101812650001401833650001801847650001801865650001401883650002501897700001501922700001701937700001101954700001601965700005501981773012302036856008202159852000902241655001202250IND60720407620221122101831.0201214e20201019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072040762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.0c008222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Hui10aFabrication of Double-Network Hydrogels with Universal Adhesion and Superior Extensibility and Cytocompatibility by One-Pot Method  ap. 4699-4708.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHydrogels, which demand simultaneously tailorable mechanical properties and excellent biocompatibility, act as a promoting material for biomedical applications, e.g., tissue engineering scaffolds, wound dressing materials, and cartilage substitutes. Double-network hydrogels (DN hydrogels) have attracted widespread concerns due to their extraordinary mechanical strength and toughness, while traditional DN hydrogels are limited in terms of their biofunctionality. Based on the DN hydrogels composed of agar and acrylamide (AM), we incorporate vinylphosphoric acid (VPA) into the network to obtain agar/PAM/PVPA hydrogels with universal adhesion and superior cytocompatibility. Meanwhile, the agar/PAM/PVPA hydrogel maintains its high strength and toughness. It is noted that the elongation of the agar/PAM/PVPA hydrogel (molar ratio of VPA is 2%) is up to 3418.9 ± 54.9%. The cell experiment also demonstrates that the addition of VPA in a proper concentration can promote cell adhesion and proliferation. Furthermore, the hydrogel has the potential to be used as 3D printing and injectable materials because of the thermoreversible sol–gel agar. The reported agar/PAM/PVPA hydrogel in this work with universal adhesion, excellent mechanical properties, and excellent cytocompatibility is able to be used for biomedical applications as scaffolds, wound dressing materials, or cartilage repair materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aadhesion 3aagar 3abiocompatibility 3acartilage 3acell adhesion 3aextensibility 3ahydrogels 3astrength (mechanics)1 aZhang, Min1 aLiu, Meiling1 aYu, Yi1 aXu, Xinyuan1 aLi, Jianshu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1522-73260 tBiomacromolecules.g2020 Oct. 19, v. 21, no. 12 p.4699-4708dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c008223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245012400175300001600299520122200315592002801537650001801565650002001583650000901603650001501612650001101627650002301638650000901661650001301670653001301683653001701696653002301713653001601736653002201752653002301774700003001797700002901827700002501856773011701881856008701998852000902085655001202094IND60532455720221119223657.0190318e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053245572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2014.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrera, Marcelino10aLinking risk taking and the behavioral and metabolic responses to confinement stress in gilthead seabream Sparus aurata  ap. 101-108.  aRisk taking and avoidance responses during confinement have been identified in a variety of species, including fish. In addition, differences in metabolic rate have also been attributed to divergent personalities, coping styles or behavioral types. In this study we disclose for the first time a link between risk taking and the behavioral responses and oxygen consumption under confinement stress in the gilthead seabream Sparus aurata. Fish were submitted to a risk-taking test twice to determine the consistency of behavioral responses. Afterwards fish were transferred to individual confinement chambers where their swimming activity and oxygen consumption were measured. Latency to take risks was negatively correlated to both movement and oxygen consumption rates, indicating that risk-avoiders (long latency) were less active and, hence, did not consume so much oxygen as risk-takers. In conclusion, this work reports the first data on the links between risk-taking and the behavioral responses and oxygen consumption during a confinement stress in fish. The relationships between behavioral and physiological variables are significant, suggesting the existence of divergent coping styles in gilthead seabream.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparus aurata 3aanimal behavior 3afish 3ametabolism 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3arisk 3aswimming 0aBehavior 0aCoping style 0aOxygen consumption 0aRisk taking 0aGilthead seabream 0aConfinement stress1 aCastanheira, Maria Filipa1 aConceição, Luís E.C.,1 aMartins, Catarina I.0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2014 June, v. 155 p.101-108dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2014.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245009700174300001400271520159500285592002801880650005801908650001901966650002501985650001502010650001302025650002202038653001502060653001702075653001502092653002602107653002402133700002002157700002902177773010102206856008702307852000902394655001202403IND60603738520221122001310.0200113e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060373852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBisaro, Alexander10aInstitutional Analysis in Climate Change Adaptation Research: A Systematic Literature Review  ap. 34-43.  aAppropriate institutions are essential for climate change adaptation. Yet diverse approaches to institutional analysis are available, encompassing different ontological and epistemological assumptions, and thus yielding insights on very different aspects of institutions in adaptation. Therefore, efforts to expand knowledge in this domain can be usefully informed by an assessment of approaches to institutional analysis in the adaptation literature, which is to date lacking. We address this gap by conducting a systematic review of the adaptation literature addressing institutions. Our review characterises approaches to institutional analysis by identifying methodological choices and the philosophy of science underpinning them. We then analyze the distribution of approaches to institutional analysis across different adaptation situations, contextualizing our results within methodological debates in adaptation research regarding the appropriateness of positivist, interpretative, or post-normal approaches. We find that institutional analysis of adaptation is now engaging with ‘how’ and ‘why’ questions, beyond descriptive questions that characterise the adaptation ‘barriers’ literature, that diverse philosophies of science drive methodological choice, and that post-normal approaches, e.g. co-design approaches, hardly address institutions. We conclude that support for interpretative approaches, and for institutional analysis in post-normal approaches is needed. The latter is important for adaptation planning processes in developing countries under the UNFCCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aclimate change 3adeveloping countries 3aphilosophy 3aplanning 3asystematic review 0aAdaptation 0aInstitutions 0aGovernance 0aPhilosophy of Science 0aPost-Normal Science1 aRoggero, Matteo1 aVillamayor-Tomas, Sergio0 tEcological economics.g2018 Sept., v. 151 p.34-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013000171500001900301520213700320592002802457650002002485650001702505650001202522650002502534650001102559650001202570650001502582650001802597650002402615650001202639653002402651653001802675653002802693653001702721653002102738700002002759700002802779773008702807856008502894852000902979655001202988IND60717108120221119232834.0210405e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071710812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2020.1050212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Feudis, Mauro10aMid-term (30 years) changes of soil properties under chestnut stands due to organic residues management: An integrated study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChestnut plantations are worldwide distributed and they are often subjected to intensive management practices such as the removal of the organic residues from the soil surface. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of such practices on soil properties at different depths and on nutrient contents in chestnut leaves. To reach our goal, 6 pits down to 30 cm soil depth were dug in European chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) stands where the organic residues such as burrs, leaves and pruned materials are yearly removed (REM), and 9 pits in stands where the organic residues are chopped and left on soil surface (CONS). Both practices began about 30 years ago. The nutrient contents in leaves were assessed on chestnut trees close to each pit. Our findings showed a more intense soil development in CONS than in REM. At soil surface, CONS had thicker mineral horizon than in REM probably due to the protection acted by the organic residues against erosion. In subsoil, organic residues conservation promoted the organic C (soil organic C, water–extractable organic C, fulvic–like C and soil organic C stock) accumulation which further promoted horizon development. Since the role of soil organic matter (SOM) as source of nutrients, the subsoil of CONS study sites had a greater stock of Ca, P and S and a higher exchangeable Ca content than REM. Furthermore, the higher SOM and nutrient contents in CONS subsoil compared to REM promoted the microbial respiration. The organic residues conservation effects on the surface soil horizon properties were, instead, negligible. Despite the generally better soil conditions in CONS than in REM, no differences were observed for the leaf nutrient contents likely due to the chestnut trees adaptability also to the scarcely fertile soils. Overall, our findings highlighted the importance of organic residues conservation for the improvement in deeper soil horizons of the chemical and biological fertility in chestnut plantations. Furthermore, this research pointed out to pay more attention on subsoil since it is a good indicator of the changes caused by external factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea sativa 3acarbon sinks 3acatenas 3aexchangeable calcium 3aleaves 3apruning 3asoil depth 3asoil horizons 3asoil organic carbon 3asubsoil 0aChestnut management 0aMountain soil 0aOrganic carbon dynamics 0aLitter floor 0aSoil development1 aFalsone, Gloria1 aVittori Antisari, Livia0 tCatena.g2021 Mar., v. 198 p.105021-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.1050213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245010700177500002900284520120000313592002801513650001301541650001501554650002701569650000901596650002201605653003201627653002101659653004001680653001901720700002501739700001901764773010301783856008501886852000901971655001201980IND60717108420221119233011.0201202e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071710842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2020.1042562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibes Iñesta, Emilio,10aTemporal contingencies are dependent on space location: Distal and proximal concurrent water schedules  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aTwo studies evaluated the effect of delivering water depending on lever-pressing in a proximal or distant location to the water-producing response.

The proportion of water deliveries in one dispenser relative to the second dispenser varied between phases, while the overall frequency was kept constant. In one study rats received water from a dispenser proximal to the water producing response location, whereas in the second study rats received water in the dispenser at the opposite panel where the response was emitted. The number of obtained water deliveries varied according to the programmed proportion, but rats obtained fewer deliveries under the distal location contingency. No systematic variations on space allocation were observed in neither experiment. The results are discussed in terms of the importance of considering the continuous interaction of time and space parameters in the analysis of behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior 3adispensers 3afrequency distribution 3arats 3aspatial variation 0aProximal-distal contingency 0aSpace allocation 0aConcurrent fixed interval schedules 0aLever pressing1 aHernández, Varsovia1 aSerrano, Mario0 tBehavioural processes.g2020 Dec., v. 181 p.104256-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2020.1042563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245013400206300001800340520130700358592002801665650002201693650001501715650001501730650000801745650001101753650002401764650002301788650001501811650001101826650001201837650001501849650002501864650001901889650003101908700005701939773013901996856007902135852000902214655001202223IND60632273620221122092309.0190314e20190128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063227362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b065852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalthammer, Tunga1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2370-866410aPredicting the Gas/Particle Distribution of SVOCs in the Indoor Environment Using Poly Parameter Linear Free Energy Relationships  ap. 2491-2499.  aUnderstanding the partitioning of semi volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) between gas phase and particle phase is essential for exposure analysis and risk assessment in the indoor environment. Numerous attempts have been made to calculate gas/particle partitioning coefficients Kᵢₚ. Single-parameter adsorption and absorption models, which relate Kᵢₚ to the vapor pressure Pₛ or the octanol/air distribution coefficient KOA are usually applied. In this work we use poly parameter Linear Free Energy Relationships (pp-LFER) to describe the partitioning behavior of 14 SVOCs with high relevance for the indoor environment. The pp-LFER concept is based on Abraham descriptors and considers interactions between molecule and particle by separate parameters. van der Waals interactions can be approximated by the logarithm of the hexadecane/air partitioning coefficient (log KHdA = L), which is a key parameter for the 14 polar but nonionizable organic esters being studied here. For many of the examined compounds experimentally determined L-values were not available and had to be measured using gas chromatography. It is shown that the pp-LFER method is a strong alternative to single-parameter approaches and gives reliable coefficients for gas/particle distribution in the indoor environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3aair 3aesters 3aexposure assessment 3agas chromatography 3ahexadecane 3amodels 3aoctanol 3aprediction 3avan der Waals forces 3avapor pressure 3avolatile organic compounds1 aGoss, Kai-Uwe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9707-55050 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Jan. 28, v. 53, no. 5 p.2491-2499dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b065853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245017100166520143700337592002801774650001601802650001501818650001301833650001601846650001701862650001401879650002401893650001401917650001801931650001401949650001701963650001601980650002201996650001402018650001302032653003402045653002302079653001302102653001502115653001402130700001502144700001602159700001202175700001502187700001802202700001702220700001602237773011802253856008802371852000902459655001202468IND60765973820221121221834.0220606e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076597382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1535292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiao10aFacile preparation of novel magnetic mesoporous Fe[sbnd]Mn binary oxides from Mn encapsulated carboxymethyl cellulose-Fe(III) hydrogel for antimony removal from water  aEffective removal of Sb(III) and Sb(V) has long been an urgent task for protecting human health and environment. In this study, novel magnetic mesoporous FeMn binary oxides (MMFMs) were fabricated via calcinating the Mn encapsulated carboxymethyl cellulose-Fe(III) hydrogel, and the structure of MMFMs were closely related to the Fe:Mn ratio. Owing to the mesoporous structure together with synergistic effect of FeMn binary component, the MMFMs exhibited excellent mass transfer and adsorption ability to Sb(III) and Sb(V). MMFM₃ achieved a maximum Sb(III) and Sb(V) adsorption capacity of 281.5 and 204.6 mg/g, respectively. Co-existing anions of Cl⁻, NO₃⁻ and SO₄²⁻ exhibited marginal influence on the adsorption for both Sb(III) and Sb(V), except the PO₄³⁻ for Sb(III) and SiO₃²⁻ or PO₄³⁻ for Sb(V). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic investigation revealed that high valence Mn(IV) was mainly responsible for the oxidation transformation of the highly toxic Sb(III) into less toxic Sb(V), while the FeOₓ content played major role for the adsorption of Sb(V). The generated inner-sphere FeOSb complex between Fe-OH groups and Sb(III/V) dominantly contributed to the removal of Sb(III/V). Overall, mesoporous structure, magnetic separation ability, excellent adsorption performance together with exceptional regeneration properties demonstrated the great potential of MMFMs for Sb(III/V) remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aadsorption 3aantimony 3aenvironment 3ahuman health 3ahydrogels 3amagnetic separation 3amagnetism 3amass transfer 3aoxidation 3aporous media 3aremediation 3aspectral analysis 3asynergism 3atoxicity 0aMagnetic mesoporous adsorbent 0aFeMn binary oxides 0aAntimony 0aAdsorption 0aMechanism1 aMa, Xinyue1 aQi, Chengsi1 aLi, Rui1 aZhang, Wei1 aLi, Jiansheng1 aShen, Jinyou1 aSun, Xiuyun0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 May 15, v. 821 p.153529-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1535293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01152naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011200159300002000271520017800291592002800469650002200497650002200519650001100541650001900552700001200571700001500583700001700598700001600615773012400631856007400755852000900829655001200838IND60678895320221119230410.0191218e20191212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067889532DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra90091h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Wencheng10aCorrection: Efficient removal of cobalt from aqueous solution using β-cyclodextrin modified graphene oxide  ap. 40975-40976.  aCorrection for ‘Efficient removal of cobalt from aqueous solution using β-cyclodextrin modified graphene oxide’ by Wencheng Song et al., RSC Adv., 2013, 3, 9514–9521.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acobalt 3agraphene oxide1 aHu, Jun1 aZhao, Ying1 aShao, Dadong1 aLi, Jiaxing0 tRSC advances.g2019 Dec. 12, v. 9, no. 70 p.40975-40976dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra90091h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001800170245008300188300001600271520123600287592002801523650002501551650001601576650000901592650002101601650001501622650001501637650002501652650001501677650001401692650000701706650001101713650002101724650002101745650004601766650003201812650003101844650002101875650001101896650002101907650003501928653002301963653002101986653002402007653001602031653001502047653000702062653000802069653000802077653000702085653000602092653000802098653000702106653000802113653000802121653000802129653000802137653000802145700002002153773010402173856008502277852000902362655001202371IND60113329620221118052204.0160903e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011332962DNAL7 a238922802pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.06.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhandegar, V.10aElectrocoagulation for the treatment of textile industry effluent – A review  ap. 949-963.  aVarious techniques such as physical, chemical, biological, advanced oxidation and electrochemical are used for the treatment of industrial effluent. The commonly used conventional biological treatment processes are time consuming, need large operational area and are not effective for effluent containing toxic elements. Advanced oxidation techniques result in high treatment cost and are generally used to obtain high purity grade water. The chemical coagulation technique is slow and generates large amount of sludge. Electrocoagulation has recently attracted attention as a potential technique for treating industrial effluent due to its versatility and environmental compatibility. This technique uses direct current source between metal electrodes immersed in the effluent, which causes the dissolution of electrode plates into the effluent. The metal ions, at an appropriate pH, can form wide range of coagulated species and metal hydroxides that destabilize and aggregate particles or precipitate and adsorb the dissolved contaminants. Therefore, the objective of the present manuscript is to review the potential of electrocoagulation for the treatment of industrial effluents, mainly removal of dyes from textile effluent.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological treatment 3acoagulation 3adyes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydroxides 3aindustrial effluents 3ametal ions 3aoxidation 3apH 3asludge 3atextile industry 3atoxic substances 2aColoring Agentsxisolation & purification 2aElectrocoagulationxmethods 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIndustrial Waste 2aMetals 2aTextile Industry 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 0aElectrocoagulation 0aTextile effluent 0aOperating parameter 0aDye removal 0aEfficiency 0aAC 0aBOD 0aCOD 0aDC 0aF 0appm 0aSS 0aTDS 0aTFS 0aTOC 0aTSS 0aTVS1 aSaroha, Anil K.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 128 p.949-963dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.06.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01225naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245005600167300001400223520034600237592002800583650001600611650001500627650001000642700002100652700001900673700001800692700002100710700002000731773010300751856004800854852000900902655001200911IND50066238720221120193736.0130507e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006623872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-008-0008-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiddikov, G.

However, the processes controlling the mobilization of Cd remains poorly understood. Using 12 field-contaminated paddy soils, we investigated the factors controlling the temporal changes in Cd solubility in paddy soils that were incubated anaerobically for 40 d followed by a 20 d oxidation period. Soluble and extractable Cd concentrations decreased rapidly upon flooding but increased during the oxidation phase, with Cd solubility (aqueous Cd/soil Cd) largely depending upon porewater pH. Furthermore, inhibiting sulfate reduction or inhibiting oxidation dissolution of Cd-sulfides had little or no effect on the mobilization of Cd in the subsequent oxidation phase. Both sequential extraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analyses revealed that changes in Cd solubility were largely dependent upon the transformation of Cd between the Fe–Mn (oxyhydro)oxide fraction and exchangeable fraction. Mobilization of Cd upon soil drainage was caused by a decrease in soil pH resulting in the release of Cd from Fe–Mn (oxyhydro)oxides. Taken together, Fe–Mn (oxyhydro)oxides play a critical (and prevalent) role in controlling the mobilization of Cd upon soil drainage in paddy systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acadmium 3adrainage 3afilling period 3aoxidation 3aoxides 3apH 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3asolubility 3asulfates 3asulfides 3atemporal variation1 aWang, Ping-Mei1 aGu, Yi1 aKopittke, Peter M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4948-18801 aZhao, Fang-Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0164-169X1 aWang, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8622-87670 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Feb. 11, v. 53, no. 5 p.2500-2508dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b068633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003000188245011100218300001100329500001500340506007600355520176400431592002802195506003702223650001902260650002202279650001502301650001702316650002502333650002802358650001302386650001202399650001302411650001702424650001702441650001002458650002702468650001702495650002202512653001802534700002002552700002002572700002002592773010102612856008102713852000902794655001202803IND60440819320221207074259.0170721e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044081932DNAL7 a10.1186/s40529-014-0075-12doi7 aPMC54303322pmcid7 a285109542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdiredjo, Afifuddin Latif10aHydraulic conductivity and contribution of aquaporins to water uptake in roots of four sunflower genotypes  ap. 75.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: This article evaluates the potential of intraspecific variation for whole-root hydraulic properties in sunflower. We investigated genotypic differences related to root water transport in four genotypes selected because of their differing water use efficiency (JAC doi: 10.1111/jac.12079. 2014). We used a pressure-flux approach to characterize hydraulic conductance (L ₀) which reflects the overall water uptake capacity of the roots and hydraulic conductivity (Lp ᵣ) which represents the root intrinsic water permeability on an area basis. The contribution of aquaporins (AQPs) to water uptake was explored using mercuric chloride (HgCl₂), a general AQP blocker. RESULTS: There were considerable variations in root morphology between genotypes. Mean values of L ₀ and Lp ᵣ showed significant variation (above 60% in both cases) between recombinant inbred lines in control plants. Pressure-induced sap flow was strongly inhibited by HgCl₂ treatment in all genotypes (more than 50%) and contribution of AQPs to hydraulic conductivity varied between genotypes. Treated root systems displayed markedly different L ₀ values between genotypes whereas Lp ᵣ values were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis points to marked differences between genotypes in the intrinsic aquaporin-dependent path (Lp ᵣ in control plants) but not in the intrinsic AQP-independent paths (Lp ᵣ in HgCl₂ treated plants). Overall, root anatomy was a major determinant of water transport properties of the whole organ and can compensate for a low AQP contribution. Hydraulic properties of root tissues and organs might have to be taken into account for plant breeding since they appear to play a key role in sunflower water balance and water use efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aplant breeding 3aHelianthus annuus 3aaquaporins 3aroot systems 3awater use efficiency 3aintraspecific variation 3asap flow 3atissues 3agenotype 3ainbred lines 3awater uptake 3aroots 3ahydraulic conductivity 3apermeability 3amercuric chloride 0awater balance1 aNavaud, Olivier1 aGrieu, Philippe1 aLamaze, Thierry0 tBotanical studies.g2014 Dec., v. 55, no. 1 p.75-75dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1999-31107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40529-014-0075-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03788naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009800167300001600265520219800281592002802479650002302507650001502530650001102545650001602556650002002572650001102592650001802603650001502621650001002636650001902646650000902665650001502674650002502689650001802714650002502732650001602757653001902773653001802792653001802810653001002828653000902838653002002847653002002867653001702887653001502904653001502919653001302934653001502947653001502962700001802977700001702995773009603012856008103108852000903189655001203198IND60545008020221118051809.0160901e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054500802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2013.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Grady, Damien14aThe use of radar satellite data from multiple incidence angles improves surface water mapping  ap. 652-664.  aSatellite radar data has been employed extensively to monitor flood extents, where cloud cover often prohibits the use of satellite sensors operating at other wavelengths. Where total inundation occurs, a low backscatter return is expected due to the specular reflection of the radar signal on the water surface. However, wind-induced waves can cause a roughening of the water surface which results in a high return signal. Additionally, in arid regions, very dry sand absorbs microwave energy, resulting in low backscatter returns. Where such conditions occur adjacent to open water, this can make the separation of water and land problematic using radar. In the past, we have shown how this latter problem can be mitigated, by making use of the difference in the relationship between the incidence angle of the radar signal, and backscatter, over land and water. The mitigation of wind-induced effects, however, remains elusive. In this paper, we examine how the variability in radar backscatter with incidence angle may be used to differentiate water from land overcoming, to a large extent, both of the above problems.We carry out regression over multiple sets of time series data, determined by a moving window encompassing consecutively-acquired Envisat ASAR Global Monitoring Mode data, to derive three surfaces for each data set: the slope β of a linear model fitting backscatter against local incidence angle; the backscatter normalised to 30° using the linear model coefficients (σ300), and the ratio of the standard deviations of backscatter and local incidence angle over the window sample (SDR). The results are new time series data sets which are characterised by the moving window sample size.A comparison of the three metrics shows SDR to provide the most robust means to segregate land from water by thresholding. From this resultant data set, using a single step water–land classification employing a simple (and consistent) threshold applied to SDR values, we produced monthly maps of total inundation of the variable south-western basin of the Aral Sea through 2011, with an average pixel accuracy of 94% (kappa=0.75) when checked against MODIS-derived reference maps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangle of incidence 3aarid zones 3abasins 3acloud cover 3adata collection 3aenergy 3alinear models 3amonitoring 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3asand 3asatellites 3astatistical analysis 3asurface water 3atime series analysis 3awavelengths 0aClassification 0aFlood mapping 0aSurface water 0aRadar 0aASAR 0aIncidence angle 0aBragg resonance 0aWind effects 0aAbsorption 0aRegression 0aAral Sea 0aKazakhstan 0aUzbekistan1 aLeblanc, Marc1 aBass, Adrian0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Jan., v. 140 p.652-664dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008800169300001200257520135900269592002801628650001001656650001301666650001501679650001901694650001001713650002001723650001201743651001701755653001801772653002201790653002401812653002501836653001201861700002001873700002301893700002201916700001901938773008701957856005102044852000902095655001202104IND50087730920221118234811.0140412e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008773092DNAL7 a10.2989/00306525.2012.7572532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurn, Campbell10aPopulation estimates of three vulture species in Kruger National Park, South Africa  ap. 1-9.  aVultures are globally threatened, yet reliable population data on these birds are few, thus measuring their response to change is difficult. Kruger National Park (KNP) in South Africa is an important stronghold for many avian species, particularly vultures. In this study we generate population estimates for three vulture species in KNP using two plotless density estimators (PDE): a distance estimator based on nearest-neighbour distance and T-square sampling. We flew aerial censuses over large (c. 3 500 km²) sample areas in two ecogeographically separate parts of KNP and counted vulture nests visible within predetermined transects. In total 416 White-backed Vulture Gyps africanus, 22 Lappet-faced Vulture Torgos tracheliotos and 24 White-headed Vulture Trigonoceps occipitalis nests were recorded. The nearest-neighbour distance PDE performed poorly, and we used a T-square PDE calibrated with aerial survey counts to extrapolate across KNP and estimate breeding population sizes. There are an estimated 904 (95% CI±162) pairs of African White-backed Vultures, 78 (95% CI±18) pairs of Lappet-faced Vultures and 60 (95% CI±13) pairs of White-headed Vultures in KNP. These results provide a basis for investigating how large vultures respond to ecosystem change and understanding their resilience within a broader environmental change scenario.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3abreeding 3aecosystems 3anational parks 3anests 3apopulation size 3asurveys 3aSouth Africa 0aaerial survey 0adensity estimator 0apopulation estimate 0aKruger National Park 0avulture1 aCombrink, Leigh1 aRonaldson, G Scott1 aThompson, Charles1 aBotha, André,0 tOstrich.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 84, no. 1 p.1-9dTaylor & Francis Groupx1727-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2012.757253  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002600169245006600195300001600261520117100277592002801448653001701476653002001493653001701513653001401530700001801544700001601562700002401578773012701602856011701729852000901846655001201855IND60127915920221120111239.0151114e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012791592DNAL7 a10.1290/1071-2690(2002)038<0188:AMFPEG>2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMIDDLEMISS, PAMELA J.12aA method for purifying enteric glia from rat myenteric plexus  ap. 188-190.  aThe enteric nervous system is a large and complex division of the peripheral nervous system. The glia associated with it share some characteristics with the olfactory-ensheathing glia, astrocytes and Schwann cells. To facilitate studies of rat enteric glia, we have developed a method for preparing them in large quantities with a high degree of homogeneity. The enteric glia were isolated from the small intestine of Wistar rats by enzymatic digestion with dispase. The cell isolate was added to a mitotically arrested layer of 3T3 cells. Subsequent separation of the enteric glia from the 3T3 cells was done enzymatically, with unavoidable loss of many enteric glia and potential contamination of enteric glia cultures with the 3T3 cells. Therefore, 3T3 cells were cultured in Nunc 0.2-μμm tissue culture inserts that could be readily removed from the wells when no longer needed. There was no loss of the enteric glia. The cultures consisted entirely of GFAP-labeled cells, presumptive enteric glia. This method permits the culturing of large numbers of highly purified enteric glia without the use of expensive growth factors and complement-mediated cytolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 0aenteric glia 0atransplantation 0apurification 0aisolation1 aJIANG, SHUCUI1 aWang, Jian,1 aRATHBONE, MICHEL P.0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2002 Apr., v. 38, no. 4 p.188-190dTissue Culture Associationx1543-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1290%2F1071-2690%282002%29038%3C0188%3AAMFPEG%3E2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010700170300001400277520163500291592002801926650002001954650002401974650002501998650002102023650002302044650002102067650001402088650001002102650001302112650001302125650001702138650001802155650001102173650002202184650001402206650001302220651001402233653001302247653001902260653001402279653002102293653001402314653002102328700002302349700002002372700002002392700002002412700002302432773009002455856008202545852000902627655001202636IND60546557420221123015748.0160903s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054655742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2014.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancis, James T.12aA description of the nearshore fish communities in the Huron–Erie Corridor using multiple gear types  ap. 52-61.  aGreat Lakes coastal wetlands provide a critical habitat for many fish species throughout their life cycles. Once home to one of the largest wetland complexes in the Great Lakes, coastal wetlands in the Huron–Erie Corridor (HEC) have decreased dramatically since the early 1900s. We characterized the nearshore fish communities at three different wetland complexes in the HEC using electrofishing, seines, and fyke nets. Species richness was highest in the Detroit River (63), followed by the St. Clair Delta (56), and Western Lake Erie (47). The nearshore fish communities in the Detroit River and St. Clair Delta consisted primarily of shiners, bluntnose minnow, centrarchids, and brook silverside, while the Western Lake Erie sites consisted of high proportions of non-native taxa including common carp, gizzard shad, goldfish, and white perch. Species richness estimates using individual-based rarefaction curves were higher when using electrofishing data compared to fyke nets or seine hauls at each wetland. Twelve fish species were captured exclusively during electrofishing assessments, while one species was captured exclusively in fyke nets, and none exclusively during seine hauls. Western Lake Erie wetlands were more indicative of degraded systems with lower species richness, lower proportion of turbidity intolerant species, and increased abundance of non-native taxa. This work highlights the importance of coastal wetlands in the HEC by capturing 69 different fish species utilizing these wetlands to fulfill life history requirements and provides insight when selecting gears to sample nearshore littoral areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aDorosoma cepedianum 3aLabidesthes sicculus 3aMorone americana 3aPimephales notatus 3afish communities 3afyke nets 3agears 3agoldfish 3ahabitats 3alife history 3alittoral zone 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3aturbidity 3awetlands 3aLake Erie 0aWetlands 0aFish community 0aNearshore 0aSpecies richness 0aDiversity 0aGear comparisons1 aChiotti, Justin A.1 aBoase, James C.1 aThomas, Mike V.1 aManny, Bruce A.1 aRoseman, Edward F.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2014, v. 40 p.52-61dElsevier B.V.x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2014.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01397naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012500156300001800281520030300299592002800602650000800630650002000638650002300658650001000681650001600691650001200707650001300719700001600732700001700748700001800765700001700783700001800800773013400818856007400952852000901026655001201035IND60660759420221119010048.0190827e20150210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066075942DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc07688e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Fengxia10aHighly sensitive detection of CpG methylation in genomic DNA by AuNP-based colorimetric assay with ligase chain reaction  ap. 3371-3374.  aWe have developed a new ligase chain reaction-based colorimetric assay for detection of DNA methylation with ultrahigh sensitivity and selectivity.

Tree-level data remains still not fully utilized in the context of tree selection mechanisms and harvest-scheduling models. Using spatial optimization with tree-level data can shift the situation. The research presented a decision-support model set based on mixed integer programming (MIP) to select trees based on economical and spatial goals. Trees were represented as polygons to conduct spatial optimization and account for perimeter boundary minimization while establishing adjacency constraints. The proposed model framework method was tested in a Stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) stand of almost 4400 trees in Spain where individual tree detection with airborne laser scanning data was conducted. The MIP-based tree selections were presented using different priorities for single and multi-objective optimizations to demonstrate the potential of spatial goals to make forest management planning more efficient when controlling the spatial arrangement of solutions. The results showed the general MIP formulation is feasible and all presented combinatorial problems reached global optimality fast. The use of MIP formulations to schedule tree-level decisions has positive cascading effects towards operational forest planning while expanding the current frontiers of tree-level forest planning based on heuristic optimization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus pinea 3adecision support systems 3aforest ecology 3aforest management 3aforests 3atrees 3aSpain 0aHarvest-scheduling 0aRemote sensing 0aPrecision forestry 0aALS 0a3D 0aCHM 0aDBH 0aDTM 0aLiDAR 0aLP 0aMIP 0aRVI 0aSSDS 0aTLS0 tForest ecology and management.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 483 p.118714-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1187143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014100169300001600310520155100326592002801877650001501905650001401920650002301934650002101957650002101978650001501999650002102014650001302035650001602048650001102064700002502075700002502100773011802125856008202243852000902325655001202334IND60590161520221123035331.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059016152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-018-3481-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoborodea, Adrian10aPolyolefin Characterization in Xylene by High-Temperature Gel Permeation Chromatography with a New Evaporative Light Scattering Detector  ap. 419-424.  aThe advances in nebulizer technology of the evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) for high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) allowing lower operation temperatures, overcome the limitations of the differential refractive index (DRI) and infrared (IR) detectors, thus allowing xylene as solvent for evaluation of the molecular weight distributions (MWD) of polyolefins. Different types of polyolefins, previously characterized by GPC in trichlorobenzene (TCB) with a DRI detector, in an interlaboratory study conducted by International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) (Luruli, Phase 1: IUPAC SEC/GPC round robin project report: repeatability and reproducibility of sample preparation and analysis in high-temperature SEC, http://media.iupac.org/projects/2005/2005-011-3-400_rpt-phase1_110510.pdf , 2010), and also in a recent study by GPC in TCB with an ELSD and DRI (Boborodea and O’Donohue, Int J Polym Anal Charact 22:631–638, 2017), were for the first time analyzed by GPC with ELSD in xylene.

After linearization of the ELSD signal, the measured average molecular weights of polyolefins in xylene were in good agreement with the values given by DRI detector in TCB. The molecular weight distributions obtained in xylene with an evaporative light scattering detector are similar with those evaluated by classical GPC with differential refractive index detector in TCB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adetectors 3agel chromatography 3alight scattering 3amolecular weight 3apolyolefin 3arefractive index 3asolvents 3atemperature 3axylene1 aMirabella, FrancisM.1 aO’Donohue, Stephen0 tChromatographia.g2018 Mar., v. 81, no. 3 p.419-424dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl1915x0009-58937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-018-3481-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245005300169300001600222520128400238592002801522650003001550650001101580650001001591650000901601650001401610650001901624650001801643650001901661650001401680650001801694651001401712653001301726653001701739653000801756653001001764653001801774700002101792773009801813856008201911852000901993655001202002IND60546557620221122235220.0160903e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054655762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2014.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatisoff, Gerald10aSediment resuspension in the Lake Erie nearshore  ap. 532-540.  aA decline in water quality in Lake Erie during the last decade, despite increased efforts to limit nutrient loading, may be better understood by examining internal processes in the lake. We employed 7Be, 210Pb and 137Cs measurements of suspended matter in tributaries, in the lake water column, in atmospheric precipitation, in sediment traps and in bottom sediments collected in June and August/September 2011 to estimate the fraction of the suspended matter that is resuspended from the bottom. Mass balances on 7Be and 210Pb using sediment trap material indicated that at the nearshore site ~83–94% of suspended matter in the water column was resuspended bottom sediment, while, offshore, resuspended sediment made up only ~62–75%. A mass balance using the 7Be/210Pb ratio for each sediment source indicated that resuspension of bottom sediment accounted for 52–97% of the suspended material in the nearshore and from 53 to 86% of the suspended matter in the offshore and was greater after the fall overturn. The amount of nutrients delivered to the water column by resuspension indicates that the resuspension loading of particle-bound P to the lake is about the same as the tributary loading, although the resuspended P is likely to be significantly less bioavailable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acesium 3alakes 3alead 3anutrients 3apollution load 3aradionuclides 3asediment traps 3asediments 3awater quality 3aLake Erie 0aSediment 0aResuspension 0a7Be 0a210Pb 0aSediment trap1 aCarson, Mary Lou0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2014 Sept., v. 40 p.532-540dElsevier B.V.x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2014.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245014200206300001800348520154300366592002801909650002301937650001701960650002301977650002102000650001502021650001902036650000902055650001202064650002202076650004402098650002002142650001402162650001302176650002002189650002102209650001902230650001402249700005902263700005702322700001702379700002602396700002502422700005802447700002202505700006402527700005902591773013502650856008002785852000902865655001202874IND60685667220221117062249.0200305e20200211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068566722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b099682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeverick, Graham1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8541-438110aSolvent- and Anion-Dependent Li⁺–O₂– Coupling Strength and Implications on the Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Li–O₂ Batteries  ap. 4953-4967.  aLithium–oxygen (Li–O₂) batteries offer considerably higher gravimetric energy density than commercial Li-ion batteries (up to three times) but suffer from poor power, cycle life, and round-trip efficiency. Tuning the thermodynamics and pathway of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in aprotic electrolytes can be used to enhance the Li–O₂ battery rate and discharge capacity. In this work, we present a systematic study on the role of the solvent and anion on the thermodynamics and kinetics of Li⁺-ORR, from which we propose a unified descriptor for its pathway and kinetics. First, by thoroughly characterizing the solvation environment of Li⁺ ions using Raman spectroscopy, ⁷Li NMR, ionic conductivity, and viscosity measurements, we observe increasing Li⁺–anion interactions with increasing anion DN in low DN solvents such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane and acetonitrile but minimal Li⁺–anion interactions in the higher DN dimethyl sulfoxide. Next, by determining the electrolyte-dependent Li⁺/Li, TBA⁺,O₂/TBA⁺–O₂–, and Li⁺,O₂/Li⁺–O₂– redox potentials versus the solvent-invariant Me₁₀Fc reference potential, we show that stronger combined solvation of Li⁺ and O₂– ions leads to weaker Li⁺–O₂⁻ coupling. Finally, using rotating ring disk electrode measurements, we show that weaker Li⁺–O₂– coupling in electrolytes with strong combined solvation leads to an increased generation of soluble Li⁺–O₂–-type species and faster overall kinetics during Li⁺-ORR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aacetonitrile 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy density 3aions 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aredox potential 3asolvation 3asolvents 3astable isotopes 3asuperoxide anion 3athermodynamics 3aviscosity1 aTatara, Ryoichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8148-52941 aFeng, Shuting1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5630-70851 aCrabb, Emily1 aFrance-Lanord, Arthur1 aTułodziecki, Michal1 aLopez, Jeffrey1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6425-55501 aStephens, Ryan M.1 aGrossman, Jeffrey C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1281-23591 aShao-Horn, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8714-21210 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Feb. 11, v. 124, no. 9 p.4953-4967dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b099683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002500187245012400212300001600336506007600352520085600428592002801284506003701312650001401349650001401363650000801377650001101385650000901396650001501405650001401420700001801434700002101452700002401473700002201497773010901519856008101628852000901709655001201718IND60591505420221207123733.0180905e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059150542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pt.2015.08.0072doi7 aPMC46795002pmcid7 a264407882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollender, Philip A.10aMethods for Quantification of Soil-Transmitted Helminths in Environmental Media: Current Techniques and Recent Advances  ap. 625-639.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLimiting the environmental transmission of soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), which infect 1.5 billion people worldwide, will require sensitive, reliable, and cost-effective methods to detect and quantify STHs in the environment. We review the state-of-the-art of STH quantification in soil, biosolids, water, produce, and vegetation with regard to four major methodological issues: environmental sampling; recovery of STHs from environmental matrices; quantification of recovered STHs; and viability assessment of STH ova. We conclude that methods for sampling and recovering STHs require substantial advances to provide reliable measurements for STH control. Recent innovations in the use of automated image identification and developments in molecular genetic assays offer considerable promise for improving quantification and viability assessment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiosolids 3ahelminths 3aova 3apeople 3asoil 3avegetation 3aviability1 aKirby, Amy E.1 aAddiss, David G.1 aFreeman, Matthew C.1 aRemais, Justin V.0 tTrends in parasitology.g2015 Dec., v. 31, no. 12 p.625-639dElsevier LtdwJournal:6336x1471-49227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2015.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245017100180520147700351592002801828650002201856650001501878650002601893650001301919650001601932650001601948650002001964650001001984650001301994650001402007650002202021650001502043650002302058650001702081650002002098650002102118650001102139650002902150650001602179650001502195650002502210653003102235653002802266653002902294653002802323653001502351700001802366700001402384700001402398700001602412700001502428773011802443856008802561852000902649655001202658IND60765974520221121221857.0220606e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076597452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1535372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelvaraj, Ganesh-Kumar10aClass 1 In-Tn5393c array contributed to antibiotic resistance of non-pathogenic Pseudoxanthomonas mexicana isolated from a wastewater bioreactor treating streptomycin  aThe emergence of antibiotic resistance in retort to environmental pollutants during wastewater treatment still remains elusive. Here, we first to investigate the emergence of antibiotic resistance in an environmental non-pathogenic bacterium, Pseudoxanthomonas mexicana isolated from a lab-scale bioreactor treating wastewater containing streptomycin. The molecular mechanism of antibiotic resistance development was evaluated in its genomic, transcriptional, and proteomic levels. The streptomycin resistant (SR) strain showed strong resistance to streptomycin (MIC > 600 μg/mL) as well to sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and kanamycin (≥250 μg/mL). A 13.4 kb class-1-integron array consisting of a new arrangement of gene cassette (IS6100-sul1-aadA2-catB3-aacA1-2-aadB-int1-IS256-int) linked with Tn5393c transposon was identified in the SR strain, which has only been reported in clinical pathogens so far. iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS proteomics revealed 22 up-regulated proteins in the SR strain growing under 100 mg L⁻¹ streptomycin, involving antibiotic resistance, toxin production, stress response, and ribosomal protein synthesis. At the mRNA level, elevated expressions of ARGs (strA, strB, and aadB) and 30S-ribosomal protein genes (rpsA and rpsU) were observed in the SR strain. The results highlighted the genomic plasticity and multifaceted regulatory mechanism employed by P. mexicana in adaptation to high-level streptomycin during biological wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudoxanthomonas 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abioreactors 3aenvironment 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenomics 3akanamycin 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3aribosomal proteins 3astreptomycin 3astress response 3asulfamethoxazole 3atoxins 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransposons 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aPseudoxanthomonas mexicana 0aStreptomycin resistance 0aClass 1 In-Tn5393c array 0aWhole genome sequencing 0aProteomics1 aWang, Hanqing1 aZhang, Yu1 aTian, Zhe1 aChai, Wenbo1 aLu, Huijie0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 May 15, v. 821 p.153537-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1535373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01985naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245008300203300001800286520082200304592002801126650002001154650002301174650001901197650001601216650002001232650002301252650001301275650001901288700006001307700002201367700002101389773013501410856008101545852000901626655001201635IND60685667320210220000000.0210220e20200212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068566732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b099792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaporte, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5079-516110aFormic Acid Synthesis in a Water–Mineral System: Major Role of the Interface  ap. 5125-5131.  aMineral surfaces are known for their catalytic properties, as they have lower kinetic barriers to reactions and modify chemical equilibria. Using ab initio molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling methods, we predict that the MgO(001)–water interface thermodynamically favors the formation of formic acid from carbon monoxide and water. This occurs despite the lack of direct participation from the surface atoms, with the reaction taking place beyond the first adsorbed layer. Furthermore, the application of an external electric field on the reaction in bulk water shows a similar effect. We propose that formic acid may be stabilized by the surface electric field, by direct comparison with the equilibrium in bulk water with and without an external electric field applied, and at the MgO(001)–water interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalytic activity 3aelectric field 3aformic acid 3amagnesium oxide 3amolecular dynamics 3asampling 3athermodynamics1 aPietrucci, Fabio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4892-26671 aGuyot, François,1 aSaitta, A.

Because emissivity is an intrinsic property of the surface, multispectral thermal infrared emissivity data have the potential for enhancing our ability to monitor landscape changes in environmentally sensitive zones beyond what is currently possible from standard practices used today. The most common of these practices is the use of visible to short-wave infrared data, in particular the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Two algorithms are currently used to generate the LST&E products from MODIS data, but studies have identified several issues with both these algorithms that limit their usefulness for land cover change detection. These issues have been recently addressed by applying the ASTER Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm to MODIS thermal infrared data to generate LST and a dynamically varying multispectral emissivity product for bands 29, 31, and 32 at 1-km resolution. The new product (MOD21) will be released with MODIS Collection 6 during fall 2013. This study demonstrates the utility of the dynamic MOD21 multispectral emissivity product to detect land cover changes over a broad range of different Earth surface domains including land degradation in dryland regions, snow melt characteristics on glaciers and ice sheets, extreme ecosystem disturbances, and agricultural activities. The MOD21 spectral emissivity provided increased sensitivity to land cover change in a more consistent manner than is currently possible with other emissivity products and, depending on the application, standard visible to near infrared (VNIR) data. The results suggest that synergistic use of thermal and VNIR data will help us to better identify and understand changes in the Earth surface system, and reduce uncertainties in estimating their magnitudes and trends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3aalgorithms 3aarid lands 3aautumn 3aecosystems 3aevapotranspiration 3aglaciers 3aice 3aland cover 3aland degradation 3alandscapes 3amelting 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3asnowmelt 3asurface temperature 3auncertainty 0aEmissivity 0aMODIS 0aLand cover change 0aMOD21 0aASTER 0aTemperature emissivity separation 0aMultispectral1 aVeraverbeke, Sander1 aHook, Simon0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Jan., v. 140 p.755-765dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01885naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008500158300002000243520096800263592002801231650001501259650001701274650002501291650001001316700001501326700001801341700001701359773012401376856007401500852000901574655001201583IND60641448120221122025829.0190505e20170411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064144812DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra26375e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yinghao10aEdge effect detection for real-time cellular analyzer using statistical analysis  ap. 20833-20839.  aReal time cellular analyzers (RTCA) are widely used to test the cytotoxicity of chemicals. However, there are some uncontrollable factors, which are detrimental to the experimental quality. One of the fundamental issues is the edge effect. Abnormal time-dependent cellular response curves (TCRCs) are observed when the wells are located at the edge of the E-plate. In this paper, the Smirnov test was used to detect the edge effect. The average normalized cell index (NCI) of the negative control located in the inner wells was taken as the standard. Thereafter, all TCRCs were divided into several intervals, and their corresponding empirical distribution functions (EDFs) of the mean NCI and NCI located at the edge wells were calculated, and hypothesis testing was used to determine the differences of the EDFs. The experimental results evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm. This framework provided a systematic method for edge-effect detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acytotoxicity 3astatistical analysis 3awells1 aChen, Shan1 aPan, Tianhong1 aXiaobo, Zou,0 tRSC advances.g2017 Apr. 11, v. 7, no. 34 p.20833-20839dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra26375e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013300169300001600302520150400318592002801822650002501850650001301875650001301888650001001901650002101911650001501932650001501947650001101962650002701973650001702000650001902017650002502036650002002061651001602081651002202097651001902119651001502138700002202153700002002175700002102195773012502216856008202341852000902423655001202432IND60590230920221116160635.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059023092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-016-3076-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathias, PhilipT.10aSignature of postglacial colonization on contemporary genetic structure and diversity of Quadrula quadrula (Bivalvia: Unionidae)  ap. 207-225.  aContemporary species distributions and geographic patterns of genetic structure largely reflect pre-historic events, often with subsequent alterations from human influences. The geographic genetic structure of a relatively common and widespread unionid species, Quadrula quadrula, was investigated to reconstruct its postglacial history. Hypotheses regarding colonization routes of Q. quadrula into the Great Lakes basin after the most recent glacial retreat were tested. Samples were collected from Q. quadrula at sites spanning hypothesized glacial refugia and postglacial expansion routes in the Mississippi River drainage, including the Ohio and Missouri rivers, and the Great Lakes. Broad-scale phylogeography and population structure were assessed by sequencing a fragment of the mitochondrial CO1 gene and genotyping eight microsatellites. Results of analyses showed marked differences among the Great Lakes, Mississippi River, and Ohio River drainages, and suggested colonization of the Great Lakes basin from a Mississippian source. Populations showed patterns of isolation by distance: geographic and genetic distances were significantly correlated among Great Lakes populations based on colonization through the Chicago–Illinois outlet, but not when following the Wabash–Maumee outlet. All evidence indicates that postglacial colonization of the Great Lakes basin occurred almost exclusively through the Chicago–Illinois outlet, with subsequent expansion into the lower Great Lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMississippian period 3aQuadrula 3adrainage 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3agenotyping 3aglaciation 3ahumans 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondria 3aphylogeography 3apopulation structure 3arefuge habitats 3aGreat Lakes 3aMississippi River 3aMissouri River 3aOhio River1 aHoffman, JordanR.1 aWilson, ChrisC.1 aZanatta, DavidT.0 tHydrobiologia.g2018 Mar., v. 810, no. 1 p.207-225dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-3076-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006400146245010200210300001800312520129000330592002801620650002201648650002401670650001701694650001101711650001901722650001201741650002201753650002301775650001401798650002201812650001101834650001201845700006001857700006001917773013501977856008002112852000902192655001202201IND60685667520200413000000.0200305e20200204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068566752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b100032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZulueta, Yohandys A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0491-581710aNa- and K-Doped Li₂SiO₃ as an Alternative Solid Electrolyte for Solid-State Lithium Batteries  ap. 4982-4988.  aThe search for high-performance solid electrolyte materials with the potential to increase the safety and energy density of next-generation Li-ion batteries is becoming ever more important for the electrification of transport and grid-scale energy storage. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations are used to study ion transport in Na- and K-doped Li₂SiO₃ as a potential material for future solid-state lithium batteries. Lattice statics calculations are also used to determine the defect energetics of this system, which reveal the ease with which Li₂SiO₃ can store Na and K. Our calculations reveal low defect formation energies of 0.07 and 1.95 eV for Na and K doping of Li₂SiO₃, respectively. Room-temperature Li-ion diffusion in Li₂SiO₃ is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of a low concentration of Na (1 mol %) with a notably low activation energy of 0.34 eV, compared with 0.48 eV for the undoped system. Alternatively, at higher dopant concentrations in excess of 3 mol %, it is K doping that results in an enhancement in Li-ion diffusion rather than Na doping. Our results highlight the potential of doped Li₂SiO₃ as a solid electrolyte material for Li-ion batteries and encourage further experimental verification of these promising findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aambient temperature 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amolecular dynamics 3apotassium 3asimulation models 3asodium 3astatics1 aNguyen, Minh Tho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3803-05691 aDawson, James A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3946-53370 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Feb. 04, v. 124, no. 9 p.4982-4988dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b100033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092024002100149040001800170072000900188100001900197245010000216300001600316500002400332520116100356650002601517650002501543650002401568650002001592650002801612650002401640650002401664650001501688650002301703650001001726650001201736650002301748650001001771651001301781700002301794700002401817773009301841852000901934856011101943856011202054930003302166945002502199946001302224961001302237655001202250IND4439844720221118230109.0100712e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443984472DNAL7 a10.1675/1524-4695(2004)027[0170:SDOMAF]2.0.CO;22doi7 a10113/440812hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP0501 aFenech, Amy S.10aSeasonal Diets of Male and Female Double-crested Cormorants from an Oxbow Lake in Arkansas, USA  ap. 170-176.  aIncludes references  aDiets were examined and analyzed for 418 wintering Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) collected from January to mid-April 2001 and October to December 2001 at an oxbow lake in southeast Arkansas. The fish community was also sampled to examine prey availability. Gizzard Shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) and Yellow Bass (Morone mississippiensis) were the most important species in cormorant diet. Other, less important, cormorant prey species included Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), cyprinids (minnows), and sunfishes (Lepomis spp.). Diet varied by season and sex. Cormorants consumed higher proportions of cyprinids and Channel Catfish in the autumn than the remainder of the over-wintering period. In general, females consumed Gizzard Shad more than males, while males consumed Channel Catfish more than females. Neither genders consumed notable amounts of sport fish. Prey size did not differ between the sexes, but did vary by season. These data demonstrate the relative importance of forage and rough fish and the lesser relative importance of sport fish in the diet of cormorants over-wintering on an oxbow lake in southeast Arkansas. 3aPhalacrocorax auritus 3awildlife food habits 3afeeding preferences 3afreshwater fish 3aMorone mississippiensis 3aIctalurus punctatus 3aDorosoma cepedianum 3aCyprinidae 3agender differences 3amales 3afemales 3aseasonal variation 3alakes 3aArkansas1 aLochmann, Steve E.1 aRadomski, Andrew A.0 tWaterbirds.g2004 June, v.  27, no.  2 p.170-176dThe Waterbird Societyx1938-53907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2004)027%5B0170:SDOMAF%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/440813Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101020b20101108c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/10/15  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02662naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245012700189300001600316520155600332592002801888653002101916653002401937653002101961653002001982653002702002700001902029700002202048700002502070773012702095856011702222852000902339655001202348IND60127916720221121075826.0151114e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012791672DNAL7 a10.1290/1071-2690(2002)038<0235:RLAPKC>2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBOTOS, JEANNINE10aRb LOCALIZATION AND PHOSPHORYLATION KINETICS CORRELATE WITH THE CELLULAR PHENOTYPE OF CULTURED BREAST ADENOCARCINOMA CELLS  ap. 235-241.  aRetinoblastoma protein (Rb) expression has been correlated with state of differentiation, proliferation rate, and metastatic potential in breast adenocarcinomas and established cell lines. These observations, based on immunoreactivity of total Rb rather than hypophosphorylated protein, do not address the relationship between functional Rb and indicators of an aggressive transformed cellular phenotype. We hypothesized that the distribution of functional Rb and the kinetics of Rb phosphorylation would differ between cell lines representing immortalized mammary epithelium (MCF10A), differentiated nonmetastatic mammary adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and poorly differentiated, highly metastatic mammary adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231) and that these differences would be informative of the cellular phenotype. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy was used to compare qualitatively the subcellular localization of total and hypophosphorylated Rb protein in synchronized and asynchronous cells. This technique was also used to quantitatively assess the amounts of hypophosphorylated Rb throughout the cell cycle in these representative cell lines. Total Rb stained more prominently than hypophosphorylated Rb in the nucleus of all asynchronous cells. Rb phosphorylation was more rapid in MCF-7 cells than in MCF10A cells, whereas Rb dephosphorylation appeared deregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells. We conclude that assessment of hypophosphorylated Rb may be more useful than assessment of total Rb for the evaluation of transformed breast adenocarcinoma phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 0abreast neoplasms 0acell cycle proteins 0anuclear proteins 0aphosphoproteins 0aretinoblastoma protein1 aBARHOUMI, ROLA1 aBURGHARDT, ROBERT1 aKOCHEVAR, DEBORAH T.0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2002 Apr., v. 38, no. 4 p.235-241dTissue Culture Associationx1543-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1290%2F1071-2690%282002%29038%3C0235%3ARLAPKC%3E2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03791naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007300162300001600235520223300251592002802484650001102512650001402523650001202537650001502549650005002564650004302614650001602657650001902673650002202692650001602714653000902730653001002739653002102749653003302770653001802803653002002821653002502841653003002866653001702896653003502913653002302948700003002971700002303001700001403024700001803038700001603056773009903072856008103171852000903252655001203261IND60545008920221118051759.0160901e20140205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054500892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2013.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Ziti13aAn Anisotropic Flat Index (AFX) to derive BRDF archetypes from MODIS  ap. 168-187.  aSpectral vegetation indices can be generalized as a function of surface reflectance with respect to wavelength. However, there is significant information on vegetation structure embedded in the anisotropic effects of the target. In this study, we describe and characterize a new vegetation index, the Anisotropic Flat Index (AFX) that captures this anisotropic scattering information and can be derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) product suite (MOD43A1). The AFX is created by normalization of net scattering magnitude (obtained from volumetric and geometric-optical scattering) with the isotropic scattering. The AFX summarizes the variability of basic dome-bowl anisotropic reflectance patterns of the terrestrial surface. A classification scheme for BRDF typology is created based on AFX archetypes that capture characteristic BRDF shape types. This study fully characterizes AFX in a number of steps. First, sensitivity to random noise and observation geometries is explored by comparing the AFX with other variables derived from field measurements that comprehensively sample the viewing hemisphere. Second, AFX is compared with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values using field measurements from many ground campaigns, as well as global MODIS observations from EOS Land Validation Core Sites (LVCS). Third, a BRDF typology is developed by classification of an a priori database of BRDF archetypes from field measurements, and from MODIS observations that cover the full range of vegetation types from grasslands to closed forest (MCD43A). Fourth, the response of AFX to the parameter variability of canopy architectures and background optical properties for three vegetation types with discontinuous woody canopies is investigated through the use of a 5-Scale BRDF model simulation. Finally, global BRDF archetypes are mapped and discussed through the use of a global high-quality MODIS BRDF/albedo gap filled product (MCD43GF). The results show that the AFX summarizes BRDF archetypes and provides additional information on vegetation structure and other anisotropic reflectance characteristics of the land surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3adatabases 3aforests 3agrasslands 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asimulation models 3awavelengths 0aBRDF 0aMODIS 0aVegetation index 0aAnisotropic Flat Index (AFX) 0aBRDF typology 0aBRDF archetypes 0aVegetation structure 0aMultiangle remote sensing 0aLinear model 0aEOS land validation core sites 0aA priori knowledge1 aHill, Mikeq(Michael J.),1 aSchaaf, Crystal B.1 aZhang, Hu1 aWang, Zhuosen1 aLi, Xiaowen0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Feb. 05, v. 141 p.168-187dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01495naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245005800168300001600226520061100242592002800853650002100881650001300902650001700915650001600932650001100948650000900959651001300968773012100981856008201102852000901184655001201193IND60579681220221118233101.0180619e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057968122DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452170401292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProkopchuk, I.P.10aFeeding of Polar cod Boreogadus saida in the Kara Sea  ap. 591-602.  aIn the summer–autumn period of 2007, 2010, and 2013, the peculiarities of Polar cod feeding Boreogadus saida in the Kara Sea were considered.

As the length of Polar cod increases, the weight percentage of copepods decreases and the portion of fish increases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoreogadus saida 3aCopepoda 3aEuphausiacea 3aUrochordata 3aadults 3afish 3aKara Sea0 tJournal of ichthyology.g2017 July, v. 57, no. 4 p.591-602dPleiades PublishingwJournal:J000000402x0032-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00329452170401293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012900167300001600296520122900312592002801541650001801569650001101587650001101598650002301609650001801632650001401650650001701664700001801681700002201699700003001721700001701751700002001768700003301788773012501821856008201946852000902028655001202037IND60590231320221116160828.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059023132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-017-3103-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Keiko10aModelling growth in the critically endangered freshwater mussel Margaritifera auricularia (Spengler, 1793) in the Ebro basin  ap. 375-391.  aHere we analyse in detail, for the first time, the growth pattern of the endangered freshwater mussel Margaritifera auricularia in the Ebro basin, a life history trait essential for conservation purposes. We combined information on size and age from captive bred juveniles, together with growth annuli from living preadults studied in the field, and empty shells of preadult and adult individuals. We compared the fit of six types of (asymptotic and sigmoid) non-linear growth models and, in terms of residual errors and AIC values, the sigmoid ones were superior, being the Generalized von Bertalanffy and Richards models the best fitted ones. After an initial exponential growth phase in juveniles, growth rate starts to decelerate at an inflection point corresponding to an age of seven years. At an age of about 30 years, the growth rate markedly declines and attains an asymptote at c. 150 mm shell length. Global growth rate is relatively low but comparable to other members of the family, and the maximum age estimated from ring counts was 68 years. We demonstrate that the use of sigmoid models provides more accurate estimation of growth patterns in freshwater mussels, as previously observed for other bivalves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMargaritifera 3aadults 3abasins 3afreshwater mussels 3agrowth models 3ajuveniles 3alife history1 aCucala, Laura1 aMestre, Alexandre1 aMesquita-Joanes, Francesc1 aElbaile, Eva1 aSalinas, Carlos1 aMuñoz-Yanguas, MiguelÁngel0 tHydrobiologia.g2018 Mar., v. 810, no. 1 p.375-391dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3103-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003300166245011900199300001600318520080200334592002801136650001501164650001501179650002201194650001301216650002301229650002301252650001501275650001401290650001401304650001601318650005001334650003401384650002401418650004101442700001801483700001801501700001901519700001701538773013301555856004801688852000901736655001201745IND50071647320221120180351.0140104e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007164732DNAL7 a241424902pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-013-2217-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTavakoly Sany, Seyedeh Belin12aA review of strategies to monitor water and sediment quality for a sustainability assessment of marine environment  ap. 813-833.  aThe basic aim of this work is (1) to review and present practically operational requirements for a sustainability assessment of marine environment, such as describing the monitoring process, research approaches, objectives, guidelines, and indicators and (2) to illustrate how physico-chemical and biological indicators can be practically applied, to assess water and sediment quality in marine and coastal environment. These indicators should meet defined criteria for practical usefulness, e.g. they should be simple to understand and apply to managers and scientists with different educational backgrounds.

In this study, exopolysaccharides (EPS) were produced by Pleurotus pulmonarius in submerged culture supplemented with different agro-wastes. Functional groups in EPS were revealed using Fourier Transform-Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Antimicrobial activity of EPS was tested against microorganisms using agar well diffusion. Scavenging potentials of EPS was tested against 1, 1- diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl (OH), iron (Fe²⁺) and nitric oxide (NO) radicals. In vitro prebiotic activity of EPS was carried out. The highest yield (5.60 g/L) of EPS was produced by P. pulmonarius in submerged culture supplemented with groundnut shell (20.0 g/L). The functional groups in EPS were hydroxyl (-OH), methyl (-CH₃), ketone (-RCOH) and carbonyl group (-C=O). EPS displayed zones of inhibition (5.00–14.00 mm) against tested microorganisms. Scavenging activity of EPS ranged from 65.70-81.80% against DPPH. EPS supported the growth of Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Streptococcus thermophiles with values ranged from 3.04 × 10⁴–3.40 × 10⁴ cfu/ml and 2.50 × 10⁴–2.81 × 10⁴ cfu/ml, respectively. Submerged culture of P. pulmonarius with addition of agro-wastes enhanced yield of EPS. The EPS exhibited bio-functional properties like antimicrobial, antioxidant and prebiotic activities. Hence, agrowastes can be recycled in submerged fermentation with fungi to produce promising biomaterials for biopharmaceutical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii 3aPleurotus pulmonarius 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3aagar 3aagricultural wastes 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidants 3abiocompatible materials 3abiopharmaceuticals 3aexopolysaccharides 3airon 3anitric oxide 3apeanut hulls 3aprebiotics 3asubmerged fermentation 0aBiotechnology 0aMicrobiology 0aMetabolite 0aPharmaceutical science 0aWhite-rot fungi 0aAgro-wastes 0aFermentation 0aProbiotic 0aFTIR1 aUbaru, Adaeze Mascot1 aLadi-Lawal, Temilayo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4951-21251 aThonda, Oluwakemi Abike1 aAladejana, Oluwatoyin Modupe1 aMalomo, Olu0 tHeliyon.g2020 Dec., v. 6, no. 12 p.e05685-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e056853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01265naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012400156300001600280520023600296592002800532650002500560650002000585650004300605650002800648650001300676700001400689700001700703700002600720773012200746856007400868852000900942655001200951IND60662593720221118033435.0190906e20110405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066259372DNAL7 a10.1039/c0gc00524j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartman, R.10aAnalytical Method Volume Intensity (AMVI): A green chemistry metric for HPLC methodology in the pharmaceutical industry  ap. 934-939.  aAnalytical Method Volume Intensity (AMVI), a simple metric developed to measure the total solvent consumption of an HPLC method, can help chemists make informed decisions on how to lower an analytical method's environmental impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3agreen chemistry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apharmaceutical industry 3asolvents1 aHelmy, R.1 aAl-Sayah, M.1 aWelch, Christopher J.0 tGreen chemistry.g2011 Apr. 5, v. 13, no. 4 p.934-939dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0gc00524j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003700151245022700188300001600415520159400431592002802025650002202053650002102075650001502096650001502111650001202126650001902138650001902157650002002176650001302196650001602209650001102225650000902236650001302245650002302258650001502281650001302296650001902309650001502328650001402343650001502357650001302372650001102385650002902396650001002425653002502435653004602460653004202506653002502548653001302573653001002586700002402596700003302620700003202653700003002685700002202715773009802737856008502835852000902920655001202929IND60554504420221119102528.0161024e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055450442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.08.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbarra, Alan Alexander González10aDetermination of putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine and spermine in different chemical matrices by high performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–ITMS/MS)  ap. 176-184.  aThe goal of this work was to establish a simple HPLC–ESI–ITMS/MS procedure, suitable for the determination of four common aliphatic polyamines in two different types of biological matrices. To this end, 1,6-diaminohexane was used as the internal standard (IS) and 4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzenotrifluoride (FNBT) as the derivatizing agent. Formation of fully derivatized compounds was confirmed by high resolution ESI–QTOFMS and MS/MS analysis. Reversed phase chromatographic separation was carried out by gradient elution with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and methanol. In a positive ESI mode, the following pairs of precursor/quantifier ions were used for multiple reaction monitoring: 467.4/261.0 for PUT, 481.2/461.1 for CAD, 713.7/261.0 for SPD, 959.8/507.2 for SPM and 495.3/475.2 for IS. On-column instrumental detection limits of four polyamines were in the range 0.62–2.14fmol (0.039–0.215ng/ml). Versatility was demonstrated by analyzing plant extracts and human urine; prior to derivatization, all samples were cleaned-up by dichloromethane extraction. The evaluated signal suppression/enhancement was in the range 82.3–115.4% and the percentage recoveries obtained in the method of standard addition were in the range 83.7–114.4%. Statistically significant differences in polyamines concentrations were found in garden cress exposed to Cd(II) versus control seedlings (t-test, p<0.05); results obtained for urine from healthy volunteers and diabetic patients at different clinical conditions suggested possible utility of free polyamines as biomarkers of progressive diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,6-hexanediamine 3aLepidium sativum 3abiomarkers 3acadaverine 3acadmium 3achromatography 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3adiabetes 3aformic acid 3ahumans 3aions 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3amonitoring 3apatients 3aplant extracts 3aputrescine 3aseedlings 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3at-test 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine 0aAliphatic polyamines 0a4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzenotrifluoride (FNBT) 0aLC–MS, Multiple reaction monitoring 0aPlant abiotic stress 0aDiabetes 0aUrine1 aWróbel, Katarzyna,1 aEscobosa, Alma Rosa Corrales1 aElguera, Julio Cesar Torres1 aGaray-Sevilla, Ma Eugenia1 aWrobel, Kazimierz0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 1002 p.176-184dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.08.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04397naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245006200171506011700233506007600350520309900426592002803525506003703553650001103590650001603601650001503617650001203632653002503644653002103669653001203690653003803702653002103740700002003761700002203781700002003803773009303823856008603916852000904002655001204011IND60783557920221207070819.0221004e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078355792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e099652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalysheva, Olga14aThe effect of online learning in modern history education  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInteractive digital technologies have become relevant in modern education. The use of these technologies in the classroom contributes to the development of professional competencies and skills. The purpose of the study is to analyze the effectiveness of interactive learning environments and online platforms in learning history. The features of modern online learning platforms and the possibilities of their use in the study of history have been analyzed. The research was carried out at the Department of National History of Moscow City University (Moscow, the Russian Federation). The experiment involved 623 history students of different years of study of the following training profiles: "History" (124 students of 1–4 years of study) and "Pedagogical education" ("History and a foreign language", "History and social studies" – 399 students of 1–5 years of study). Also, the survey was addressed to 29 faculty members from the university under consideration. The results of the first survey show that the majority of students (62%) noted the use of traditional methods and 38% of respondents indicated the use of the modern ones. The majority of students (52%) also answered that digital tools are rarely used in the study of history while 71% of respondents reported that digital technology affects their motivation to learn. Therefore, the majority of students rated their level of motivation as average (43%) or low (47%). The most frequent professional competencies and skills are “technical competence (modern technologies)” (62%), “creativity” (65%), “critical thinking” (60%), “strategic thinking” (55%), and “practical skills” (78%). Based on the results obtained in the first survey, a program was developed to increase the motivation of students to study history and archeology, as well as to familiarize themselves with modern educational technologies that can be used in the learning process. The second survey showed an increase in the indicators of students' motivation to learn, which indicates the effectiveness of the developed program for the study of history. The majority of students (85%) answered that digital tools affect their motivation to learn. Thus, they rated it as medium (50%), high (20%) and low (30%). Accordingly, the indicators of professional competencies and skills increased by 10%: “technical competence (modern technologies)” (72%), “creativity” (75%), “critical thinking” (71%), “strategic thinking” (65%), and “practical skills” (88%). No less significant were the shifts in students’ creative thinking development indicators – they changed from 18% (before the experiment) to 58% (after the experiment). The practical significance and prospects for further research are explained by the possibility of using the developed program for the study of history in other universities located in different countries. Also, the methodological basis of the proposed program can be used to study not only history but also other subjects as digital technologies are relevant in the modern education system.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRussia 3aarchaeology 3amotivation 3asurveys 0aDigital technologies 0aEducation system 0aHistory 0aInteractive learning environments 0aOnline platforms1 aTokareva, Elena1 aOrchakova, Larisa1 aSmirnova, Yulia0 tHeliyon.g2022 July, v. 8, no. 7 p.e09965-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e099653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002100183245007600204300002000280506007600300520101000376592002801386506003701414650001501451650001701466650001701483650001301500650001701513650002201530650002401552650001001576650001001586650002701596650004401623650001401667650002201681650001401703700002401717700001801741700002301759700001601782773013501798856007801933852000902011655001202020IND60580490320221207095112.0170921e20170920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058049032DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b061762doi7 aPMC56091162pmcid7 a288538672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWyche, Thomas
P.10aTryptorubin A: A Polycyclic Peptide from a Fungus-Derived Streptomycete  ap. 12899-12902.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFungus-growing ants engage in complex symbiotic relationships with their fungal crop, specialized fungal pathogens, and bacteria that provide chemical defenses. In an effort to understand the evolutionary origins of this multilateral system, we investigated bacteria isolated from fungi. One bacterial strain (Streptomyces sp. CLI2509) from the bracket fungus Hymenochaete rubiginosa, produced an unusual peptide, tryptorubin A, which contains heteroaromatic links between side chains that give it a rigid polycyclic globular structure. The three-dimensional structure was determined by NMR and MS, including a ¹³C-¹³C COSY of isotopically enriched material, degradation, derivatives, and computer modeling. Whole genome sequencing identified a likely pair of biosynthetic genes responsible for tryptorubin A’s linear hexapeptide backbone. The genome also revealed the close relationship between CLI2509 and Streptomyces sp. SPB78, which was previously implicated in an insect–bacterium symbiosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFormicidae 3aHymenochaete 3aStreptomyces 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3achemical defenses 3acomputer simulation 3afungi 3agenes 3aheterocyclic compounds 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apathogens 3asequence analysis 3asymbiosis1 aRuzzini, Antonio C.1 aSchwab, Laura1 aCurrie, Cameron R.1 aClardy, Jon0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 139, no. 37 p.12899-12902dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b061763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013300174506011700307506007600424520137600500592002801876506003701904650002101941650001601962650001701978650001601995650001602011650001302027650001802040650000902058650001202067650002302079650003002102650001402132650001002146650001702156650002502173650002102198650002102219653001902240653002302259653002102282653002602303653002202329700002302351700002202374773009302396856008602489852000902575655001202584IND60779939120221207084756.0220906e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077993912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e096672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalahatkar, Bahram10aRepeated intraperitoneal injection of ovine growth hormone accelerates growth in sub-yearling Siberian sturgeon Acipenser baerii  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe role of growth hormone (GH) in chondrosteans is poorly understood, particularly with regard to its effects on growth. In this study, we examined the influence of exogenous GH on growth performance and body composition in juvenile Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii). Fish with initial weight of 80.2 ± 0.1 g (mean ± S.E) were injected once every 10 days with either purified ovine GH (oGH) at 1, 2, 4, and 8 μg oGH/g body weight (BW) or with saline over a 50-day period. Treatment with the highest dose of oGH significantly enhanced growth performance (final body weight and length, body weight increase and specific growth rate, SGR). Notably, 8 μg oGH/g BW increased body weight by 33% and SGRw by 141% compared to control fish. GH-stimulated (8 μg oGH/g BW) growth was accompanied by increased crude protein content; however, oGH treatment did not affect levels of total protein, total lipid, cholesterol, triglyceride, or glucose in plasma. oGH decreased plasma levels of thyroxine (at 4 μg oGH/g BW), but had no significant effect on plasma levels of triiodothyronine or cortisol compared to controls. These findings indicate that 8 μg oGH/g BW enhances somatic growth and synthesis of body protein in juvenile Siberian sturgeon and demonstrate the feasibility of exogenous oGH treatment in conservation and aquaculture programs for this ancient species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcipenser baerii 3aaquaculture 3abody protein 3abody weight 3acholesterol 3acortisol 3acrude protein 3afish 3aglucose 3agrowth performance 3aintraperitoneal injection 3ajuveniles 3asheep 3asomatotropin 3aspecific growth rate 3atriacylglycerols 3atriiodothyronine 0aGrowth hormone 0aGrowth performance 0aThyroid hormones 0aProximate composition 0aSiberian sturgeon1 aPoursaeid, Samaneh1 aSheridan, Mark A.0 tHeliyon.g2022 June, v. 8, no. 6 p.e09667-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e096673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02053naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011700154300001600271520089300287592002801180650002401208650002001232650001101252650001701263650002001280650001601300650001401316650001501330650002201345650001301367700001801380700001801398700002101416700002501437773012201462856007401584852000901658655001201667IND60662594020221118033553.0190906e20110405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066259402DNAL7 a10.1039/c0gc00539h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Jie10aInstantaneous crystallization of ultrathin one-dimensional fluorescent rhabdophane nanowires at room temperature  ap. 817-819.  aLanthanide phosphates are of increasing interest because of their sharp, stable photoluminescence with long lifetime. The emission of lanthanide phosphate can be easily changed by introducing different lanthanide ion dopants such as Eu and Tb for down-conversion and Er, Tm for up-conversion luminescence. However, the synthesis of such crystalline materials is always energy- and/or time-consuming. Sometimes, even templates and/or organic solvents are required to prepare the nano-sized and crystalline lanthanide phosphate. Those obstacles hinder the scaling-up of production and practical applications. In this communication, we report two microfluidic platforms (SDP and RTP) using continuous flow conditions to fabricate (within seconds) ultrathin single-crystalline rhabdophane lanthanide phosphate nanowires with tunable length at room temperature, using water as a benign medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acrystallization 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3agreen chemistry 3alanthanides 3ananowires 3aphosphates 3aphotoluminescence 3asolvents1 aGuo, Yanglong1 aLu, Guanzhong1 aRaston, Colin L.1 aIyer, K.

Chemical composition, physical properties, and biological properties were measured at 0–6 and 6–12cm soil depths over four years. Weed coverage and biomass were also measured. Terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses determined soil bacterial and fungal community compositions. Mulch with infrequent herbicide application provided effective weed control in IFP, and increased soil organic matter, pH, nutrient availability, microbial biomass C, and microbial respiration. Mechanical cultivation and chicken manure compost were used for OFP, which increased soil porosity, decreased aggregate stability, and increased potentially mineralizable and total inorganic N. Under OFP, cultivation suppressed weeds for 2–4 week intervals, but overall weed coverage was greater than under IFP. For most measurements, minimal treatment differences were found at 6–12cm soil depth. Sampling time influenced bacterial communities more than the treatments but by the final sampling dates, fungal communities in the 0–6cm depth segregated by treatment. Soil quality did not improve as much in OFP as in the IFP system soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aintegrated agricultural systems 3aapples 3asoil depth 3aorchards 3aweed control 3anitrogen content 3aporosity 3aproduction technology 3asoil analysis 3aMalus domestica 3asoil pH 3acomposted manure 3aorganic production 3acommunity structure 3asoil organic matter 3asoil quality 3apoultry manure 3arootstocks 3aweeds 3afruit growing 3asoil fungi 3apesticide application 3anutrient availability 3amicrobial biomass 3aaggregate stability 3aNew York 0asoil1 aMerwin, Ian A.1 aThies, Janice,1 aSchindelbeck, Robert R.1 aBrown, Michael G.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2011 May, v. 48, no. 1 p.18-30dElsevier B.V.x0929-13937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008800124300001600212500016800228520114200396650001701538650001201555650001401567650002301581650001301604651001001617700001601627700001501643700001601658700001901674773007201693939003301765852000901798655001201807IND9200307320221120150452.0920117e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920030732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeoni, S.14aThe influence of four rootstocks on some melon hybrids and a cultivar in greenhouse  ap. 127-134.  aPaper presented at the "Second International Symposium on Protected Cultivation of Vegetables in Mild Winter Climates," October 29-November 3, 1989, Crete, Greece.  aThree melon hybrids (PACIO, SYMPHONY, PAQUITO) and a cultivar (SUPERMARKET) were tested on four rootstocks resistant to Fusarium: RS 841--ACCENT--BANETTO--KAGO. The test was carried out in south Sardinia in a steel and plastic unsterilized glasshouse, which had already been submitted to four consecutive melon growing cycles. The plants were grown vertically on plastic nets. Harvesting started on 3 May and ended on 17 July 1988. The effect of the rootstocks was very significant. There was a sharp increased in yield with PACIO X RS 841 (+310% versus the control). The other cases also presented a significant yield increase: PAQUITO (+65%), SYMPHONY (+62%) SUPERMARKET (+52%), all X RS 841. The highest unit production and mean weight were obtained with RS 841, which yielded 12.013 Kg/m2 in combination X PACIO. With PAQUITO, RS 841 yielded 10.623 Kg/m2 while the respective control value was 6.855 Kg/m2. An influence on the growth rate of branches and on the early maturity rate of the crop was observed. The rootstock affected the form of the crop, the size of the placental cavity and the thickness of both mesocarp and esocarp. 3aCucumis melo 3ahybrids 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3aFusarium 3aItaly1 aGrudina, R.1 aCadinu, M.1 aMadeddu, B.1 aCarletti, M.G.0 tActa horticulturae.g1991 May, , no. 287 p.127-134x0567-75727nnas  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245013800132300001600270520114200286650001501428650002001443650002201463653003101485700002201516700002301538700002801561700002201589773009901611852000901710930003301719945001301752946001101765655001201776IND2038997620221120140111.0940421s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203899762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia-Ciudad, A.10aApplication of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy to chemical analysis of heterogeneous and botanically complex grassland samples  ap. 419-426.  aThe potential of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) for determining the chemical composition of heterogeneous, botanically complex semi-natural grassland herbage was assessed. Samples were collected over four consecutive years at different maturation stages and were analysed by chemical and NIRS procedures for crude protein, neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), acid detergent lignin and cellulose. A subset of samples was selected on the basis of spectral features in order to establish calibration equations, while the other samples were used for validation. The wavelengths selected by using multiple regression were similar to others previously reported. The ranges of correlation coefficients and standard errors of prediction, respectively, for the various components when NIRS and chemical procedures were compared were as follows: protein, 0.93-0.95 and 0.57-0.70; NDF, 0.92-0.93 and 2.06-2.37; ADF, 0.85-0.87 and 1.42-1.56; lignin, 0.90-0.94 and 0.45-0.59; cellulose, 0.82-0.86 and 1.27-1.45.

The one-dimensional hydrodynamic model CanalMan was used to assess water saving in a secondary canal. Different operational scenarios were evaluated in comparison with the existing operational strategy. This included the operation of the canal at different discharges combined with night closure, in periods of low demand. Time-discharge hydrographs were prepared using the numerical model for operation of canals having daily opening and closing with full supply, 80 and 70% of design discharge. These hydrographs were used to estimate possible time duration of canal operation for these discharges in the case of night closure. Water saving by night closure was compared with that from operation having weekly rotations.Study of the existing operational practices indicated extremely high oversupply to the canal compared with crop water requirements, especially in the months of August, November and December. Significant water saving was found by night closure and operating the canal at reduced discharges. 3airrigation canals 3airrigation water 3amathematical models 3awater requirement 3ahydrodynamics 3airrigation requirement 3ahydrologic models 3acrops 3aPakistan 0awater saving 0ademand 0aCanalMan model 0anight closure 0asecondary irrigation canals 0airrigation management1 aGhumman, Abdul Razzaq0 tIrrigation and drainage.g2008 Oct., v. 57, no. 4 p.400-410dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1531-03537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ird.3753Available from publisher's Web site  a20110601b20110603c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/10/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03151naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002000179245007700199300001800276500002400294506007600318520107700394506003701471650001301508650000801521650001201529650001601541650003001557650001001587650003501597650002501632650002401657650001801681650002601699650003501725650004101760650002201801650002801823650002901851651001701880651001001897651001001907700001901917700001301936700001701949700002001966700002601986700002402012700002102036700001902057700001602076700002102092700001602113700002302129700002002152700002202172700002102194700001702215700001802232773011602250852000902366856007802375655001202453IND4413155320221207134623.0081128e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441315532DNAL7 a190368422pmid7 aPMC26390262pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ern2602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRusso, Ethan B.10aPhytochemical and genetic analyses of ancient cannabis from Central Asia  ap. 4171-4182.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Yanghai Tombs near Turpan, Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region, China have recently been excavated to reveal the 2700-year-old grave of a Caucasoid shaman whose accoutrements included a large cache of cannabis, superbly preserved by climatic and burial conditions. A multidisciplinary international team demonstrated through botanical examination, phytochemical investigation, and genetic deoxyribonucleic acid analysis by polymerase chain reaction that this material contained tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component of cannabis, its oxidative degradation product, cannabinol, other metabolites, and its synthetic enzyme, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase, as well as a novel genetic variant with two single nucleotide polymorphisms. The cannabis was presumably employed by this culture as a medicinal or psychoactive agent, or an aid to divination. To our knowledge, these investigations provide the oldest documentation of cannabis as a pharmacologically active agent, and contribute to the medical and archaeological record of this pre-Silk Road culture.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCannabis 3aDNA 3aenzymes 3ametabolites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aroads 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atetrahydrocannabinol 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCannabidiolxanalysis 2aCannabisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 3aCentral Asia 3aChina 0aChina1 aJiang, Hong-En1 aLi, Xiao1 aSutton, Alan1 aCarboni, Andrea1 adel Bianco, Francesca1 aMandolino, Giuseppe1 aPotter, David J.1 aZhao, You-Xing1 aBera, Subir1 aZhang, Yong-Bing1 aLü, En-Guo1 aFerguson, David K.1 aHueber, Francis1 aZhao, Liang-Cheng1 aLiu, Chang-Jiang1 aWang, Yufei.1 aLi, Cheng-Sen0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2008 Nov., v. 59, no. 15 p.4171-4182dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ern2603Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02804naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001400186245006800200300001600268506007600284520142000360506003701780650001001817650002801827650001001855650002201865650001501887650001501902650001101917650000901928650000901937650002801946650000901974650001501983700001701998700002002015700003102035700002602066773010202092852000902194856008502203930003302288946001302321655001202334IND4410728120221207134621.0080926e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441072812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-008-9122-02doi7 aPMC33750512pmcid7 a187878982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSa, Qila 10aQuantitative trait locus analysis for hemostasis and thrombosis  ap. 406-412.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSusceptibility to thrombosis varies in human populations as well as many in inbred mouse strains. The objective of this study was to characterize the genetic control of thrombotic risk on three chromosomes. Previously, utilizing a tail-bleeding/rebleeding assay as a surrogate of hemostasis and thrombosis function, three mouse chromosome substitution strains (CSS) (B6-Chr5A/J, Chr11A/J , Chr17A/J) were identified (Hmtb1, Hmtb2, Hmtb3). The tail-bleeding/rebleeding assay is widely used and distinguishes mice with genetic defects in blood clot formation or dissolution. In the present study, quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis revealed a significant locus for rebleeding (clot stability) time (time between cessation of initial bleeding and start of the second bleeding) on chromosome 5, suggestive loci for bleeding time (time between start of bleeding and cessation of bleeding) also on chromosomes 5, and two suggestive loci for clot stability on chromosome 17 and one on chromosome 11. The three CSS and the parent A/J had elevated clot stability time. There was no interaction of genes on chromosome 11 with genes on chromosome 5 or chromosome 17. On chromosome 17, twenty-three candidate genes were identified in synteny with previously identified loci for thrombotic risk on human chromosome 18. Thus, we have identified new QTLs and candidate genes not previously known to influence thrombotic risk.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood 3achromosome substitution 3agenes 3agenetic disorders 3ahemorrhage 3ahemostasis 3ahumans 3aloci 3amice 3aquantitative trait loci 3arisk 3athrombosis1 aHart, Erika 1 aHill, Annie E. 1 aNadeau, J.

However, how these phenotypic abnormalities develop with variations remains elusive. We hypothesize that the differences in euploid gene expression variation among trisomy 21 tissues are caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 and may contribute to the phenotypic variations in Down syndrome. We used DNA microarray to measure the differences in gene expression variance between four human trisomy 21 and six euploid amniocytes. The three publicly available data sets of fetal brains, adult brains, and fetal hearts were also analyzed. The numbers of euploid genes with greater variance were significantly higher in all four kinds of trisomy 21 tissues (p < 0.01) than in the corresponding euploid tissues. Seventeen euploid genes with significantly different variance between trisomy 21 and euploid amniocytes were found using the F test. In summary, there is a set of euploid genes that shows greater variance of expression in human trisomy 21 tissues than in euploid tissues. This change may contribute to producing the variable phenotypic abnormalities observed in Down syndrome. 3aDNA microarrays 3aDown syndrome 3aadults 3achromosomes 3adata collection 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3apolyploidy 3atissues 3atrisomics 3avariance1 aLiu, Li Yu 1 aChen, Chien Yu 1 aTsai, Cheng Hsien 1 aHwa, Hsiao Lin 1 aZhang, Liyun.1 aLin, Yi Shing 1 aHsieh, Fon Jou 0 tMammalian genome.g2008 June, v. 19, no. 6 p.398-405dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-008-9121-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080926b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03265naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001900163245011300182300001600295500002400311500001500335520195800350650001802308650001402326650002402340650002402364650001802388650001802406650002302424653002302447653002802470653001602498700001802514700001902532773011702551852000902668856008502677930003302762945002502795946001102820655001202831IND4410715020221117181207.0080926e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441071502DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-008-9433-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF4001 aCorredoira, E.10aThidiazuron-induced high-frequency plant regeneration from leaf explants of Paulownia tomentosa mature trees  ap. 197-208.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAttempts were made to study the effect of thidiazuron (TDZ) on adventitious shoot induction and plant development in Paulownia tomentosa explants derived from mature trees. Media with different concentrations of TDZ in combination with an auxin were used to induce adventitious shoot-buds in two explant types: basal leaf halves with the petiole attached (leaf explant) and intact petioles. Optimal shoot regeneration was obtained in leaf explants cultured on induction medium containing TDZ (22.7 or 27.3 μM) in combination with 2.9 μM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) for 2 weeks, and subsequent culture in TDZ-free shoot development medium including 0.44 μM BA for a further 4-week period. The addition of IAA to the TDZ induction medium enhanced the shoot-forming capacity of explants. The caulogenic response varied significantly with the position of the explant along the shoot axis. The highest regeneration potential (85-87%) and shoot number (up to 17.6 shoots/explant) were obtained in leaf explants harvested from the most apical node exhibiting unfolded leaves (node 1). An analogous trend was also observed in intact petiole explants, although shoot regeneration ability was considerably lower, with values ranging from 15% for petioles isolated from node 1 to 5% for those of nodes 2 and 3. Shoot formation capacity was influenced by the genotype, with regeneration frequencies ranging from 50% to 70%. It was possible to root elongated shoots (20 mm) in basal medium without growth regulators; however, rooting frequency was significantly increased up to 90% by a 7-day treatment with 0.5 μM indole-3-butyric acid, regardless of the previous culture period in shoot development medium (4 or 8 weeks). Shoot quality of rooted plantlets was improved not only by IBA treatment but also by using material derived from the 4-week culture period. Regenerated plantlets were successfully acclimatized in the greenhouse 8 weeks after transplanting. 3adose response 3aplantlets 3aadventitious shoots 3aPaulownia tomentosa 3amature plants 3aculture media 3aindole acetic acid 0aplant regeneration 0aplant growth substances 0athidiazuron1 aBallester, A.1 aVieitez, A.

Its habitat, severely affected by urban, industrial, and agricultural land use, is highly vulnerable, and makes of S. sennenii, a seriously endangered taxon. Its pollination ecology is studied and compared among populations. Flowers of S. sennenii are distinguished by several morphological and physiological characters, including night emission of scent, which are related to nocturnal pollination. Although visited by insects at night and during day, selective insect exclusion experiments show that this plant is pollinated mainly at night. However, differences among populations are observed in visitation rates and reproductive success, which indicates that the system composed by the plant and its pollinators show evidences of disruption in some populations. The causes and consequences of this disruption are analyzed, with a focus on differences in population size, habitat quality, and genetic diversity. The results are discussed from the perspective of the vulnerability of established mutualisms, and the consequences for the survival of the species. 3aSilene 3aagricultural land 3aflowers 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3ainsects 3aland use 3amutualism 3aodors 3apollination 3apollinators 3apopulation size 3aIberian Peninsula 0aPollination ecology 0aMutualism disruption 0aNocturnal pollination 0aConservation1 aDötterl, Stefan 1 aBlanché, Cèsar 1 aRovira, Ana 1 aMassó, Sergi 1 aBosch, Maria 0 tPlant ecology.g2010 Nov., v. 211, no. 1 p.203-218dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-010-9785-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02676naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001500163245012700178300001600305500002400321520124600345650002101591650002001612650001801632650001401650650001901664650002401683650002301707650001501730650001801745650001301763650001701776650002601793650002001819650002201839700001701861700001501878700002101893773011701914852000902031856008502040930003302125945002502158946001102183655001202194IND4410715220221117181203.0080926e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441071522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-008-9435-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF4001 aPintos, B.10aSynthetic seed production from encapsulated somatic embryos of cork oak (Quercus suber L.) and automated growth monitoring  ap. 217-225.  aIncludes references  aCork oak (Quercus suber) somatic embryos were coated with alginate for the production of synthetic seeds and their storability for commercialization was investigated. Also, the automatic monitoring of somatic embryo growth with a digital system of image capture was tested. A power regression model was fitted between size and fresh weight (Adjusted R-squared = 0.96). This method permitted growth assessment without contamination risk and opens the possibility of an automated control of culture growth for the future up scaling of plant production. Conversion rate of synthetic seeds was higher on medium supplemented with mineral nutrients than on medium without nutrients. Also, when the somatic embryos were coated without mineral nutrients added to the capsule, conversion rate was significantly lower. The addition of sucrose to the capsule had no significant effect on the conversion rate. No differences were recorded between 50 and 100 mM CaCl₂ for capsule complexation. Synthetic seeds were cold stored at 4°C for two months without significant loss of conversion capacity.

Cunn. ex G. Don to ectomycorrhizal inoculation  ap. 105-117.  aAustralian acacias like Acacia holosericea are excellent candidates for the revegetation of arid zones in Africa. Their high ability to develop multiple symbioses with soil microorganisms is crucial to their rapid development in adverse climatic and edaphic conditions. These symbioses include nitrogen fixation with rhizobia, vesicular arbuscular mycorrhization and ectomycorrhization. We set up an experiment to test the growth response of A. holosericea to ectomycorrhizal inoculation in 13 different soils from Senegal. After autoclaving the soil, the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse for four weeks. Plants were inoculated with Pisolithus albus strain IR100. The following parameters were measured: plant biomass, N, P, K and Ca foliar composition, spontaneous nodulation rate, and ectomycorrhizal colonization. Data were analyzed in light of the physical, chemical and total microbial characteristics of the soil. The results demonstrated a global promoting effect of P. albus inoculation on plant (shoot and root) growth and on foliar P and K, together with a depressive effect on N, while Ca rates were barely affected. Interestingly, spontaneous nodulation with putative water- or airborne rhizobia was stimulated after P. albus inoculation. However, these nodules seemed poorly effective, as they failed to cause any change in plant growth or in foliar N composition within the nodulated and nonnodulated control plants. These results show that plant growth response to ectomycorrhizal inoculation is greatly dependent on soil characteristics, and that root ectomycorrhizal colonization is influenced by biotic factors such as soil microbiota. From a practical point of view, data from the present study demonstrate that it is possible to optimize the effect of fungi on plant growth by screening soils under nursery conditions. 3aAcacia holosericea 3aPisolithus 3aarid zones 3aautoclaving 3abiomass 3acalcium 3aectomycorrhizae 3aedaphic factors 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3aland restoration 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3aroots 3ascreening 3ashoots 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3aSenegal 0aAustralian Acacia 0aRhizobia 0aSoil characteristics1 aKisa, Marija 1 aPrin, Yves 1 aDucousso, Marc 1 aPlenchette, Christian 1 aLepage, Michel 1 aGaliana, Antoine 0 tNew forests.g2008 Mar., v. 35, no. 2 p.105-117dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0169-42867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-007-9066-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20080203b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02901naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144100001600153245004800169300001600217500002400233520175400257650002202011650002902033650001502062650002302077650001202100650002202112653002002134653002402154653001802178700002102196700001502217773010602232852000902338856007502347930003302422945002502455946001102480655001202491IND4410760720221117181216.0080926e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441076072DNAL7 a10.1002/ird.3782doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP210 0aJ2001 aNasseri, A.10aEffectual components on furrow infiltration  ap. 481-489.  aIncludes references  aDesign, management and evaluation of furrow irrigation depend on how well infiltration characteristics are identified. Furrow infiltration varies with different variables, and modelling of such phenomena is a complex process at field scale. This research was conducted to quantify the contributions of opportunity time (τ), water flow depth (Dg), initial soil water content (θi), flow section area (A) and wetted perimeter (Wp), as independent variables, on cumulative infiltration (CI) variations using path analysis method; and to develop empirical relationships between field-wide furrow infiltration and independent variables. Path analysis was used with the aim of scrutinizing direct (DT) and indirect (IDT) effects of five exogenous variables, namely τ, Dg, θi, A and Wp on the endogenous variable of CI. Furrow infiltration was measured by blocked furrow infiltrometers at 56 infiltration sites over a 70 x 130 m field plot. The furrow cross-sections were taken using a profilometer, whereas flow section area and wetted perimeter were graphically determined from measured cross-sections. Initial soil water content was obtained by means of the gravimetric method, with drying by the burning alcohol technique in the field. Results revealed that total effects of τ, Dg, θi, A and Wp on furrow infiltration were 0.790, 0.370, -0.359, 0.349 and 0.301; and DT effects of those variables were 92.4, 12.16, 36.50, 42.12 and 14.95% of their total effects, respectively. Consequently, the τ, θi, and A were recognized as the effectual components on the field-wide furrow infiltration, on the basis of the largest direct effects of the variables. Total and the DT effects of Wp on CI were relatively diminutive compared with other variables. 3afurrow irrigation 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3awater flow 3asoil water content 3afurrows 3ahydrologic models 0ablocked furrows 0afurrow infiltration 0apath analysis1 aNeyshabori, M.R.1 aAbbasi, F.0 tIrrigation and drainage.g2008 Oct., v. 57, no. 4 p.481-489dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1531-03537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ird.3783Available from publisher's Web site  a20110601b20110603c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/10/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02608naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002400163245010100187300001600288500002400304500001500328520112400343650001701467650001201484650001401496650001101510650002401521650002101545650001201566650001801578650002701596650002101623650001801644650001501662650002301677653002601700653002801726700001901754700002301773700002601796773011701822852000901939856008501948930003302033945002502066946001102091655001202102IND4410715420140724000000.0080926e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441071542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-008-9423-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF400 0aF6001 aGonçalves, Sandra.13aAn efficient in vitro propagation protocol for Pinguicula lusitanica, a rare insectivorous plant  ap. 239-243.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, an efficient protocol was developed for in vitro propagation of Pinguicula lusitanica L., a rare insectivorous plant with pharmacological value and limited reproductive capacity. The effects of two concentrations (0.1 and 0.5 mg l⁻¹) of a range of plant growth regulators, including cytokinins (BA, KIN, and ZEA) and auxins (IAA, IBA, and NAA), and three concentrations of MS medium macronutrients (total, 1/2 and 1/4MS) on proliferation and rooting, were investigated. P. lusitanica shoots showed abundant proliferation and rooting capacity, both of which were significantly influenced by MS medium strength. The use of 1/2MS supplemented with 0.5 mg l⁻¹ BA or KIN ensure a 29-fold rate of proliferation. Best rooting frequency and higher root number and length were attained in 1/4MS medium containing 0.2 mg l⁻¹ IAA. Sixty percent of the plantlets were successfully acclimatized to ex vitro conditions, exhibiting normal development. These plantlets can be used to replenish declining populations in the wild and/or for the extraction of bioactive compounds, reducing pressure on wild stocks. 3ainsectivores 3akinetin 3aplantlets 3azeatin 3aindole butyric acid 3amedicinal plants 3arooting 3abenzyladenine 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3amicropropagation 3aculture media 3aPinguicula 3aindole acetic acid 0aPinguicula lusitanica 0aplant growth substances1 aEscapa, Ana L.1 aGrevenstuk, Tomás1 aRomano, A.q(Anabela)0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2008 Nov., v. 95, no. 2 p.239-243dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-008-9423-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20110520b20110603c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/02/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03071naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245009300173300001600266500017100282520144400453650001201897650002201909650001001931650001501941650001201956650001201968650001801980650001901998650001902017650001702036650002502053650001102078651001002089700001902099700002002118700001602138700001802154700002102172700001802193700001702211700001502228700001502243700001502258700002002273700002102293700001902314773014402333856005502477852000902532655001202541IND60567428420221117160247.0170421e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056742842DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1141.352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNur Azlina, R.10aSimulation studies for export of minimally processed durian by air shipment to Hong Kong  ap. 283-288.  aPaper presented at the III International Conference on Fresh-Cut Produce: Maintaining Quality and Safety held September 13-18 2015, Davis CA, United States of America  aA simulation study for export of minimally processed durian by air shipment to Hong Kong was conducted using newly dropped 'Mousang King' durian. Two packing systems were evaluated, using (A) square polypropylene (PP) containers (110×110 mm) with seal packing at 200 g pack-1 and (B) rectangular PP containers (185×125 mm) with shrink wrapping at 400 g pack-1. All samples were stored at -18°C for 5 weeks. Following that, samples were transferred to 2°C for 7 days to simulate retail conditions in Hong Kong. Physical changes (colour and visual appearance), chemical changes (total soluble solids) and sensory acceptance were observed daily. Microbial counts (yeasts and moulds, total coliforms, mesophilic aerobes) were also monitored to relate to product safety. Minimally processed durian in both packing systems (A and B) maintained its quality until the end of the 7 days of storage, as noted by only slight variations in chemical and physical data. However, there were significant differences in microbial counts, as minimally processed durian packed in square PP containers with seal packing (A) showed lowered counts of microbial aerobes as compared with packing using shrink wrap (B). Total coliforms, yeasts and moulds also showed similar findings. Thus, the results revealed that the smaller packing system using seal packing was more suitable for packing minimally processed durian for export by air shipment to Hong Kong. 3aaerobes 3acoliform bacteria 3acolor 3acontainers 3adurians 3aexports 3amolds (fungi) 3apolypropylenes 3aproduct safety 3astorage time 3atotal soluble solids 3ayeasts 3aChina1 aLatifah, M.

Both the effects of total ammonium nitrogen (TAN) fluxes and the algal densities on MAA accumulation were investigated. MAAs increased with the TAN flux, but only until values lower than 100 μM/h. Above this flux, the MAA content decreased, whereas algal yield increased. The content of individual MAAs was related to nitrogen (N) status, that is, shinorine percentage slightly decreased and palythine increased with increasing N fluxes. The decrease of MAAs at high flux of N (up to 100 μM/h) is related to the decrease of water residence time and the decrease of the biofiltration efficiency. Under different TAN fluxes and algal densities, MAA content was negatively related to algal yield indicating that MAAs were accumulated only under a high ammonium-N availability. Thus, an energy allocation between growth (primary metabolism) and MAA accumulation (secondary metabolism) is regulated by the absorption capacity of inorganic N. In conclusion, A. armata, in addition to its high biofiltration capacity of nutrients, is a good source of MAAs as potential UV screen photoprotectors. 3afish culture 3aeffluents 3aammonium nitrogen 3awater quality 3abream 3aaquatic plant culture 3aalgae 3aabsorption 3aaquaculture tanks 3ayields 3aplant density 3asecondary metabolites 3aamino acids 3aSparus aurata 3abiofiltration 3aultraviolet radiation 3aAsparagopsis 3afish ponds 3aprotective effect 0amycosporine 0aalgae and seaweeds 0ashinorine 0apalythine 0aAsparagopsis armata1 aBueno, Agustín1 aKorbee, Nathalie1 aSantos, Rui1 aMata, Leonardo1 aSchuenhoff, Andreas0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2008 Oct., v. 39, no. 5 p.692-699dBlackwell Publishing Incx0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2008.00199.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110616b20110701c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/08/04  aOther US 7aarticle02440naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010700128300001600235500015200251500002400403520114300427650003501570650001301605650001601618650001001634650001201644650001401656650002401670650002501694650001701719650001501736650002401751650001201775700001601787700001601803773014001819852000901959856008601968655001202054IND4462141520221123024119.0111027s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446214152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobsson, A.10aInfluence of packaging material and storage temperature on the texture, colour, and weight of broccoli  ap. 323-326.  aPaper presented at the Eighth International Controlled Atmosphere Research Conference, Volume 1,  held July 8-13, 2001, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.  aIncludes references  aSophisticated packaging solutions can be used in order to preserve vegetables during storage and transport. Polymeric films with selective barriers matching the respiration of the produce, thereby creating an ideal atmosphere inside the package, are available on the market. Fresh broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica ‘Monterey’) heads were packed in 4 different commercially available polymeric films, and stored at 4 and 10°C respectively. During storage the weight, colour, chlorophyll content and texture were monitored. The investigated polymer materials were oriented polypropylene (OPP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and two types of polyethylene (PE) packagings. The choice of packaging material had an impact on the measured quality parameters of broccoli. Storage in OPP resulted in the longest storage life. Broccoli stored in PVC film deteriorated faster than broccoli packaged in the other materials. It was also observed that the influence of the type of packaging material was more important at the higher temperature. The implications of this work for the packaging and storage of fresh broccoli will be discussed. 3aBrassica oleracea var. italica 3abroccoli 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3amarkets 3apackaging 3apackaging materials 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolyethylene 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3atexture1 aNielsen, T.1 aSjoholm, I.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Mar., , no. 600 p.323-326dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/600/600_45.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02761naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245016600131300001800297500002400315520162500339650001801964650002501982650001502007650001202022650000902034650001202043650001402055650001902069650001402088650002502102650002302127650000902150700001902159700001502178700001202193773017302205852000902378655001202387IND4365712320221123024151.0041119e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436571232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDijkhuizen, M.A.10aZinc plusβ-carotene supplementation of pregnant women is superior to β-carotene supplementation alone in improving vitamin A status in both mothers and infants  ap. 1299-1307.  aIncludes references  aBackground: Deficiencies of vitamin A, iron, and zinc are prevalent in women and infants in developing countries. Supplementation during pregnancy can benefit mother and infant. Objective: We examined whether supplementation during pregnancy with iron and folic acid plus beta-carotene or zinc or both improves the micronutrient status of mothers and infants postpartum. Design: Pregnant women (n = 170) were supplemented daily only during pregnancy with beta-carotene (4.5 mg), zinc (30 mg), or both or placebo plus iron (30 mg) and folic acid (0.4 mg) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Micronutrient status was assessed 1 and 6 mo postpartum. Results: Six months postpartum, plasma retinol concentrations were higher in the women who received zinc during pregnancy than in women who did not. Infants born to mothers supplemented with beta-carotene + zinc had higher plasma retinol concentrations, with the frequency of vitamin A deficiency reduced by >30% compared with the other 3 groups. Breast-milk beta-carotene concentrations were higher in all women supplemented with beta-carotene, but breast-milk retinol concentrations were higher only in women who received beta-carotene + zinc. Zinc concentrations did not differ among groups in mothers and infants. Conclusions: Zinc supplementation during pregnancy improved the vitamin A status of mothers and infants postpartum, which indicates a specific role of zinc in vitamin A metabolism. Addition of both beta-carotene and zinc to iron supplements during pregnancy could be effective in improving the vitamin A status of mothers and infants. 3abeta-carotene 3adeveloping countries 3afolic acid 3ainfants 3airon 3amothers 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3avitamin A 3avitamin deficiencies 3avitamin metabolism 3azinc1 aWieringa, F.T.1 aWest, C.E.1 aMuhilal0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 Nov., v. 80, no. 5 p.1299-1307dThe American Society for Nutrition, with the assistance of Highwire Pressx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245007000172300001600242500017100258520145400429650002501883650001801908650001801926650001901944650001701963650001001980650001201990650001302002650002202015650001302037650001902050650002802069650001102097650001302108650001902121650001502140650001702155650002302172650001302195650002502208650001002233700001802243700001602261700001802277700001802295700001502313700001702328773014402345856005502489852000902544655001202553IND60567427120221123012341.0170421e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056742712DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1141.232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiuffrida, F.10aShelf-life of fresh-cut tomato in relation to cut and fruit types  ap. 199-206.  aPaper presented at the III International Conference on Fresh-Cut Produce: Maintaining Quality and Safety held September 13-18 2015, Davis CA, United States of America  aThree typologies of tomato (round 'Ventero', ribbed 'Marmalindo', elongated 'Sir Elyan') were minimally processed in slices or wedges and packaged in polypropylene trays (500 g each). Slices (7 mm thick) were obtained by cutting fruits perpendicularly to the main axis. For wedges, fruits were divided into 4 or 8 parts (depend on fruit diameter). Initially (day 0), and after 3, 6 and 9 days of storage at 5°C, quality attributes (microbial load, colour, pericarp firmness, soluble solids, titratable acidity, dry matter, antioxidant activity, content of vitamin C, lycopene and β-carotene) were evaluated. Concentrations of CO2 and O2 in the trays were also measured. Oxygen concentration decreased dramatically in the ribbed tomato trays after 3 days of storage. The reduction of O2 during storage was higher for wedges compared to slices and started before on elongated tomato type compared to round tomatoes. For maintaining a good microbiological quality during cold storage, cutting in slices or wedges should be opportunely suited to tomato type. Firmness was lower (12.8%) in the slices of elongated tomato compared to the wedges, whereas no differences were found in ribbed and round tomatoes. Lycopene content decreased in round tomato slices compared to wedges (about 16%), no differences were observed in ribbed and elongated tomatoes. A vitamin C reduction (26%) was observed in the elongated tomato cut in slices compared to wedges. 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abeta-carotene 3acarbon dioxide 3acold storage 3acolor 3acutting 3afirmness 3afresh-cut produce 3alycopene 3amicrobial load 3amicrobiological quality 3aoxygen 3apericarp 3apolypropylenes 3ashelf life 3astorage time 3atitratable acidity 3atomatoes 3atotal soluble solids 3atrays1 aCassaniti, C.1 aInserra, L.1 aMalvuccio, A.1 aRestuccia, C.1 aPatane, C.1 aLeonardi, C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 Oct. 1, , no. 1141 p.199-206dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1141.23  aDNAL 7aarticle01419naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245011800171300001800289520043900307650002700746650000800773650001000781650002000791650002500811700002400836700002000860773013000880852000901010856008501019946001301104655001201117IND4443721820221123012304.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444372182DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954101000302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaydzhafarova, A.

Two storage tests were conducted using garlic cloves ('California Late') that were peeled and packaged commercially. In Test #1 (MAP bags of 454 g), O2 concentrations averaged 15, 10 and 5% at 0, 5 and 10°C, respectively; the corresponding CO2 concentrations averaged 8, 15 and 23%. In Test #2 with small vacuum packed bags (30 g) inside larger master packages (170 g), atmospheres in the former averaged 1.5-3% O2 and 20-30% CO2 at all storage temperatures (0, 2.5, 5 and 7.5°C), while the master bags averaged 20-21% O2 and 0.5-0.8% CO2. In both tests, discoloration occurred in areas damaged during mechanical peeling, and was associated with lower L* and increased chroma values. In Test #1, decay was a significant contributor to loss of quality. In Test #1 excellent visual quality was maintained during 21 and 16 d at 0 and 5°C, respectively, and acceptable quality was maintained for about 10 d at 10°C. In Test #2, very good visual quality was maintained up to 28 d at 0 and 2.5°C, and acceptable quality was maintained for 21 d at 5 and 7.5°C. No important changes in texture were observed due to temperature or storage time. Pungency (thiosulfinate and pyruvate concentrations) decreased with time and the decrease was greater at higher storage temperatures. A reasonable expected storage-life of commercially peeled and modified atmosphere packaged garlic is 3-4 weeks at 0°C, 2-3 weeks at 5°C and 1-2 weeks at 10°C. 3abags 3acarbon dioxide 3adiscoloration 3afood service 3agarlic 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3aoxygen 3apeeling 3apyruvic acid 3aretail marketing 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3atexture 3avacuum packaging 3aCalifornia1 aHong, G.1 aCantwell, M.

In 1999 and 2000, pear trees were sprayed with B several times starting 2 months before harvest in order to study the effect of preharvest B sprays on fruit minerals (Ca, Mg, K, P, B), vitamin C, and the subsequent incidence of brown heart in pear fruits stored under -0.5°C, 2% O2 + 5% CO2. The results of the first year showed that up to 60% of the control fruits were affected with brown heart after 4 months storage. On the other hand, the B treated fruits remained completely healthy till the end of the storage period. There were no differences in Ca, Mg, K, P uptake, but a more than 10 fold B-uptake between the control and B-treated fruits. In contrast to the first year, the effect of B application on the prevention of brown heart was less effective in the second year. Simultaneously the B uptake was much lower, only the half of the first year. This could be partially an explanation for the reduced effectiveness of boron in 2000. 3aascorbic acid 3aboron 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3afruits 3aheart 3amagnesium 3aoxygen 3apears 3astorage time1 aStreif, J.1 aBangerth, F.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Mar., , no. 600 p.257-260dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/600/600_33.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02613naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245017300134300001600307500015200323500002400475520142300499650001101922650001901933650003401952650001401986650001102000650001702011700001902028700001702047773014002064852000902204856008602213655001202299IND4462140420221122235238.0111027s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446214042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan der Merwe, J.A.10aEffect of controlled atmosphere storage after initial low oxygen stress treatment on superficial scald development on South African-grown Granny Smith and Topred apples  ap. 261-265.  aPaper presented at the Eighth International Controlled Atmosphere Research Conference, Volume 1,  held July 8-13, 2001, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of two controlled atmosphere (CA) storage regimes and twelve CA storage periods following an initial low oxygen stress (ILOS) treatment on the development of superficial scald on ‘Topred’ and ‘Granny Smith’ apples was evaluated during two successive seasons. Apples harvested at pre-optimum and optimum maturity stages were stored for 7 days under simulated commercial conditions. Subsequently, fruit were exposed to ILOS conditions and then stored for 20 w and 12 w respectively at -0.5 °C in atmospheres containing 1.5% O2/1.5% CO2 or 1.5% O2/3.0% CO2 (Topred) and 1.5% O2/1.0% CO2 or 1.5% O2/3.0% CO2 (Granny Smith). The trial was repeated with fruit not exposed to a low O2 concentration and stored at regular atmosphere conditions at -0.5°C. Samples were evaluated at 2-week intervals. ILOS, without diphenylamine (DPA) treatment, followed immediately by CA storage, inhibited the development of superficial scald significantly on both cultivars after a CA storage period of between 8 w and 12 w for fruit picked at pre-optimum maturity and 2 w and 6 w for fruit picked at optimum maturity. CA storage regimes did not differ significantly in their effect on superficial scald development. Storage periods of longer than 14 w (Topred) and 16 w (Granny Smith) (pre-optimum maturity) and 6 w (Topred and Granny Smith) (optimum maturity) inhibited the development of superficial scald completely. 3aapples 3acarbon dioxide 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3acultivars 3aoxygen 3astorage time1 aCombrink, J.C.1 aCalitz, F.J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Mar., , no. 600 p.261-265dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/600/600_34.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02900naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100001900188245008300207300001600290500002400306520123500330650003801565650001501603650001701618650001701635650002001652650002401672650002301696650001801719650002001737650002101757650002101778650001401799650001801813650001401831650001801845650001101863650001801874650002201892650001601914650002401930653002601954700002201980700002402002773012402026852000902150856009202159930003302251945002502284946001302309655001202322IND4410766320221122230309.0080929e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441076632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1749-7345.2008.00204.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM120 0aL500 0aL600 0aM0011 aAlam, Md.

Six isocaloric diets were formulated to contain varying levels of crude protein (CP) ranging from 36 to 56% (36, 40, 44, 48, 52, and 56%) by substituting a mixture of carbohydrates and lipid for fish meal. The feeding experiment was carried out in 18-75 L aquaria stocked at a density of 15 juveniles (initial average weight 6.7 g) per tank. Fish were fed test diets in triplicate tanks to apparent satiation twice a day for 8 wk. Whole-body proximate composition was analyzed after the feeding trial. After the feeding trial, weight gain and specific growth rate of fish fed the 44% CP diet were not significantly different from those fed the 48, 52, and 56% CP diets, but were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those fed the 36 and 40% CP diets. Feed conversion efficiency and protein efficiency ratio were significantly affected by dietary protein level. The dietary requirement of protein for maximum growth of black sea bass juveniles, estimated using broken-line regression analysis on weight gain, was 45.3% and maximum weight gain occurred at 52.6% based on polynomial regression analysis. 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3aSerranidae 3afish culture 3afish feeding 3adietary protein 3aprotein requirement 3aexperimental diets 3aanimal growth 3afeed conversion 3afeed composition 3abody composition 3ajuveniles 3acrude protein 3afish meal 3acarbohydrates 3alipids 3astocking rate 3aaquaculture tanks 3aweight gain 3aregression analysis 0aCentropristis striata1 aWatanabe, Wade O.1 aCarroll, Patrick M.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2008 Oct., v. 39, no. 5 p.656-663dBlackwell Publishing Incx0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2008.00204.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110601b20110603c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/08/04  aOther US 7aarticle02967naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179072000900188100002800197245019500225300001600420500002400436520122900460650002401689650001201713650001701725650001701742650001801759650001901777650002001796650002701816650002001843650001601863650002001879650001401899650001101913650002201924650001601946650001601962650002501978700002602003700002502029700002402054700002702078773012402105852000902229856009202238930003302330945002502363946001302388655001202401IND4410766420140724000000.0080929e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441076642DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1749-7345.2008.00195.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM120 0aL810 0aL500 0aL600 0aM0011 aSanchez-Martínez, J.G.12aA Preliminary Study on the Effects on Growth, Condition, and Feeding Indexes in Channel Catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, after the Prophylactic Use of Potassium Permanganate and Oxytetracycline  ap. 664-670.  aIncludes references  aThe prophylactic use of potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) and oxytetracycline and its effects on catfish growth were assessed. For eleven weeks, healthy channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, juveniles were exposed to KMnO₄ and oxytetracycline. KMnO₄-treated fish were exposed to 1 ppm twice a week for 1 h, while oxytetracycline-treated fish received a 50 mg/kg dose in the feed (35 fish per tank, two tanks per treatment). Assessed parameters included body weight and length, specific growth rate (SGR), feed intake (FI), condition, and feed conversion index (FCI). Potassium permanganate did not have a suppressive effect on growth, while oxytetracycline significantly enhanced growth on channel catfish (weight and length), as they were heavier (12.5%) than KMnO₄-treated fish and controls at the end of the trial. SGR (%/d), FI, and FCI were not significantly different (P > 0.05) among the three groups of fish. Condition index (K) was significantly higher (ANOVA, P < 0.05) in the oxytetracycline-treated fish. The present study suggests that, at concentrations commonly used in aquaculture, exposure of healthy channel catfish to oxytetracycline enhanced growth, while KMnO₄ does not induce growth suppression. 3aIctalurus punctatus 3acatfish 3afish culture 3afish feeding 3aanimal growth 3abody condition 3adisease control 3apotassium permanganate 3aoxytetracycline 3afeed intake 3afeed conversion 3ajuveniles 3adosage 3aaquaculture tanks 3abody weight 3abody length 3aanalysis of variance1 aPérez-Castañeda, R.1 aRábago-Castro, J.L.1 aAguirre-Guzmán, G.1 aVázquez-Sauceda, M.L.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2008 Oct., v. 39, no. 5 p.664-670dBlackwell Publishing Incx0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2008.00195.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110601b20110603c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/08/04  aOther US 7aarticle02124naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245007200165300001800237520096700255650001101222650001701233650002201250650002301272650001401295650001301309650002001322650001201342650001601354650001201370650001401382650002601396700002101422700001301443773013001456852000901586856008501595939003301680946001301713655001201726IND4443721620221122220637.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444372162DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954101000172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvanitskaya, E.10aChromosomes in a hybrid zone of Israeli mole rat (Spalax, Radentia)  ap. 1149-1151.  aChromosomal novelties and the level of meiotic and mitotic abnormalities were studied in a hybrid zone between two chromosomally differentiated Spalax cytotypes of 2n = 58 and 2n = 52. These cytotypes differ by five Rb fusions, four centromeric shifts accompanied by heterochromatin deletion, one paracentric inversion, and the Y-chromosome reorganization. Among 149 specimens studied, 82 were hybrids with 64 different karyotypes ranging in diploid numbers from 2n = 50 to 2n = 60. Nine hybrid specimens were mosaics for the chromosome numbers due to occurrence of cell lines with different Robertsonian chromosome arrangements, and six specimens possessed variable number of B-chromosomes. Mosaicism of B-chromosomes was found also in meiotic cells however chromatid breaks and abnormal chromosome pairing during meiosis occurred very rarely. All these results imply some local genomic instability resulting in the spontaneous process of reversible Rb fusions. 3aSpalax 3aY chromosome 3achromosome number 3achromosome pairing 3acytotypes 3adiploidy 3aheterochromatin 3ahybrids 3akaryotyping 3ameiosis 3amole rats 3aparacentric inversion1 aRashkovetsky, L.1 aNevo, E.0 tRussian journal of genetics.g2010 Oct., v. 46, no. 10 p.1149-1151dDordrecht : SP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodicax1022-79547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10227954101000173Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111104  aOther US 7aarticle01813naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007000125300001800195520102300213650002601236650001401262650000901276653001101285653002801296700001601324700002001340700001701360773007901377852000901456939003301465946001301498655001201511IND9203718820221122051759.0920611e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920371882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, I.S.10aApportioning histidine requirements for maintenance versus growth  ap. 1451-1463.  aPurified diets containing six levels of histidine were fed to growing rats to evaluate histidine requirements for growth and for maintenance. A model was developed to subdivide the requirement for maintenance from the requirement for growth. Based on weight gain response, the histidine need for growth was 4.02 mg/g weight gain and the daily histidine need for maintenance was .130 times metabolic body size (Wg.75). Based on nitrogen gain response, the histidine need for growth was .168 mg/mg N gain and the daily histidine need for maintenance (mg) was .137 times metabolic body size (Wg.75). The plateau of plasma histidine concentration was reached at 22 mg intake/day. Previous histidine requirements for growth (for less than 5 g daily weight gain or 120 mg daily N retention) and for maintenance were in very close agreement with these estimates. As a percentage of retained protein, according to theses equations, histidine was calculated to be 2.7%; the reported histidine content of rat muscle CP is 2.85%. 3anutrient requirements 3ahistidine 3arats 0agrowth 0amaintenance requirement1 aOwens, F.N.1 aPettigrew, J.E.1 aOltjen, J.W.0 tNutrition research.g1991 Dec., v. 11, no. 12 p.1451-1463x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02608naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245019700169300001600366520117900382650001901561650001701580650001401597650001101611650002401622650002401646650002201670650001401692650001701706650001201723650001101735650002001746650001001766650001401776653001501790653001401805700001801819700001601837700001601853700001201869773011201881852000901993856009202002930003302094946001102127655001202138IND4407661320221122051621.0080712e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440766132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2008.01499.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNibouche, S.10aAssessment of the resistance of cotton germplasm (Gossypium spp.) to aphids (Homoptera, Aphididae) and leafhoppers (Homoptera: Cicadellidae, Typhlocybinae): methodology and genetic variability  ap. 376-382.  aWe carried out an assessment of the resistance of 71 accessions of cotton (Gossypium spp. L.) to the aphid Aphis gossypii and to leafhoppers under natural infestation. Our objectives were (i) to improve the methods for screening cotton germplasm for resistance to both pests, and (ii) to test the existence of genetic correlation between resistances to both insects. For both insects, the percentage of colonized leaves exhibited high genotypic correlation with the number of insects per leaf, had similar or higher heritabilities, and appeared as the better measure of insect populations. The one-plant-per-plot experimental design used allowed an assessment of resistance with high heritability value, and proved to be suitable for the screening of cotton germplasm. G. arboreum was more resistant to both insects than G. barbadense and G. hirsutum. While hairiness had a significant negative effect on resistance to aphids, no significant effect was observed on resistance to leafhoppers, excepted in G. arboreum. The lack of genotypic correlation between resistance to aphids and to leafhoppers demonstrated that a simultaneous improvement of the resistance is possible. 3aAphis gossypii 3aCicadellidae 3aGossypium 3acotton 3aexperimental design 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aheritability 3ainsects 3aleaves 3apest resistance 3apests 3ascreening 0aresistance 0ahairiness1 aBrévault, T.1 aKlassou, C.1 aDessauw, D.1 aHau, B.0 tPlant breeding.g2008 Aug., v. 127, no. 4 p.376-382dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2008.01499.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080712b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03360naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245011700168300001400285500001500299520167200314650002601986650001602012650002202028650001302050650002202063650002802085650005202113650001602165650002002181650002902201650001002230650001902240650002502259650001802284650001302302650001702315653003002332653003102362653001002393653001802403653001202421653003002433700002602463700002302489700002102512700002002533773011502553852000902668856008502677930003302762946001102795655001202806IND4402206120221122035334.0080302e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440220612DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-005-0031-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYakovlev, Igor A. 10aAnalysis of gene expression during bud burst initiation in Norway spruce via ESTs from subtracted cDNA libraries  ap. 39-52.  a2019-12-04  aWe have made and partially sequenced two subtracted cDNA libraries, one representing genes predominantly expressed in a tree from an early-flushing family of Norway spruce (early-flushing library; EFL) and the second from a late flushing family (late flushing library; LFL), during 4 weeks before bud burst. In the EFL, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) encoding proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus and energy metabolism and proteins related to stress (abiotic and biotic) and senescence were abundant. ESTs encoding metallothionein-like and histone proteins as well as transcription factors were abundant in the LFL. We used quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to study the expression patterns of 25 chosen genes and observed that the highest levels of activity for most genes were present when plants were still ecodormant. The results indicate that the late flushing is not a result of a delay in gene activity, but is rather associated with an active transcriptional process. Accordingly, certain metabolic processes may be turned on in order to prevent premature flushing. We discuss the putative role of the studied genes in regulation of bud burst timing. Among the candidate genes found, the most interesting ones were the DNA-binding proteins, water-stress-related genes and metallothioneins. Expression patterns of some genes involved in chemical modification of DNA and histones indicate that epigenetic factors are involved in the timing of bud burst. In the obtained transcriptomes, we could not find genes commonly believed to be involved in dormancy and bud set regulation (PHY, CRY, ABI etc.) in angiosperm plants. 3atranscription factors 3aepigenetics 3acomplementary DNA 3ahistones 3aenergy metabolism 3aexpressed sequence tags 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aPicea abies 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3atrees 3acDNA libraries 3aDNA-binding proteins 3atranscriptome 3adormancy 3aAngiospermae 0aBud burst adaptive traits 0aContrasting-flushing trees 0agenes 0aMagnoliophyta 0aqRT-PCR 0aSubtracted cDNA libraries1 aFossdal, Carl-Gunnar 1 aJohnsen, Øystein 1 aJunttila, Olavi 1 aSkrøppa, Tore 0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2006 Feb., v. 2, no. 1 p.39-52dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1614-29427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-005-0031-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080302b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01169naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245006600166300001600232520014000248650001400388650001700402653002700419653002500446653002200471700001900493700002400512700002700536773014000563852000900703856008500712930003300797946001300830655001200843IND4443727920221122035501.0101015e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444372792DNAL7 a10.1134/S10681620100501462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorozova, N.

The complex data matrix (744 observations), obtained by the determination of major inorganic analytes (Cl⁻, NO₃ ⁻, SO₄ ²⁻, NH₄ ⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺) in water samples by ion chromatography was treated by linear discriminant analysis and non-parametrical testing. In case of both streams obtained results indicate presence of two discriminant functions (DFs). The data variance explained by DFs is as follows: Black Vistula stream--first DF: 93.5%, second DF: 6.5%; White Vistula stream--first DF: 66.3%, second DF: 33.7%. In case of Black Vistula stream first DF allows distinction of medium, high and low waterstage related samples while second DF between high/low and medium water stage related samples. In case of White Vistula stream first DF allowed to distinguish between medium/high and low water stage related samples while second DF between medium and high water level samples. In case of both streams, the most informative DFs were related to geological conditions of investigated catchments (contents of Cl⁻, Na⁺, K⁺, Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺, SO₄ ²⁻), while the second to nutrient biocycle (mainly NH₄ ⁺ and NO₃ ⁻) related to slope's exposition and inclination. 3awater pollution 3aforested watersheds 3achemical analysis 3asurface water level 3astreams 3aseasonal variation 3ahydrogeology 3ahydrochemistry 3aPoland 0aslope1 aMałek, Stanisław1 aMakowska, Sylwia0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2008 Nov., v. 195, no. 1-4 p.137-149dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-008-9733-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20081125b20081206c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/11/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03836naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245005100186300001600237520179100253650002302044650001302067650001802080650002002098650002102118650002402139650002402163650001402187650001202201650001002213650001402223650001402237650000802251650001402259650002202273650001502295650002402310650001502334650000902349650001202358650001002370650001002380650000902390650002202399650001902421650007102440650001102511650002202522650001102544650000902555650001402564650002602578650003202604650002302636650005602659651001102715653001902726653001202745700002402757700002702781700003502808773012102843852000902964856008502973930003303058946001103091655001203102IND4405802920221122035421.0080516e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440580292DNAL7 a184147682pmid7 a10.1007/s00394-008-0706-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrzozowska, Anna 10aSupplement use and mortality: the SENECA study  ap. 131-137.  aBackground It is hypothesis that in relatively healthy older people supplement usage can be consider as healthy life style habit and as such can positively influence longevity. Aim of the study To determine whether supplement use was associated with all-cause mortality in the participants of the SENECA study. Methods Baseline measurements were carried out in 1988/1989 among 75 to 80-year-old people living in 15 European small towns. All-cause mortality was followed up to April 30, 1999. Data from 920 men and 980 women who were ischemic heart diseases-, stroke- and cancer-free at baseline were included. The multivariate adjusted (for sex, age, years of education, physical activity, BMI, chronic diseases, Mediterranean Diet Score, alcohol use and the place of living) hazard ratio (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mortality by use of any type of nutrient supplement and by particular nutrient supplement use were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results At baseline, 13% of participants used nutritional supplements, 19% of subjects were smokers. During 10 years of follow-up 445 men and 252 women died. Among non-smokers no significant associations between total supplement use and particular nutrient supplement use were observed. Among smokers use of any type of supplements (Multivariate HR: 1.52; 95%CI: 1.02-2.28), use of vitamin B₁ (Multivariate HR: 1.57; 95%CI: 1.00-2.48) and vitamin B₂ supplements (Multivariate HR: 1.60; 95%CI: 1.00-2.56) were associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality. The similar tendencies were observed among vitamin B₆ and vitamin C supplement users who were smokers. Conclusions Among smokers, participants of the SENECA study, supplement use increased all-cause mortality risk. 3aMediterranean diet 3aalcohols 3aascorbic acid 3abody mass index 3achronic diseases 3aconfidence interval 3adietary supplements 3aeducation 3aelderly 3aheart 3alifestyle 3alongevity 3amen 3amortality 3aphysical activity 3apyridoxine 3aregression analysis 3ariboflavin 3arisk 3athiamin 3atowns 3awomen 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCause of Death 2aDietary Supplementsxadverse effectsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMortality 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aSmokingxmortality 2aVitaminsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 0aEurope 0asupplement use 0asmoking1 aKaluza, Joanna PhD 1 aKnoops, Kim T.

Here we present a metabolic engineering example for the development of a Clostridium cellulolyticum strain for isobutanol synthesis directly from cellulose. This strategy exploits the host's natural cellulolytic activity and the amino acid biosynthesis pathway and diverts its 2-keto acid intermediates toward alcohol synthesis. Specifically, we have demonstrated the first production of isobutanol to approximately 660 mg/liter from crystalline cellulose by using this microorganism.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium cellulolyticum 3aalcohols 3aamino acids 3abiofuels 3abioprocessing 3abiosynthesis 3acellulose 3aengineering 3afermentation 3ahosts 3amicroorganisms1 aLi, Yongchao1 aYang, Yunfeng1 aLiao, James C.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 77, no. 8 p.2727-2733dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02454-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02386naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001900163245010300182300001600285500002400301520099000325650001101315650002701326650001201353650001801365650002001383650001301403650001501416650002101431650002001452650001801472650002301490650002101513651001001534653002701544700001701571700002201588700001801610773011301628852000901741856008501750930003301835945002501868946001101893655001201904IND4410708920140724000000.0080926e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441070892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-008-9739-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF8411 aDevesa-Rey, R.10aFractionation and Bioavailability of Arsenic in the Bed Sediments of the Anllóns River (NW Spain)  ap. 189-199.  aIncludes references  aThe arsenic bioavailability in the bed sediments from the Anllóns River (NW Spain) has been assessed by using several analytical approaches. A six-step sequential fractionation was compared to three general availability tests: the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) extraction, which estimates the leaching potential of As and its effect on the survival of microorganisms (Vibrio fischeri), an extraction with 1 M HCl extraction, which estimates the bioavailability to higher plants, and a physiologically based extraction test (PBET), which estimates the bioavailability to superior animals. Arsenic was found to be mainly associated to the least mobile fractions: bound to Fe-Al oxides and in the residual phase. Among the three single extractants considered, the PBET extracted the highest As concentrations (1-11% of the total As). The TCLP extracts showed toxicity to Vibrio fischeri whereas for the plants evaluated, aqueous extracts did not show adverse effects. 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3aarsenic 3afractionation 3abioavailability 3aleaching 3aextraction 3atoxicity testing 3aVibrio fischeri 3aphytotoxicity 3aLolium multiflorum 3aLepidium sativum 3aSpain 0aNasturtium officinalis1 aParadelo, R.1 aDíaz-Fierros, F.1 aBarral, M.

Somatic embryos were induced by culturing hypocotyl segments from 14-day-old in vitro grown C. acuminata seedlings in TIS. Hypocotyl segments were placed in culture vessels modified with a mechanical device to support the fixation of explants. Cultures were maintained under a 16 h photoperiod with a light intensity of 60 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ PPF at 25 ± 1°C. After 16 weeks of incubation embryogenic calli were formed above the edge of the mechanical device in the basal Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 35 g l⁻¹ sucrose and without hormonal supplementation. For plantlet regeneration, somatic embryos at cotyledonary stage were cultured in three different concentrations of 6-benzylamino-purine (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg l⁻¹ BAP) and in plant growth regulator (PGR) free medium. In general, 0.5 mg l⁻¹ BAP was found to be the most effective concentration for growth and development of Camptotheca embryos in TIS. Conversion of somatic embryos into plantlets was also successfully achieved on sterile substrates moistened with 0.5 mg l⁻¹ BAP. Plantlets derived from cotyledonary embryos were rooted in vitro with 0.5 mg l⁻¹ indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) before transfer to ex vitro conditions. 3asomatic embryogenesis 3aCamptotheca acuminata 3acallus culture 3amicropropagation 3ahypocotyls 3aculture media 3abenzyladenine 3aplantlets 3arooting 3aindole butyric acid 0aplant regeneration1 aSaare-Surminski, Katja1 aLieberei, Reinhard0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2008 Nov., v. 95, no. 2 p.163-173dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-008-9428-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20110520b20110603c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/02/27  aNon-US 7aarticle01798naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010700169300001600276520076500292650001901057650001101076650001901087650002401106650001101130650002901141650001101170700002501181773012801206852000901334856008501343930003301428946001101461655001201472IND4410726620221121234639.0080926e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441072662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-008-9191-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllerman, A.

A Preliminary Analysis of the EU ETS Based on the 2005-06 Emissions Data  ap. 267-287.  aThis paper provides an initial analysis of the EU ETS based on the installation-level data for verified emissions and allowance allocations in the first 2 years of the first trading period. These data reveal that CO₂ emissions were about 3% lower than the allocated allowances. The main objective of the paper is to shed light on the extent to which over-allocation and abatement have taken place in 2005 and 2006, when a significant CO₂ price was observed. We propose a measure by which over-allocation can be judged and provide estimates of abatement based on emissions data and indicators of economic activity as well as trends in energy and carbon intensity. Finally, we discuss the insights and implications that emerge from this tentative assessment. 3aEuropean Union 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic indicators 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aprices1 aBuchner, Barbara K. 0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2008 Oct., v. 41, no. 2 p.267-287dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0924-64607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-008-9191-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080926b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01790naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245006800163300001600231520079100247650001901038650001101057650001601068650001101084650001301095650002101108650002501129653001401154700001801168773012801186852000901314856008501323930003301408946001101441655001201452IND4410726520221121234628.0080926e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441072652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-008-9190-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnsink, Erik 10aClimate Change and the Stability of Water Allocation Agreements  ap. 249-266.  aWe analyse agreements on river water allocation between riparian countries. Besides being efficient, water allocation agreements need to be stable in order to be effective in increasing the efficiency of water use. In this paper we assess the stability of water allocation agreements using a game theoretic model. We consider the effects of climate change and the choice of a sharing rule on stability. Our results show that a decrease in mean river flow decreases the stability of an agreement, while an increased variance can have a positive or a negative effect on stability. An agreement where the downstream country is allocated a fixed amount of water has the lowest stability compared to other sharing rules. These results hold for both constant and flexible non-water transfers. 3aclimate change 3amodels 3ariver water 3arivers 3avariance 3awater allocation 3awater use efficiency 0aStability1 aRuijs, Arjan 0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2008 Oct., v. 41, no. 2 p.249-266dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0924-64607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-008-9190-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20080926b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02296naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010100165300001600266520137500282650001201657650002201669650000901691650001401700700001801714700002001732773010201752852000901854856008501863930003301948946001301981655001201994IND4410727820221121223823.0080926e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441072782DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-008-9134-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorahan, Grant 10aEstablishment of “The Gene Mine”: a resource for rapid identification of complex trait genes  ap. 390-393.  aIdentification of genes underlying complex traits presents a challenge to which geneticists have responded with many diverse approaches. A common feature of these approaches is that different research groups must, on a case-by-case basis, replicate similar efforts in recruitment, genetic characterization, and analyses. To avoid this expensive “churning,” an alternative approach has been proposed: production of an experimental genetic reference population, the Collaborative Cross, in which both genetic diversity and mapping power are maximized. Since this population consists of inbred mouse strains, further advantages are that it is essentially infinitely reproducible; genetic characterization needs to be performed only once; and the founder strains' genomes have been or will be sequenced, allowing imputation of allele sequences of all members of the reference population. Here we describe the establishment of such a genetic reference population, which we dub “The Gene Mine.” Over 1000 genetically distinct lines have been established, descended from eight diverse founder strains. Preliminary phenotypic ascertainment of these strains indicates unexpected variability arising from independent assortment of genetic variants. The Gene Mine will be a powerful resource for characterization of essentially any mouse phenotype that has a genetic basis. 3aalleles 3agenetic variation 3amice 3aphenotype1 aBalmer, Lois 1 aMonley, Donald 0 tMammalian genome.g2008 June, v. 19, no. 6 p.390-393dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-008-9134-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20080926b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02442naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245012500185300001600310520090500326650002801231650002401259650001201283650001301295650001201308650001201320650001001332650001201342650001201354650002701366650002101393650002501414650001101439650001801450650001801468650002301486650001901509650000901528650002601537650002701563653002501590700001501615700002101630773012801651852000901779856009201788930003301880946001101913655001201924IND4401248620221121223702.0080210e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440124862DNAL7 a181942312pmid7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01486.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNOLTE, V.14aThe impact of shared ancestral variation on hybrid male lethality - a 16 codon indel in the Drosophila simulans Lhr gene  ap. 551-555.  aThe Lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) gene causes hybrid male lethality in crosses between Drosophila simulans and D. melanogaster. Lhr² is a D. simulans allele, which rescues hybrid males. It has been recently proposed that a 16 codon insertion, which distinguishes the D. melanogaster and the canonical D. simulans allele, and is lacking in Lhr², may be responsible for the functional divergence of D. melanogaster and D. simulans Lhr alleles. Here, we show that the Lhr² allele lacking the insertion represents an ancestral polymorphism segregating at a moderate frequency in D. simulans. Crosses of D. melanogaster females to males from two D. simulans strains carrying this deletion showed a severe deficiency of viable hybrid males. Our results suggest that the absence of this insertion alone is not sufficient to explain functional differences between D. melanogaster and D. simulans Lhr alleles. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aDrosophila simulans 3aalleles 3acrossing 3afemales 3ahybrids 3amales 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Segregation 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDrosophilaxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenes, Insect 2aGenes, Lethal 2aGenetic Speciation 2aINDEL Mutation 2aMale 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aLethal hybrid rescue1 aWeigel, D.1 aSCHLÖTTERER, C.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2008 Mar., v. 21, no. 2 p.551-555dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01486.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04002naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245012800188300001600316520248400332650001702816650002302833650002902856650002502885650003602910650001502946650001502961650001402976650001702990650001203007650002803019650003803047650001203085651001403097651001403111653004203125653004003167653002403207653001903231700002003250773011003270852000903380856008503389930003303474946001303507655001203520IND4401539020221121175224.0080217e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440153902DNAL7 a180267842pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-007-9039-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamarakoon, Miriya 12aA Critical Review of Environmental Impact Statements in Sri Lanka with Particular Reference to Ecological Impact Assessment  ap. 441-460.  aThis article critically reviews environmental assessment (EA) practices in Sri Lanka, with a particular focus on ecology. An overview is provided of the domestic and international influences which have shaped the administrative process which is currently a two-tiered scheme. An Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) provides a preliminary screening tool, prior to the requirement for a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). A comprehensive survey of Sri Lankan national archives showed that 463 EAs were completed in the period 1981-2005, with the bulk of these in the more populated Western and North Western Provinces. Two-thirds were IEE surveys, while the remaining third advanced to full EIA. A representative sample of 130 EAs (both IEEs and full EIAs) spanning a broad range of project types, scales, and environmental settings was selected to evaluate the quality of the ecological investigations within the published environmental impact statements (EISs). These were assigned into five classes of “explanatory power”, on the basis of their scientific content in relation to survey, analysis, and reporting of ecological interests. Within most EISs, the ecological impact assessment (EcIA) was restricted to the lowest two categories of ecological assessment, i.e., tokenistic presentation of reconnaissance-level species lists without further analysis of the development implications for individual organisms or communities. None of the assessments reviewed provided statistically rigorous analysis, which would be required if ecological impact studies are to include quantitative and testable predictions of impact, which could then be followed up by appropriate post-impact monitoring programs. Attention to key local issues such as biodiversity or ecosystem services, which also have strong social dimensions in the developing world, was also notably underrepresented. It was thus concluded that despite the existence of a sound legislative framework in Sri Lanka, the analysis contained within EISs generally fails to convey meaningful information to the relevant stakeholders and decision makers involved in protecting ecological interests and promoting sustainable development. The introduction of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is considered an important tool to strengthen the institutional capacity of Sri Lankan government to implement current regulations and, in particular, to combat the cumulative effects of incremental development. 3abiodiversity 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental impact statements 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3ascreening 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3asustainable development 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcology 3aSri Lanka 0aSri Lanka 0aEnvironmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 0aEcological Impact Assessment (EcIA) 0aDevelopment control 0aProject review1 aRowan, John S. 0 tEnvironmental management.g2008 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.441-460dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-007-9039-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20080218b20080301c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02528naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245012100174300001800295500001500313520101800328650003101346650001901377650002701396650003001423650001701453650000901470650001101479650001401490650002101504650001501525650001201540653001201552653003601564653001301600653001901613700001901632700001701651700001701668700001601685700002401701700001801725700001501743773011901758852000901877856009201886930003301978946001102011655001202022IND4405176720221121175207.0080502e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440517672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01558.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHOVENDEN, MARK J.10aWarming prevents the elevated CO₂-induced reduction in available soil nitrogen in a temperate, perennial grassland  ap. 1018-1024.  a2019-12-04  aRising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO₂]) has the potential to stimulate ecosystem productivity and sink strength, reducing the effects of carbon (C) emissions on climate. In terrestrial ecosystems, increasing [CO₂] can reduce soil nitrogen (N) availability to plants, preventing the stimulation of ecosystem C assimilation; a process known as progressive N limitation. Using ion exchange membranes to assess the availability of dissolved organic N, ammonium and nitrate, we found that CO₂ enrichment in an Australian, temperate, perennial grassland did not increase plant productivity, but did reduce soil N availability, mostly by reducing nitrate availability. Importantly, the addition of 2 °C warming prevented this effect while warming without CO₂ enrichment did not significantly affect N availability. These findings indicate that warming could play an important role in the impact of [CO₂] on ecosystem N cycling, potentially overturning CO₂-induced effects in some ecosystems. 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3acarbon dioxide 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aion exchange 3asoil 3acarbon 3aemissions 3aammonium nitrate 3agrasslands 3aclimate 0awarming 0aprogressive nitrogen limitation 0anitrogen 0aelevated CO₂1 aNEWTON, P.C.D.1 aCARRAN, R.A.1 aTHEOBALD, P.1 aWILLS, K.E.1 aVANDER SCHOOR, J.K.1 aWilliams, Al.1 aOSANAI, Y.0 tGlobal change biology.g2008 May, v. 14, no. 5 p.1018-1024dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01558.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080502b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02284naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245005700174300001800231520130700249653002301556653002701579653001601606653002401622700002101646700002401667700002301691773011801714852000901832856008501841930003301926946001101959655001201970IND4400971120221121131208.0080203e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440097112DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-005-1323-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUribe-Etxebarria, Gorka 10aRock cut stability assessment in mountainous regions  ap. 1002-1013.  aEnsuring stability of rock slopes is an essential requirement in the progress of our societies today. Rock determined to be loose or with potential for failure must be removed or restrained in some way. In our work, after doing an inventory of the instabilities that occurred in the last 5 years in the Basque Country, we analyse the different factors, in slope stability. The potential for failure is evaluated for different classes of rock mass, characterized previously by their geomechanical properties. The characterization of potential risk of each one is undertaken by considering 10 parameters that define the nature of mass rock, relative orientation and morphological features of the slope (interaction rock massif-slope) and infrastructure features (interaction rock massif-slope-infrastructure). Each of these parameters is evaluated separately and a Risk Factor (RF) is determined. The RF reaches a maximum value of 10,000 and allows to differentiate four categories of slopes; each category has its own priority. Rock mass characteristics also determine the potential damage from instability and the associated correction measures. The systematic evaluation of instabilities must allow establishing a priority in the correction measures and thus optimise the available economic resources. 0aRock cut stability 0aLinear infrastructures 0aRisk Factor 0aMountainous regions1 aMorales, Tomás.1 aUriarte, Jesús A. 1 aIbarra, Valentín.0 tEnvironmental geology.g2005 Oct., v. 48, no. 8 p.1002-1013dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-005-1323-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080203b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02798naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011800165300001400283520149900297650001801796650001401814650001001828650001201838650001201850650001801862650002601880650001601906650004701922650001301969651002801982651001202010653001002022653002502032700002002057700001502077700001802092773011602110852000902226856008502235930003302320946001102353655001202364IND4404752720221121131144.0080421e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440475272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-007-0547-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRepplinger, M. 10aMorphological and molecular evidence for hybridization and introgression in Central European Arctium (Asteraceae)  ap. 75-95.  aThree species of burdock (Arctium lappa, A. tomentosum, and A. minus; Asteraceae), which commonly occur in sympatry in Central Europe, are thought to hybridize frequently, hence raising questions about their integrity. We surveyed mixed, monotypic, and/or single plant stands of these species in Central Germany to assess their extent of hybridization and introgression, and also the likelihood of insect host shifts between them. Individual plants were characterized by multivariate analyses of morphological and RAPD variation in combination with RAPD-based character-index-scores. All analyses recognized the three species as distinct units, but also identified a limited number of first (or early) generation hybrids between sympatric A. lappa and either A. tomentosum or A. minus, respectively, as well as one introgressant of A. tomentosum into A. lappa. While pre-zygotic isolation may partly account for the rarity of first generation crosses (F₁'s), the near absence of later generation hybrid segregants or introgressants likely reflects post-zygotic isolation due to the disruption of co-adapted gene complexes and/or habitat-mediated superiority shared by the ruderal parentals. As the tephritid fly Tephritis bardanae oviposits on both A. tomentosum (T) and A. minus (M), but not on A. lappa (L), the occurrence of L x M and L x T hybrids and/or introgressants may have important evolutionary consequences regarding the acquisition of a new host, i.e. A. lappa, by these insects. 3aArctium lappa 3aTephritis 3agenes 3ahybrids 3ainsects 3aintrogression 3amultivariate analysis 3aoviposition 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3asympatry 3aCentral European region 3aGermany 0aRAPDs 0aTephritis host shift1 aJohannesen, J. 1 aSeitz, A. 1 aComes, H.

Currently, there is a controversy concerning the identity of diagnostic characters for distinguishing palaeospinacid genera because of very similar dental morphologies and the scarcity of articulated skeletal material. The most notable character for distinguishing species within the Palaeospinacidae is, however, the dental morphology. The main dental character uniting all palaeospinacids is the very specialised pseudopolyaulacorhize root vascularisation. A re-examination of articulated neoselachian skeletons from the Lower Jurassic of Lyme Regis (England) and Holzmaden (S Germany), and recently discovered specimens from the Upper Jurassic of the Solnhofen area and Nusplingen (S Germany) has yielded several hitherto unrecognised complete skeletons of the palaeospinacids Synechodus and Paraorthacodus enabling a re-evaluation of characters. These specimens indicate that the number of dorsal fins and the presence or absence of dorsal fin spines represent important features for identifying palaeospinacids. Synechodus bears two dorsal fins without fin spines, whereas Paraorthacodus only has a single dorsal fin lacking a fin spine directly in front of the caudal fin. All palaeospinacids from the Early Jurassic have two spines supporting the dorsal fins and are consequently assigned to a new genus, Palidiplospinax nov. gen. Three species are placed into the new taxon: Synechodus enniskilleni, S. occultidens and S. smithwoodwardi. 3aChondrichthyes 3afins 3anew genus 3asharks 2aAnimals 2aDentition 2aPaleontology 2aSharksxanatomy & histology 2aSpinexanatomy & histology 2aToothxanatomy & histology 3aEngland 3aGermany 0aEngland 0aPalaeospinacidae 0aPalidiplospinax nov. gen1 aKriwet, Jürgen 0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2008 May, v. 95, no. 5 p.443-448dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-007-0341-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20080421b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03390naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002600154245012000180300001600300500017100316520176400487650003602251650002002287650001602307650002402323650001802347650000902365650001202374650001902386650002302405650001602428650002202444650001602466650002802482650001702510650001602527650001902543650002202562650002302584650002302607650001702630700002302647700003002670773014402700856005502844852000902899655001202908IND60567429120170801000000.0170421e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056742912DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1141.422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValencia-Chamorro, S.10aEffects of chemical compounds and hot water on quality of fresh-cut white cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata)  ap. 335-342.  aPaper presented at the III International Conference on Fresh-Cut Produce: Maintaining Quality and Safety held September 13-18 2015, Davis CA, United States of America  aThe effects of the addition of chemical compounds classified as 'generally recognized as safe' (GRAS), and hot water, on fresh-cut cabbage were studied. Strips were prepared from cabbages and treated with solutions of acetic acid (AT) (0.15%, w/w), ascorbic acid (AA) (0.2%, w/w) and citric acid (0.5%, w/w) in combination, potassium sorbate (SP) (0.2%, w/w), and water as a control (C). Treated samples were packed in polypropylene (PP) bags and stored at 4°C for 12 days. Physical, chemical, microbiological, and sensory analyses were performed. Samples treated with the ascorbic-citric acid combination exhibited lower browning index (BI), lower microbial contamination and better sensory attributes than the other samples. In another experiment, this chemical treatment was compared with samples immersed in hot water. Cabbage strips were treated with the ascorbic-citric acid combination, dipped in hot water (60°C, 2 min), and dipped in water at ambient temperature as a control; these were packed in PP and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, and stored at 4°C for 12 days. Samples with the hot-water treatment showed a weight loss of less than 0.2%, and lower carbon dioxide accumulation inside the bags than other samples. In this treatment, total polyphenol content was reduced by around 15.5% compared with the initial sample (363 mg 100 g-1 as % gallic acid equivalents); however, ΔE was the highest. The ascorbic-citric acid combination treatment showed a weight loss of less than 0.5%. This treatment maintained the microbiological and sensory quality of samples during the storage time. Total polyphenol content was increased by 8.2%. Thus, the ascorbic-citric acid combination treatment may be an alternative for fresh-cut white cabbage. 3aBrassica oleracea var. capitata 3aGRAS substances 3aacetic acid 3aambient temperature 3aascorbic acid 3abags 3acabbage 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical treatment 3acitric acid 3afresh-cut produce 3agallic acid 3amicrobial contamination 3apolyethylene 3apolyphenols 3apolypropylenes 3apotassium sorbate 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3astorage time1 aTapia-Penafiel, C.1 aSotomayor-Grijalva, M.

EOD waveform variation can provide important clues to sympatric species boundaries between otherwise similar or morphologically cryptic forms. Endemic to the watersheds of Gabon (Central Africa), Ivindomyrus marchei and Ivindomyrus opdenboschi are morphologically similar to one another. Using morphometric, electrophysiological and molecular characters [cytochrome b sequences and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotypes], we investigated to what extent these nominal mormyrid species have diverged into biological species. Our sampling covered the known distribution of each species with a focus on the Ivindo River, where the two taxa co-occur. An overall pattern of congruence among datasets suggests that I. opdenboschi and I. marchei are mostly distinct. Electric signal analysis showed that EODs of I. opdenboschi tend to have a smaller initial head-positive peak than those of I. marchei, and they often possess a small third waveform peak that is typically absent in EODs of I. marchei. Analysis of sympatric I. opdenboschi and I. marchei populations revealed slight, but significant, genetic partitioning between populations based on AFLP data (FST [almost equal to] 0.04). Taken separately, however, none of the characters we evaluated allowed us to discriminate two completely distinct or monophyletic groups. Lack of robust separation on the basis of any single character set may be a consequence of incomplete lineage sorting due to recent ancestry and/or introgressive hybridization. Incongruence between genetic datasets in one individual, which exhibited a mitochondrial haplotype characteristic of I. marchei but nevertheless fell within a genetic cluster of I. opdenboschi based on AFLP genotypes, suggests that a low level of recent hybridization may also be contributing to patterns of character variation in sympatry. Nevertheless, despite less than perfect separability based on any one dataset and inconclusive evidence for complete reproductive isolation between them in the Ivindo River, we find sufficient evidence to support the existence of two distinctive species, I. opdenboschi and I. marchei, even if not 'biological species' in the Mayrian sense. 3areproductive isolation 3aintrogression 0aelectric organ discharge 0aspeciation 0aelectric fish1 aSULLIVAN, J.P.1 aARNEGARD, M.E.1 aHOPKINS, C.D.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2008 July, v. 21, no. 4 p.1030-1045dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01544.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03040naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245009800206300001600304506007600320520157000396506003701966650004002003650001302043650000802056650002102064650001602085650001202101650000902113650002202122650001302144650001402157650001502171650001202186653001502198653001402213653000902227700002502236700002202261700002102283773010402304852000902408856008502417930003302502946001102535655001202546IND4400202320221207135132.0080120e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440020232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10453-007-9068-92doi7 aPMC70878412pmcid7 a322146232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Seung Won 10aEffects of humidity and other factors on the generation and sampling of a coronavirus aerosol  ap. 239-248.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSuspensions of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus, were nebulized at rates of 0.1-0.2 ml/min into moving air using a Collison nebulizer or a plastic medical nebulizer operating at pressures ranging from 7 to 15 psi. The airborne viruses were collected on heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) filters in an experimental apparatus and also sampled upstream of these test filters using AGI-30 and BioSampler impinger samplers. To study the effects of relative humidity (RH) on TGEV collection by the filters and samplers, the virus was nebulized into air at 30, 50, 70, and 90% RH. There were no significant changes in virus titer in the nebulizer suspension before and after nebulization for either nebulizer at any of the pressures utilized. Aerosolization efficiency - the ratio of viable virus sampled with impingers to the quantity of viable virus nebulized - decreased with increasing humidity. BioSamplers detected more airborne virus than AGI-30 samplers at all RH levels. This difference was statistically significant at 30 and 50% RH. Nebulizer type and pressure did not significantly affect the viability of the airborne virus. Virus recovery from test filters relative to the concentration of virus in the nebulizer suspension was less than 10%. The most and the least virus were recovered from filter media at 30% and 90% RH, respectively. The results suggest that TGEV, and perhaps other coronaviruses, remain viable longer in an airborne state and are sampled more effectively at low RH than at high humidity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTransmissible gastroenteritis virus 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair conditioning 3aatomization 3afilters 3aheat 3arelative humidity 3asamplers 3aviability 3aviral load 3aviruses 0aBioaerosol 0aNebulizer 0aTGEV1 aRamakrishnan, M.

Assortatively mating incipient species known as the M and S forms differentially exploit larval breeding sites associated with different ecological settings. However, some ongoing gene flow between M and S limits significant genomic differentiation mainly to small centromere-proximal regions on chromosomes X and 2L, termed 'speciation islands' with the expectation that they contain the genes responsible for reproductive isolation. As the speciation islands exhibit reduced recombination and low polymorphism, more detailed genetic analysis using fine-scale mapping is impractical. We measured global gene expression differences between M and S using oligonucleotide microarrays, with the goal of identifying candidate genes that could be involved in this ongoing speciation process. Gene expression profiles were examined in two independent colonies of both forms at each of three developmental periods of interest: fourth instar larvae, virgin females, and gravid females. Patterns were validated on a subset of genes using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of RNA samples from laboratory colonies and wild mosquitoes collected from Cameroon and Burkina Faso. Considered across all three developmental periods, differentially expressed genes represented ~1-2% of all expressed genes. Although disproportionately represented in the X speciation island, the vast majority of genes were located outside any speciation island. Compared to samples from the other developmental periods, virgin females were characterized by more than twice as many differentially expressed genes, most notably those implicated in olfaction and potentially, mate recognition.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aRNA 3aX chromosome 3abreeding sites 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene flow 3agenes 3agravid females 3ainstars 3aislands 3alarvae 3amalaria 3amicroarray technology 3aoligonucleotides 3areproductive isolation 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asmell 3avirgin females 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aLarvaxgenetics 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aRNAxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 3aBurkina Faso 3aCameroon 0aBurkina Faso 0aCameroon 0amalaria vector 0amicroarray 0areverse ecology1 aMOULINE, KARINE1 aHAHN, MATTHEW W.1 aWHITE, BRADLEY J.1 aPOMBI, MARCO1 aSimard, Frédéric.1 aCostantini, Carlo.1 aBESANSKY, NORA J.0 tMolecular ecology.g2008 May, v. 17, no. 10 p.2491-2504dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03774.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080502b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03133naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126072000900144072000900153100001900162245019300181300001600374500002400390500001500414520154800429650001601977650001401993650002702007650003002034650001402064650001302078650001202091650001302103650001402116650002202130650002002152650000702172650002002179650001202199650001802211650002402229650002002253653003502273653002102308700002002329773009202349852000902441856008402450930003302534945002502567946001102592655001202603IND4410890020221121034614.0081002e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441089002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2008.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aQ1241 aYoon, Mi Young10aReduction of soybean oligosaccharides and properties of α-d-galactosidase from Lactobacillus curvatus R08 and Leuconostoc mesenteriodes JK55 [Erratum: 2008 Dec., v. 25, issue 8, p. 1002.]  ap. 815-823.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study was undertaken to investigate the potential for reducing non-digestive oligosaccharides (NDO) in soy foods, as well as the influence of exogenous conditions on intracellular α-galactosidase (α-Gal) producing lactic acid bacteria. Two strains, Lactobacillus curvatus R08 and Leuconostoc mesenteriodes JK55, showed the highest levels of raffinose degrading activity at over 40 U mL-1, and presented maximum activities during the stationary phase in a medium where raffinose was the only carbon source. Raffinose was the most effective inducer, followed by melibiose, and galactose; the enzymes were partially inhibited by fructose and sucrose. On the other hand, limited activity was observed in glucose. The strains displayed optimum activity levels at neutral pH and a 35-37 °C temperature range. The α-Gal activities of L. curvatus R08 and Leu. mesenteriodes JK55 were maintained at pH 6.5-10.0. The activity of the α-Gal enzyme was stable in a relatively broad range of temperatures from 0 to 40 °C for 3 h. In soymilk, Leu. mesenteriodes JK55 and L. curvatus R08 completely hydrolyzed the NDO after 18-24 h of fermentation. The abilities of L. curvatus R08 and Leu. mesenteriodes JK55 to degrade raffinose sugars and, particularly, to produce organic acids from sugar, could contribute to reductions in the anti-nutritional properties of soy, and to the accumulation of compounds with beneficial properties during food processing. Furthermore, this study provides the optimum conditions to induce α-Gal from these strains. 3atemperature 3amelibiose 3aLactobacillus curvatus 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3agalactose 3afructose 3asucrose 3asoybeans 3araffinose 3aenzyme inhibition 3afood processing 3apH 3aenzyme kinetics 3asoymilk 3adigestibility 3aalpha-galactosidase 3aenzyme activity 0anon-digestive oligosaccharides 0aoligosaccharides1 aHwang, Han-Joon0 tFood microbiology.g2008 Sept., v. 25, no. 6 p.815-823dAcademic Pressx0740-00207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2008.04.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090423b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/11/13  aNon-US 7aarticle01882naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011600129300001600245520100600261650001001267650002401277650002301301650001601324650001401340650001101354650001601365700001501381700001601396773010101412852000901513939003301522946001301555655001201568IND9203720120221121013514.0920612e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920372012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoedeken, D.L.10aDesign and calibration of a continuous temperature measurement system in a microwave cavity by infrared imaging  ap. 331-337.  aA method for continuous measurement of surface temperature of food materials in a microwave oven during heating was developed The method involved using a standard 2450 MHz microwave oven modified to allow for continuous measurement of surface temperature of samples using an infrared (IR) imaging system. The oven was modified by removing the top section of the microwave cavity and replacing it with 1/8 in. square hardware cloth to allow for direct thermal imaging of the sample. It was found that the wire mesh interfered with the IR measurement such that the temperature that the IR system measured differed from the actual sample temperature. The difference was also found to be dependant upon wire screen temperature. To determine the relationship between IR temperature and actual sample temperature a calibration procedure was performed. The relation between actual temperature and temperature as measured by the IR was found to be linear and dependant upon the temperature of the wire screen. 3afoods 3amicrowave treatment 3athermal properties 3ameasurement 3aequipment 3adesign 3acalibration1 aTong, C.H.1 aLentz, R.R.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g1991 Dec., v. 15, no. 5 p.331-337x0145-88927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02177naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245016900162300001500331500002400346520099600370650002001366650001301386650001201399650001201411650002501423650001601448650001201464650002301476650001001499650002201509650001401531700002101545700001801566700001901584700002101603773009801624852000901722856004801731655001201779IND4422488820221120234412.0090626e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442248882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00049-009-0014-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGehlsen, Uta10aTerminal double bonds in the alkenes and acetates of defensive secretion from the thrips Suocerathrips linguis Mound & Marullo, 1994 (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae)  ap. 97-102.  aIncludes references  aDefensive secretions of adult males and females of the subsocial thrips Suocerathrips linguis were examined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The samples contained six long-chain acetates and five aliphatic alkanes and alkenes. Whole-body extracts yielded six methyl esters of fatty acids as well as hexadecyl acetate. Structures of the two main components, (11Z)-icosa-11,19-dienyl acetate and octadecyl acetate, were confirmed. The third most abundant substance was identified as octadec-17-enyl acetate, which is a new natural product. In addition, (9Z)-octadec-9-enyl acetate was identified along with other acetates. Pure icosadienyl acetate was found to remain liquid down to -15°C, and is the solvent for the solid components of the secretion cocktail. A tentative biosynthetic pathway for all of the 12 acetates, alkanes and alkenes is discussed, considering especially the components with terminal double bonds that are uncommon in Thysanoptera and other insects. 3aPhlaeothripidae 3aacetates 3aalkanes 3aalkenes 3adefensive secretions 3afatty acids 3afemales 3agas chromatography 3amales 3amass spectrometry 3asecretion1 aLindemann, Peter1 aRettig, Willi1 aMoritz, Gerald1 aTschuch, Gunther0 tChemoecology.g2009 July, v. 19, no. 2 p.97-102dSP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx0937-74097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00049-009-0014-x 7aarticle02285naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012400127300001600251520111700267650002301384650001701407650002501424650001101449650002501460650001801485650001401503650001901517650001001536650002301546650001101569650003201580650002001612650002301632650002501655653002401680700001701704773010101721852000901822939003301831946001101864655001201875IND9203724420221120234415.0920611e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920372442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicole, M.R.10aUltrastructural localization of chitin in cell walls of Rigidoporus lignosus, the white-rot fungus of rubber tree roots  ap. 415-431.  aThe distribution of N-acetylglucosamine residues in the cell wall of the white-rot pathogenic fungus, Rigidoporus lignosus, was studied by using gold labelled wheatgerm agglutinin bound to ovomucoid-colloidal gold. Ultrastructural investigation of R. lignosus-infected root tissues of Hevea brasiliensis showed a modification of the fungal cell wall throughout the infection process. Gold particles were found to occur on both thick- and thin-walled hyphae of R. lignosus rhizomorphs at the root surface. Walls of hyphae that had penetrated the roots were only labelled when they were out of the host cell, suggesting that modification of chitin molecules may be related to the excretion of host cell wall degrading enzymes. Variation in the distribution of gold particles was observed over hyphal walls of both colonized phellem and xylem cells. The observation that N-acetylglucosamine residues were released in the host cell cytoplasm suggests that lytic enzymes alter the fungal cell walls. Released chitin oligosaccharides may play a role in the induction of the root's defence system against fungal attack. 3aHevea brasiliensis 3apathogenesis 3aRigidoporus lignosus 3achitin 3aspatial distribution 3acytochemistry 3ainfection 3ahistopathology 3aroots 3acolonizing ability 3ahyphae 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aenzyme activity 3adefense mechanisms 3acell wall components 0acell ultrastructure1 aBenhamou, N.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g1991 Dec., v. 39, no. 6 p.415-431x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02387naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245007800180300001600258500002400274520098200298650001301280650001901293650001301312650002601325650001701351650001301368650001201381650002501393650001301418650001801431650002201449650001201471650004001483650001401523650006001537650001401597650005401611651001701665700001601682700001601698700001401714700001601728773009201744852000901836856004801845655001201893IND4385800020221120234513.0061210e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438580002DNAL7 a170726802pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-006-9010-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStabili, L.10aVibrio harveyi Associated with Aglaophenia octodonta (Hydrozoa, Cnidaria)  ap. 603-608.  aIncludes references  aA previously unknown association between a luminous bacterium, Vibrio harveyi, and a benthic hydrozoan, Aglaophenia octodonta, is described. Aglaophenia hydrocladia showed a clear fluorescence in the folds along the hydrocaulus and at the base of the hydrotheca, suggesting the presence of luminous bacteria. This hypothesis was confirmed by isolation of luminous bacteria from Aglaophenia homogenates. Phenotypic characterization of bacterial isolates was performed by several morphological, biochemical, and cultural tests, completed with 16S rDNA sequence analysis. All the isolates were referred to a single species: V. harveyi. The association between V. harveyi and A. octodonta has epidemiological as well as ecological significance. Therefore, A. octodonta may function as habitat “islands” providing a unique set of environmental conditions for luminous bacteria colonization, quite different from those already recorded from the plankton for other Vibrio species. 3aHydrozoa 3aVibrio harveyi 3abacteria 3aenvironmental factors 3afluorescence 3ahabitats 3aislands 3anucleotide sequences 3aplankton 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Ribosomalxanalysisxgenetics. 2aGeography 2aHydrozoaxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aPhylogeny 2aVibrioxcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0aIndian Ocean1 aGravili, C.1 aPiraino, S.1 aBoero, F.1 aAlifano, P.0 tMicrobial ecology.g2006 Nov., v. 52, no. 4 p.603-608dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-006-9010-7 7aarticle01585naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245004600125300001600171500015200187520064500339650001600984650002501000650001201025650002101037650002001058650001701078651001801095773009501113852000901208939003301217945000801250946001301258655001201271IND9204721920221120223823.0920727s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920472192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, C.W.10aEnergy for food production and processing  ap. 324-337.  aIn the series analytic: The science of global change: the impact of human activities on the environment / edited by D.A.

The processing of food requires nearly twice as much energy as for production. As commercial energy has replaced animal power and human effort in farming and has helped provide fertilizer and chemicals for plant production, production has increased by two orders of magnitude over the past 100 years. There has been a rapid shift of processing off-the-farm to commercial enterprises. The possibilities of using the products of agriculture to meet energy needs particularly by substituting biomass products for commercial energy are discussed. 3aagriculture 3aproduction economics 3abiomass 3aenergy resources 3afood processing 3aenergy crops 3aUnited States0 tACS Symposium series - American Chemical Society.g1992, v. 483 p.324-337x0097-61567nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aENE  aOther US 7aarticle01897naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245008900171300001400260500002400274520079500298650001201093650001601105650002301121650002001144650001101164650002801175650001001203650001001213650003301223650001401256650003001270650001801300700001501318700001601333773009801349852000901447856005501456655001201511IND4435481920100501103140.0100416e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443548192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0329.2009.00610.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandelier, A.10aDetection of Chalara fraxinea in common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) using real time PCR  ap. 87-95.  aIncludes references  aA real time PCR assay was developed for the detection of Chalara fraxinea in common ash.

The primers amplified an 81 bp fragment for C. fraxinea but did not amplify DNA from other Chalara species or from other fungi isolated from ash, whether pathogenic or saprophytic. The limit of detection was 5 pg of genomic DNA per PCR. Moreover, naturally-infected samples were correctly diagnosed. A procedure for DNA extraction from woody tissues using an electric drill yielded DNA of an appropriate quality for real time PCR.

Proto biosynthesis and accumulation were triggered by manipulation of the porphyrin-heme biosynthetic pathway. Proto accumulation in cultured cells was induced by treatment with 1.0 mM delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a naturally occurring 5-carbon amino acid, for 3.5 h. In darkness, significant Proto accumulation became evident within 3.5 h of incubation. In the light, the accumulated tetrapyrroles triggered destruction of treated cells within the first 30 min of illumination, probably via the rapid oxidation of cellular constituents by singlet oxygen. Protoporphyrin IX accumulation and specific cell lysis increased significantly by inclusion of 0.75 mM 1,10-phenanthroline (Oph), a tetrapyrrole biosynthesis modulator.

In the glasshouse test, the three selected bacterial isolates were recovered from inside roots in all samplings, up to 8 weeks after inoculation, indicating that the roots of healthy beet may be a habitat for these endophytic bacteria. 3abeets 3aendophytes 3agerm-free animals 3agreenhouses 3ahabitats 3aindole acetic acid 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3asugar beet1 aLou, Kai1 aLi, Chun0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2009 July, v. 45, no. 6 p.645-653dSpringer-Verlagx0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-009-0376-9 7aarticle03936naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011700163300001600280500002400296500001500320520256000335650002002895650001702915650001402932650001702946650002502963650002302988650001103011650001203022650001803034650002203052650001603074650001203090650002603102650001203128650001903140650002103159650001003180650001103190650001003201653001403211700001703225700001903242700002003261773009203281852000903373856004803382655001203430IND4430533520221120191234.0091226e20100120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443053352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2009.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Shou-Chen10aEffect of lowering the root/shoot ratio by pruning roots on water use efficiency and grain yield of winter wheat  ap. 158-164.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA pot and a field experiment were conducted to assess the effects of root/shoot ratio (R/S) on the water use efficiency (WUE) and grain yield of winter wheat. The R/S was regulated by pruning the roots during the stem elongation stage, resulting in reduced root systems of the plants. At the heading stage, the root dry weight of root-pruned plants was less than that of intact-root plants, but their R/S was similar to that of intact-root plants under both experimental conditions. After tiller pruning, the R/S of root-pruned plants was significantly lower than that of intact-root plants (p <0.05). Root pruning reduced the rate of leaf transpiration and lowered the number of tillers per plant (p <0.05) during the vegetative stage. As a result, root-pruned wheat showed reduced water use when compared to intact-root plants before heading (p <0.05). At anthesis, there was no significant difference in transpiration between plants with intact roots and those with pruned roots in the pots. However, under field conditions, transpiration of root-pruned plants was significantly higher than that of intact-root plants at anthesis. Additionally, at anthesis root-pruned plants had a higher rate of leaf photosynthesis and lower rate of root respiration, which resulted in a significantly higher grain yield at maturity when compared to plants with intact roots. Under both experimental conditions, there were no significant differences in shoot dry weight per plant between root-pruned and intact-root plants grown in monoculture. When root-pruned plants were grown with intact-root plants, the root-pruned wheat was less productive and had a lower relative shoot dry weight (0.78 and 0.86, respectively) than the intact-root plants (1.24 and 1.16, respectively). These results suggest that plants with pruned roots had a lower ability to compete and to acquire and use the same resources in the mixture when compared with intact-root plants. Root pruning improved the WUE of winter wheat under both experimental conditions. This suggests that appropriate management for the root system/tillers in wheat crops can be used to increase grain yield and water use efficiency. Specifically, lowering the R/S improved the grain yield and WUE of winter wheat significantly by lowering its competitive ability and improving root efficiency. Therefore, drought-resistance breeding to improve the grain yield and WUE, at least for wheat, should be made by targeted selection of less competitive progeny with a small R/S for cultivation in arid and semiarid areas. 3astem elongation 3awinter wheat 3aflowering 3aroot systems 3awater use efficiency 3amanagement systems 3ashoots 3atillers 3atranspiration 3avegetative growth 3agrain yield 3aprogeny 3afield experimentation 3apruning 3aphotosynthesis 3aroot shoot ratio 3aroots 3aleaves 3acrops 0awater use1 aLi, Fengmin.1 aXu, Bing-Cheng1 aHuang, Zhan-Bin0 tField crops research.g2010 Jan. 20, v. 115, no. 2 p.158-164dElsevierx0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2009.10.017 7aarticle03627naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245012300181300001600304520216900320650002102489650002302510650001902533650002402552650001002576650001202586650001302598650001502611650001502626650001002641650002202651650001202673650001202685650001402697650003602711650002202747650001602769651001302785651001302798653003002811653001402841653002302855773010502878852000902983856008502992930003303077946001103110655001203121IND4407783620221120191323.0080712e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440778362DNAL7 a184810992pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-008-1043-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, S. D. 10aRange expansion of a habitat-modifying species leads to loss of taxonomic diversity: a new and impoverished reef state  ap. 883-894.  aGlobal climate change is predicted to have major negative impacts on biodiversity, particularly if important habitat-modifying species undergo range shifts. The sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii (Diadematidae) has recently undergone poleward range expansion to relatively cool, macroalgal dominated rocky reefs of eastern Tasmania (southeast Australia). As in its historic environment, C. rodgersii in the extended range is now found in association with a simplified 'barrens' habitat grazed free of macroalgae. The new and important role of this habitat-modifier on reef structure and associated biodiversity was clearly demonstrated by completely removing C. rodgersii from incipient barrens patches at an eastern Tasmanian site and monitoring the macroalgal response relative to unmanipulated barrens patches. In barrens patches from which C. rodgersii was removed, there was a rapid proliferation of canopy-forming macroalgae (Ecklonia radiata and Phyllospora comosa), and within 24 months the algal community structure had converged with that of adjacent macroalgal beds where C. rodgersii grazing was absent. A notable scarcity of limpets on C. rodgersii barrens in eastern Tasmania (relative to the historic range) likely promotes rapid macroalgal recovery upon removal of the sea urchin. In the recovered macroalgal habitat, faunal composition redeveloped similar to that from adjacent intact macroalgal beds in terms of total numbers of taxa, total individuals and Shannon diversity. In contrast, the faunal community of the barrens habitat is overwhelmingly impoverished. Of 296 individual floral/faunal taxa recorded, only 72 were present within incipient barrens, 253 were present in the recovered patches, and 221 were present within intact macroalgal beds. Grazing activity of C. rodgersii results in an estimated minimum net loss of approximately 150 taxa typically associated with Tasmanian macroalgal beds in this region. Such a disproportionate effect by a single range-expanding species demonstrates that climate change may lead to unexpectedly large impacts on marine biodiversity as key habitat-modifying species undergo range modification. 3aEcklonia radiata 3aPhyllospora comosa 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3afauna 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3amacroalgae 3amonitoring 3areefs 3aspecies diversity 2aAnimals 2aBiomass 2aEcosystem 2aEukaryotaxgrowth & development 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aSea Urchins 3aTasmania 0aTasmania 0aCentrostephanus rodgersii 0aKelp beds 0aSea urchin barrens0 tOecologia.g2008 July, v. 156, no. 4 p.883-894dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1043-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20080712b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03234naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001600150245007500166300001600241520134500257650001601602650002101618650002301639650002401662650001801686650003001704650001501734650001901749650002301768650003001791650002501821650001501846650002401861650001001885650005301895650001801948650001101966650004101977650006202018650001102080650002502091650000902116650001802125650001602143650002702159650001402186650002802200651001802228653002702246653003302273653003202306700001402338700001602352700001302368700001502381700001702396700001602413773007602429852000902505939003302514946001302547655001202560IND9203719820221120181906.0920612e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920371982DNAL7 a16597162pmid7 aPMC15803432pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, J.R.10aProgress in efforts to prevent the spread of HIV infection among youth  ap. 678-686.  aThe Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) that causes AIDS will continue to threaten public health for years to come. Despite some popular misperceptions, adolescents are at risk of infection. Twenty percent of persons reported with AIDS have been ages 20 through 29. Given the long incubation period between HIV infection and AIDS, some of these young adults probably were infected while they were teenagers. Young people must develop the skills they will need to avoid HIV infection and other related health problems. In 1987, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) launched a national program to help schools and other agencies that serve youth across the nation provide effective health education to prevent the spread of HIV. CDC supports and works closely with national health and education organizations, State and local education agencies, colleges and universities, and local health departments to establish HIV prevention policies and programs, training and demonstration centers, Information development and dissemination activities. The impact of these efforts are assessed through applied surveillance and evaluation research. Through this system, CDC is attempting to institutionalize the means for continuously providing educational programs that will be effective in preventing HIV infection and other important health problems. 3aadolescents 3ahealth education 3adisease prevention 3agovernment agencies 3aorganizations 3ainformation dissemination 3amonitoring 3ahuman behavior 3aprogram evaluation 3apublic services and goods 3ainformation services 2aAdolescent 2aAdolescent Behavior 2aAdult 2aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. 2aCommunication 2aFemale 2aHIV Infectionsxprevention & control 2aHealth Educationxmethodsxorganization & administration. 2aHumans 2aInformation Services 2aMale 2aOrganizations 2aRisk-Taking 2aSchool Health Services 2aSocieties 2aStudent Health Services 0aUnited States 0aschool health services 0ahuman immunodeficiency virus 0acenters for disease control1 aDaily, L.1 aCollins, J.1 aKann, L.1 aDalmat, M.1 aTruman, B.I.1 aKolbe, L.J.0 tPublic health reports.g1991 , v. 106, no. 6 p.678-686x0033-35497nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02183naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245010500143300001300248520072500261650001400986650001701000650001801017650002001035650001201055650001601067650001801083650001501101650001601116650002101132650000701153650001601160650002501176650001201201650003901213650003101252650002401283650001001307650002701317650003201344650004101376653001501417653001901432653002501451700001701476700001401493773009301507852000901600939003301609946001101642655001201653IND9203725020221120150611.0920611e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920372502DNAL7 a15639242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarwal, R.10aEffect of benzimidazole drugs on the uptake of low molecular weight nutrients in Trichuris globulosa  ap. 9-14.  aThiabendazole (100 micromole) and fenbendazole (250 micromole) were found to inhibit U-14 C-glucose, (Na)-1-14C-palmitate and (Na)-1-14 C-acetate uptake markedly (P < 0.001) in adult Trichuris globulosa.

Migration was measured by three successive migration tests into two of the European Union official food simulants: distilled water and 3% acetic acid testing at 40°C for 10 days. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) has assessed that a migration above 0.33 mg for 2-BEA and a group of eight related substances kg−1 foodstuff from plastics articles used exclusively for infants is unacceptable. Migration of 2-BEA was found from eight of 12 bottles. However, migration above the target value of 0.33 mg kg−1 was not observed in the third decisive test from any of the 12 different brands of polycarbonate feeding bottles. A migration of between 0.05 and 0.26 mg kg−1 from seven of 12 bottles was measured to 3% acetic acid in the third test, whereas no migration to distilled water was observed in the third test. The average recovery of 2-BEA after the 10-day exposure at the target value of 0.33 mg kg−1 was 77% into distilled water and 36% into 3% acetic acid. The limited recovery was understandable as 2-BEA was partly hydrolysed in the aqueous food simulants and 2-butoxyethanol, a hydrolysis product and one of the related substances was identified. Quantification was carried out using gas chromatography after liquid/liquid extraction of the food simulant. 3aEuropean Union 3aacetates 3aacetic acid 3abottles 3afoods 3agas chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3ainfant feeding 3ainfants 3aplastics1 aLund, K.H.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2003 Dec., v. 20, no. 12 p.1178-1185x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520303100016059703Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20121120  aNon-US 7aarticle03463naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245014300189300001800332500002400350520144900374650003801823650001501861650001701876650001201893650001001905650002901915650001201944650003001956650001201986650001601998650002002014650002202034650001302056650003002069650003802099650002702137650006402164650001302228650004502241650002302286650004402309650004002353650003602393650002402429650005202453650003602505650002702541700001702568700002302585700002402608700001702632700003402649773010202683852000902785856005502794655001202849IND4445623920221120140644.0101126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444562392DNAL7 a207962142pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03440.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz, Pedro.10aDeficiency in plastidic glutamine synthetase alters proline metabolism and transcriptomic response in Lotus japonicus under drought stress  ap. 1001-1013.  aIncludes references  a• The role of plastidic glutamine synthetase (GS2) in proline biosynthesis and drought stress responses in Lotus japonicus was investigated using the GS2 mutant, Ljgln2‐2. • Wild‐type (WT) and mutant plants were submitted to different lengths of time of water and nutrient solution deprivation. Several biochemical markers were measured and the transcriptional response to drought was determined by both quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction and transcriptomics. • The Ljgln2‐2 mutant exhibited normal sensitivity to mild water deprivation, but physiological, biochemical and massive transcriptional differences were detected in the mutant, which compromised recovery (rehydration) following re‐watering after severe drought stress. Proline accumulation during drought was substantially lower in mutant than in WT plants, and significant differences in the pattern of expression of the genes involved in proline metabolism were observed. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that about three times as many genes were regulated in response to drought in Ljgln2‐2 plants compared with WT. • The transcriptomic and accompanying biochemical data indicate that the Ljgln2‐2 mutant is subject to more intense cellular stress than WT during drought. The results presented here implicate plastidic GS2 in proline production during stress and provide interesting insights into the function of proline in response to drought. 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3abiomarkers 3abiosynthesis 3adrought 3agenes 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3amutants 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproline 3arehydration 3atranscriptomics 3awater deprivation 2aDroughts 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGlutamate-Ammonia Ligasexdeficiencyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aLotusxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlastidsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aProlinexmetabolism 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aStress, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aBetti, Marco1 aSánchez, Diego H.1 aUdvardi, Michael K.1 aMonza, Jorge1 aMárquez, A.

  1 aGirard, C.L.10aImpact of B-vitamin supply on major metabolic pathways of lactating dairy cows  ap. 213-220.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aKnowledge of the major nutrient requirements of dairy cows has increased substantially during the past decades. Little is known, however, about the importance of the roles played by B vitamins. Since most of those vitamins act as essential cofactors in energy, protein and lipid metabolism, it is likely that as milk yield increases, the demand for these cofactors also increases. The supply of B vitamins from dietary sources and synthesis by the ruminal microflora is generally sufficient to avoid deficiency symptoms, but could be insufficient for optimizing metabolic efficiency, production, composition and the nutritional quality of milk in high-producing dairy cows. Results from recent experiments show how the supply of three B vitamins - folic acid, biotin and vitamin B12 - affects major metabolic pathways. Supplementary biotin has frequently been reported to increase milk yield but has a limited effect on milk composition. Folic acid supplements have been found to increase milk and milk protein yields in multiparous cows without affecting dry matter intake when vitamin B12 supply was adequate. An insufficient vitamin B12 supply blocked those effects but they can be restored through vitamin B12 supplementation. Supplemental vitamin B12 and biotin increased milk and milk protein yields without changing dry matter intake. Vitamin B12 utilization by tissues increased in cows fed supplementary folic acid simultaneously; plasma glucose also increased in these cows but plasma biotin decreased. From these findings, it appears that, in high-producing dairy cows, especially in early lactation, the strong competition for nutrients that occurs between gluconeogenesis, methylneogenesis and protein synthesis increases the amount of folic acid, vitamin B12 and biotin required to maintain metabolic efficiency, especially when the nutrient supply is limited. These observations emphasize the need to review the paradigm according to which B-vitamin supply by ruminal microflora cannot be limiting in dairy cow. 3aruminant nutrition 3adairy cows 3acow feeding 3abiotin 3alactation 3afolic acid 3avitamin B12 3amechanism of action 3abiochemical pathways 3amilk yield 3arumen microorganisms 0aliterature reviews1 aMatte, J.J.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2006 June, v. 86, no. 2 p.213-220dAgricultural Institute of Canada.wJournal:1932x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/aic-journals/cjas.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070806b20070902c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/12/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02001naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245018800126300001600314500019500330500002400525520063500549650001201184650001301196650001801209650001101227650002101238650001401259650001401273650001901287650001301306650001601319650003701335650001801372700001601390700001901406700001101425700002001436700002001456773010601476852000901582655001201591IND4365444820221120115313.0041108e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436544482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeyoumu, A.10aContinuous nano- and ultra-filtration of kraft pulping black liquor with ceramic filters : a method for lowering the load on the recovery boiler with generating valuable side-products  ap. 143-150.  aIn the special issue: 6th International Lignin Institute Conference held January 22-23, 2003, Wageningen, The Netherlands \ edited by A.

These unicellular algae occur in far-flung volcanic areas throughout the earth. Three genera (Cyanidium, Galdieria, and Cyanidioschyzon) are recognized. The phylogenetic diversity of culture isolates of the Cyanidiales from habitats throughout Yellowstone National Park (YNP), three areas in Japan, and seven regions in New Zealand was examined by using the chloroplast RuBisCO large subunit gene (rbcL) and the 18S rRNA gene. Based on the nucleotide sequences of both genes, the YNP isolates fall into two groups, one with high identity to Galdieria sulphuraria (type II) and another that is by far the most common and extensively distributed Yellowstone type (type IA). The latter is a spherical, walled cell that reproduces by internal divisions, with a subsequent release of smaller daughter cells. This type, nevertheless, shows a 99 to 100% identity to Cyanidioschyzon merolae (type IB), which lacks a wall, divides by "fission"-like cytokinesis into two daughter cells, and has less than 5% of the cell volume of type IA. The evolutionary and taxonomic ramifications of this disparity are discussed. Although the 18S rRNA and rbcL genes did not reveal diversity among the numerous isolates of type IA, chloroplast short sequence repeats did show some variation by location within YNP. In contrast, Japanese and New Zealand strains showed considerable diversity when we examined only the sequences of 18S and rbcL genes. Most exhibited identities closer to Galdieria maxima than to other strains, but these identities were commonly as low as 91 to 93%. Some of these Japanese and New Zealand strains probably represent undescribed species that diverged after long-term geographic isolation. 3aCyanidium 3aautotrophs 3acytokinesis 3agenes 3ahabitats 3amulticultural diversity 3anational parks 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3aribosomal RNA 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3atemperature 3aJapan 3aNew Zealand1 aNorris, T.B.1 aLehr, C.R.1 aMcDermott, T.R.1 aCastenholz, R.W.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology AEM.g2008 May 1, v. 74, no. 9 p.2822-2833dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle03456naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100001600204245017400220300001700394500002400411520160000435650001002035650001502045650001102060650001502071650001902086650001402105650001602119650000902135650002102144650003202165650000902197650001202206650002302218650001102241650002202252650000902274650002102283650001702304650001102321650002002332650001902352650001902371650001802390650002302408650002402431650002002455700001702475700001202492700001602504700002202520773008902542852000902631856007302640930003302713945002502746946001102771655001202782IND4385241620221120111034.0061116e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438524162DNAL7 a220636652pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL500 0aL600 0aQ5021 aKerth, C.R.10aCarcass, sensory, fat color, and consumer acceptance characteristics of Angus-cross steers finished on ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) forage or on a high-concentrate diet  ap.  324-331.  aIncludes references  aFall-born Angus-cross steers (n = 30) from 1 of 2 sires, were randomly assigned to either an 85% corn, 7.5% cotton-seed hulls, and 7.5% vitamin/mineral/urea supplement diet (GRAIN), 100% ryegrass grazing (RG), or ryegrass grazing then the GRAIN diet for 94 d (RG/GRAIN).

Potential errors and artifacts associated with the soda lime chamber method were investigated and improvements made. The following issues relating to quantification and reliable measurement of soil CO2 efflux were evaluated: (i) absorption capacity of the soda lime, (ii) additional and thus artifactual absorption of CO2 by soda lime during the experimental procedure, (iii) variation in the CO2 concentration inside the chamber headspace, and (iv) effects of chamber closure on soil CO2 efflux. Soil CO2 efflux, as measured using soda lime (with a range of quantities: 50, 100, and 200 g per 0.082 m2 ground area enclosed in chamber), was compared with transient IRGA measurements as a reference method that is based on well-established physical principles, using several forms of spatial and temporal comparisons. Natural variation in efflux rates ranged from 2 to 5.5 g C m-2 day-1 between different chambers and over different days. A comparison of the IRGA-based assay with measurement based on soda lime yielded an overall correlation coefficient of 0.82. The slope of the regression line was not significantly different from the 1:1 line, and the intercept was not significantly different from the origin. This result indicated that measurement of CO2 efflux by soda lime absorption was quantitatively similar and unbiased in relation to the reference method. The soda lime method can be a highly practical method for field measurements if implemented with due care (in terms of drying and weighing soda lime, and in minimizing leakages), and validated for specific field conditions. A detailed protocol is presented for use of the soda lime method for measurement of CO2 efflux from field soils. 3acarbon dioxide 3agas emissions 3asoil respiration 3asodium hydroxide 3acalcium hydroxide 3aabsorption 3aquantitative analysis 3aanalytical methods1 aWong, S.C.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2006 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.1121-1131dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.09.0123electronic resource  a20061204b20070102c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/12/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02443naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001500195245008000210300001600290500002400306500001500330520104500345650002101390650002501411650001601436650001501452650002701467650001601494650002401510650002001534650000701554650002101561650001801582650001001600653001401610653001701624700001401641700001601655700001501671773008801686852000901774856007301783930003301856945002501889946001101914655001201925IND4385241820221120100852.0061116e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438524182DNAL7 a220636662pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aL200 0aQ5021 aBiswas, S.10aEffect of electrical stimulation on quality of tenderstretched chevon sides  ap. 332-336.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThirty male Black Bengal goats 5-8 years of age, slaughtered at the Kolkata slaughter house, India, by the traditional 'halal' method, were used to assess the effect of electrical stimulation on tenderstretched sides of chevon carcasses. Five groups (T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5) were treated with variable voltages of 35, 110, 330, 550, 1100 with fixed 50 Hz and 10 pulses/s for a duration of 3 min. Different quality parameters, such as, fibre diameter, sarcomere length, water holding capacity (WHC), pH, microbial content and taste panel score were studied at 24 and 48 h post-stimulation. pH, WHC and fibre diameter decreased whereas sarcomere length showed an increasing trend in electrically stimulated meat, which was also microbiologically more stable. The non-stimulated control meat was tougher than the electrically stimulated chevon as evident through taste panel scoring. Treatment 3 (T3), i.e. 330 V, 50 Hz and 10 pulses/s, showed superiority over the other four treatments in the majority of the important meat quality parameters. 3aage at slaughter 3aelectrical treatment 3atenderizing 3asarcomeres 3awater holding capacity 3aplate count 3aBengal (goat breed) 3ameat tenderness 3apH 3aelectric current 3amuscle fibers 3ataste 0aslaughter 0ameat quality1 aDas, A.K.1 aBanerjee,R.1 aSharma, N.0 tMeat science.g2007 Feb., v. 75, no. 2 p.332-336dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.08.0023electronic resource  a20070302b20070402c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/03/02  aNon-US 7aarticle01872naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245006900130300001600199500009200215520089900307650001901206650003201225650001501257650001201272650001601284650002001300700001701320700001601337700001601353700001501369773009501384852000901479939003301488946001301521655001201534IND9204683020221120084953.0920724s1989    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920468302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallagher, I.M.10aUltrastructural localization of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes  ap. 426-442.  aIn the series analytic: Plant cell wall polymers / edited by N.G.

Both enzymes were localized in the fungal cell walls and mucilage layers of both generative and skeletal hyphae, whereas ligninase but not laccase was also evident adjacent to the plasma membrane. The localization of these enzymes was the same in hyphae grown in culture and in sections of beech heartwood infected with C. versicolor. Control experiments showed that no labelling was detected in the absence of primary antibodies, or when antibodies to animal or plant enzymes were substituted but antibodies to fungal proteins from different species were labelled in sections of C. versicolor.

In this study, two kinds of flavonoid-rich extracts from leaves of A. grossedentata were prepared by traditional solvent extraction (product A) and recrystallization (product B). By analysis of ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectrometry, infrared (IR) spectrometry, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ESI/MS, the major flavonoid in two products was identified as (+)-dihydromyricetin (DMY). Also, by HPLC, the contents of DMY in leaves, product A and product B were measured to be 32.96 ± 1.18%, 77.15 ± 1.98% and 95.12 ± 2.86%, respectively. Various antioxidant tests (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, reducing power, antioxidant activity in linoleic acid system) showed that the antioxidant activity of the flavonoid-rich extracts could be comparable with that of tertiary butylhydroquinone. The flavonoid-rich extracts from A. grossedentata leaves have a promise to be a new natural antioxidant with potential application in food industry. Leaves of Ampelopsis grossedentata are consumed in southern China as health tea (Tengcha) and herbal medicine. In this study, the flavonoid-rich extracts from leaves of A. grossedentata, which were rich in (+)-dihydromyricetin, were prepared by traditional solvent extraction and recrystallization. Also, the antioxidant activity of the extracts can be comparable with that of tertiary butylhydroquinone. The results obtained in this study suggest that leaves of A. grossedentata may have potential as a new source of natural antioxidant and health food with great commercial interest in the food and phytopharmaceutical market. 3aAmpelopsis 3aantioxidant activity 3afood industry 3afood marketing 3ahealth foods 3aherbal medicines 3aherbal tea 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3alinoleic acid 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aLIU, BENGUO1 aNING, ZHENGXIANG1 aZHAO, RUIXIANG1 aZHANG, AIYUAN1 aWU, QIONG0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2009 Dec., v. 33, no. 6 p.808-820dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4514.2009.00253.x 7aarticle01738naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007200127300001600199500009200215520087000307650001501177650001801192650001501210650002301225650002301248650002701271773009501298852000901393939003301402946001301435655001201448IND9204682420221120085032.0920724s1989    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920468242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearce, R.B.10aCell wall alterations and antimicrobial defense in perennial plants  ap. 346-360.  aIn the series analytic: Plant cell wall polymers / edited by N.G.

Antimicrobial defence in such tissues may entail the durable operation of resistance mechanisms during prolonged host-parasite interactions: wall alterations are well suited to this requirement. In the bark of many trees, the suberized phellem forms a constitutive barrier to invasion, and suberization is an early and important part of the wound and defence responses restoring an intact periderm surface. This is exemplified by the response of Sitka spruce to attack by Armillaria obscura. Induced suberization responses also occur in sapwood, conferring enhanced resistance to degradation by decay fungi and contributing to the formation of barriers which limit the spread of pathogens in the living tree. 3aperennials 3aplant tissues 3acell walls 3adisease resistance 3adefense mechanisms 3aplant pathogenic fungi0 tACS Symposium series - American Chemical Society.g1989, v. 399 p.346-360x0097-61567nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02297naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002300181245010200204300001800306500002400324506007600348520036800424506003700792650001800829650001800847650001900865650001000884650001300894650001100907650001400918650001200932650004700944650004100991650003201032650008701064650001301151650006201164650002801226650003201254650003301286650001801319650002701337700001601364700002001380700002101400700002301421700001601444773013401460852000901594856008001603856004801683655001201731IND4385163420221207135213.0061112e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438516342DNAL7 a169360452pmid7 aPMC16361412pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.01394-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLobo, Maria Luisa.10aIdentification of Potentially Human-Pathogenic Enterocytozoon bieneusi Genotypes in Various Birds  ap. 7380-7382.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnterocytozoon bieneusi was detected in 24 of 83 samples from birds of the orders Columbiformes, Passeriformes, and Psittaciformes.

Oxygen concentration, nitrate concentration and carbon availability are generally the main factors that control soil denitrification rate and the amount of N2O or N2 emitted. The aim of this paper is to present a database of the N2O mole fraction measured at the field scale, and to test hypotheses concerning its regulation. A 15N-nitrate tracer solution was added to 36 undisturbed soil cores on a 20 mx20 m cultivated field plot. Fluxes of CO2, N2O and N2 from the soil surface were monitored for 24 h. Soil moisture, bulk density, carbon, nitrogen and mineral nitrogen concentration were also measured to investigate possible spatial relationships between their variations and those of N2O, N2 and nitrous oxide mole fraction. Under high water content, nitrous oxide and N2 emissions were highly variable with variation coefficients of 70-140%. N2O emission rates were about twice as high as those of N2, with a total denitrification rate ranging from 269 to 3843 g N ha-1 d-1. After 24 h of incubation, the values of nitrous oxide mole fraction ranged from 0.15 to 0.94 and no significant decline during incubation time was observed. Spatial variability of N2O, N2 and nitrous oxide mole fraction was high and no spatial dependence was observed at the scale of the experimental plot. Only tenuous relationships between gaseous nitrogen emissions and soil properties (mainly nitrate concentration and moisture content) were found. Meanwhile, a positive correlation was observed between N2 and CO2 emissions. This result supports the hypothesis that an increase in soil available organic carbon leads to N2 emissions as the end product of denitrification. 3anitrous oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3agas emissions 3aspatial variation 3anitrate nitrogen 3astable isotopes 3aisotope labeling 3adenitrification 3aglobal warming 3aFrance1 aLeveque, J.1 aHenault, C.1 aMilloux, M.J.1 aBizouard, F.1 aAndreux, F.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2006 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.941-951dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.08.0103electronic resource  a20061130b20061202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/11/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02407naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195072000900204100001700213245008500230300001600315500002400331500001500355520054000370650002700910650001200937650001900949650001100968650001500979650001800994650002101012650001901033650001301052650002101065650001201086650001701098650001401115650002301129650001501152650002101167650001201188650002601200650002101226650001601247650003201263650001301295651001001308653002201318653002601340653003201366700001601398700001701414700001901431700002001450773008801470852000901558856007301567930003301640945002501673946001101698655001201709IND4385242520221120074722.0061116e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438524252DNAL7 a220636702pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL500 0aL600 0aQ102 0aQ5021 aPolidori, P.10aMeat fatty acid composition of llama (Lama glama) reared in the Andean highlands  ap. 356-358.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study reports the results of the chemical analysis of the Longissimus thoracis and lumborum taken from 20 llama males, reared in the Andean highlands.

The discovery of aquaporins has facilitated research on intracellular and whole-plant water transport at the molecular level. Aquaporins belong to a ubiquitous family of membrane intrinsic proteins (MIP). Plants have four subfamilies: plasma-membrane intrinsic protein (PIP), tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP), nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP), and small basic intrinsic protein (SIP). Recent research has revealed a diversity of plant aquaporins, especially their physiological functions and intracellular localisation. A few PIP members have been reported to be involved in carbon dioxide permeability of cells. Newly identified transport substrates for NIP members of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana have been demonstrated to transport silicon and boron, respectively. Ammonia, glycerol, and hydrogen peroxide have been identified as substrates for plant aquaporins. The intracellular localisation of plant aquaporins is diverse; for example, SIP members are localised on the ER membrane. There has been much progress in the research on the functional regulation of water channel activity of PIP members including phosphorylation, formation of hetero-oligomer, and protonation of histidine residues under acidic condition. This review provides a broad overview of the range of potential aquaporins, which are now believed to participate in the transport of several small molecules in various membrane systems in model plants, crops, flowers and fruits. 3acytochemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3aammonia 3aaquaporins 3aorganelles 3asilicon 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aglycerol 3aboron 3aflowers 3aplasma membrane 3aplant proteins 0atransport proteins 0aliterature reviews 0amembrane proteins 0afruits (plant anatomy) 0aplants1 aHanba, Yuko T.1 aShiratake, Katsuhiro1 aMaeshima, Masayoshi0 tFunctional plant biology.g2008, v. 35, no. 1 p.1-14dCSIRO Publishingx1445-44087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP071303Available from publisher's Web site  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02024naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001700167245010100184300001800285500011800303500002400421520065000445650002001095650001801115650002001133650001701153650002001170650001201190650002101202650001701223650002001240650002301260700001801283700001301301700001601314773009701330852000901427856007301436930003301509945002501542946001101567655001201578IND4385251520221117171548.0061116e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438525152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aK0011 aCourty, P.E.10aLaccase and phosphatase activities of the dominant ectomycorrhizal types in a lowland oak forest  ap. 1219-1222.  aPaper presented at the Rhizosphere Congress 2004 - Perspectives and Challenges.

Among the most frequent and abundant EM morphotypes, those of Lactarius quietus and Cortinarius anomalus showed a peak of laccase activity in spring, while those of Xerocomus chrysenteron displayed highest laccase activities in summer and autumn. In comparison, less seasonal differences were observed in EM acid phosphatase activity. This suggests that the different EM types within the EM community perform complementary functions depending on season. 3alowland forests 3aQuercus robur 3aQuercus petraea 3aforest soils 3aectomycorrhizae 3alaccase 3aacid phosphatase 3asoil enzymes 3aenzyme activity 3aseasonal variation1 aPouysegur, R.1 aBuee, M.1 aGarbaye, J.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2006 June, v. 38, no. 6 p.1219-1222dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.10.0053electronic resource  a20070418b20070502c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/04/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02847naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001800167245012300185300001800308500002400326520151400350650001901864650003101883650001601914650001801930650002401948650002501972650001601997650002102013650001902034650001202053651001602065700001602081700001402097700001502111700001502126773009702141852000902238856007302247930003302320945002502353946001102378655001202389IND4385250820221122144346.0061116e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438525082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aJ1001 aTarnawski, S.10aPhenotypic structure of Pseudomonas populations is altered under elevated pCO2 in the rhizosphere of perennial grasses  ap. 1193-1201.  aIncludes references  aThe increasing atmospheric CO2 content (pCO2) is likely to modify the ecosystem functioning including rhizosphere bacteria that are directly dependent on rhizodeposition. This may include alteration of Pseudomonas populations that display phenotypic traits in relation with plant fitness. In the present study, 1228 Pseudomonas strains were isolated from the non-rhizosphere soil, rhizosphere soil and root fractions of perennial grassland systems: Lolium perenne and Molinia coerulea. Both plants were grown under ambient (36 Pa) and elevated (60 Pa) pCO2 in the Swiss Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) system. Pseudomonas spp. were tested for their ability to produce auxin, siderophores and hydrogen cyanide, and to dissimilate nitrate. No effect of root proximity and elevated pCO2 was observed on the proportions of auxin producers. For L. perenne and M. coerulea, siderophore and hydrogen cyanide Pseudomonas producers were stimulated in the root fraction. In contrast lower frequencies of nitrate reducers were observed in the root fraction compared to non-rhizosphere soil. The frequencies of siderophore producers and nitrate dissimilating strains were higher, and those of hydrogen cyanide producers lower, under elevated pCO2 for L. perenne. This alteration of the phenotypic structure of Pseudomonas guild in the root fraction is discussed in relation with the physico-biochemical modifications of the rhizosphere condition via rhizodeposition and environmental changes occurring under elevated pCO2. 3acarbon dioxide 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aPseudomonas 3asoil bacteria 3acommunity structure 3aphenotypic variation 3arhizosphere 3aMolinia caerulea 3aLolium perenne 3agrasses 3aSwitzerland1 aHamelin, J.1 aJossi, M.1 aAragno, M.1 aFromin, N.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2006 June, v. 38, no. 6 p.1193-1201dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.10.0033electronic resource  a20070418b20070502c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/04/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03488naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245015600201300001800357500002400375506007600399520175000475506003702225650002902262650002602291650002102317650002702338650002802365650001602393650002902409650001702438650002402455650004302479650002202522650001902544650003002563650003702593650002002630700002202650700002402672700002202696700002102718700001902739773013502758852000902893856008002902655001202982IND4418331220221207132018.0090327e20090401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441833122DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02266-082doi7 aPMC26631882pmcid7 a191818352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRihakova, Jitka10aInsights into Structure-Activity Relationships in the C-Terminal Region of Divercin V41, a Class IIa Bacteriocin with High-Level Antilisterial Activity  ap. 1811-1819.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDivercin V41 (DvnV41) is a class IIa bacteriocin with potent antilisterial activity isolated from Carnobacterium divergens V41. Previously, we expressed from a synthetic gene, in Escherichia coli Origami, a recombinant DvnV41 designated DvnRV41, which possesses four additional amino acids (AMDP) in the N-terminal region that result from enzymatic cleavage and retains the initial DvnV41 activity. To unravel the relationship between the structure of DvnRV41 and its particularly elevated activity, we produced by site-directed mutagenesis eight variants in which a single amino acid replacement was specifically introduced into the sequence. The point mutations were designed to change either conserved residues in class IIa bacteriocins or residues specific to DvnV41 located mainly in the C-terminal region. The fusion proteins were purified from the cytosoluble fractions by immobilized affinity chromatography. DvnRV41 and its variants were released from the fusion proteins by enzymatic cleavage, using enterokinase. The purity of DvnRV41 and of the variants was checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry. The antibacterial activity of DvnRV41 and its variants was assessed using different indicator strains, including Listeria monocytogenes EGDe and Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2. The activity of all of the variants appeared to be less than the activity of DvnRV41. The decrease in activity did not appear to be related to a global conformational change, as determined by circular dichroism. Overall, the variants of DvnRV41 produced in the present study provide interesting insights into structure-activity relationships of class IIa bacteriocins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCarnobacterium divergens 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aaffinity chromatography 3aamino acids 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteriocins 3agel electrophoresis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apoint mutation 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3astructure-activity relationships 3asynthetic genes1 aPetit, Vanessa W.1 aDemnerova, Katerina1 aPrévost, Hervé.1 aRebuffat, Sylvie1 aDrider, Djamel0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2009 Apr. 1, v. 75, no. 7 p.1811-1819dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02266-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02307naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245014000189300001600329500002400345520094200369650002301311650001901334650001301353650001601366650001401382650001301396650001201409650002301421650002801444650002501472650002701497650001901524650004501543650004101588700001801629700002101647700001901668773012901687852000901816856004801825655001201873IND4451573720221122083445.0110401e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445157372DNAL7 a206020972pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-010-9560-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoung, Catherine B.10aToxicity of the Insecticide Terbufos, its Oxidation Metabolites, and the Herbicide Atrazine in Binary Mixtures to Ceriodaphnia cf dubia  ap. 417-425.  aIncludes references  aThe acute toxicity of terbufos and its major metabolites, tested alone, in binary mixtures or in combination with atrazine were evaluated using neonates of the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia cf dubia. Terbufos, terbufos sulfoxide, and terbufos sulfone tested individually were highly toxic to C. cf dubia, with mean 96-h EC₅₀ values of 0.08, 0.36, and 0.19 μg/l, respectively. The addition of atrazine (10 μg/l) significantly increased the toxicity of terbufos. The toxicity of terbufos sulfone was unaffected by atrazine, whereas the results for terbufos sulfoxide were equivocal. Equitoxic mixtures of the metabolites showed additive toxicity to C. cf dubia. The high toxicities of terbufos and its environmentally persistent oxidative metabolites suggest that contamination of aquatic systems with this insecticide mixture and the coapplied herbicide atrazine might pose a greater hazard to some biota than their individual toxicities. 3aCeriodaphnia dubia 3aacute toxicity 3aatrazine 3ametabolites 3aoxidation 3aterbufos 2aAnimals 2aAtrazinextoxicity 2aCladoceraxdrug effects 2aHerbicidesxtoxicity 2aInsecticidesxtoxicity 2aLethal Dose 50 2aOrganothiophosphorus Compoundsxtoxicity 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aHyne, Ross V.1 aStevens, Mark M.1 aHose, Grant C.0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2011 Apr., v. 60, no. 3 p.417-425dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-010-9560-z 7aarticle02549naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245019300170300001800363500002400381500001500405520126100420650002201681650002301703650000901726650001601735650001801751650001201769650001501781650001701796650001601813650002001829650002101849650002001870650001301890650002501903653001701928700001701945773010101962852000902063856005502072655001202127IND4444948320221122083447.0101105s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444494832DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02421.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Xiaojuan10aHaematological and biochemical characteristics of two aquacultured carnivorous cyprinids, topmouth culter Culter alburnus (Basilewsky) and yellowcheek carp Elopichthys bambusa (Richardson)  ap. 1331-1338.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe haematological and biochemical characteristics of two healthy farmed cyprinids, the topmouth culter Culter alburnus and yellowcheek carp Elopichthys bambusa, were investigated in this study. Erythrocytes, thrombocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes (i.e. neutrophils and eosinophils) were observed in these two fish. Every type of these cells (excluding the erythrocyte and lymphocyte) showed similar sizes in the topmouth culter and yellowcheek carp. Thrombocytes and neutrophils were the two most abundant leucocytes in the topmouth culter while thrombocytes and lymphocytes were the two most frequent leucocytes observed in the yellowcheek carp. The erythrocyte counts, haemoglobin concentrations and values of serum glucose in these two fish were high. There were significant differences in the leucocyte counts, haemoglobin concentrations, mean cellular haemoglobin contents, mean cell haemoglobin concentrations and values of serum glucose, triglyceride, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and chlorine between the topmouth culter and the yellowcheek carp. The information of haematology and blood biochemistry obtained here would be useful for the prevention and diagnosis of diseases of farmed topmouth culter and yellowcheek carp. 3aerythrocyte count 3adisease prevention 3acarp 3alymphocytes 3ablood glucose 3aBambusa 3ahemoglobin 3aerythrocytes 3aneutrophils 3ablood platelets 3atriacylglycerols 3aleukocyte count 3aAlburnus 3aalkaline phosphatase 0athrombocytes1 aWang, Weimin0 tAquaculture research.g2010, v. 41, no. 9 p.1331-1338dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02421.x 7aarticle03487naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176072000900185100001500194245016700209300001800376500002400394500001500418520188700433650002302320650001702343650001902360650002102379650001802400650001302418650002702431650001902458650001202477650002402489650003102513650002902544650002202573650001002595651001902605653001102624700001602635700001702651700001702668773009702685852000902782856007302791930003302864945002502897946001102922655001202933IND4385252520221122052804.0061116e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438525252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aJ500 0aJ200 0aF600 0aF3001 aHill, P.W.10aTemporal and spatial dynamics of soil solution C and N concentrations during Lolium perenne L. sward establishment and the effects of elevated CO2 and N additions  ap. 1290-1297.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThere is now clear evidence for a prolonged increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and enrichment of the biosphere with N. Understanding the fate of C in the plant-soil system under different CO2 and N regimes is therefore of considerable importance in predicting the environmental effects of climate change and in predicting the sustainability of ecosystems. Swards of Lolium perenne were grown from seed in a Eutric Cambisol at either ambient (ca. 350 micromole mol-1) or elevated (700 micromole mol-1) atmospheric pCO2 and subjected to two inorganic N fertilizer regimes (no added N and 70 kg N ha-1 month-1). After germination, soil solution concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOC), dissolved inorganic N (DIN), dissolved organic N (DON), phenolics and H+ were measured at five depths down the soil profile over 3 months. The exploration of soil layers down the soil profile by roots caused transient increases in soil solution DOC, DON and phenolic concentrations, which then subsequently returned to lower quasi-stable concentrations. In general, the addition of N tended to increase DOC and DON concentrations while exposure to elevated pCO2 had the opposite effect. These treatment effects, however, gradually diminished over the duration of the experiment from the top of the soil profile downwards. The ambient pCO2 plus added N regime was the only treatment to maintain a notable difference in soil solution solute concentration, relative to other treatments. This effect on soil solution chemistry appeared to be largely indirect resulting from increased plant growth and a decrease in soil moisture content. Our results show that although plant growth responses to elevated pCO2 are critically dependent upon N availability, the organic chemistry of the soil solution is relatively insensitive to changes in plant growth once the plants have become established. 3atemporal variation 3aplant growth 3acarbon dioxide 3anitrogen content 3asoil solution 3anitrogen 3afertilizer application 3aLolium perenne 3aphenols 3aplant establishment 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3adissolved organic carbon 3aspatial variation 3asward 3aUnited Kingdom 0acarbon1 aJones, D.L.1 aMarshall, C.1 aFarrar, J.F.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2006 June, v. 38, no. 6 p.1290-1297dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.09.0243electronic resource  a20070419b20070502c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/04/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03704naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001700158245011200175300001800287500002400305500001500329520228300344650004502627650001302672650001002685650001602695650001602711650001802727650001602745650003002761650001302791650002302804650002202827650002402849650002202873650001202895651001102907653001202918700001602930700001602946773009702962852000903059856007303068930003303141945002503174946001103199655001203210IND4385252620221122052656.0061116e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438525262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ1001 aAlberton, O.10aSampling effects on the assessment of genetic diversity of rhizobia associated with soybean and common bean  ap. 1298-1307.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBiological nitrogen fixation plays a key role in agriculture sustainability, and assessment of rhizobial diversity contributes to worldwide knowledge of biodiversity of soil microorganisms, to the usefulness of rhizobial collections and to the establishment of long-term strategies aimed at increasing contributions of legume-fixed N to agriculture. Although in recent decades the use of molecular techniques has contributed greatly to enhancing knowledge of rhizobial diversity, concerns remain over simple issues such as the effects of sampling on estimates of diversity. In this study, rhizobia were isolated from nodules of plants grown under field conditions, in pots containing soil, or in Leonard jars receiving a 10(-2) or a 10(-4) serially-diluted soil inoculum, using one exotic (soybean, Glycine max) and one indigenous (common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris) legume species. The experiments were performed using an oxisol with a high population (10(5) cells g-1 soil) of both soybean rhizobia, composed of naturalized strains introduced in inoculants and of indigenous common-bean rhizobia. BOX-PCR was used to evaluate strain diversity, while RFLP-PCR of the ITS (internally transcribed spacer) region with five restriction enzymes aimed at discriminating rhizobial species. In both analyses the genetic diversity of common-bean rhizobia was greater than that of soybean. For the common bean, diversity was greatly enhanced at the 10(-4) dilution, while for the soybean dilution decreased diversity. Qualitative differences were also observed, as the DNA profiles differed for each treatment in both host plants. Differences obtained can be attributed to dissimilarity in the history of the introduction of both the host plant and the rhizobia (exotic vs. indigenous), to host-plant specificity, rhizobial competitiveness, and population structure, including ease with which some types are released from microcolonies in soil. Therefore, sampling method should be considered both in the interpretation and comparison of the results obtained in different studies, and in the setting of the goals of any study, e.g. selection of competitive strains, or collection of a larger spectrum of rhizobia. Furthermore, effects of sampling should be investigated for each symbiosis. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asampling 3abeans 3aGlycine max 3arhizosphere 3asoil bacteria 3aDNA primers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asoybeans 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aspecies diversity 3amicrobial detection 3agenetic variation 3astrains 3aBrazil 0alegumes1 aKaschuk, G.1 aHungria, M.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2006 June, v. 38, no. 6 p.1298-1307dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.08.0183electronic resource  a20070419b20070502c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/04/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02930naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245012700190300001800317520119300335650002401528650001201552650001601564650001101580650001001591650002001601650001101621650001001632650001201642650000901654650002701663650001201690650002501702650001101727650002401738650002201762650003101784650000901815650003001824650002201854650001401876653003301890653001801923653002501941653002701966653002201993700001502015700001502030700001902045773013102064852000902195856009202204930003302296946001102329655001202340IND4408962120221121234602.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440896212DNAL7 a186248842pmid7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01568.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSCHIELZETH, H.10aSexual imprinting on continuous variation: do female zebra finches prefer or avoid unfamiliar sons of their foster parents  ap. 1274-1280.  aSexual imprinting on discrete variation that serves the identification of species, morphs or sexes is well documented. By contrast, sexual imprinting on continuous variation leading to individual differences in mating preferences within a single species, morph and sex has been studied only once (in humans). We measured female preferences in a captive population of wild-type zebra finches. Individual cross-fostering ensured that all subjects grew up with unrelated foster parents and nest mates. Females from two cohorts (N = 113) were given a simultaneous choice between (two or four) unfamiliar males, one of which was a genetic son of their foster parents (SFP). We found no significant overall preference for the SFP (combined effect size d = 0.14 ± 0.15). Additionally, we tested if foster parent traits could potentially explain between-female variation in preferences. However, neither the effectiveness of cooperation between the parents nor male contribution to parental care affected female preferences for the son of the foster father. We conclude that at least in zebra finches sexual imprinting is not a major source of between-individual variation in mating preferences. 3aTaeniopygia guttata 3afemales 3afoster care 3ahumans 3amales 3amating behavior 3amorphs 3anests 3aparents 3asons 3aspecies identification 2aAnimals 2aCooperative Behavior 2aFemale 2aFinchesxphysiology 2aGenetic Variation 2aImprinting, Psychological. 2aMale 2aMating Preference, Animal 2aPaternal Behavior 2aPhenotype 0adirect and indirect benefits 0afemale choice 0ainbreeding avoidance 0aphenotypic flexibility 0asexual imprinting1 aBurger, C.1 aBOLUND, E.1 aFORSTMEIER, W.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2008 Sept., v. 21, no. 5 p.1274-1280dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01568.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02928naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245009800169300001600267500010900283520126200392650002001654650001101674650001101685650001601696650002001712650001601732650001601748650001801764650001801782650001601800650001101816650001201827650002601839650002001865650002501885650001101910650002001921650001901941650001501960650002001975650002501995650002502020650001602045650001602061651002102077700001802098700001602116700002002132773013702152856005502289961000902344852000902353655001202362IND60701691820221121101206.0200714s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070169182DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1261.312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhusal, N.10aCanopy light distribution and fruit quality in excessive tall spindle apple production system  ap. 209-218.  aPaper presented at the I International Apple Symposium held October 10-16, 2016 Yangling, Shaanxi, China  aThe tall spindle planting system achieves the goals of high sustained yield and good quality fruit. However, some growers in Korea let apple trees grow vigorously up to 4 m or higher in high-density planting of 3.5×1-m spacing with M.9 rootstock. Such practices lead to very tall trees with low-quality fruit in the lower canopy. We measured light distribution, flower buds, fruit quality, and leaf characteristics at different parts of the canopy. Light penetration in the interior part of the lower canopy (0.5 and 1.5 m in height) was less than 15% of natural light intensity. Leaf area index (LAI) was higher than 2.0 at the lower and interior part of the tree canopies, and light distribution values decreased rapidly with the increased LAI. Fruit color and soluble solids content (SSC) correlated well with light penetration. Leaf photosynthesis (A) in interior parts of the canopy was much lower than in the middle and exterior parts of the canopy. Similarly, leaves in the interior parts of the canopy had lower specific leaf weight (SLW), chlorophyll content, and flower-bud size than those of exterior parts. Therefore, excessive tree height should be reduced in tall spindle apple trees for the production of better fruit quality and high yield. 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3acrop production 3aflower buds 3afruit color 3afruit growing 3afruit quality 3afruit trees 3afruits 3agrowers 3ahigh density planting 3aleaf area index 3aleaf characteristics 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3aphotosynthesis 3arootstocks 3asolar radiation 3aspecific leaf weight 3atotal soluble solids 3atree growth 3atree height 3aKorean Peninsula1 aBhusal, S.

Streif index, firmness or only starch conversion are commonly used methods. To replace these with a more practical and non-destructive method, a portable spectrometer (DA meter, chlorophyll absorbance index (I(AD))) was used to determine the optimum harvest date and storage potential for five apple cultivars grown in a cool climate. There was a very strong negative correlation between harvest date and I(AD) value in all cultivars. I(AD) values also showed a strong negative correlation with fruit respiration. However, the relationship was stronger in ‘Discovery’, ‘Rubinola’ and ‘Santana’ than in ‘Aroma’ and ‘Karin Schneider’. Streif index values showed very close relationships with I(AD) in all five apple cultivars. Apples harvested with I(AD) values of 0.8-1.8 had Streif index values of 0.14-0.20, which corresponds to an adequate threshold for harvesting apples for long-term storage. After four months in cold storage, fruits with higher I(AD) value at harvest showed higher firmness in all cultivars except ‘Rubinola’, and slower softening in ‘Aroma’, ‘Rubinola’ and ‘Santana’. Only in ‘Aroma’ and ‘Karin Schneider’ did I(AD) show a negative correlation, with a decline in soluble solids content during storage. Negative correlations were also found between I(AD) values at harvest or after storage and the occurrence of fungal decay. Since fruit respiration rate increases with advanced maturity while Streif index decreases, determination of I(AD) can be a very promising technique to predict the storage potential of apples and to identify high-quality fruit. 3aMalus domestica 3aabsorbance 3aapples 3acell respiration 3achlorophyll 3aclimate 3acold storage 3acultivars 3afirmness 3afruits 3afungi 3aharvest date 3aindustry 3anondestructive methods 3aprediction 3aspectrometers 3astarch 3astorage quality 3astorage time 3atotal soluble solids 3aScandinavia1 aVangdal, E.0 tActa horticulturae.g2019, , no. 1261 p.219-224dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1261.32  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02061naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245013500170300001600305520087100321650001201192650001301204650001301217650001301230650000901243650001701252650001301269650002101282700002301303700002201326700002201348700001701370700002101387773012701408852000901535856008501544930003301629946001301662655001201675IND4417071620221121101142.0090228e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441707162DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954090201852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyarshinova, O.

It was demonstrated that segregation of RIS relative to these traits was independent from the presence or absence of the mut-1 allele. These findings suggested the appearance of mut-1-independent mutations in the 101/HY mice, which resulted in the development of neurological pathologies. The appearance of such mutations can be the consequence of the genetic repair defects, earlier observed in the mice with this genotype. 3aalleles 3acrossing 3aepilepsy 3agenotype 3amice 3amutagenicity 3amutation 3aneurodevelopment1 aMalashenko, A.

R. 10aUrban forest biomass estimates: is it important to use allometric relationships developed specifically for urban trees?  ap. 95-113.  aMany studies have analyzed the benefits, costs, and carbon storage capacity associated with urban trees. These studies have been limited by a lack of research on urban tree biomass, such that estimates of carbon storage in urban systems have relied upon allometric relationships developed in traditional forests. As urbanization increases globally, it is becoming important to more accurately evaluate carbon dynamics in these systems. Our goal was to understand the variability and range of potential error associated with using allometric relationships developed outside of urban environments. We compared biomass predictions from allometric relationships developed for urban trees in Fort Collins, Colorado to predictions from allometric equations from traditional forests, at both the individual species level and entire communities. A few of the equations from the literature predicted similar biomass to the urban-based predictions, but the range in variability for individual trees was over 300%. This variability declined at increasingly coarse scales, reaching as low as 60% for a street tree community containing 11 tree species and 10, 551 trees. When comparing biomass estimates between cities that implement various allometric relationships, we found that differences could be a function of variability rather than urban forest structure and function. Standardizing the methodology and implementing averaged equations across cities could be one potential solution to reducing variability; however, more accurate quantification of biomass and carbon storage in urban forests may depend on development of allometric relationships specifically for urban trees. 3aallometry 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acities 3aecosystems 3aequations 3aforests 3aprediction 3astreet trees 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aColorado 0aAllometric relationships 0aVolume equations 0aUrban forest1 aBurke, I.

Initial research involved physiological and cytological studies that have been reviewed earlier. This review provides an overview of the genetic and molecular analyses that have occurred in the past 25 years as well as perspectives on future directions. The interaction between B. lactucae and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is determined by an extensively characterized gene-for-gene relationship. Resistance genes have been cloned from L. sativa that encode proteins similar to resistance proteins isolated from other plant species. Avirulence genes have yet to be cloned from B. lactucae, although candidate sequences have been identified on the basis of motifs present in secreted avirulence proteins characterized from other oomycetes. Bremia lactucae has a minimum of 7 or 8 chromosome pairs ranging in size from 3 to at least 8 Mb and a set of linear polymorphic molecules that range in size between 0.3 and 1.6 Mb and are inherited in a non-Mendelian manner. Several methods indicated the genome size of B. lactucae to be ca. 50 Mb, although this is probably an underestimate, comprising approximately equal fractions of highly repeated sequences, intermediate repeats, and low-copy sequences. The genome of B. lactucae still awaits sequencing. To date, several EST libraries have been sequenced to provide an incomplete view of the gene space. Bremia lactucae has yet to be transformed, but regulatory sequences from it form components of transformation vectors used for other oomycetes. Molecular technology has now advanced to the point where rapid progress is likely in determining the molecular basis of specificity, mating type, and fungicide insensitivity. 3aproteins 3agene-for-gene relationship 3aregulatory sequences 3achromosomes 3aLactuca sativa 3adowny mildew 3afungicides 3aexpressed sequence tags 3amodels 3aBremia lactucae 3alettuce 0aOomycete 0agenes 0aResistance1 aWong, Joan 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2008 Sept., v. 122, no. 1 p.19-30dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-008-9305-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080801b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01989naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245007100175300001400246520082100260650002801081653002901109653002901138653001901167653001901186653001801205653002801223700001501251700002101266700001801287700001901305773015801324852000901482856009201491930003301583946001101616655001201627IND4408397820221121050133.0080801e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440839782DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0507.2008.01579.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTintelnot, Kathrin10aRe-identification of Pseudallescheria isolates after near-drowning  ap. 11-16.  aFungal infections caused by the members of the genera Pseudallescheria and/or Scedosporium are important complications in patients after near-drowning. As the taxonomy of Pseudallescheria and Scedosporium has been revised, clinical isolates from 11 patients, after near-drowning, previously identified as P. boydii or S. apiospermum had to be re-identified. S. apiospermum, now separated from P. boydii as a distinct species, was found most frequently (n = 8), while S. aurantiacum, recently described as new species and P. boydii were less common (n = 2 and n = 1, respectively). Three patients near-drowned during the Tsunami 2004 were infected by different species of the P. boydii complex.

The diabetic patient exhibits a pathological coagulation state, with an increased synthesis of coagulation factors and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) as well as an enhanced aggregation of platelets. Previous studies have shown that C-peptide can reduce leucocyte-endothelial cell interaction and improve microvascular blood flow in patients with type 1 diabetes. In the present study, we examined in vivo whether C-peptide is able to reduce platelet activation and through that microvascular thrombus formation. Materials and methods In the microvessels of cremaster muscle preparations taken from normal and diabetic mice, ferric chloride-induced thrombus formation was analysed using intravital fluorescence microscopy. Results I.V. administration of C-peptide in high dose (70 nmol/kg), but not in low dose (7 nmol/kg), caused a significant delay in arteriolar and venular thrombus growth in normal and diabetic mice. This effect was repressed by cremaster muscle superfusion with insulin (100 μU/ml) in diabetic animals, but particularly in normal animals. In parallel, immunohistochemistry demonstrated a higher number of PAI-1-expressing vessels in cremaster muscle tissue from control animals and from animals treated with C-peptide and insulin compared with tissue from animals with C-peptide treatment application alone. Conclusions/interpretation We conclude that C-peptide possesses antithrombotic actions in vivo. A causal role of PAI-1 in this scenario needs to be further addressed. However, the reversal of C-peptide action by insulin may invalidate the use of this peptide as a treatment option to improve rheology and microcirculation in diabetic patients. 3adiabetes 3astreptozotocin 3ac-peptide 2aAnimals 2aC-Peptidextherapeutic use 2aDiabetes Mellitusxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFlow Cytometry 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aInsulinxpharmacology 2aMice 2aMicrocirculationxdrug effects 2aP-Selectinxmetabolism 2aPlasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1xmetabolism 2aPlatelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complexxmetabolism 2aThrombosisxcomplicationsxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 0ainsulin 0aPlatelets 0aMicrovascular thrombosis 0aIn vivo microscopy1 aBraun, B. 1 aMenger, M.

Sources of fecal bacteria in the Hickory Grove Lake watershed include unpermitted septic systems, manure applications in the watershed, livestock access to streams, waterfowl, and wildlife. The Lake Inlet, Lake Outlet, and Lake Beach were monitored for E. coli concentrations from 2010-2012, this monitoring data was used to assess relationships between watershed bacteria loads and the beach bacteria levels. Fecal bacteria from waterfowl were identified as the major source to the Lake Beach causing the water quality impairment. The bacteria TMDL for the Hickory Grove Lake beach was set at 1.87E+11 orgs/day for the single sample maximum target and 1.01E+11 orgs/day for the geometric mean target, which correlates to the presence of fewer than five resident geese. Monitoring recommendations to support this approach include weekly beach water quality monitoring and post-event sampling; periodic spatial sampling of the lake; weekly and post-event grab sampling of the water quality at the lake inlet mixing zones; and weekly and post-event grab sampling of the water quality at the lake outlet. 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3acase studies 3ageese 3alakes 3amixing 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aseptic systems 3astreams 3atotal maximum daily load 3awater quality 3awaterfowl 3awatersheds 3awildlife 3aIowa1 aSoupir, Michelle L.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2015 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.73-82dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.31.10427  aDNAL 7aarticle01851naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245007200165300001600237520091800253650002201171650002001193653001801213700002301231700002101254700001801275773011801293852000901411856008501420930003301505946001101538655001201549IND4443748120221120212800.0101015e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444374812DNAL7 a10.2478/s11536-009-0134-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiskin, Turgut 10aTrauma to transplanted kidney with open fractures: Report of a case  ap. 716-718.  aA 45 year-old man, who had undergone kidney transplantation 7 years prior, was admitted to hospital after a motorcycle accident.

Open fractures of long bones provide a higher risk of sepsis in transplant patients than closed fractures. 3akidney transplant 3aanimal injuries 0aOpen fracture1 aAydin, Cemalettin 1 aKayaalp, Cuneyt 1 aSumer, Fatih 0 tCentral European journal of medicine.g2010 Dec., v. 5, no. 6 p.716-718dHeidelberg : SP Versitax1895-10587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11536-009-0134-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02570naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002100141245009900162300001500261520145000276650002101726650001601747650001701763650002101780650001301801650002501814650001501839650001301854700002201867700001801889700002401907700001901931700002501950700001901975773014901994856004402143852000902187655001202196IND4522903020221120191414.0150814e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452290302DNAL7 a10.13031/aea.31.107312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, Philip J.10aWater Deficit and Nitrogen Fertilizer Effects on NDVI of Tifton 85 Bermudagrassduring Regrowth  ap. 97-102.  aA better understanding of how bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) regrowth is influenced by production inputs will aid in advancing precision management. The objectives were to evaluate the effect of irrigation and nitrogen (N) on normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) during regrowth and evaluate the relationship between NDVI during regrowth to forage yield. Normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) data were collected in an experiment evaluating two harvest schedules (four or eight week), four rates of irrigation (0, 4.2, 8.4, or 12.5 mm of water each irrigation event), and three rates of N (season total of 168, 336, and 504 kg N ha-1). Both irrigation and N influenced NDVI of bermudagrass during the regrowth periods of both the four- and eight-week harvest schedules, but there were no irrigation by N interactions. As was expected, regrowth (as measured by NDVI) in response to irrigation was dependent on the timing and duration of rain-free periods within the regrowth periods. Generally, NDVI increased with increasing N rate at most sampling dates. Regression slopes of yield versus NDVI measured near the end of the regrowth period were higher for the eight-week harvest schedule than for the four-week schedule. Within each harvest schedule, however; slopes were similar. The high correlation coefficients between NDVI late in the regrowth period and yield suggest NDVI is a useful tool for managing bermudagrass harvests. 3aCynodon dactylon 3acorrelation 3aforage yield 3airrigation rates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aobjectives 3aregrowth1 aStone, Kenneth C.1 aAndrae, John,1 aBusscher, Warren J.1 aMillen, Joseph1 aStrickland, Ernie E.1 aEvans, Dean E.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2015 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.97-102dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.31.10731  aDNAL 7aarticle03420naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245009000180300001600270520176700286650001702053650002002070650002602090650002502116650001402141650001002155650001402165650001202179650001702191650000902208650001802217650002802235650002402263650000902287650002202296650003802318650002002356650002202376650004202398650002802440653001802468653001602486700001702502700002002519700001802539700001702557700001502574773012702589852000902716856008502725930003302810946001102843655001202854IND4443745320221120191432.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444374532DNAL7 a208624962pmid7 a10.1007/s00438-010-0575-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lanzhi 10aGene actions at loci underlying several quantitative traits in two elite rice hybrids  ap. 383-397.  aTo understand the gene activities controlling nine important agronomic quantitative traits in rice, we applied a North Carolina design 3 (NC III design) analysis to recombinant inbred lines (RILs) in highly heterotic inter- (IJ) and intra-subspecific (II) hybrids by performing the following tasks: (1) investigating the relative contribution of additive, dominant, and epistatic effects for performance traits by generation means analysis and variance component estimates; (2) detecting the number, genomic positions, and genetic effects of QTL for phenotypic traits; and (3) characterizing their mode of gene action. Under an F∞-metric, generation means analysis and variance components estimates revealed that epistatic effects prevailed for the majority of traits in the two hybrids. QTL analysis identified 48 and 66 main-effect QTL (M-QTL) for nine traits in IJ and II hybrids, respectively. In IJ hybrids, 20 QTL (41.7%) showed an additive effect of gene actions, 20 (41.7%) showed partial-to-complete dominance, and 8 (16.7%) showed overdominance. In II hybrids, 34 QTL (51.5%) exhibited additive effects, 14 (21.2%) partial-to-complete dominance, and 18 (27.3%) overdominance. There were 153 digenic interactions (E-QTL) in the IJ hybrid and 252 in the II hybrid. These results suggest that additive effects, dominance, overdominance, and particularly epistasis attribute to the genetic basis of the expression of traits in the two hybrids. Additionally, we determined that the genetic causes of phenotypic traits and their heterosis are different. In the plants we studied, the phenotypic traits investigated and their heterosis were conditioned by different M-QTL and E-QTL, respectively, and were mainly due to non-allelic interactions (epistasis). 3aOryza sativa 3aadditive effect 3aadditive gene effects 3aanalysis of variance 3aepistasis 3agenes 3aheterosis 3ahybrids 3ainbred lines 3aloci 3aoverdominance 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits 3arice 2aChimeraxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Variation 2aOryzaxanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 0aNC III design 0aGene action1 aLu, Kaiyang 1 aChen, Zhaoming 1 aMou, Tongmin 1 aHu, Zhongli 1 aLi, Xinqi 0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2010 Nov., v. 284, no. 5 p.383-397dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-010-0575-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02544naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001500141245012400156300001600280520153900296650002501835650002301860650001101883650002401894650001501918700001401933700001901947700002001966700001301986700001601999773015002015856004402165852000902209655001202218IND4522903520221120175609.0150814e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452290352DNAL7 a10.13031/aea.31.108532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Luyu10aEffects of Configuration and Headspace Mixing on the Accuracy of Closed Chambers for DairyFarm Gas Emission Measurement  ap. 153-162.  aThis study was aimed at evaluating the influence of chamber configuration (enclosure area and height), the use of a mixing fan and the wind speed induced by the fan at the emitting surface (head space mixing) on the accuracy for the closed chamber in gas emission measurement at low emission rates (=3000 g SF6 m-2 h-1). A calibration system was designed to generate a reference flux, and SF6 was used as the target gas. Accuracy or chamber performance was defined based on the agreement between the calculated reference and chamber fluxes, which were not affected by chamber configuration. Four unvented closed chambers with two floor diameters (300 and 400 mm) and three different heights (200, 300, and 400 mm) were tested at seven different emission rates (from 684 +/- 72 to 2958 +/- 144 g m-2 h-1). Chamber configuration was correlated with the reference flux of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and the tested chambers underestimated the reference fluxes by 21.5% +/-13.6% (average +/- SD). Chamber enclosure area did not affect the chamber performance while the height significantly impacted measurement accuracy. A chamber height of 300 mm was recommended to measure low gas emission rates. The positive air pressure induced by the mixing fan in the headspace increased with the fan speed, but the chamber performance was not affected by the mixing fan at lower emission rates. For our tested conditions, a mixing fan was not necessary and a vent opening balancing the air pressure inside and outside a chamber was not recommended. 3aatmospheric pressure 3aheadspace analysis 3amixing 3asulfur hexafluoride 3awind speed1 aLu, Qikun1 aWang, Chaoyuan1 aShi, Zhengxiang1 aCao, Wei1 aLi, Baoming0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2015 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.153-162dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.31.10853  aDNAL 7aarticle04017naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245010900180300001600289520193500305650001902240650001202259650001902271650001602290650000902306650001102315650001702326650001002343650001702353650001602370650001902386650001902405650001702424650001002441650001602451650000902467650001102476650002002487650001802507650002502525650003702550650001802587650002502605650002802630650002202658650002402680650002802704650001902732650004302751650003402794650002202828650007602850653002902926653001702955700001602972700001502988700001803003700002103021700001903042773010803061852000903169856008503178930003303263946001103296655001203307IND4409658220221120175509.0080830e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440965822DNAL7 a185842172pmid7 a10.1007/s00572-008-0180-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Min 10aInfluence of arbuscular mycorrhizae on photosynthesis and water status of maize plants under salt stress  ap. 287-296.  aThe influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus mosseae on characteristics of the growth, water status, chlorophyll concentration, gas exchange, and chlorophyll fluorescence of maize plants under salt stress was studied in the greenhouse. Maize plants were grown in sand and soil mixture with five NaCl levels (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 g/kg dry substrate) for 55 days, following 15 days of non-saline pretreatment. Under salt stress, mycorrhizal maize plants had higher dry weight of shoot and root, higher relative chlorophyll content, better water status (decreased water saturation deficit, increased water use efficiency, and relative water content), higher gas exchange capacity (increased photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, and decreased intercellular CO₂ concentration), higher non-photochemistry efficiency [increased non-photochemical quenching values (NPQ)], and higher photochemistry efficiency [increased the maximum quantum yield in the dark-adapted state (Fv/Fm), the maximum quantum yield in the light-adapted sate (Fv'/Fm'), the actual quantum yield in the light-adapted steady state ([Greek Phi symbol]PSII) and the photochemical quenching values (qP)], compared with non-mycorrhizal maize plants. In addition, AM symbiosis could trigger the regulation of the energy biturcation between photochemical and non-photochemical events reflected in the deexcitation rate constants (kN, kN', kP, and kP'). All the results show that G. mosseae alleviates the deleterious effect of salt stress on plant growth, through improving plant water status, chlorophyll concentration, and photosynthetic capacity, while the influence of AM symbiosis on photosynthetic capacity of maize plants can be indirectly affected by soil salinity and mycorrhizae-mediated enhancement of water status, but not by the mycorrhizae-mediated enhancement of chlorophyll concentration and plant biomass. 3aGlomus mosseae 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3afungi 3agas exchange 3agreenhouses 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3aplant growth 3aroots 3asalt stress 3asand 3ashoots 3asodium chloride 3asoil salinity 3astomatal conductance 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awater content 3awater use efficiency 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aFungixphysiology 2aHeat-Shock Response 2aMycorrhizaexphysiology 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aWaterxphysiology 2aZea maysxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 0aChlorophyll fluorescence 0aWater status1 aTang, Ming 1 aChen, Hui 1 aYang, Baowei 1 aZhang, Fengfeng 1 aHuang, Yanhui 0 tMycorrhiza.g2008 Sept., v. 18, no. 6-7 p.287-296dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0940-63607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-008-0180-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03516naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245011400162300001800276500001500294520214100309650001902450650001402469650001102483650002202494650001102516650002102527650001502548650001002563650001402573650001302587650002602600650002202626650001302648650001802661650002202679650001202701650001802713650001602731650001602747650001502763650002102778653001702799700001902816773007102835852000902906930003302915945002502948946001302973655001202986IND4386132420221120172002.0061219e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438613242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A potential source of winter hardiness is G. coccinea Pursh., a polyploid widely distributed in North America; of particular interest are autotetraploid populations of G. coccinea from Minnesota. To facilitate interspecific hybridization, a tetraploid G. lindheimeri would be advantageous. Two G. lindheimeri genotypes, MN selections 443-1 and 01G-02, were treated with two different antimitotic agents at two concentrations, trifluralin-15 and 30 micromolar and colchicine-0.25 and 1.25 mM, along with appropriate controls, to determine the frequency of chromosome doubling. Two-node stem sections were treated for 12, 24, or 48 h and then rooted and grown to flowering. Pollen diameter was measured as an indicator of chromosome doubling in cell layer LII, and morphologic characteristics (days to flower, flower size, plant height, inflorescence height, and plant width) were recorded for all plants. Chromosome doubling was not observed in any plant treated with trifluralin. Based on pollen diameter, genotype 443-1 only had chromosome doubling in the colchicine 1.25 mM concentration when treated for 12 h. All durations of colchicine at 1.25 mM were successful for genotype 01G-02 as well as a small percent treated with colchicine at 0.25 mM treated for 48 h. Autotetraploid plants (2n = 4x = 28) had larger flowers in both genotypes, and autotetraploid derivatives of genotype 01G-02 flowered earlier and were taller than diploid plants. Conformation changes from three-lobed to four-lobed pollen grains were observed when pollen diameter approached that expected of 2n pollen. Visual screening of pollen for conformation changes can quickly determine if chromosome doubling in cell layer LII has occurred. With the autotetraploid G. lindheimeri derived from colchicine application, crosses can be performed with autotetraploid G. coccinea to introgress cold tolerance. Additional breeding can also be done at the tetraploid level to develop new autotetraploid cultivars of G. lindheimeri. 3ainflorescences 3aflowering 3aheight 3aGaura lindheimeri 3apollen 3aapplication rate 3aperennials 3astems 3aphenology 3agenotype 3ain vitro regeneration 3aornamental plants 3adiameter 3anursery crops 3achromosome number 3arooting 3aculture media 3atrifluralin 3atetraploidy 3acolchicine 3aplant morphology 0aplant growth1 aAnderson, N.O.0 tHortScience.g2006 Dec., v. 41, no. 7 p.1656-1661x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20070904b20071002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/04/16  aOther US 7aarticle03123naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100004300145245013600188300001600324520166100340650002702001650002002028650001302048650001202061650001202073650001402085650001502099650001002114650001802124650002702142650001402169650001102183650001602194650001502210650001002225650001302235651001102248653002402259653002302283653001302306653003002319700003002349773011202379852000902491856008502500930003302585946001102618655001202629IND4409134620221120120821.0080815e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440913462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-007-9411-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBittencourt, Juliana Vitória Messias 10aPollen movement within a continuous forest of wind-pollinated Araucaria angustifolia, inferred from paternity and TwoGener analysis  ap. 855-868.  aAs a matter of fact, Araucaria angustifolia populations occur predominately in small and isolated stands; only a minor number of continuous natural forests of this dioecious wind-pollinated coniferous tree species remain. To implement reasonable conservation, breeding and restorations program it is necessary to have the knowledge of pollen dispersal distance and fine-scale genetic structure. In this paper, levels and dispersion distance of pollen and spatial genetic structure of A. angustifolia were investigated in a 14 ha transect in a continuous forest in Paraná State, Brazil. Analyses have been performed by the use of eight microsatellite loci, paternity and TwoGener approaches, and spatial autocorrelation analysis. In transect, 52 male and 56 female adult trees were mapped and genotyped, together with 190 seeds. In the present transect, A. angustifolia show spatial genetic structure at distances up to 75 m. Paternity analysis indicated that 54% of seeds were fertilized by pollen from trees outside the transect. The calculated average pollination distance within transect was 102 and 98 m based on the paternity analysis and TwoGener analysis, respectively. We found a significant pollen gene pool structure across seed-trees ( [graphic removed] , P < 0.01) that corresponds to an effective number of pollen donors of 6.4 male trees or an effective pollination neighbourhood area (A ep ) of 2.1 ha. The findings suggest long-distance pollen dispersion (>100 m) inside the continuous forest. However, the high proportion occurs in short-distance producing biparental and correlated mating as well as reducing the variance effective size. 3aAraucaria angustifolia 3aautocorrelation 3abreeding 3afemales 3aforests 3agene pool 3agenotyping 3amales 3amature plants 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apaternity 3apollen 3apollen flow 3aseed trees 3aseeds 3avariance 3aBrazil 0aMicrosatellite loci 0aPaternity analysis 0aTwoGener 0aSpatial genetic structure1 aSebbenn, Alexandre Magno 0 tConservation genetics.g2008 Aug., v. 9, no. 4 p.855-868dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1566-06217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-007-9411-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03553naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245016500186300001600351520132400367650001101691650003601702650001701738650001001755650001901765650001101784650001801795650001501813650001301828650004301841650001401884650005201898650002601950650001201976650001501988650003102003650004602034650001102080650003902091650001102130650002502141650002602166650005702192650003102249650006102280650003202341650002302373653001802396653002702414653002602441653001602467700002702483700002602510700002002536700002402556700002702580773013402607852000902741856008502750930003302835946001102868655001202879IND4401014420221120085219.0080203e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440101442DNAL7 a161896792pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-005-0067-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSehringer, Bernd 10aEvaluation of different strategies for real-time RT-PCR expression analysis of corticotropin-releasing hormone and related proteins in human gestational tissues  ap. 768-775.  aIn this article real-time quantitative RT-PCR strategies for investigation of mRNA distribution in stress-related corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP), and CRH receptors (CRH-R1, CRH-R2) in human gestational tissues are described. The effect of sample and RNA preparation, reverse transcription, and the quantitation strategy were investigated. Both thawing of the sample before homogenization and the RT reaction were identified as critical steps. In contrast, the time-lag from the biopsy until snap-freezing and the homogenization procedure had little effect. The “housekeeping” gene cyclophilin was found to be differently expressed in gestational tissues, compromising its use as internal reference. For relative quantitation of mRNA levels by TaqMan PCR the standard curve method and the comparative C T method (ΔΔC T or ΔC T' method) were compared. Both calculation strategies delivered similar relative mRNA amounts in identifying the placenta as the main source of CRH and CRH-BP mRNA compared with myometrium and decidua. Consistent results were also obtained for CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 by both methods of calculation. We conclude that the simpler comparative C T method is adequate for assessing the mRNA levels of CRH, CRH-BP, and CRH receptors in human gestational tissues. 3abiopsy 3acorticotropin-releasing hormone 3acyclophilins 3agenes 3ahomogenization 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3amyometrium 3aplacenta 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areceptors 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcription 3athawing 2aAlgorithms 2aCarrier Proteinsxanalysis 2aCorticotropin-Releasing Hormonexanalysis 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Profilingxmethods 2aHumans 2aPlacentaxmetabolism 2aPregnancyxmetabolism 2aReceptors, Corticotropin-Releasing Hormonexanalysis 2aReproducibility of Results 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aUterusxmetabolism 0aReal-time PCR 0aComparative C T method 0aStandard curve method 0aCyclophilin1 aZahradnik, Hans Peter 1 aDeppert, Wolfgang R. 1 aSimon, Michael 1 aNoethling, Claudia 1 aSchaefer, Wolfgang R. 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2005 Nov., v. 383, no. 5 p.768-775dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-005-0067-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03130naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010000174300001800274520204800292650001502340650000902355650002402364650002002388650001102408650003202419650001302451650000902464650001302473651001202486700002402498700002502522773017302547856005102720852000902771655001202780IND60355215520221120085303.0150814e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6035521552DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-5092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSreedharan, Aswathy10aSalmonella Transfer Potential onto Tomatoes during Laboratory-Simulated In-Field Debris Removal  ap. 1062-1068.  aFlorida Tomato Good Agricultural Practices (T-GAPs) mandate the removal of dirt and debris from tomatoes during harvest but do not provide any specific regulations or guidance; thus, the current practice of using cloths needs to be evaluated. This study examined Salmonella transfer from inoculated green tomatoes to uninoculated cloths and from inoculated cloths to uninoculated tomatoes, upon single and multiple touches. Tomatoes were spot inoculated with a rifampin-resistant Salmonella cocktail (107 CFU per tomato) and were touched with cloth (clean, dirty-dry, dirty-wet) at 0, 1, or 24 h postinoculation. Salmonella was enumerated on tryptic soy agar, followed by enrichments when necessary. The transfer direction was then reversed by touching freshly inoculated cloths with uninoculated tomatoes. Transfer coefficients (TCs) were then calculated. Salmonella TCs from inoculated tomato and cloth were highest when the inoculum was wet (0.44 Â± 0.13 to 0.32 Â± 0.12), regardless of the condition of the cloth. Although Salmonella TCs from inoculated tomato to uninoculated cloth decreased significantly when the inoculum was dried (0.17 Â± 0.23 to 0.01 Â± 0.00), low levels of Salmonella were detected on cloth even after 24 h of drying. Inoculated dirty cloth did not transfer more Salmonella compared with inoculated clean cloth, and Salmonella survival was not higher on dirty cloth. When inoculated clean cloth (wet) was touched with 25 tomatoes, significantly higher levels of Salmonella were transferred to the first, second, and fourth tomatoes (0.03 Â± 0.10 to 0.09 Â± 0.02). However, inoculated dirty-wet (below limit of detection) and dirty-dry (0.00 to 0.04 Â± 0.01) cloths transferred similar levels of Salmonella to all 25 tomatoes. Results indicate a low risk of potential Salmonella contamination when the same cloth is used multiple times for debris removal, especially under high moisture levels. Results also show that the use of dirty cloths did not increase the risk of Salmonella cross-contamination. 3aSalmonella 3aagar 3across contamination 3adetection limit 3adrying 3agood agricultural practices 3ainoculum 3arisk 3atomatoes 3aFlorida1 aSchneider, Keith R.1 aDanyluk, Michelle D.0 tJournal of food protection.g2014 July, v. 77, no. 7 p.1062-1068dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-509  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100003400142245011400176520102700290592002801317650001701345650001401362650001701376650001901393650002401412650002701436650001901463650001601482653002001498653001301518653001401531700002501545700001801570773010301588856007801691852000901769655001201778IND4463789720221120232715.0160209e20120118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446378972DNAL7 a10.1515/1556-3758.21512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAugusto, Pedro Esteves Duarte10aUsing the Mitschka-Briggs-Steffe Method for Evaluation of Cactus Pear Concentrated Pulps Rheological Behavior  aThe rheological characterization of food is important for efficient product and process design. Although its importance in semi-arid regions, there are only a few studies regarding the rheological properties of cactus pear products in the literature. The present work has used the Mitschka-Briggs-Steffe method for evaluation of the rheological behavior of cactus pear concentrated pulps. The pulps have shown pseudoplastic behavior. The flow behavior index (n) shows a constant value in the evaluated conditions, and its average value was considered in the evaluated temperature and concentration range. The consistency index (k) has shown dependency of concentration and temperature, being well modeled by a modified Arrhenius equation. Thus, the rheological parameters of cactus pear concentrated pulps can be obtained using a single equation, related with temperature, concentration and shear rate. The obtained data are potentially useful for future studies on product development, food properties and process design.  aPublisher supplied data 3acactus pears 3aequations 3afood quality 3aprocess design 3aproduct development 3arheological properties 3asemiarid zones 3atemperature 0afood properties 0arheology 0aviscosity1 aCristianini, Marcelo1 aIbarz, Albert0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2012 Jan. 18, v. 7, no. 6dDe Gruyterx1556-37587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/1556-3758.21513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006800165300001600233520140500249592002801654596007201682650001301754650002601767650001101793650002401804650002501828650001401853650002601867650002601893650001601919650001001935650000901945650002401954650001301978650002001991650002702011650002202038700001702060700001702077700001102094700001502105700001802120700001702138700001802155773012802173856008102301852000902382655001202391IND60616890720221121114908.0181021e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061689072DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-018-3782-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKou, Xinchang10aSoil micro-food web interactions and rhizosphere priming effect  ap. 129-142.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The rhizosphere priming effect (RPE) is the stimulation or suppression of soil organic matter decomposition by living roots and associated rhizosphere organisms. The RPE is pivotal in regulating biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. However, biological mechanisms, especially soil micro-food web interactions, behind the RPE remain largely unknown. METHODS: We quantified the RPE of soybean and cottonwood at three growth stages using a natural ¹³C tracer method, measured soil microbial and nematode community composition, and investigated their relations with the RPE. RESULTS: The magnitude of the RPE varied widely at different growth stages. Soybean produced a greater cumulative RPE than cottonwood. The plant species effect was also observed in the bacterial PLFA with higher values found in the soybean treatment. Mantel test analysis suggested that the variations in microbial community were closely related with the RPE, soil and plant characteristics. The nematode community affected the RPE indirectly through altering the structure of the microbial community. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the RPE was connected with interactions of soil micro-food webs. This connection indicates that soil micro-food web interactions in the rhizosphere may either regulate microbial turnover and/or microbial community composition, subsequently modulating the RPE.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0200602cNational Key Research and Development Plan of China 3aNematoda 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3adevelopmental stages 3afood webs 3amicrobial communities 3aplant characteristics 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asoil 3asoil organic matter 3asoybeans 3astable isotopes 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atracer techniques1 aSu, Tongqing1 aMa, Ningning1 aLi, Qi1 aWang, Peng1 aWu, Zhengfang1 aLiang, Wenju1 aCheng, Weixin0 tPlant and soil.g2018 Nov., v. 432, no. 1-2 p.129-142dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-018-3782-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245010300202300001800305500002000323506007600343520136600419592002801785506003701813650002001850650001501870650002601885650003001911650002501941650002101966650001501987650001102002650001702013650001502030650001702045650001102062650003002073650001102103650001402114650001202128650001502140650002802155650001702183700002102200700002102221700001902242700002102261700002802282773013302310856007302443852000902516655001202525IND60649980320221207104618.0190709e20150604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064998032DNAL7 a10.3390/nu70644802doi7 aPMC44887972pmcid7 a260536172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Laura P.10aPrebiotics Modulate the Effects of Antibiotics on Gut Microbial Diversity and Functioning in Vitro  ap. 4480-4497.  aJournal Article  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIntestinal bacteria carry out many fundamental roles, such as the fermentation of non-digestible dietary carbohydrates to produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can affect host energy levels and gut hormone regulation. Understanding how to manage this ecosystem to improve human health is an important but challenging goal. Antibiotics are the front line of defence against pathogens, but in turn they have adverse effects on indigenous microbial diversity and function. Here, we have investigated whether dietary supplementation—another method used to modulate gut composition and function—could be used to ameliorate the side effects of antibiotics. We perturbed gut bacterial communities with gentamicin and ampicillin in anaerobic batch cultures in vitro. Cultures were supplemented with either pectin (a non-fermentable fibre), inulin (a commonly used prebiotic that promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria) or neither. Although antibiotics often negated the beneficial effects of dietary supplementation, in some treatment combinations, notably ampicillin and inulin, dietary supplementation ameliorated the effects of antibiotics. There is therefore potential for using supplements to lessen the adverse effects of antibiotics. Further knowledge of such mechanisms could lead to better therapeutic manipulation of the human gut microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3aampicillin 3abacterial communities 3abeneficial microorganisms 3adietary carbohydrate 3adigestive system 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3afermentation 3agentamicin 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ainulin 3apathogens 3apectins 3aprebiotics 3ashort chain fatty acids 3atherapeutics1 aWalton, Gemma E.1 aPsichas, Arianna1 aFrost, Gary S.1 aGibson, Glenn R.1 aBarraclough, Timothy G.0 tNutrients.g2015 June 04, v. 7, no. 6 p.4480-4497dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu70644803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009300163300001800256520095900274592002801233650001101261650001901272650001701291650001501308650001401323650001201337650002301349650001701372650001301389650001801402650001301420700002001433700002301453773009101476856008101567852000901648655001201657IND60440406520221119143132.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044040652DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-014-9569-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Gongshe12aA Promising Low Beta-Glucan Barley Mutation of m351 for Better Bioethanol Production Use  ap. 1158-1164.  aBioethanol is an important liquid fuel complement. Barley is a potential alternative raw material for ethanol production because its by-product is a nutritious feed. The barley m351mutant, which has a mutation for low beta-glucan content, was tested for its ethanol production efficiency and feed fraction quality in a pilot fermentation experiment. Grain samples of m351 and the corresponding wild type of Harrington were either treated or untreated with beta-glucanase during the ethanol production process. Compared to the corresponding wild-type line, m351 produced the same amount of ethanol. More importantly, the feed fraction derived from the fermentation process showed 5 % more protein and 7 % less beta-glucan than that from the wild type, indicating that the feed fraction from m351 was more valuable. The experiments provided evidence that m351 is a useful genetic resource for developing barley cultivars for use in bioethanol production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3abeta-glucanase 3abeta-glucans 3abioethanol 3acultivars 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3amutation 3araw materials 3asampling1 aTrupia, Sabrina1 aEllberg, Sherry R.0 tBioEnergy research.g2015 Sept., v. 8, no. 3 p.1158-1164dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-014-9569-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157100001200175245013400187300001800321500001500339520155900354592002801913650002601941650001701967650001601984650001502000650002202015650003802037650002402075650001202099650001202111650004302123650003302166650001302199650004702212650007002259650003402329650002902363650002202392650001102414650003402425650003602459650003902495650006202534650003702596653001602633700002102649700002002670700001702690773008902707856009202796852000902888655001202897IND4478123020221122065830.0141111e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447812302DNAL7 a223656972pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, A.10aOvarian hydrobursitis in female camels (Camelus dromedarius): The role of Chlamydophila abortus and a trial for medical treatment  ap. 1754-1758.  a2019-12-05  aThe occurrence of Chlamydophila abortus in female camels affected with ovarian hydrobursitis and a trial for medical treatment were studied. A total of 111 cases were included in two experiments. In Experiment 1, sera from 51 affected cases were tested for C. abortus antibody using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In Experiment 2, 60 female camels affected with bilateral ovarian hydrobursitis were divided into treated and control groups (n = 30 each). Based on the bursal diameter, females of both groups were subdivided into those having small (< 5 cm), medium (5–7 cm) or large (> 7 cm) bursae. Treated group received 20 mg/kg body weight oxytetracycline intramuscular, 4% lotagen intrauterine, and 500 μg cloprostenol intramuscular. Controls did not receive any treatment. All females were observed for 90 days non-return rate (NRR) and calving rate (CR). Antibodies against C. abortus were observed in 44/51 (86.3%) of the affected females. The 90 days NRR of the treated and control groups were 13/30 (43.3%) and 0/30 (0.0%), respectively, (P = 0.001), while the CR were 10/30 (33.3%) and 0/30 (0.0%), respectively, (P = 0.01). Based on bursal size, the 90 days NRR were 11/15 (73.3%), 2/7 (28.6%) and 0/8 (0.0%) for treated females having small, medium and large bursa, while the CR were 9/15 (60%), 1/7 (14.3%), and 0/8 (0.0%), respectively, (P = 0.01). In conclusion, it seems that C. abortus may be responsible for the spreading of the ovarian hydrobursitis syndrome in dromedaries. Small sized bursa could be medically treated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydophila abortus 3acalving rate 3abody weight 3aantibodies 3amedical treatment 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aCamelus dromedarius 3afemales 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aCamelus. 2aChlamydophilaxclassificationximmunology. 2aChlamydophila Infectionsxdrug therapyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aCloprostenolxtherapeutic use 2aCresolsxtherapeutic use 2aDrug Combinations 2aFemale 2aFormaldehydextherapeutic use 2aInfertility, Femalexveterinary 2aLuteolytic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aOvarian Diseasesxdrug therapyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aOxytetracyclinextherapeutic use 0adromedaries1 aAl-Sobayil, F.A.1 aHassanein, K.M.1 aAl-Hawas, A.0 tTheriogenology.g2012 June, v. 77, no. 9 p.1754-1758dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03948naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245008600206300001000292506007600302520220500378592002802583596004502611596003102656596002002687506003702707650001302744650002002757650002502777650002102802650003402823650001002857650001702867650001102884650002902895650001702924650001302941650002602954650000802980650002502988650002503013650001003038651001603048700002303064700002603087700002703113700002503140700002503165773010103190856008203291852000903373655001203382IND60627618520221207085536.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062761852DNAL7 a10.1186/s12937-018-0425-z2doi7 aPMC63236792pmcid7 a306217362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMertens, Elly10aFFQ versus repeated 24-h recalls for estimating diet-related environmental impact  ap. 2.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: There is an increasing interest in estimating environmental impact of individuals’ diets by using individual-level food consumption data. However, like assessment of nutrient intakes, these data are prone to substantial measurement errors dependent on the method of dietary assessment, and this often result in attenuation of associations. PURPOSE: To investigate the performance of a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for estimating the environmental impact of the diet as compared to independent 24-h recalls (24hR), and to study the association between environmental impact and dietary quality for the FFQ and 24hR. METHODS: We analysed cross-sectional data from 1169 men and women, aged 20–76 years, who participated in the NQplus study, the Netherlands. They completed a 216-item FFQ and two replicates of web-based 24hR. Life cycle assessments of 207 food products were used to calculate greenhouse gas emissions, fossil energy and land use, summarised into an aggregated score, pReCiPe. Validity of the FFQ was evaluated against 24hRs using correlation coefficients and attenuation coefficients. Associations with dietary quality were based on Dutch Healthy Diet 15-index (DHD15-index) and Nutrient Rich Diet score (NRD9.3). RESULTS: For pReCiPe, correlation coefficient between FFQ and 24hR was 0.33 when adjusted for covariates age, gender and BMI, and increased to 0.76 when de-attenuated for within-subject variation in the 24hR. Energy-adjustment slightly reduced these correlations (r = 0.71 for residuals of observed values and 0.59 for residuals of density values). Covariate-adjusted attenuation coefficient for the FFQ was 0.56 (ʎ₁ = 0.56 and ʎ₁ = 0.65 for observed and density residuals), slightly lower than without covariate adjustment. Diet-related environmental impact was inversely associated with the food-based DHD15-index for both FFQ and 24hR, while associations with the nutrient-based NRD9.3 were inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: The FFQ slightly underestimated environmental impact when compared to 24hR. Associations with dietary quality are highly dependent on the diet score used, and less dependent on the method of dietary assessment.  aPublisher supplied data  a633692cHorizon 2020 Framework Programme  a15SD01 (SHARP-BASIC)cTiFN  a91110030cZonMw0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3abody mass index 3aenvironmental impact 3afood consumption 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afoods 3afossil fuels 3agender 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahealthy diet 3aland use 3alife cycle assessment 3amen 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional adequacy 3awomen 3aNetherlands1 aKuijsten, Anneleen1 aGeleijnse, Johanna M.1 aBoshuizen, Hendriek C.1 aFeskens, Edith J.

However, maintaining enough viable cells on a sensor platform for a prolonged duration is a challenging task. In this study, key factors affecting the survival and growth of Ped-2E9 cells under modified conditions were investigated. When the Ped-2E9 cells were grown in media containing 5% fetal bovine serum in sealed tubes without any replenishment of nutrients or exogenous CO₂ supply, a large portion of the cells remained viable for 6 to 7 days and cells entered into G0/G1 resting phase. The media pH change was negligible and no cell death was observed in the first 4 days, then cells sequentially underwent apoptotic (fourth day onward) phase until day 7 after which a majority was dead. Subsequent cytotoxicity testing of 3- to 7-day stored Ped-2E9 cells sensitively detected virulent Listeria and Bacillus species. These data strongly suggest that Ped-2E9 cells can be maintained in viable state for 6 days in a sealed tube mimicking the environment in a potential sensor device for onsite use without the need for expensive cell culture facilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aapoptosis 3abiosensors 3acarbon dioxide 3acell culture 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3afetal bovine serum 3ahybridomas 3anutrients 3apH 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aBacillus cereusxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Toxinsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBiosensing Techniquesxmethods 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCell Line 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aDNAxmetabolism 2aHybridomasxcytologyxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aListeria monocytogenesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aTime Factors1 aMorgan, Mark T.1 aRickus, Jenna L.1 aRagheb, Kathy1 aCorvalán, C.q(Carlos),1 aRobinson, J.

Our case study describes two independent approaches to assess regional area of TOF as a means for the biomass production potential of TOF within a study region in Germany, the Göttingen district (area: 1,118 km²): (1) a statistical sampling with field inventory data, and (2) an area-wide GIS-mapping approach based on open-access aerial imagery. For our particular study, the differences between the mapping-based approach and the sample-based approach were minor (sampling: 24.37 ha and 16,670 t of dry wood per year with a relative standard error 11.6 % vs. area-wide mapping: 24.35 ha and 16,055 t; standard error not available). Due to a minor difference of only 3.7 % between the two approaches, we conclude that area-wide mapping serves as a sound basis for a quantification of bioenergy potentials from TOF. It also shown that only about 62 % of all TOF objects (74 % of the total annual biomass production) would be directly accessible via the existing road infrastructure (without heavy machinery). In terms of available end-use energy, the regional biomass potential translates to an annual amount of 233 TJ which, in turn, reflects only about 0.9 % of the annual end-use energy demand in the study area. This marginal contribution to the region’s energy supply is due to the fact that TOF covers only around 24 km² (~2 %) in our study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3abiomass production 3acase studies 3aenergy 3aforests 3ainfrastructure 3aremote sensing 3atrees 3awood 3aGermany1 aBusch, Gerald1 aKrause, Benjamin1 aBade, Claudia1 aFessel, Carola1 aKleinn, Christoph0 tBioEnergy research.g2015 Sept., v. 8, no. 3 p.1344-1351dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-015-9596-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245007100198300001800269500002000287506007600307520132400383592002801707506003701735650001201772650004501784650001101829650001301840650001201853650001801865650003001883650001301913650002301926650001501949650002001964650001701984650002302001650001002024650001502034650001602049650001502065650002402080650001402104650002002118650000902138650001502147650001502162650001102177650001602188650002102204700002102225700001402246700002502260700001602285700001902301700001902320773013302339856007302472852000902545655001202554IND60649980420221207110238.0190709e20150604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064998042DNAL7 a10.3390/nu70644982doi7 aPMC44887982pmcid7 a260536182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLysne, Vegard12aA Protein Extract from Chicken Reduces Plasma Homocysteine in Rats  ap. 4498-4511.  aJournal Article  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present study aimed to evaluate effects of a water-soluble protein fraction of chicken (CP), with a low methionine/glycine ratio, on plasma homocysteine and metabolites related to homocysteine metabolism. Male Wistar rats were fed either a control diet with 20% w/w casein as the protein source, or an experimental diet where 6, 14 or 20% w/w of the casein was replaced with the same amount of CP for four weeks. Rats fed CP had reduced plasma total homocysteine level and markedly increased levels of the choline pathway metabolites betaine, dimethylglycine, sarcosine, glycine and serine, as well as the transsulfuration pathway metabolites cystathionine and cysteine. Hepatic mRNA level of enzymes involved in homocysteine remethylation, methionine synthase and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase, were unchanged, whereas cystathionine gamma-lyase of the transsulfuration pathway was increased in the CP treated rats. Plasma concentrations of vitamin B2, folate, cobalamin, and the B-6 catabolite pyridoxic acid were increased in the 20% CP-treated rats. In conclusion, the CP diet was associated with lower plasma homocysteine concentration and higher levels of serine, choline oxidation and transsulfuration metabolites compared to a casein diet. The status of related B-vitamins was also affected by CP.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abetaine 3abetaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 3acasein 3achickens 3acholine 3acystathionine 3acystathionine gamma-lyase 3acysteine 3aexperimental diets 3afolic acid 3agene expression 3ahomocysteine 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amethionine 3amethionine synthase 3aoxidation 3aprotein sources 3arats 3ariboflavin 3asarcosines 3aserine 3avitamin B12 3awater solubility1 aBjørndal, Bodil1 aVik, Rita1 aNordrehaug, Jan Erik1 aSkorve, Jon1 aNygård, Ottar1 aBerge, Rolf K.0 tNutrients.g2015 June 04, v. 7, no. 6 p.4498-4511dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu70644983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245007300161300001400234520127700248592002801525650001501553650001201568650002201580650001701602650002701619650001401646650001501660650001701675650001501692650001801707650001701725650001801742650000901760653001801769653002701787653002601814653002801840700001301868700002001881700001901901773011201920856007702032852000902109655001202118IND60523744120221117214350.0160701e20160618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052374412DNAL7 a10.1515/aep-2016-00202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huyuan10aSewage sludge as barrier material for heavy metals in waste landfill  ap. 52-58.  aHeavy metal pollutants in the leachate of waste landfill are a potential threat to the environment. In this study, the feasibility of using municipal sewage sludge as barrier material for the containment of heavy metal pollutants from solid waste landfills was evaluated by compaction test and hydraulic conductivity test concerning compaction property, impermeability and heavy metal retardation. Results of the compaction test showed that the maximum dry density of 0.79 g·cm⁻³ was achieved at the optimum water content of about 60%. The hydraulic conductivities of compacted sewage sludge permeated with synthetic heavy metal solutions were in the range of 1.3×10⁻⁸ – 6.2×10⁻⁹ cm·s⁻¹, less than 1.0 ×10⁻⁷cm·s⁻¹ recommended by regulations for barrier materials. Chemical analyses on the effluent from the hydraulic conductivity tests indicated that the two target heavy metals, Zn and Cd in the permeants were all retarded by compacted sewage sludge, which might be attributed to the precipitation and adsorption of heavy metal ions. The results of this study suggest that specially prepared material from sewage sludge could be used as a barrier for waste landfills for its low permeability and strong retardation to heavy metal pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acadmium 3achemical analysis 3aheavy metals 3ahydraulic conductivity 3alandfills 3ametal ions 3apermeability 3apollutants 3asewage sludge 3asolid wastes 3awater content 3azinc 0asewage sludge 0ahydraulic conductivity 0aheavy metal pollution 0aheavy metal retardation1 aYang, Bo1 aZhang, Guangwei1 aZhang, Xuechao0 tArchives of environmental protection.g2016 June 18, v. 42, no. 2 p.52-58dDe Gruyter Openx2083-48107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/aep-2016-00203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002600191245010600217300001600323500001900339506007600358520151400434536016801948592002802116506003702144650001702181650001602198650002502214650001802239650000902257650001602266650001902282650001402301650001602315650001402331650002502345650002402370650000902394650001402403653002102417653002902438653006802467653002702535700002902562700002002591700001902611700001602630700002202646773013402668856008402802852000902886655001202895IND60692900920221207070812.0200503e20141102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069290092DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2014.9785392doi7 aPMC46840672pmcid7 a267407792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanawake, Aloka Lanka10aMapping QTLs for cold tolerance at germination and the early seedling stage in rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 989-998.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCold tolerance is an important breeding target in rice production. We studied quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling cold tolerance at germination (CTG) and early seedling (CTS) stages, using recombinant inbred lines derived from a japonica × indica cross. CTG was evaluated based on the percentage rate of germination at 15 °C for 12 days after pre-incubation of imbibed seeds at 20 °C for 2 days. For CTS, seven-day-old seedlings grown at 25 °C were subjected to two consecutive periods of three-day cold stress at 4 °C with an intervening eight-day recovery at 25 °C. CTS evaluation was according to an arbitrary five-point rating system at the fifth day of recovery after each stress period. No correlations were found between CTG and CTS, while a weak correlation was detected between CTS after the first and second stress. By the composite interval mapping, five QTLs for CTG explaining 5.7%–9.3% of the total phenotypic variance (PVE) and nine for CTS with PVE of 5.8%–35.6% were detected. Only one of these QTLs was common, indicating growth-stage specificity of cold tolerance. Four of the five QTLs after the second cold stress were different from the ones after the first cold stress. Analysis of variance test showed significant interactions between alleles at the QTL sites and the two stress conditions with respect to the mean CTS scores. A possible involvement of cold acclimation and usefulness of japonica germplasms in breeding for cold tolerance in indica rice was discussed.  aThis work was supported in part by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.

The hybrid method, involving the PROSAIL radiative transfer model and machine learning algorithms, has been widely applied for crop CCC retrieval. However, PROSAIL’s homogeneous canopy hypothesis limits the ability to use the PROSAIL-based CCC estimation across different crops with a row structure. In addition to leaf area index (LAI), average leaf angle (ALA) is the most important canopy structure factor in the PROSAIL model. Under the same LAI, adjustment of the ALA can make a PROSAIL simulation obtain the same canopy gap as the heterogeneous canopy at a specific observation angle. Therefore, parameterization of an adjusted ALA (ALAₐdⱼ) is an optimal choice to make the PROSAIL model suitable for specific row-planted crops. This paper attempted to improve PROSAIL-based CCC retrieval for different crops, using a random forest algorithm, by introducing the prior knowledge of crop-specific ALAₐdⱼ. Based on the field reflectance spectrum at nadir, leaf area index, and leaf chlorophyll content, parameterization of the ALAₐdⱼ in the PROSAIL model for wheat and soybean was carried out. An algorithm integrating the random forest and PROSAIL simulations with prior ALAₐdⱼ information was developed for wheat and soybean CCC retrieval. Ground-measured CCC measurements were used to validate the CCC retrieved from canopy spectra. The results showed that the ALAₐdⱼ values (62 degrees for wheat; 45 degrees for soybean) that were parameterized for the PROSAIL model demonstrated good discrimination between the two crops. The proposed algorithm improved the CCC retrieval accuracy for wheat and soybean, regardless of whether continuous visible to near-infrared spectra with 50 bands (RMSE from 39.9 to 32.9 μg cm⁻²; R² from 0.67 to 0.76) or discrete spectra with 13 bands (RMSE from 43.9 to 33.7 μg cm⁻²; R² from 0.63 to 0.74) and nine bands (RMSE from 45.1 to 37.0 μg cm⁻²; R² from 0.61 to 0.71) were used. The proposed hybrid algorithm, based on PROSAIL simulations with ALAₐdⱼ, has the potential for satellite-based CCC estimation across different crop types, and it also has a good reference value for the retrieval of other crop parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acanopy gaps 3achlorophyll 3aleaf angle 3aleaf area index 3aleaf chlorophyll content 3amodels 3aradiative transfer 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asatellites 3asoybeans 3awheat1 aSun, Qi 1 aZhang, Bing 1 aHuang, Wenjiang 1 aYe, Huichun 1 aZhang, Zhaoming 1 aZhang, Xiao 1 aQian, Binxiang 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Dec. 25, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140100983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245014900182300001500331520104400346592002801390650002101418650002301439650001601462650001101478650001201489650001101501650002001512650002201532650001001554650000901564650001201573650002101585650002401606650000701630650001301637650001101650650000901661650002401670650001801694650002301712650002101735650008301756650004401839650001301883650002801896650008501924650003902009650002702048650002602075700001202101700001702113700001702130700001702147773014102164852000902305856008202314655001202396IND4387225020221119234046.0200207e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438722502DNAL7 a170438192pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-006-0635-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhiqiang10aCloning, sequencing, and expression of a novel epoxide hydrolase gene from Rhodococcus opacus in Escherichia coli and characterization of enzyme  ap. 99-106.  aAn epoxide hydrolase gene of about 0.8 kb was cloned from Rhodococcus opacus ML-0004, and the open reading frame (ORF) sequence predicted a protein of 253 amino acids with a molecular mass of about 28 kDa.

This study aimed at identifying i) relevant information that can be observed from UAV images by two kind of stakeholders : growers and advisers (G&A) ii) the most suitable periods for this observation iii) and the added value this information can have for both G&A daily tasks. This approach has been conducted on an 11.3 ha commercial vineyard representative of the south of France vineyards. UAV-based visible images (2.5 cm resolution) have been acquired in commercial conditions every two weeks from budburst to harvest. Images have been presented to two groups of G&A six times during the growing season. Every expert gathering was conducted with i) an individual period where images were presented to each expert ii) a collective period where G&As were invited to share information. Application of this methodology demonstrated that much information about the vines, the soil and the vineyard environment can be extracted from UAV-based visible images without any image processing. Results showed that this information have added value all along the growing cycle of the vine, particularly for advisers.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrowers 3agrowing season 3aharvesting 3aimage analysis 3asoil 3astakeholders 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3avines 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3aFrance 0aUAV 0aprecision viticulture 0aexpertise gathering1 aBesqueut, G.1 aTisseyre, B.0 tAdvances in animal biosciences.g2017 July, v. 8, no. 2 p.823-827dCambridge University PresswJournal:6188x2040-47197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S20404700170011943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245009500176520138300271592002801654650001701682650001701699650003901716650002101755650001801776650001701794650003301811650002001844650001401864650001501878650001301893650001601906650000901922653000901931653001501940653002601955653001701981653001701998653001902015700001802034700002202052700003202074700001802106700003002124773012502154856008302279852000902362655001202371IND60770128120221120222813.0220621e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077012812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1045152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLelis, Carini Aparecida10aFluorescence spectroscopy in tandem with chemometric tools applied to milk quality control  aFluorescence spectroscopy with chemometric tools was used to check the milk authentication against the fraudulent addition of whey. Different commercial kinds of milk were adulterated with whey at five different levels. The fluorescence spectra of the adulterated samples showed different emission profiles when excited at the wavelength associated with tryptophan residues (295 nm). The addition of whey caused a reduction in fluorescence intensity. Nevertheless, visual inspection was not enough to discriminate between adulterations or milk types. Initial principal component analysis (PCA) explained 98.21% of the variance, PC1 (96.23%) enabled discrimination between genuine and adulterated milk, and PC2 (1.98%) discriminated by fat content in milk. However, supervised methods allowed for more efficient performances. Among the tested techniques, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) allowed better classification than most evaluated approaches to soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA). Overall, PLS-DA also showed better accuracy than SIMCA for classifying genuine and adulterated milk, with 100% predictive accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for whole and skim milk. Despite demonstrating suitable classification (>80%) of genuine and adulterated milk, it was not possible to classify the samples according to the level of adulteration.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemometrics 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afood composition 3alipid content 3amilk quality 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquality control 3askim milk 3atryptophan 3avariance 3awavelengths 3awhey 0aWhey 0aTryptophan 0aMultivariate analysis 0aAuthenticity 0aAdulteration 0aScreening tool1 aGalvan, Diego1 aTessaro, Letícia1 ade Andrade, Jelmir Craveiro1 aMutz, Yhan S.1 aConte-Junior, Carlos Adam0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2022 June, v. 109 p.104515-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1045153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01881naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245005200171300001800223520071300241592002800954650002500982650001401007650001201021650001101033650001901044650001401063650001101077650001701088650001501105650001301120650001301133650000901146650000901155651001801164700002101182700002901203700001501232700001901247773009101266856008101357852000901438655001201447IND60440406920221119143458.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044040692DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-015-9597-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStraker, Kaitlin C.10aBlack Locust as a Bioenergy Feedstock: a Review  ap. 1117-1135.  aShort rotation woody bioenergy crops (SRWC) could contribute a substantial portion of the biomass required to meet federal mandates and offset carbon emissions. One SRWC with strong bioenergy potential is black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.), planted extensively for wood and energy applications globally, but under-studied in its native US. This member of the Fabaceae family can fix nitrogen, tolerate stress, and sequester carbon while generating biomass yields up to 14 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹.

In this work, the expression profiles of innate rice immunity related genes were examined in the mediated resistance response of true/field resistance genes. Three sets of rice near-isogenic lines (NILs) were used: the resistant NILs carrying true resistance genes in the genetic background of the susceptible cultivar Nipponbare (NB), NB-Pib, NB-Pizt, NB-Pik and NB-Pita2; NILs bearing field resistance genes pi21 in the susceptible cultivar Aichiasahi (AA) AA-pi21, Kahei (KHR). The marker gene OsWRKY45 of salicylic acid (SA) signalling was upregulated in all tested cultivars. And, JAmyb (marker gene of jasmonic acid signalling) showed higher upregulation in the resistance lines with nucleotide-binding sites and leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) R genes Pib, Pizt, Pik, Pita2 and Pikahei than in NB and KHS. SalT of abscisic acid (ABA) signalling may be involved in the R/Avr interaction, including Pizt, Pik, pi21 and Pikahei. However, SalT was shown to negatively regulate Pib/AvrPib interaction. OsPR1b and PBZ1 were differentially expressed and strongly activated at a later stage by 48 h post-inoculation. Interestingly, there was evidence that OsPR1b and PBZ1 played an important role in the pi21-mediated response. It was shown that OsRAR1 could be upregulated in the true resistance line NB-Pita2 and the field resistance line KHR, while OsSGT1 and OsHSP90 could be upregulated in all tested lines. The involvement of these genes illustrated the complexity of the downstream signalling pathways in the mediated resistance response of true/field resistance genes.  aThis research was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation of China [grant number 31370306]; Project from Department of Human Resources and Social Security of China [grant number BZY12005]; the National Transgenic Research Project [grant number 2014ZX08009004B]; Hubei Provincial National Science Project [grant number 2013CFA098].  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabscisic acid 3abiotechnology 3ablast disease 3acultivars 3aequipment 3agenetic background 3agenetic markers 3ainnate immunity 3ajasmonic acid 3arice 3asalicylic acid 0arice blast disease 0atrue resistance 0afield resistance 0asignalling pathway1 aQin, Yonghua1 aHan, Jingluan1 aZhang, Ling1 aXu, Xin1 aLiu, Xuequn1 aWang, Chuntai1 aLiu, Xinqiong0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2014 Nov. 2, v. 28, no. 6 p.999-1007dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2014.9786643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01918naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245006200170300001600232520101000248592002801258650002101286650001101307650002801318650001301346650001101359650001701370700001401387773008201401856008901483990002301572852000901595655001201604IND60095943420221122032813.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009594342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViet, N.V.10aLoad transfer in fractured carbon nanotubes under tension  ap. 332-339.  aThe previous experimental evidence revealed that tensile fracture of a carbon nanotube (CNT) is triggered from the outermost layer of the graphene sheets, and then the crack grows toward the inner sheets. This work studies load transfer among the graphene sheets when a crack grows into the inner sheets. Both shear-lag modeling and finite element analysis (FEA) have been employed for analyzing the stress distribution in the graphene sheets. Numerical computations are given to the cases in which the wall numbers are two, five, and ten, respectively. The effects of the number of layers and the aspect ratio on the load transfer efficiency have been examined. The energy release and the effective Young’s modulus of a fractured CNT with respect to the number of broken layers are computed. The stress concentration at the crack tip grows with the radial crack propagation. The increase in the interlayer shear stress leads to crack deflection that forms the sword-and-sheath type of tensile fracture.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3aenergy 3afinite element analysis 3agraphene 3amodels 3ashear stress1 aKuo, W.S.0 tComposites.g2012 Mar., v. 43, no. 2 p.332-339dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.06.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009800168300001600266520145300282592002801735650001301763650001201776650001601788650000901804650002301813650001501836650001301851650001601864650001501880650001401895650001901909650001901928650001401947650001101961650002901972650002102001650001002022651001102032653002502043653002302068653002802091700001702119700001602136700002002152700001602172773012902188856008102317852000902398655001202407IND60652515120221119172333.0190713e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065251512DNAL7 a10.1017/S20404700170012122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, F. A.10aUse of remote sensing technology in the assessment of resistance of maize to tar spot complex  ap. 259-263.  aAssessment of Tar Spot Complex (TSC) severity in maize breeding experiments is conducted visually and may sometimes result in inconsistencies due to human interpretation. Disease scoring using remote sensing technologies may help bring more precision to the phenotyping process. An experiment for assessment of grain yield losses due to TSC was conducted at the Aguafria Experimental Station of the International Center for Wheat and Maize Improvement – CIMMYT in Mexico. Twenty-five maize genotypes were planted in spring of 2016 under a fungicide treatment to control TSC development and no fungicide treatment in a square lattice design with three replications. Four flights were carried out using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with a multispectral (550, 660, 735, 790 nm) and a thermal camera, simultaneously with the visual disease scorings and the yield was measured after harvesting. The preliminary results of the study indicated that the use of remote sensing in disease resistance phenotyping may be as effective as visual disease scoring since both correlate highly with the grain yield. Structural and chlorophyll vegetation indices (VIs) proved to be a good alternative for the estimation of yield losses caused by TSC in experimental field conditions, which may be potentially used for screening for resistance to this disease in maize genotypes, hypothetically reducing the need for visual disease scoring in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acameras 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3adisease resistance 3afungicides 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3aharvesting 3aphenotype 3aplant breeding 3aremote sensing 3ascreening 3aspring 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3avegetation index 3awheat 3aMexico 0amultispectral images 0agenotype selection 0aimagery data extraction1 aDefourny, P.1 aGérard, B.1 aSan Vicente, F.1 aLoladze, A.0 tAdvances in animal biosciences.g2017 July, v. 8, no. 2 p.259-263dCambridge University PresswJournal:6188x2040-47197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S20404700170012123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245009600204506010400300506007600404520106500480592002801545506003701573650001101610650001401621650001201635650002201647650001401669650001201683650001801695653001801713653003401731653002001765653002001785653002101805653003401826700005801860700002901918700006601947700002202013700002602035700006402061700002702125700003202152700002402184700003202208700002602240773010402266856008202370852000902452655001202461IND60770128520221207131030.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077012852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2022.1116502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaunbo, Natja1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5717-163114aThe overlooked paradox of the coexistence of overweight/obesity and anemia during pregnancy  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlobally, the prevalence of overweight and obesity, including among pregnant women, has substantially increased in the past three decades. This has been fueled by, among other factors, an increase in the consumption of high energy-dense foods and a decrease in physical activity. Additionally, global prevalence of anemia among pregnant women remains a public health concern. Overweight/obesity as well as anemia in pregnancy are independently associated with adverse health outcomes for the mother and offspring. In some pregnant women, the two conditions coexist. Yet current knowledge in this field, including prevalence rates, risk factors, and health consequences for mother and offspring being exposed to these conditions, is staggeringly sparse. In this review we describe the current evidence on prevalence rates, risk factors, and effects for mother and offspring regarding coexistence of overweight/obesity and anaemia in pregnant women based on a systematic literature search. We also highlight research gaps and suggest avenues for future research.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanemia 3anutrition 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3apublic health 0aPublic health 0aDouble burden of malnutrition 0aIron deficiency 0aMaternal health 0aTheory of change 0aSustainable development goals1 aDavidsen, Emma1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1753-18581 aGranich-Armenta, Adriana1 aBygbjerg, Ib Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9100-27541 aSánchez, Marcela1 aRamirez-Silva, Ivonne1 aAvila-Jimenez, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1388-31781 aChristensen, Dirk Lund1 aRivera-Dommarco, Juan Angel1 aCantoral, Alejandra1 aNielsen, Karoline Kragelund1 aGrunnet, Louise Groth0 tNutrition.g2022 July,  Aug., v. 99-100 p.111650-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2022.1116503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002400092040001800116100002000134245012700154300001600281520099400297592002801291650001501319650001901334650000801353650002701361650001001388650003001398650001501428650001001443650003301453650002001486650001601506650001401522650001901536650003501555650001201590651001401602651001101616653001401627653001601641653001501657653001101672653001601683700002001699700002401719700002001743773010201763852000901865856007101874961001301945655001201958IND4457516020200516000000.0200516e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445751602DNAL7 a10.3852/10-1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMejía, Luis C.10aNew species, phylogeny, host-associations and geographic distribution of genus Cryptosporella (Gnomoniaceae, Diaporthales)  ap. 379-399.  aThe phylogeny of Cryptosporella is revised to include recently discovered species. Eight species new to science are described and two new combinations are proposed, raising the total number of species accepted in Cryptosporella to 19. The species delimitation and phylogeny for Cryptosporella are determined based on analyses of DNA sequences from three genes (β-tubulin, ITS and tef1-α), comparative morphology of sexual structures on their host substrate, and host associations. The inferred phylogeny suggests that Cryptosporella has speciated primarily on Betulaceae with 16 species occurring on hosts in that plant family. The host range of most species seems to be narrow with nine species reported from a single host species or subspecies and seven species occurring on plants within a single host genus. A key to species is provided.

The research was carried out in a peach orchard (Prunus persica). Soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), NDVI from a multispectral image (0.25 m/pixel) and soil properties at 40 sampling points (0–30 cm) were acquired. The ECa was standardized at 25°C. It showed a strong relationship with former landforms, altered by land levelling. A positive correlation of EC₂₅ with EC₁:₅, water holding capacity at −1500 kPa and soil depth was found. NDVI was correlated only in the textural fractions coarser than clay. Two types of management zones were proposed: a) to improve the water holding capacity of soils and b) to regulate tree vigour and yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus persica 3aclay 3aelectrical conductivity 3aland use 3alandforms 3amultispectral imagery 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aorchards 3apeaches 3aremote sensing 3asoil depth 3asoil properties 3atrees 3avigor 3awater holding capacity 0aapparent electrical conductivity 0amultispectral images 0avegetation index 0amanagement zones.1 aDaniele, E.1 aUribeetxebarría, A.1 aEscolà, A.1 aRosell-Polo, J.

Also native to Asia, adventive T. japonicus populations have been detected in North America since 2014, and are currently reported from 15 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and two Canadian provinces. Yellow sticky cards (YSC) have proven effective for monitoring the presence, seasonal abundance, and distribution of these adventive populations. Our research has utilized YSC deployed in the midcanopy of H. halys host trees, following a study in which all leaves on felled tree of heaven, Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle, were inspected for H. halys egg masses, yielding eggs parasitized by T. japonicus only from mid- and upper-canopy leaves. However, given that other investigators have captured T. japonicus using YSC deployed in the lower-canopy, and that the effect of YSC placement in trees on T. japonicus captures had not been examined, captures of T. japonicus on YSC in the mid- and lower-canopy of individual A. altissima were compared. Traps were replaced weekly for five weeks and assessed for scelionid species. In 2020 and 2021, T. japonicus represented ≥53% of all Scelionidae captured, and there was not a significant effect of YSC location in the canopy on its captures. Deploying YSC at either canopy height was effective for measuring the relative abundance of T. japonicus, but sampling from the lower canopy substantially improved the efficiency and convenience of T. japonicus surveillance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAilanthus altissima 3aHalyomorpha halys 3aTrissolcus 3acanopy 3acanopy height 3aeggs 3aentomology 3amonitoring 3aparasitoids 3aAsia 3aDistrict of Columbia 0aSamurai wasp 0asampling 0abrown marmorated stink bug 0ayellow sticky trap1 aTalamas, Elijah J.1 aLeskey, Tracy C.1 aBergh, J.

Part II: Application to H₂O–NaCl and CO₂–H₂O–NaCl System  ap. 130-145.  aThe SAFT-LJ equation of state improved by Sun and Dubessy (2010) can represent the vapor–liquid equilibrium and PVTx properties of the CO₂–H₂O system over a wide P–T range because it accounts for the energetic contribution of the main types of molecular interactions in terms of reliable molecular based models. Assuming that NaCl fully dissociates into individual ions (spherical Na⁺ and Cl⁻) in water and adopting the restricted primitive model of mean spherical approximation to account for the energetic contribution due to long-range electrostatic forces between ions, this study extends the improved SAFT-LJ EOS to the H₂O–NaCl and the CO₂–H₂O–NaCl systems at temperatures below 573K. The EOS parameters for the interactions between ion and ion and between ion and water were determined from the mean ionic activity coefficient data and the density data of the H₂O–NaCl system. The parameters for the interactions between ion and CO₂ were evaluated from CO₂ solubility data of the CO₂–H₂O–NaCl system. Comparison with the experimental data shows that this model can predict the mean ionic activity coefficient, osmotic coefficient, saturation pressure, and density of aqueous NaCl solution and can predict the vapor–liquid equilibrium and PVTx properties of the CO₂–H₂O–NaCl system over the range from 273 to 573K, from 0 to 1000bar, and from 0 to 6mol/kg NaCl with high accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aequations 3aions 3amodels 3aprediction 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asolubility 3atemperature1 aDubessy, Jean0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 July 1, v. 88 p.130-145dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.04.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01828naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245006600163520100800229592002801237650001501265650001101280650001001291650002101301650001701322651000901339773011901348856007401467852000901541655001201550IND60762591620221119234923.0220110e20220104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076259162DNAL7 a10.3390/w140101022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtloff, Charles R.10aInka Hydraulic Engineering at the Tipon Royal Compound (Peru)  aThe Inka site of Tipon had many unique hydraulic engineering features that have modern hydraulic theory counterparts. For example, the Tipon channel system providing water to the Principal Fountain had a channel contraction inducing critical flow as determined by CFD analysis- this feature designed to induce flow stability and preserve the aesthetic display of the downstream Waterfall. The Main Aqueduct channel sourced by the Pukara River had a given flow rate to limit channel overbank spillage induced by a hydraulic jump at the steep-mild slope transition channel location as determined by use of modern CFD methods- this flow rate corresponds to the duplication of the actual flow rate used in the modern restoration using flow blockage plates placed in the channel to limit over-bank spillage. Additional hydraulic features governing the water supply to agricultural terraces for specialty crops constitute further sophisticated water management control systems discussed in detail in the text.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3arivers 3awater 3awater management 3awater supply 3aPeru0 tWater.g2022 Jan. 04, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140101023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245014500176300001400321520131900335592002801654650001801682650002301700650001001723650001801733650001201751650001301763650001601776650001701792650001201809650000901821650001901830700002701849700003201876773008901908856008101997852000902078655001202087IND50088744720221116150753.0150214e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008874472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-013-2014-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersen, Sally Nordlund10aRoot interactions between intercropped legumes and non-legumes—a competition study of red clover and red beet at different nitrogen levels  ap. 59-72.  aAIMS: To investigate root competition in a legume/non-legume mixture, and how root growth of the legume is affected by the competition at increasing nitrogen (N) supply. METHODS: Red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) were grown in transparent rhizotron tubes either in mixture or as sole crop at N supplies of 0, 75 or 150 kg ha⁻¹. The root growth was evaluated by the root intensity on the rhizotron surface, root depth and plant uptake of¹⁵N injected into the soil at the deeper part of the red clover root system. RESULTS: Competition with red beet decreased clover root intensity in deeper soil layers compared to clover grown as sole crop. The difference between clover in sole crop and in mixture was not evident at the highest N supply because the root growth of clover in sole crop appeared to be lowered at high N level. Increased N supply increased the dominance of red beet, but generally did not alter the root growth and distribution of the two species grown in mixture. CONCLUSIONS: Clover root growth and rooting depth were inhibited by competition with red beet but the effect was not enhanced by increased N supply; hence the increased dominance of red beet at higher N level was likely due to its increased growth and competitiveness for other soil resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeta vulgaris 3aTrifolium pratense 3abeets 3aintercropping 3alegumes 3anitrogen 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3arooting 3asoil 3asoil resources1 aDresbøll, Dorte Bodin1 aThorup-Kristensen, Kristian0 tPlant and soil.g2014 May, v. 378, no. 1-2 p.59-72dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-013-2014-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04799naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100006000188245014200248300001000390506007600400520284200476592002803318596002703346596002803373596006403401506003703465650001903502650001503521650002703536650001403563650002003577650001803597650003403615650001603649650001403665650002503679650001203704650002203716650003103738650002403769650001103793650001603804650001003820700002203830700001503852700002303867700001403890700001303904700002503917700002003942773015703962856008104119852000904200655001204209IND60627619120221207055216.0200721e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062761912DNAL7 a306217892pmid7 aPMC63258112pmcid7 a10.1186/s12966-018-0761-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Elten, T.

We previously showed that a 6 month preconception lifestyle intervention among women with obesity and infertility was successful in decreasing the intake of high caloric snacks and beverages, increasing physical activity and in reducing weight in the short term. We now report the effects of the preconception lifestyle intervention on diet, physical activity and body mass index (BMI) at 5.5 years (range = 3.7–7.0 years) after the intervention. METHODS: We followed women who participated in the LIFEstyle study, a multicentre RCT in which women with obesity and infertility were assigned to a six-month lifestyle intervention program or prompt infertility treatment (N = 577). Diet and physical activity 5.5 years later were assessed with an 173-item food frequency questionnaire (N = 175) and Actigraph triaxial accelerometers (N = 155), respectively. BMI was calculated from self-reported weight and previously measured height (N = 179). Dietary intake, physical activity, and BMI in the intervention and control group were compared using multivariate regression models. Additionally, dietary intake, physical activity and BMI of women allocated to the intervention arm with successful weight loss during the intervention (i.e. BMI < 29 kg/m² or ≥ 5% weight loss), unsuccessful weight loss and the control group were compared with ANCOVA. RESULTS: Although BMI did not differ between the intervention and control group 5.5 years after the intervention (− 0.5 kg/m² [− 2.0;1.1]; P = 0.56), the intervention group did report a lower energy intake (− 216 kcal/day [− 417;-16]; P = 0.04). Women in the intervention arm who successfully lost weight during the intervention had a significantly lower BMI at follow-up compared to women in the intervention arm who did not lose weight successfully (− 3.4 kg/m² [− 6.3;-0.6]; P = 0.01), and they reported a significantly lower energy intake compared to the control group (− 301 kcal [− 589;-14]; P = 0.04). Macronutrient intake, diet quality, and physical activity did not differ between the intervention and control group, irrespective of successful weight loss during the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: In our study population, a preconception lifestyle intervention led to reduced energy intake 5.5 years later. Additionally, women allocated to the intervention group who were successful in losing weight during the intervention also had a lower BMI at follow-up. This shows the potential sustainable effect of a preconception lifestyle intervention.

S.14aThe Butter Flavorant, Diacetyl, Forms a Covalent Adduct with 2-Deoxyguanosine, Uncoils DNA, and Leads to Cell Death  ap. 3311-3317.  aDiacetyl (DA), a natural butter flavorant, is a causative agent for the lung disease obliterative bronchiolitis. Mutagenic properties of 1,2-dicarbonyls have previously been empirically linked to their possible interaction with DNA nucleobases. This study for the first time identifies chemically the adduct of DA with 2-deoxyguanosine. Selective reactivity of DA with 5′-TTTGTTTTT-3′ over 5′-TTTTTTTTT-3′ indicated its propensity to modify specifically the guanosine residue. Treatment of plasmid DNA, pBR322, with DA induced changes in electrophoretic mobility that are typical of ternary structure disruption. Such DNA nucleobase interaction of DA translated into increased apoptosis in DA-treated SH-SY5Y cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC₅₀ = 0.114 ± 0.0421 mM). The traditional carbonyl scavengers metformin, 2-thiobarbituric acid, and d-penicillamine protected cells from DA toxicity in proportion to their rates of reaction with DA, with d-penicillamine causing a maximal increase in the IC₅₀ to 5.23 ± 0.0992 mM when co-incubated with DA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abutter 3adiacetyl 3aguanosine 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ametformin 3amutagenicity 3aplasmids 3athiobarbituric acid 3atranslation (genetics) 2aApoptosis 2aButter 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aDNAxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aDNA Adductsxchemistry 2aDNA, Single-Strandedxchemistry 2aDeoxyguanosinexchemistry 2aDiacetylxchemistryxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aFood Additivesxtoxicity 2aMutagens 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aTaste 0adiacetyl 0aguanosine 0aDNA unwinding 0aapoptosis 0acarbonyl scavenger1 aRaza, Abbas1 aVince, Robert0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 Mar. 28, v. 60, no. 12 p.3311-3317dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf300180e3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02802naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245007500170300001600245520151100261592002801772650001301800650002201813650001901835650001201854650001601866650001801882650001401900650002501914650001501939650001101954650002201965650001801987650001202005700002002017700002602037700002002063700002202083700002202105700002302127700002602150773011102176856004802287852000902335655001202344IND4468574120221122220923.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446857412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-011-9836-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoura, Monika Fecury11aAclassification of Pepper yellow mosaic virus isolates into pathotypes  ap. 549-552.  aPepper yellow mosaic virus (PepYMV) is the most important potyvirus infecting sweet pepper in Brazil. In this study, twenty isolates of PepYMV were obtained from commercial sweet pepper crops. To confirm virus identity, the coat protein gene was completely sequenced for eleven of these isolates, and partially sequenced for the other nine isolates. The amino acid identities obtained were above 93% when compared with the sequence of a characterized PepYMV isolate (AF348610). Extracts of Nicotiana tabacum cv. TNN plants infected with the different isolates were used to inoculate the differential series of Capsicum spp cultivars containing the genes pvr2 1 , pvr2 2 , pvr2 3 , pvr2 4 , and Pvr4. Using the same criteria established for Potato virus Y (PVY), fourteen isolates of PepYMV could be classified as known pathotypes described for PVY, that is: 1.2 (2 isolates), 1.3 (6) and 1.2.3 (6). The remaining six isolates, 1.3 (2) and 1.2.3 (4) could not be classified into the typical pathotypes of PVY because they were also virulent on Serrano Criollo de Morellosâ334 (C.M 334) which carries the pvr2 3 and Pvr4 genes. To classify the PepYMV into pathotypes and counter the biological diversity found in this species we propose the utilization of 2x for the ability to overcome the correspondent allele of the pvr2 locus and 4 for the capacity to break down the Pvr4 gene. Using this criterion we could classify the PepYMV into five pathotypes: 21.22; 21.23; 21.22.23; 21.23. 4 and 21.22.23. 4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aPotato virus Y 3aalleles 3aamino acids 3acoat proteins 3acultivars 3anucleotide sequences 3apathotypes 3apepper 3aspecies diversity 3asweet peppers 3aviruses1 aMituti, Tatiana1 aMarubayashi, Julio M.1 aGioria, Ricardo1 aKobori, Romulo F.1 aPavan, Marcelo A.1 ada Silva, Norberto1 aKrause-Sakate, Renate0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2011 Dec., v. 131, no. 4 p.549-552dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-011-9836-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008900157520132200246592002801568650002201596650001301618650001901631650001101650650001701661650001201678650002501690700001901715700001601734700001801750700001801768773011901786856007401905852000901979655001201988IND60762591720221119234944.0220110e20220104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076259172DNAL7 a10.3390/w140101042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Lifei 10aResearch on Seepage of Jointed Rock Mass of Tunnel and Limited Discharge of Grouting  aIn underground engineering such as tunnel engineering, the condition of surrounding rock such as water-containing jointed rock mass is a common engineering geology. For broken, water-containing surrounding rock, the reasonable measures to prevent and drain water has always been a key issue. Based on the statistical information of the structural surface of the surrounding rock of the Hongtuzhang tunnel, DIPS software was used to classify the structural plane of the tunnel. Based on the statistical analysis of the occurrence, size, and density of the structural plane, the two-dimensional structural plane network model of the rock mass was established, and the permeability tensor (K₁ = 1.61 × 10⁻⁶ m/s, K₂ = 5.78 × 10⁻⁷ m/s) was calculated. Consider the worst orientation, the permeability tensor (K₁ = 1.61 × 10⁻⁶ m/s) was selected to calculate the grouting design. Based on the theory of limited discharge, the influence of parameters of permeability coefficient ratio n and thickness of grouting layer Tg on the tunnel water inflow and lining external water pressure was analyzed. The recommended value of tunnel drainage was 3.0 m³/m∙d, then the corresponding grouting circle parameters were put forward (permeability coefficient ratio n = 100, thickness of grouting layer Tg = 8 m).  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adrainage 3adrainage water 3amodels 3apermeability 3aseepage 3astatistical analysis1 aLian, Xingwei 1 aHuang, Dan 1 aLi, Xiaoqing 1 aZou, Jinzhou 0 tWater.g2022 Jan. 04, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140101043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245013300177300001600310520078600326592002801112650002801140650001301168650002101181650001701202650001701219650003301236650002601269650001301295650002001308700001701328700001501345700001401360773008201374856008901456990002301545852000901568655001201577IND60095943820221122013038.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009594382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatrick Lim, W.K.10aEffect of intumescent ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and melamine cyanurate (MC) on the properties of epoxy/glass fiber composites  ap. 124-128.  aThe effects of halogen-free flame retardants (FR) such as intumescent ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and melamine cyanurate (MC) on the flammability and mechanical properties of epoxy/glass fiber composite systems were studied. Overall, intumescent APP shows better flammability results compared with MC. The composite with 5vol.% APP performed sufficiently well in the UL-94 test and LOI, whereas 20vol.% MC is required to achieve similar results. The addition of 1vol.% MC into 4vol.% APP had shown some improvement on the composite flame resistance. The composite attains the maximum flexural strength at 15vol.% while the dynamic mechanical analysis shows that the addition of flame retardants increased the storage modulus but did not change the glass transition temperature Tg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium polyphosphates 3aepoxides 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3aglass fibers 3aglass transition temperature 3amechanical properties 3amelamine 3astorage modulus1 aMariatti, M.1 aChow, W.S.1 aMar, K.T.0 tComposites.g2012 Mar., v. 43, no. 2 p.124-128dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.11.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245007500209300001200284506007600296520167100372592002802043506003702071650002502108650001102133650001702144650002402161650002202185650001702207650000902224650001902233650001102252650001302263650001102276650001202287650001402299650001702313650002402330700002202354700001702376700002202393700002902415700002602444700001802470700002602488700003002514773011702544856008202661852000902743655001202752IND60616891420221207094128.0210216e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061689142DNAL7 a303425082pmid7 aPMC61959862pmcid7 a10.1186/s12917-018-1642-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPankowski, Filip10aComputed tomographic evaluation of cleft palate in one-day-old puppies  ap. 316.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cleft palate is a birth defect characterized by a lack of fusion between structures forming the palate. Causes include a multitude of factors, both genetic and environmental. Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate morphological features and diagnose head disorders in adult dogs. However, there is less data about its use in neonatal dogs. The purpose of this study was to perform CT evaluation of palatal defects in one-day-old puppies and to present a novel approach of 3D modeling in terms of cleft palate assessment. RESULTS: Macroscopic and CT examinations were performed in 23 stillborn or euthanized purebred newborn puppies. On the basis of CT data, a 3D model was prepared and the cleft surface area was then calculated. A multi-stage approach, which utilised software such as 3D Slicer and Blender, was applied. Palatal defects were found in ten dogs, of which five had cleft palate, three had bilateral cleft lip and palate, one had a unilateral cleft lip and palate and one had a unilateral cleft lip. The surface area of the clefts ranged from 31 to 213 mm², which made up respectfully 11 to 63% of the total surface area of the palate. No abnormalities were found in thirteen dogs and they made up the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography and 3D modeling were very effective in evaluation of palatal disorders in newborn dogs. 3D models adapted to the natural curvature of the palate were created and more precise data was obtained. Morphological characteristics, CT findings and advanced image analysis of cleft palate in neonates obtained from these models increase the knowledge about this malformation in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabnormal development 3aadults 3acleft palate 3acomputed tomography 3acomputer software 3adog diseases 3ahead 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aneonates 3apalate 3apuppies 3apurebreds 3asurface area 3aveterinary medicine1 aPaśko, Sławomir1 aMax, Andrzej1 aSzal, Bartłomiej1 aDzierzęcka, Małgorzata1 aGruszczyńska, Joanna1 aSzaro, Paweł1 aGołębiowski, Marek,1 aBartyzel, Bartłomiej Jan0 tBMC veterinary research.g2018 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.316-316dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1642-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245006700208300001200275500001900287506007600306520136400382592002801746506003701774650000801811650001801819650002301837650001401860650001401874650001001888650001401898650002801912653002101940653003801961653001401999653001102013773013002024856008402154852000902238655001202247IND60692901820221207071639.0200503e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069290182DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2014.9813682doi7 aPMC44338282pmcid7 a260196122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemir, Aynur10aPossible effect of biotechnology on plant gene pools in Turkey  ap. 1-9.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe recent rapid developments in biotechnology have made great contributions to the study of plant gene pools. The application of in vitro methods in freeze storage and DNA protection techniques in fast production studies has made major advances. From that aspect, biotechnology is an indispensable means for the protection of plant gene pools, which includes the insurance of sustainable agriculture and development of species. Besides all the positive developments, one of the primary risks posed by the uncontrolled spreading of genetically modified organisms is the possibility for other non-target organisms to be negatively affected. Genes of plant origin should be given priority in this type of studies by taking into consideration such negative effects that may result in disruption of ecological balance and damage to plant genetic pools. Turkey, due to its ecological conditions and history, has a very important position in terms of plant gene pools. This richness ought to be protected without corrupting its natural quality and natural evolution process in order to provide the sources of species that will be required for future sustainable agricultural applications. Thus, attention should be paid to the use of biotechnological methods, which play an important role especially in the protection and use of local and original plant gene pools.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3abiotechnology 3aecological balance 3aequipment 3aevolution 3agenes 3ainsurance 3asustainable agriculture 0aplant gene pools 0aagricultural biological diversity 0agene flow 0aTurkey0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 29, no. 1 p.1-9dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2014.9813683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002800172245012700200300001200327520118300339592002801522650001001550650001501560650001401575650001201589650002701601650001801628650001501646650002501661650003601686650004201722650001201764650002301776650003701799650004101836650002301877650001801900651001901918651001901937700002501956700002101981700001602002700001702018700001802035773009802053856008702151852000902238655001202247IND50059275820221121040403.0141112e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005927582DNAL7 a229029982pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.07.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHedgespeth, Melanie Lea10aPharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in treated wastewater discharges into Charleston Harbor, South Carolina  ap. 1-9.  aThis study assessed seasonal and regional trends of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) detected in monthly samples from two local wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Charleston, South Carolina, USA, over the period of one year. Surface water of Charleston Harbor was also analyzed to examine environmental distribution in an estuarine ecosystem. Of the 19 compounds examined, 11 were quantified in wastewater influent, 9 in effluent, and 7 in surface water. Aqueous concentrations of many PPCPs were reduced by >86% in wastewater effluent compared with influent, though some compounds showed low removal and greater effluent concentrations compared with influent (e.g. estrone and fluoxetine). Differences in effluent concentrations and estimated removal between facilities were likely related to variations in the facilities' operating procedures. Surface water concentrations were generally reduced by >90% for those chemicals found in effluent. Additionally, there were seasonal trends that indicate reduced degradation in colder months in wastewater and surface water. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining PPCPs in the South Atlantic Bight.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3aecosystems 3aeffluents 3aestrone 3apersonal care products 3asurface water 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 2aNonprescription Drugsxanalysis 2aPharmaceutical Preparationsxanalysis 2aSeasons 2aSeawaterxanalysis 2aWastewaterxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Purification 2aWater Quality 3aSouth Carolina 0aSouth Carolina1 aSapozhnikova, Yelena1 aPennington, Paul1 aClum, Allan1 aFairey, Andy1 aWirth, Edward0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 437 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.07.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03591naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245011700198300001800315500002000333506007600353520166900429592002802098596004802126596007302174596004102247506003702288650002002325650003802345650002402383650002602407650001102433650001802444650002002462650001202482650002202494650001502516700002302531700002202554700002102576700001702597700002302614700002202637700002102659700002002680700002202700700002502722700006402747773013202811856007302943852000903016655001203025IND60675785920221207132729.0191108e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067578592DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.131352doi7 aPMC68351262pmcid7 a310223242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeike, Doreen10aCharacterizing standard genetic parts and establishing common principles for engineering legume and cereal roots  ap. 2234-2245.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlant synthetic biology and cereal engineering depend on the controlled expression of transgenes of interest. Most engineering in plant species to date has relied heavily on the use of a few, well‐established constitutive promoters to achieve high levels of expression; however, the levels of transgene expression can also be influenced by the use of codon optimization, intron‐mediated enhancement and varying terminator sequences. Most of these alternative approaches for regulating transgene expression have only been tested in small‐scale experiments, typically testing a single gene of interest. It is therefore difficult to interpret the relative importance of these approaches and to design engineering strategies that are likely to succeed in different plant species, particularly if engineering multigenic traits where the expression of each transgene needs to be precisely regulated. Here, we present data on the characterization of 46 promoters and 10 terminators in Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus, Nicotiana benthamiana and Hordeum vulgare, as well as the effects of codon optimization and intron‐mediated enhancement on the expression of two transgenes in H. vulgare. We have identified a core set of promoters and terminators of relevance to researchers engineering novel traits in plant roots. In addition, we have shown that combining codon optimization and intron‐mediated enhancement increases transgene expression and protein levels in barley. Based on our study, we recommend a core set of promoters and terminators for broad use and also propose a general set of principles and guidelines for those engineering cereal species.  aPublisher supplied data  a0PP1028264cBill & Melinda Gates Foundation  aBB/K003712/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  cEastern Academic Research Consortium0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHordeum vulgare 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3aMedicago truncatula 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3abarley 3abiotechnology 3agene expression 3alegumes 3asynthetic biology 3atransgenes1 aKorolev, Andrey V.1 aSoumpourou, Eleni1 aMurakami, Eiichi1 aReid, Dugald1 aBreakspear, Andrew1 aRogers, Christian1 aRadutoiu, Simona1 aStougaard, Jens1 aHarwood, Wendy A.1 aOldroyd, Giles E.

Statistically valid Plackett–Burman design of experiments was employed to carry out this mixture study. The results obtained showed a maximum removal of Cu(II) (98.9%), followed by Ni(II) (97%), Cd(II) (94.8%), Zn(II) (94.6%), Pb(II) (94.4%) and Fe(III) (93.9%). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the sulfate and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction revealed that the effect due to copper was highly significant (P value<0.05) on sulfate and COD removal. To establish the role of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) in the metal removal process, surface morphology and composition of the metal loaded biomass were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) integrated with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The results obtained revealed that the metal precipitates are associated with the outer and inner cell surface of the SRB as a result of the sulfide generated by SRB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3abiomass 3acadmium 3achemical oxygen demand 3acopper 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aexperimental design 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alead 3anickel 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfates 3asulfides 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc 0aAMD 0aAPHA 0aCOD 0aFESEM-EDX 0aFTIR 0ag 0aMLVSS 0aSRB 0aTEM-EDS 0aANOVA 0aEDTA 0aBESA 0aHeavy metals 0aSulfate reducing bacteria 0aMulticomponent system 0aAnaerobic biomass 0aPlackett–Burman design1 aPakshirajan, Kannan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2478-28391 aDas, Gopal0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 324 p.62-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.12.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245007000164300001600234520100800250592002801258650002501286650001401311650002101325650001001346650002201356650001301378650001701391650002301408650001101431650001401442650001701456700002601473700002201499773011901521856007401640852000901714655001201723IND60664019620221118163721.0190910e20120117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066401962DNAL7 a10.1039/c1ra00910a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrăguțan, Ileana,10aTargeted drugs by olefin metathesis: piperidine-based iminosugars  ap. 719-736.  aExamining advances in the class of natural and non-natural piperidine azasugars, important therapeutic agents and potent glycosidase inhibitors, this review looks at syntheses applying olefin metathesis as a highly efficient key step and gateway strategy for discovery of better iminosugar leads for treatment of widespread affections like viral and metabolic diseases.

Selection for higher yields has increased stay‐green in modern maize hybrids. Here, we report a novel QTL controlling functional stay‐green that was discovered in a mapping population derived from the Illinois High Protein 1 (IHP1) and Illinois Low Protein 1 (ILP1) lines, which show very different rates of leaf senescence. This QTL was mapped to a single gene containing a NAC‐domain transcription factor that we named nac7. Transgenic maize lines where nac7 was down‐regulated by RNAi showed delayed senescence and increased both biomass and nitrogen accumulation in vegetative tissues, demonstrating NAC7 functions as a negative regulator of the stay‐green trait. More importantly, crosses between nac7 RNAi parents and two different elite inbred testers produced hybrids with prolonged stay‐green and increased grain yield by an average 0.29 megagram/hectare (4.6 bushel/acre), in 2 years of multi‐environment field trials. Subsequent RNAseq experiments, one employing nac7 RNAi leaves and the other using leaf protoplasts overexpressing Nac7, revealed an important role for NAC7 in regulating genes in photosynthesis, chlorophyll degradation and protein turnover pathways that each contribute to the functional stay‐green phenotype. We further determined the putative target of NAC7 and provided a logical extension for the role of NAC7 in regulating resource allocation from vegetative source to reproductive sink tissues. Collectively, our findings make a compelling case for NAC7 as a target for improving functional stay‐green and yields in maize and other crops.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3agenes 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aphenotype 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein metabolism 3aprotoplasts 3aresource allocation 3atranscription factors 3aIllinois1 aFengler, Kevin A.1 aVan Hemert, John L.1 aGupta, Rajiv,1 aMongar, Nick1 aSun, Jindong1 aAllen, William B.1 aWang, Yang1 aWeers, Benjamin1 aMohua,1 aLafitte, Renee1 aHou, Zhenglin1 aBryant, Angela1 aIbraheem, Farag1 aArp, Jennifer1 aSwaminathan, Kankshita1 aMoose, Stephen P.1 aLi, Bailin1 aShen, Bo0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2019 Dec., v. 17, no. 12 p.2272-2285dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.131393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245015600167300001400323520176700337592002802104650002002132650001902152650001202171650002102183650001602204650001702220650001602237650001702253650002402270650002602294650002602320650000902346650001902355650003702374650001102411651001002422653001302432653002802445653001902473700001802492700001902510700002102529700001802550773015202568856008702720852000902807655001202816IND60754756320221121224529.0211023e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075475632DNAL7 a10.5958/2249-5258.2021.00009.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevi, H.L.10aIntegrated nutrient management with mycorrhizal application on capsicum (Capsicum annuum L. var. Grossum Sebdt.) under protected cultivation in Tripura  ap. 55-59.  aCultivation of capsicum (Capsicum annuum L. var. Grossum Sebdt.) is very limited in Tripura due to the lack of its proper protected production technology. Though the climate of the state during winter is suitable for capsicum cultivation, open field cultivation does not fulfil the quality standards and low production resulting in a gap between the supply and increasing demand of quality capsicum. An earlier experiment in the centre standardized that second fortnight of October as a suitable planting time of capsicum var. Indra in Tripura under protected cultivation. In this study, an attempt was made to maximize the yield and nutrient management of capsicum var. Indra with Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) inoculation. The treatments were combinations of farmyard manure @10 tons/ha (blanket application) and 3 levels of the recommended dose of fertilizer i.e., 100, 75, and 50% of RDF with or without AM during 2016–17. Application of FyM + 50% RDF + AM recorded a yield of 48.26 t/ha. Further, an increase in fertilizer application up to 75% RDF enhances the yield up to 52.63 t/ha. However, there was no significant increase in yield with an increase in fertilizer dose up to 100% RDF. Soil application of AM significantly improves the yield by 74%. The highest fruit yield (52.63t/ha) was recorded with 75% RDF + AM. The result also corresponds with the yield attributes like maximum fruit weight (172.60g) and soil microbial population [3.50 MPN (AM)/g soil]. The total soluble sugars remained non -significant in all treatments. Soil microbial population showed a negative correlation with the increase in the recommended dose of fertilizer application. Application of FyM + 75% RDF + AM was found to be the most economical and sustainable treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aanimal manures 3aclimate 3afertilizer rates 3afertilizers 3afruit weight 3afruit yield 3ahorticulture 3anutrient management 3aproduction technology 3aprotected cultivation 3asoil 3asoil treatment 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awinter 3aIndia 0aCapsicum 0aMycorrhizal inoculation 0aOrganic manure1 aDas, Biswajit1 aBhowmick, S.N.1 aShuklabaidya, A.1 aKandpal, B.K.0 tProgressive horticulture.g2021 June, v. 53, no. 1 p.55-59dIndian Society of Horticultural Research and DevelopmentwJournal:2070x2249-52587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/2249-5258.2021.00009.93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03492naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245017600172300001400348520164800362592002802010650001402038650001902052650001002071650001702081650001502098650001702113650002502130650002502155650001102180650001402191650001202205650001802217650001702235650001402252650001102266650001502277650002302292650001802315653001702333653002402350653001402374653002402388653002002412653002002432700001602452700001502468700001302483700001302496700001502509700001402524700001202538700001402550700001502564700001202579700001202591700002002603700001802623773009002641856009002731852000902821655001202830IND60592296520221121023514.0180402e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059229652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Zuyuan10aTime-responsive osteogenic niche of stem cells: A sequentially triggered, dual-peptide loaded, alginate hybrid system for promoting cell activity and osteo-differentiation  ap. 25-42.  aThe efficacy of stem cell-based bone tissue engineering has been hampered by cell death and limited fate control. A smart cell culture system with the capability of sequentially delivering multiple factors in specific growth stages, like the mechanism of the natural extracellular matrix modulating tissue formation, is attractive for enhancing cell activity and controlling cell fate. Here, a bone forming peptide-1 (BFP-1)-laden mesoporous silica nanoparticles (pep@MSNs) incorporated adhesion peptide, containing the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) domain, modified alginate hydrogel (RA) system (pep@MSNs-RA) was developed to promote the activity and stimulate osteo-differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in sequence. The survivability and proliferation of hMSCs were enhanced in the adhesion peptide modified hydrogel. Next, BFP-1 released from pep@MSNs induced hMSCs osteo-differentiation after the proliferation stage. Moreover, BFP-1 near the cells was self-captured by the additional cell-peptide cross-linked networks formed by the ligands (RGD) binding to receptors on the cell surface, leading to long-term sustained osteo-stimulation of hMSCs. The results suggest that independent and sequential stimulation in proliferation and osteo-differentiation stages could synergistically enhance the survivability, expansion, and osteogenesis of hMSCs, as compared to stimulating alone or simultaneously. Overall, this study provided a new and valid strategy for stem cell expansion and osteo-differentiation in 2D or 3D culture systems, possessing potential applications in 3D bio-printing and tissue regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3abone formation 3abones 3acell culture 3acell death 3acrosslinking 3adevelopmental stages 3aextracellular matrix 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3aligands 3ananoparticles 3aporous media 3areceptors 3asilica 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 3atissue repair 0aNanocarriers 0aMulti-drug delivery 0aOrganoids 0aInjectable hydrogel 0a3D cell culture 0aStem cell niche1 aZhang, Siqi1 aPan, Jijia1 aShi, Rui1 aLiu, Hao1 aLyu, Yalin1 aHan, Xiao1 aLi, Yan1 aYang, Yue1 aXu, Zhixiu1 aSui, Yi1 aLuo, En1 aZhang, Yuanyuan1 aWei, Shicheng0 tBiomaterials.g2018 May, v. 163 p.25-42dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010800168300001600276520125600292592002801548650001901576650001901595650001401614650000901628650001301637650002001650650001201670651001601682773009101698856008101789852000901870655001201879IND50067111220221119125031.0150127e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006711122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-013-0718-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonseth, Camille10aImpact of snow variability on the Swiss winter tourism sector: implications in an era of climate change  ap. 307-320.  aWith its numerous mountain regions and its well developed winter tourism infrastructures, Switzerland is a country whose tourism sector is known to be sensitive to snowpack variability. With climate change—which is predicted to have negative impacts on snow depths and duration—the need for accurately assessing the sensitivity of winter tourism consumption to changing snow conditions is reinforced. Taking advantage of newly available data on visitation rates at Swiss ski areas, we analyze the effect of snow conditions on skier visits using standard panel data regression techniques. We assume the magnitude of this effect to be conditional on the level of snowmaking investments. Higher snowmaking investments should lead to a lower sensitivity. Our results validate this hypothesis and also shed light on the competitive interactions between lower and higher lying ski areas located in the same tourism region. In fact, our results show that better snow conditions in the former reduces visitation rates in the latter. Eventually, we find that ski areas benefiting from sunny conditions tend to have, ceteris paribus, more skier visits. This suggests additional impacts if climate change were to modify sunshine duration in mountain regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3ainfrastructure 3amountains 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asolar radiation 3atourism 3aSwitzerland0 tClimatic change.g2013 July, v. 119, no. 2 p.307-320dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-013-0718-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245012400177300001600301520147200317592002801789650003401817650002701851650001501878650002401893650001101917650002401928650001101952650001801963650000901981650001501990650001902005650001102024650001902035650001802054650001102072650001902083653001102102653002402113653001502137653001102152653000902163653001102172653001102183700001902194700002202213700001902235700001902254773011402273856008502387852000902472655001202481IND60610682220221122170807.0180829e20170215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061068222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.12.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYekta, Sepehr Shakeri10aChemical speciation of sulfur and metals in biogas reactors – Implications for cobalt and nickel bio-uptake processes  ap. 110-116.  aThis article deals with the interrelationship between overall chemical speciation of S, Fe, Co, and Ni in relation to metals bio-uptake processes in continuous stirred tank biogas reactors (CSTBR). To address this topic, laboratory CSTBRs digesting sulfur(S)-rich stillage, as well as full-scale CSTBRs treating sewage sludge and various combinations of organic wastes, termed co-digestion, were targeted. Sulfur speciation was evaluated using acid volatile sulfide extraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Metal speciation was evaluated by chemical fractionation, kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. Relative Fe to S content is identified as a critical factor for chemical speciation and bio-uptake of metals. In reactors treating sewage sludge, quantity of Fe exceeds that of S, inducing Fe-dominated conditions, while sulfide dominates in laboratory and co-digestion reactors due to an excess of S over Fe. Under sulfide-dominated conditions, metals availability for microorganisms is restricted due to formation of metal-sulfide precipitates. However, aqueous concentrations of different Co and Ni species were shown to be sufficient to support metal acquisition by microorganisms under sulfidic conditions. Concentrations of free metal ions and labile metal complexes in aqueous phase, which directly participate in bio-uptake processes, are higher under Fe-dominated conditions. This in turn enhances metal adsorption on cell surfaces and bio-uptake rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aacid volatile sulfides 3aadsorption 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3achemical speciation 3acobalt 3afractionation 3airon 3ametal ions 3amicroorganisms 3anickel 3aorganic wastes 3asewage sludge 3asulfur 3athermodynamics 0aBiogas 0aChemical speciation 0aBio-uptake 0aSulfur 0aIron 0aCobalt 0aNickel1 aSkyllberg, Ulf1 aDanielsson, Åsa,1 aBjörn, Annika1 aSvensson, Bo H0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 324 p.110-116dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.12.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245013700175300001400312520129400326592002801620650002201648650001701670650001601687650001101703650002401714650002201738650001701760650001701777650001401794650001001808650001601818653001501834653002901849653001601878653002001894653002101914700001901935700001701954700001601971773015201987856008702139852000902226655001202235IND60754756620221121201313.0211023e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075475662DNAL7 a10.5958/2249-5258.2021.00012.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaura, Guraprīta,10aGenetic variation and association studies for yield and component traits in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus [(Thunb.)

Analysis of variances revealed significant variability among the genotypes for all the characters. Phenotypic and genotypic coefficients of variations were found high for number of fruits per plant and fruit yield*. High heritability along with high genetic advance as percent of mean was observed for fruit diameter. Correlation studies indicated that fruit yield per plant was positively and significantly correlated with vine length, number of fruits per plant and total soluble solids. Significant negative correlation was observed between fruit yield per plant and fruit length. Positive direct effect on fruit yield per plant was imposed by vine length, fruit weight, fruit diameter, rind thickness and total soluble solids and negative direct effects were exerted by number of fruits per plant and fruit length. Positive correlation between number of fruits per plant and fruit yield per plant was due to positive indirect effects of number of fruits per plant through fruit length and total soluble solids. Fruit yield could be increased through longer vines and more number of fruits per plant with smaller size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrullus lanatus 3afruit weight 3afruit yield 3afruits 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3ahorticulture 3aphenotype 3avines 3awatermelons 0aWatermelon 0aCoefficient of variation 0aCorrelation 0aGenetic advance 0aPath coefficient1 aPathania, Anju1 aRattan, Puja1 aReddy, A.H.0 tProgressive horticulture.g2021 June, v. 53, no. 1 p.70-75dIndian Society of Horticultural Research and DevelopmentwJournal:2070x2249-52587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/2249-5258.2021.00012.93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011400175300001800289520099700307536013201304592002801436596003501464650002201499650002601521650001301547650001501560650002001575650001301595650001801608650001501626650001101641650001301652650001001665650001401675650001001689653001801699653001701717653002001734653001201754653001701766700002701783700002601810773012401836856008501960852000902045655001202054IND60595476120221118172010.0180605e20180528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059547612DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2018.14345422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVirk, Harpreet Kaur10aGrowth, symbiosis, productivity, and profitability of soybean at varying planting methods and nitrogen levels  ap. 1184-1196.  aA field experiment was conducted to study the effect of different planting methods (Happy Seeder sowing, Straw Chopper + Zero Tillage sowing, and conventional sowing) and nitrogen (N) levels (0%, 75%, 100%, and 125% of recommended N) on the emergence, growth, symbiotic parameters, productivity, and profitability of soybean sown after wheat harvest.

Therefore, sowing with Happy Seeder after combine harvested wheat along with 100% recommended N would best optimize soybean yield and profitability.  aWe are highly thankful to Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana for providing financial support to conduct this study.  aPublisher supplied data  cPunjab Agricultural University 3acosts and returns 3afield experimentation 3anitrogen 3ano-tillage 3anutrient uptake 3aplanting 3aprofitability 3aseed yield 3asowing 3asoybeans 3astraw 3asymbiosis 3awheat 0acrop residues 0ahappy seeder 0anitrogen levels 0asoybean 0azero tillage1 aGuraikabāla Siṅgha,1 aManes, Gursahib Singh0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2018 May 28, v. 41, no. 9 p.1184-1196dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2018.14345423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03944naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245011600172300001600288520239200304592002802696650001002724650001702734650002002751650001902771650001702790650001602807650001702823650001102840650001402851650001202865650001302877650001802890650000902908650001502917650001602932653001302948653002002961653003102981653002003012653001703032700001603049700001703065700002203082700002003104700002103124700001703145700001803162700001903180773009203199856009003291852000903381655001203390IND60592296820221121003850.0180402e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059229682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.02.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Yu Bin10aEngineering spheroids potentiating cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions by self-assembly of stem cell microlayer  ap. 105-120.  aNumerous methods have been reported for the fabrication of 3D multi-cellular spheroids and their use in stem cell culture. Current methods typically relying on the self-assembly of trypsinized, suspended stem cells, however, show limitations with respect to cell viability, throughput, and accurate recapitulation of the natural microenvironment. In this study, we developed a new system for engineering cell spheroids by self-assembly of micro-scale monolayer of stem cells. We prepared synthetic hydrogels with the surface of chemically formed micropatterns (squares/circles with width/diameter of 200 μm) on which mesenchymal stem cells isolated from human nasal turbinate tissue (hTMSCs) were selectively attached and formed a monolayer. The hydrogel is capable of thermally controlled expansion. As the temperature was decreased from 37 to 4 °C, the cell layer detached rapidly (<10 min) and assembled to form spheroids with consistent size (∼100 μm) and high viability (>90%). Spheroidization was significantly delayed and occurred with reduced efficiency on circle patterns compared to square patterns. Multi-physics mapping supported that delamination of the micro-scale monolayer may be affected by stress concentrated at the corners of the square pattern. In contrast, stress was distributed symmetrically along the boundary of the circle pattern. In addition, treatment of the micro-scale monolayer with a ROCK inhibitor significantly retarded spheroidization, highlighting the importance of contraction mediated by actin stress fibers for the stable generation of spheroidal stem cell structures. Spheroids prepared from the assembly of monolayers showed higher expression, both on the mRNA and protein levels, of ECM proteins (fibronectin and laminin) and stemness markers (Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog) compared to spheroids prepared from low-attachment plates, in which trypsinized single cells are assembled. The hTMSC spheroids also presented enhanced expression levels of markers related to tri-lineage (osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic) differentiation. The changes in microcellular environments and functionalities were double-confirmed by using adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs). This spheroid engineering technique may have versatile applications in regenerative medicine for functionally improved 3D culture and therapeutic cell delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3acell culture 3acell structures 3acell viability 3adelamination 3aengineering 3afibronectins 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3alaminin 3amedicine 3amessenger RNA 3anose 3astem cells 3atemperature 0aSpheroid 0aStem cell niche 0aThermo-responsive hydrogel 0aMicropatterning 0aPolydopamine1 aKim, Eun Mi1 aByun, Hayeon1 aChang, Hyung-kwan1 aJeong, Kwanghee1 aAman, Zachary M.1 aChoi, Yu Suk1 aPark, Jungyul1 aShin, Heungsoo0 tBiomaterials.g2018 May, v. 165 p.105-120dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.02.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012600164300001600290520125300306592002801559650002101587650002301608650001901631650002901650650001601679650001101695650002501706650001201731650002801743650003101771650001201802650001501814650002701829650001701856650001101873700001701884700001501901700002001916700001801936773010001954856008102054852000902135655001202144IND60085441220221118160004.0141101e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008544122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2012.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhikun10aProduction of pyruvate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae through adaptive evolution and rational cofactor metabolic engineering  ap. 126-131.  aPyruvate-decarboxylase (Pdc)-negative Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been proven as a suitable metabolic engineering platform to produce organic acids. S. cerevisiae BY5419 Pdc⁻ strain cannot grow in batch cultures on synthetic medium with glucose as the sole carbon source, yet grows well on synthetic medium with ethanol or acetate. In this study, by combining adaptive evolution and cofactor engineering, we obtained a series of engineered yeasts that can produce pyruvate using glucose as sole carbon source. Differential expression of noxE, encoding a water-forming NADH oxidase from Lactococcus lactis, and udhA, encoding a soluble pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase from Escherichia coli, was investigated. Of all the constructed recombinant strains, G2U1-A₀ was able to produce 75.1gl⁻¹ pyruvate, increased 21% compared with the original strain A₀. The production yield of this strain reached 0.63gofpyruvategofglucose⁻¹. This study demonstrates that the fine regulation of intracellular NADH/NAD⁺ ratio is critical for cell metabolism and pyruvate production. Combining the adaptive evolution and fine regulation of intracellular NADH/NAD⁺ ratio provides a new strategy for improving the Pdc⁻ strain engineering platform.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactococcus lactis 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetic acid 3acarbon 3acofactor engineering 3aethanol 3aevolutionary adaptation 3agene expression regulation 3aglucose 3ametabolism 3apyruvate decarboxylase 3apyruvic acid 3ayeasts1 aGao, Cuijuan1 aWang, Qian1 aLiang, Quanfeng1 aQi, Qingsheng0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 67 p.126-131dElsevier B.V.x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2012.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245013500164300001400299520152700313592002801840650003401868650003501902650002001937650001301957650001301970650001201983650001101995650001402006650001702020650001102037650001202048650001102060650002902071650001102100651001002111653001702121653001102138653002002149653003302169700002002202700001802222700002702240700002302267773015202290856008702442852000902529655001202538IND60754756920221121201415.0211023e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075475692DNAL7 a10.5958/2249-5258.2021.00015.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnkit, 10aIntroduction and evaluation of new exotic vegetable crops under protected conditions in high altitude of Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh  ap. 83-89.  aThe attempts were made to introduce and evaluate the performance of selected exotic vegetable cultivars such as Chinese cabbage (pak choi and pe-tsai), lettuce (iceberg and loose leaf), celery, Swiss chard, red cabbage, and broccoli under protected conditions during winter season of 2019 at Defence Research Laboratory Research and Development Centre Tawang (Arunachal Pradesh).

MicroRNA319 (miR319) has been characterized as an important player in abiotic stress resistance in some C3 plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. However, its role in the dedicated biomass plant switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a C4 plant, has not been reported. Here, we show crosstalk between miR319 and ethylene (ET) for increasing salt tolerance. By overexpressing Osa‐MIR319b and a target mimicry form of miR319 (MIM319), we showed that miR319 positively regulated ET synthesis and salt tolerance in switchgrass. By experimental treatments, we demonstrated that ET‐mediated salt tolerance in switchgrass was dose‐dependent, and miR319 regulated the switchgrass salt response by fine‐tuning ET synthesis. Further experiments showed that the repression of a miR319 target, PvPCF5, in switchgrass also led to enhanced ethylene accumulation and salt tolerance in transgenic plants. Genome‐wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that overexpression of miR319 (OE‐miR319) down‐regulated the expression of key genes in the methionine (Met) cycle but promoted the expression of genes in ethylene synthesis. The results enrich our understanding of the synergistic effects of the miR319‐PvPCF5 module and ethylene synthesis in the salt tolerance of switchgrass, a C4 bioenergy plant.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016002cYoung Talent Supporting Program of the College of Animal Science and Technology of the China Agricultural University Education Foundation  a31770280cNational Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aC4 plants 3aPanicum virgatum 3aabiotic stress 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3adose response 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3amethionine 3amicroRNA 3arice 3asalt tolerance 3astress tolerance 3atranscriptomics1 aLi, Dayong1 aYan, Jianping1 aWang, Kexin1 aLuo, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9223-17861 aZhang, Wanjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5806-33520 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2019 Dec., v. 17, no. 12 p.2370-2383dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.131543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245010000178300001400278520115200292592002801444650002201472650001401494650001401508650001401522650001301536650001201549650001101561650000701572650002101579650001901600650001801619650001601637650000901653653002201662653002501684653002501709653002301734653003201757700002001789700001601809700002001825700002201845700002601867700006701893773011201960856008502072852000902157655001202166IND60610682620221120060225.0180829e20170215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061068262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSethurajan, Manivannan10aLeaching and selective zinc recovery from acidic leachates of zinc metallurgical leach residues  ap. 71-82.  aZinc (Zn) leaching yields and kinetics from three different zinc plant leach residues (ZLR) generated in different periods (ZLR1>30 years, ZLR2 5–30 years and ZLR3<2 years) were investigated. The factors affecting the Zn leaching rate such as solid to liquid ratio, temperature, acid concentration and agitation were optimized.

The Zn leaching kinetics of ZLRs follow the shrinking core diffusion model. The activation energy required to leach Zn from ZLR1, ZLR2 and ZLR3 were estimated to be 2.24kcal/mol, 6.63kcal/mol and 11.7kcal/mol, respectively, by the Arrhenius equation. The order of the reaction with respect to the sulfuric acid concentration was also determined as 0.20, 0.56, and 0.87 for ZLR1, ZLR2 and ZLR3, respectively. Zn was selectively recovered from the leachates by adjusting the initial pH and by the addition of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide. More than 90% of Zn was selectively recovered as sphalerite from the ZLR polymetallic leachates by chemical sulfide precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aagitation 3aequations 3aleachates 3aleaching 3aliquids 3amodels 3apH 3asodium hydroxide 3asodium sulfide 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3azinc 0aLeaching kinetics 0aMetallurgical wastes 0aShrinking core model 0aSelective recovery 0aMetal sulfide precipitation1 aHuguenot, David1 aJain, Rohan1 aLens, Piet N.L.1 aHorn, Heinrich A.1 aFigueiredo, Luiz H.A.1 avan Hullebusch, Eric D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1519-19250 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 324 p.71-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.01.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011400173500001400287520153600301592002801837650001401865650001201879650001401891650002301905650002001928650002001948650001701968650001301985650001701998650001502015650000902030653003502039653003002074653003002104653004202134700002502176773011402201856008202315852000902397655001202406IND60727234720221120111547.0210320e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072723472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scp.2021.1003782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇakırca, Emine Emel10aStudy on heterogeneous catalysts from calcined Ca riched hydrotalcite like compounds for biodiesel production  aNAL-light  aCa riched Hydrotalcite like compounds (HLCs) were synthesized by co-precipitation method to obtained Ca–Mg–Al mixed metal oxides with a view to produce biodiesel via methanolysis of microalgae. For this purpose, hydrotalcite-like catalysts containing Ca⁺², Mg⁺² and Al⁺³ metals were prepared with a molar ratio (x value) of Al⁺³/(Ca⁺² + Mg⁺² + Al⁺³) at 0.33. Ca/Mg molar ratio in the hydrotalcite like compounds was determined as 0, 0.5, 1, 2. Also, Mg-free CaAl HLCs was prepared at x = 0.33 value. The calcination process was carried out at 800 °C. Obtained catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, TGA, FTIR, SEM and ICP-OES techniques. The basicity of the all catalysts were investigated by using TPD/CO₂ technique and Hammett indicators. With increase in calcium amount on the HLCs, some evident features were observed such as high basicity and increase in basicity range with H_ values above 15, increase in pore diameter up to 18.37 nm, low pore volume and high catalytic activities. XRD analysis demostrated that the desired Ca–Mg–Al active metal oxide forms were formed after calcination. Catalytic activities of all the catalysts were examined in terms of conversion of microalgae oil to biodiesel and achieved up to 90% FAME yield under mild reaction conditions: 338 K for 5 h, methanol/microalgae oil molar ratio 6:1 and 3% catalyst amount. These results showed that the molar ratio of Ca–Mg in HLCs were significantly effective on the HLCs structure and catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acalcium 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoprecipitation 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrotalcite 3amethanol 3amethanolysis 3amicroalgae 3aoils 0aCa-hydrotalcite like compounds 0aCa–Mg–Al mixed oxides 0aCatalyst characterization 0aTransesterification of microalgae oil1 aAkın, Ayşe Nilgün0 tSustainable chemistry and pharmacy.g2021 May, v. 20 p.100378-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23279x2352-55417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scp.2021.1003783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006900146245013000215300002000345500001900365520138300384592002801767650001301795650001201808650001401820650001101834650001301845650001301858650001901871650001601890700005501906773017301961856008002134852000902214655001202223IND60711067020221118175931.0200916e20200823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071106702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c031022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAghajani Delavar, Mojtaba1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0784-913010aModeling Combined Effects of Temperature and Structure on Competition and Growth of Multispecies Biofilms in Microbioreactors  ap. 16122-16135.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt is a well-known challenge to simulate competition and growth of multiple microorganisms in microbioreactors because of complex interactions among microorganisms, substrate, operational conditions, and structure. In this paper, we developed a multispecies thermal lattice Boltzmann model with the cellular automata model coupled to it to investigate competitive biofilm formation of two aerobic nitrite and ammonium oxidizers in a microbioreactor. Three configurations of the microbioreactor with two heating blocks were simulated to compare the combined effects of the structure and temperature on biofilm growth, detachment, and competition. The results revealed that the heating block temperatures and locations had lower effects on the biofilm growth rate and pattern than the inlet port temperature. Increasing temperature of inlet 2 has more effects on the biofilm growth than increasing temperatures of the two heating blocks. The percentage of the biofilm-occupied grids increases from 7.9 to 12.1% when the inlet temperature at inlet 2 increases from 10 to 50 °C. Two microorganisms showed different rates of responses to changing temperature and structure. The growth of the nitrite oxidizer was about 20% more than that of ammonium oxidizers. This model enables us to understand interactions between individual cells and biofilm communities in the microbioreactor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3abiofilm 3achemistry 3amodels 3anitrites 3aoxidants 3aprocess design 3atemperature1 aWang, Junye1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5562-14000 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Aug. 23, v. 59, no. 37 p.16122-16135dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c031023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245012700178300001400305520165700319592002801976650001102004650001402015650002202029650001502051650001602066650001702082650001702099650001002116650002502126650002102151650002002172651001002192653001502202653002402217653001302241700001802254700001602272700002002288773015202308856008702460852000902547655001202556IND60754757020221121131533.0211023e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075475702DNAL7 a10.5958/2249-5258.2021.00016.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Mathala Juliet10aEnergy analysis of different cucumber varieties in protected cultivation under humid tropic condition of West Coast, India  ap. 90-94.  aEnergy-efficient agricultural production system is a prerequisite to achieving sustainability. The effect of energy-intensive inputs is directly associated with the cost of production and environmental issues. In this regard, a study was conducted to assess the energy use pattern of six cucumber varieties under greenhouse conditions on the west coast of India. The higher energy input (64671 MJ/ha) and energy output (176176 MJ/ha) were observed in Gypsy, closely followed by Kian (energy input 64096 MJ/ha and energy output 164780 MJ/ha) variety, and lower values were observed with variety Infinity. The results indicated that among the six tested varieties, the energy use efficiency (2.72) and energy productivity (3.41 MJ/kg) were found higher in Gypsy (2,72 and 3.41) and Kian (2,57 and 3.21) varieties, respectively. The lower values were observed in the Infinity variety with an energy efficiency and energy productivity of 1.89 and 2.36 MJ/kg. The specific energy required to produce per unit of economic output was lower in varieties Gypsy (0.29 kg/MJ) and Kian (0.31 kg/MJ). The net energy was found maximum in Gypsy (111505 MJ/ha), closely followed by Kian (100684 MJ/ha), indicating cucumber cultivation under protected cultivation as energy-intensive. Further, the energy use pattern of cucumber production indicated that nitrogenous fertiliser, labour, insecticide, and fungicide are the significant energy-consuming inputs for cucumber production. In conclusion, growing varieties Gypsy and Kian would be a better option under greenhouse conditions on the West Coast to achieve higher yield, energy efficiency and energy productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3acucumbers 3aenergy efficiency 3afungicides 3agreenhouses 3ahorticulture 3ainsecticides 3alabor 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aproduction costs 3aspecific energy 3aIndia 0aGreenhouse 0aEnergy productivity 0aNitrogen1 aParamesha, V.1 aThangam, M.1 aArunachalam, V.0 tProgressive horticulture.g2021 June, v. 53, no. 1 p.90-94dIndian Society of Horticultural Research and DevelopmentwJournal:2070x2249-52587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/2249-5258.2021.00016.63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010700158300001800265520141100283592002801694650001501722650001401737650002401751650002501775650001401800650002001814650002101834650001501855650001001870650001301880650001101893650001201904650001801916700001501934700001501949700001401964773012101978856007402099852000902173655001202182IND60664020320221119022739.0190910e20120213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066402032DNAL7 a10.1039/c1ra00944c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Yuesong10aSelective adsorption for removing sulfur: a potential ultra-deep desulfurization approach of jet fuels  ap. 1700-1711.  aJet fuels are strategic fuels widely used in airplanes. Through appropriate reforming and shifting processing, jet fuels can be converted into syngas, which is a suitable fuel to solid oxide fuel cells for many auxiliary and backup power units. Integrated micro fuel processors in combination with solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks using jet fuels have been viewed as attractive portable power sources. Because the sulfur in jet fuels easily causes catalyst poisoning for fuel processing reactions and the electrochemical reactions in fuel cells, ultra-deep sulfur removal in jet fuels and many other hydrocarbon fuels has become a very important and active research subject worldwide in the last 15 years. Amongst the state-of-the-art technologies, selective adsorption for removing sulfur (SARS) is emerged to be very attractive. SARS has been regarded as the most promising approach because it obtains ultra-deep desulfurization efficiency at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure without hydrogen consumption. In this paper, we survey the current status and prospect of the SARS technology for jet fuels, and will discuss some important issues remaining for the SARS technology in the future. The final goal of this survey is to find/innovate a promising method for jet fuel desulfurization, which is most suitable for supplying fuels to solid oxide fuel cell auxiliary and backup power units.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aairplanes 3aambient temperature 3aatmospheric pressure 3acatalysts 3adesulfurization 3aelectrochemistry 3afuel cells 3afuels 3ahydrogen 3asulfur 3asurveys 3asynthesis gas1 aLi, Peiwen1 aXu, Xinhai1 aLiu, Hong0 tRSC advances.g2012 Feb. 13, v. 2, no. 5 p.1700-1711dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1ra00944c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245011100161300001400272506002800286520152000314592002801834506003701862650002001899650001101919650001001930650001401940650001301954650001401967650001201981650001501993650001702008650001102025650000702036650001402043650001502057650001602072653001502088653001002103653003002113653003202143653002702175773012902202856007802331852000902409655001202418IND60774109820221207122847.0190401e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077410982DNAL7 a10.19159/tutad.4792682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBOYACI, Selma10aDetermination of Phenological and Pomological Characteristics of Some Apple (Malus domestica L.)

(Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is a common insect pest of stored legume seeds around the world. Since chemical insecticides and fumigation can have adverse effects on human health and environment, the development of a non-chemical method to replace chemical insecticides is urgently needed for the control of stored products pests. In this study, we investigated the oviposition preference, development, and adult performances of C. chinensis at five radiofrequency levels of 0 (control without frequency), 5, 10, 20, and 30 kHz on three leguminous seeds: azuki bean, cowpea, and mung bean. In addition, the effects were also studied in three successive generations (parent, F1- and F2-generations) of C. chinensis. We found that radiofrequency application had significant effects on the life history variables of C. chinensis. Radiofrequency exposures on C. chinensis not only affected developmental period, adult longevity and adult weight, but also negatively affected the fecundity of subsequent generations. The total developmental period from egg to adult emergence was longer and adult longevity was shorter in the radiofrequency treatments than in the untreated control. Reduced radiofrequency levels coincided with increased sexual development of adults. The lowest rate of adult emergence and the shortest adult longevity both occurred at 5 kHz. The outcomes of this study are discussed in terms of targeting susceptibilities to radiofrequency in storage and semi-field conditions as an alternative to chemical treatments.  aPublisher supplied data  aPJ011291022017cRural Development Administration, Korea 3aCallosobruchus chinensis 3aChrysomelidae 3aVigna angularis 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3achemical treatment 3acowpeas 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afumigation 3ahuman health 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticides 3alife history 3alongevity 3amung beans 3aoviposition 3aradio waves 3aseeds 3asexual development 3astorage pests1 aYi, Hwijong1 aAhn, Jeongjoon1 aRoh, Gwang Hyun1 aPark, Chunggyoo1 aYoon, Youngnam1 aJang, Yunwoo1 aBaek, Inyoul1 aKim, Yongchul1 aBae, Soondo0 tApplied entomology and zoology.g2019 Aug., v. 54, no. 3 p.255-266dSpringer JapanwJournal:22886x0003-68627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13355-019-00621-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03448naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245011500211300001800326500001900344520166000363592002802023596004002051596003502091650006902126650001702195650002302212650001802235650002302253650002102276700006002297700005902357700005802416700005802474700002002532700002302552700001702575700006202592700006002654700006402714773013302778856008202911852000902993655001203002IND60711159720221120194908.0200917e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071115972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-020-02026-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShackleton, Ross T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5628-450610aBiological invasions in World Heritage Sites: current status and a proposed monitoring and reporting framework  ap. 3327-3347.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS) are areas of outstanding universal value and conservation importance. They are, however, threatened by a variety of global change drivers, including biological invasions. We assessed the current status of biological invasions and their management in 241 natural and mixed WHS globally by reviewing documents collated by UNESCO and IUCN. We found that reports on the status of biological invasions in WHS were often irregular or inconsistent. Therefore, while some reports were very informative, they were hard to compare because no systematic method of reporting was followed. Our review revealed that almost 300 different invasive alien species (IAS) were considered as a threat to just over half of all WHS. Information on IAS management undertaken in WHS was available for fewer than half of the sites that listed IAS as a threat. There is clearly a need for an improved monitoring and reporting system for biological invasions in WHS and likely the same for other protected areas globally. To address this issue, we developed a new framework to guide monitoring and reporting of IAS in protected areas building on globally accepted standards for IAS assessments, and tested it on seven WHS. The framework requires the collation of information and reporting on pathways, alien species presence, impacts, and management, the estimation of future threats and management needs, assessments of knowledge and gaps, and, using all of this information allows for an overall threat score to be assigned to the protected area.

Konfetti)” was carried out at Floriculture Department Farm, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, during 2016–17 to study the effect of pre-emergence herbicides and different mulching materials on vegetative and floral parameters of Rosa hybrida var. Konfetti by using the following treatments, Black polythene mulch (200 μ), Paddy straw mulch (4.5 kg/m²), Pendimethalin 1.5 kg/ha, Pendimethalin 1.0 kg/ha, Pendimethalin 1.0 kg/ha + Paddy straw mulch (4.5 kg/m²), Hand weeding (Monthly interval) and weedy check. The result of experiment showed that Black polythene mulch (200 μ) was found to be the very effective weed control method. Maximum plant height (44.57 cm), plant spread (36.77 cm), number of branches per plant (5.13), number of flowering buds (4.93), flowering diameter (6.49 cm) and length of flowering stalk (17.97 cm) and minimum days taken to flowering (37.71 days) and longer flowering duration (17.97 days) was observed under black polythene mulch (200 μ) treatment. The minimum value of all the observations recorded was found to be in the weedy check. Thus, the present investigation revealed that among all the mulch materials used, black polythene mulch (200 μ) was found most effective among all.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa hybr. 3aagricultural colleges 3acontrol methods 3afarms 3afloriculture 3apendimethalin 3aplant height 3arice straw 3astraw mulches 0aIntegrated weed management 0aMulching material 0aRose 0aWeed control1 aDubey, R.K.1 aBhullar, M.S.1 aDeepika, Ravi0 tProgressive horticulture.g2021 June, v. 53, no. 1 p.109-115dIndian Society of Horticultural Research and DevelopmentwJournal:2070x2249-52587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/2249-5258.2021.00019.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245019100168520088400359592002801243650001101271650001101282650002801293650001401321650001601335650001601351650001101367650002801378650002201406650001501428653001601443653002201459653002601481653002701507653001701534700002101551700001501572700001601587773011901603856008201722852000901804655001201813IND60727235020221120132546.0210428e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072723502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2021.1005552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuura, Takuya10aFlow characteristics of artesian groundwater in coastal area of Kurobe River basin, Toyama Prefecture, by long-term and spatial observation of water temperature and electric conductivity  aLong-term (9 years from 2011) and spatial (106 points in 2012 and 2013) observation of water temperature and electric conductivity were conducted for groundwater and river water throughout the Kurobe River basin to clarify the recharge area and recharge situation for the safety use of groundwater resources.

But in the recent past, mango cultivation has gained momentum in lower hills. Under such circumstances the concept of high density plantation has become extremely significant to increase fruit yield and productivity in small as well as scattered land. KVK Uttarkashi introduced the intervention of high density plantation of Amrapali variety of mango in lower to mid hills of district Uttarkashi. The dwarf variety of mango Amrapali was planted in 3 x 3 m spacing at farmer's field. The plantation with normal density plantation fetches net return of Rs. 4896/Nali, whereas, plantation with high density obtained Rs. 10654/Nali. The net return per nail in HDP in lower hills is more than double the traditional method and this profit may be fetched four years earlier. The high net return is due to high density plantation and late season harvesting (off season) in lower hills.  aPublisher supplied data 3adwarf cultivars 3afarmers 3afruit yield 3amangoes 3aHimalayan region 0aHigh density 0aMango 0aLower hills1 aPapnai, Gaurav0 tProgressive horticulture.g2021 June, v. 53, no. 1 p.120-122dIndian Society of Horticultural Research and DevelopmentwJournal:2070x2249-52587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/2249-5258.2021.00021.X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245013000175300001800305500001900323520146100342592002801803650001501831650002101846650002101867650001201888650001201900650001501912650002901927650001201956650001101968650001601979650001401995650001302009650001802022700002202040700002202062773013502084856008102219852000902300655001202309IND50067493720221120043738.0150207e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006749372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-012-1357-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMamindy-Pajany, Yannick10aImpact of sewage sludge spreading on nickel mobility in a calcareous soil: adsorption–desorption through column experiments  ap. 4414-4423.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA soil column adsorption–desorption study was performed on an agricultural calcareous soil to determine the impact of sewage sludge spreading on nickel mobility. Ni adsorption experiments were followed by desorption tests involving the following liquid extractants: water, calcium (100 mg/L), oxalic acid (525 mg/L equivalent to 100 mg carbon/L), and sludge extracts (0.5 and 2.5 g/L). Desorption tests were also conducted after sewage sludge spreading at three application rates (30, 75, and 150 t/ha). According to the breakthrough curve, Ni adsorption was irreversible and occurred mainly through interactions with calcite surface sites. Nickel desorption from the soil column was promoted in presence of significant dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration as observed with oxalic acid elution and sludge extract at 2.5 g/L. In sludge-amended soil columns, the maximum Ni levels occurred in first pore volumes, and they were positively correlated to the sludge application rate. The presence of DOC in leaching waters was the main factor controlling Ni desorption from the sludge-amended soil columns. This finding implies that DOC generated by sludge applied on calcareous soils might facilitate the leaching of Ni due to the formation of soluble Ni–organic complexes. Thus, sludge application can have potential environmental impacts in calcareous soils, since it promotes nickel transport by decreasing Ni retention by soil components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aapplication rate 3acalcareous soils 3acalcite 3acalcium 3adesorption 3adissolved organic carbon 3aliquids 3anickel 3aoxalic acid 3apollution 3aresearch 3asewage sludge1 aSayen, Stéphanie1 aGuillon, Emmanuel0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.4414-4423dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1357-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010600167300001600273520116200289592002801451650002701479650001501506650001201521650001201533650001501545650001201560650002201572650002101594650001101615700002001626700001801646700002001664773010001684856008101784852000901865655001201874IND60085441920221118160711.0141101e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008544192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2012.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Der-Ming10aImproved operating policy utilizing aerobic operation for fermentation process to produce bio-ethanol  ap. 178-189.  aTo enhance the productivity of the alcohol fermentation process, combined aerobic and anaerobic fed-batch operation could improve the growth of microbes and also achieve better alcohol production because of well-utilizing the characteristics of the microbial metabolism. Using a realistic model fitted from experimental data, result shows that the highest productivity can be achieved using a proposed fed-batch operation with high glucose concentration. The proposed operating policy combines an initial aerobic operation to increase the biomass formation in the early phase of the fed-batch operation and then followed by the anaerobic operation to accelerate the alcohol production in the later phase. The glucose feeding policy for this optimal fed-batch operation should try to maintain a lower optimal glucose concentration in the fermenter during initial aerobic phase and then to maintain another higher optimal glucose concentration during the next anaerobic phase. Toward the ending of the fed-batch, the glucose concentration in the fermenter should be increased further in order to speed up the productivity of ethanol after the feeding stopped.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcoholic fermentation 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3aethanol 3afermenters 3aglucose 3aissues and policy 3amicrobial growth 3amodels1 aWang, Tzu-Hsing1 aChien, I-Lung1 aHwang, Wen-Song0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 68 p.178-189dElsevier B.V.x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2012.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009500158300001800253520179000271592002802061650002202089650001902111650001302130650002402143650001002167650001902177650001102196650001402207650002202221650001602243650003002259650001602289650001102305650000902316650001102325650001702336650001802353650003102371650001202402650000702414650001702421650001102438650001702449650001302466650002102479700001902500700002202519700002002541700001702561700001902578773010602597856007502703852000902778655001202787IND60532822820221122035512.0160728e20140512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053282282DNAL7 a10.1021/bm500400k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFehse, Susanne10aCopper Transport Mediated by Nanocarrier Systems in a Blood–Brain Barrier In Vitro Model  ap. 1910-1919.  aCopper (Cu) is a cofactor of various metalloenzymes and has a role in neurodegenerative diseases with disturbed Cu homeostasis, for example, in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Menkes disease. To address Cu imbalances, we synthesized two different dendritic nanoparticles (NP) for the transport of Cu(II) ions across the blood–brain barrier (BBB). The synthesized NPs show low toxicity and high water solubility and can stabilize high amounts of Cu(II). The Cu(II)-laden NPs crossed cellular membranes and increased the cellular Cu level. A human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) model was established to investigate the permeability of the NPs through the BBB. By comparing the permeability × surface area product (PSₑ) of reference substances with those of NPs, we observed that NPs crossed the BBB model two times more effectively than ¹⁴C-sucrose and sodium fluorescein (NaFl) and up to 60× better than Evans Blue labeled albumin (EBA). Our results clearly indicate that NPs cross the BBB model effectively. Furthermore, Cu was shielded by the NPs, which decreased the Cu toxicity. The novel design of the core–shell NP enabled the complexation of Cu(II) in the outer shell and therefore facilitated the pH-dependent release of Cu in contrast to core–multishell NPs, where the Cu(II) ions are encapsulated in the core. This allows a release of Cu into the cytoplasm. In addition, by using a cellular detection system based on a metal response element with green fluorescent protein (MRE-GFP), we demonstrated that Cu could also be released intracellularly from NPs and is accessible for biological processes. Our results indicate that NPs are potential candidates to rebalance metal-ion homeostasis in disease conditions affecting brain and neuronal systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aMenkes disease 3aalbumins 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3acell membranes 3acopper 3acytoplasm 3aendothelial cells 3afluorescein 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aions 3amodels 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3apH 3apermeability 3asodium 3asurface area 3atoxicity 3awater solubility1 aNowag, Sabrina1 aQuadir, Mohiuddin1 aKim, Kwang-sik,1 aHaag, Rainer1 aMulthaup, Gerd0 tBiomacromolecules.g2014 May 12, v. 15, no. 5 p.1910-1919dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm500400k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100006500180245013300245300001800378500001100396506007600407520134700483592002801830596012001858596003101978506003702009650001602046650001402062650002202076650002402098650002402122650002002146650001802166650003102184650001702215650002502232700006202257700002102319700002102340700002002361700006402381700006302445773012002508856007302628852000902701655001202710IND60675787120221207120835.0191108e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067578712DNAL7 a10.1111/obr.129312doi7 aPMC68997092pmcid7 a314686472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenturelli, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9190-866814aThe effect of Public Health/Pediatric Obesity interventions on socioeconomic inequalities in childhood obesity: A scoping review  ap. 1720-1739.  aREVIEW  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChildhood obesity has a strong social gradient. This scoping review aims to synthesize the evidence on the impact on inequalities of non‐targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity in high‐income countries. We updated a review by Hillier‐Brown, searching up to 31 December 2017 on MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, with no limitations on study design. Fifty‐eight studies describing 51 interventions were included: 31 randomized clinical trials and 27 non‐randomized trials, with sample sizes from 67 to 2,700,880 subjects. The majority were implemented in the school setting at a community level; the others were in health services or general population setting and targeting individuals or the system. Twenty‐nine interventions proved to be effective overall; seven others had an effect only in a subgroup, while 15 proved not to be effective. All types of included interventions can increase inequalities. Moreover, some interventions had opposite effects based on the socioeconomic characteristics. Any kind of intervention can reduce equity. Consequences are difficult to predict based on intervention construct. Complex interventions acting on multiple targets, settings, and risk factors are more effective and have a lower risk of increasing inequalities.  aPublisher supplied data  a770492‐CoSIE‐127 H2020‐SC6‐CO‐CREATION‐2016‐2017/H2020‐SC6‐COCREATION‐2017cEuropean Commission  cItalian Ministry of Health0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3achildhood 3achildhood obesity 3adeveloped countries 3aexperimental design 3ahealth services 3apublic health 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk factors 3asocioeconomic status1 aFerrari, Francesca1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4093-21981 aBroccoli, Serena1 aBonvicini, Laura1 aMancuso, Pamela1 aBargellini, Annalisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7562-14721 aGiorgi Rossi, Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9703-24600 tObesity reviews.g2019 Dec., v. 20, no. 12 p.1720-1739dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949851x1467-78817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obr.129313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100006200189245007400251300001600325500001100341506007600352520123500428592002801663596005001691596006201741506003701803650001901840650001501859650001901874650001501893650000701908700002001915700002301935773013801958856008202096852000902178655001202187IND60654861220221207122756.0190726e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065486122DNAL7 a10.1007/s40641-019-00129-82doi7 aPMC66596132pmcid7 a314042172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBushinsky, Seth M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5106-467810aObserving Changes in Ocean Carbonate Chemistry: Our Autonomous Future  ap. 207-220.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW: We summarize recent progress on autonomous observations of ocean carbonate chemistry and the development of a network of sensors capable of observing carbonate processes at multiple temporal and spatial scales. RECENT FINDINGS: The development of versatile pH sensors suitable for both deployment on autonomous vehicles and in compact, fixed ecosystem observatories has been a major development in the field. The initial large-scale deployment of profiling floats equipped with these new pH sensors in the Southern Ocean has demonstrated the feasibility of a global autonomous open-ocean carbonate observing system. Our developing network of autonomous carbonate observations is currently targeted at surface ocean CO₂ fluxes and compact ecosystem observatories. New integration of developed sensors on gliders and surface vehicles will increase our coastal and regional observational capability. Most autonomous platforms observe a single carbonate parameter, which leaves us reliant on the use of empirical relationships to constrain the rest of the carbonate system. Sensors now in development promise the ability to observe multiple carbonate system parameters from a range of vehicles in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSF PLR -1425989cNational Science Foundation  aNNX17AI73GcNational Aeronautics and Space Administration0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3apH1 aTakeshita, Yui,1 aWilliams, Nancy L.0 tCurrent climate change reports.g2019 Sept., v. 5, no. 3 p.207-220dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22893x2198-60617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40641-019-00129-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136040001800175100002700193245010400220300001400324506007600338506003100414520162900445592002802074596007002102506003702172650001202209650001602221650001502237650002702252650002302279650002002302650002102322650001302343650001302356650001902369650001302388650001502401650001502416653001302431653002002444653002102464653001502485653001202500700002102512700002202533700002602555773010502581856008602686856004502772961001702817852000902834655001202843IND60592297520221215142557.0200501e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059229752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2018.01.0012chorus7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2018.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristianson, Laura E.10aPlastic carrier polishing chamber reduces pollution swapping from denitrifying woodchip bioreactors  ap. 33-37.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aDenitrifying bioreactors with solid organic carbon sources (i.e., “woodchip bioreactors”) have proven to be relatively simple and cost effective treatment systems for nitrate-laden agricultural and aquacultural waters and wastewaters. However, because this technology is still relatively new, design modifications, such as the addition of a post-bioreactor polishing chamber filled with inert media, may offer potential to increase nitrate removal and mitigate unintended bioreactor by-products. Paired-column configurations filled with woodchips followed by plastic biofilm carrier media showed significant nitrate removal within the woodchip bioreactor columns (37, 26, and 88% nitrate removal efficiencies at woodchip column retention times of 7.1, 18, and 52 h), but no significant additional nitrate removal benefit of the post-processing plastic media chamber (41, 22, and 89% nitrate removal efficiencies, respectively). Releases of chemical oxygen demand from the woodchips were likely not sufficient to fuel significant nitrate removal in the polishing chamber. However, the polishing chamber significantly reduced nitrite releases from the bioreactor columns, and provided some mitigation of reduced sulfate during the 52-h retention time testing period (influent, woodchip effluent, and plastic chamber effluent sulfate concentrations of 23.6, 18.8, and 20.7 mg SO₄²⁻ L⁻¹, respectively). A full-scale post-woodchip polishing chamber filled with inert plastic media generally may not be worth the added cost unless the receiving waters are particularly sensitive to nitrite or hydrogen sulfide.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000079170 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiofilm 3abioreactors 3abyproducts 3achemical oxygen demand 3acost effectiveness 3adenitrification 3ahydrogen sulfide 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aorganic carbon 3asulfates 3awastewater 3awood chips 0aWoodchip 0aDenitrification 0aPlastic carriers 0aWastewater 0aNitrate1 aFeyereisen, Gary1 aLepine, Christine1 aSummerfelt, Steven T.0 tAquacultural engineering.g2018 May, v. 81 p.33-37dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33898x0144-86097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2018.01.0013Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5922975  aUSDA/ARSUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03660naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013100174300001600305520175100321592002802072650001202100650002802112650001302140650001302153650002302166650002902189650002402218650001102242650001802253650001602271650001502287650001502302650001502317650001102332650001202343650002802355653001702383653002202400653001502422653001602437653003702453653000802490653000702498653000802505653000802513653000802521653000702529653000802536653000802544653000802552653000802560653000802568653000802576653000702584653000802591653000902599653000802608653000702616653001002623653000802633700002102641700002202662773016002684856008502844852000902929655001202938IND60727235320221120101312.0220517e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072723532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaliskan, Serife G.10aAcute effects of energy drink on hemodynamic and electrophysiologic parameters in habitual and non-habitual caffeine consumers  ap. 333-338.  aThe consumption of energy drinks has significantly increased in recent years but their adverse effects are yet to be identified. The objective of the study is to determine the acute effects of energy drink on habitual and non-habitual caffeine consumers and if caffeine consumption habit causes a difference in the hemodynamic and electrophysiological responses. We carried out a non-randomized, non-placebo controlled, three-arm parallel assignment with 48 students enrolled at Aydın Adnan Menderes University. Four main groups were determined according to the results of the application acceptance survey. Blood pressure, electrocardiogram, breath rate, haemoglobin oxygen saturation and bioelectrical impedance analysis were measured before consuming the drinks. After consuming the drinks, measurements were repeated at 30 min and 60 min. In addition, Participant's Situation Anxiety Scale was recorded. Energy drink consumption led to a significant increase in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate for non-habitual caffeine consumers. PR interval and QRS complex were not affected significantly, however QTc interval reduced in time. Haemoglobin oxygen saturation and breathing rate did not change. Body fat percentage values of habitual energy drink consumers were smaller than the other groups. Body metabolism rate increased after energy drink consumption. There was no significant change for high-habitual caffeine consumers in all parameters evaluated. Energy drink consumption has a negative effect on hemodynamic parameters. But as the habituation level increases the impact of energy drink on hemodynamic parameters tends to decrease. Registered under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier No: NCT04223167.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody fat 3acaffeine 3aclinical nutrition 3adiastolic blood pressure 3aelectrocardiography 3aenergy 3aenergy drinks 3ahabituation 3aheart rate 3ahemoglobin 3ametabolism 3aoxygen 3asurveys 3asystolic blood pressure 0aEnergy drink 0aElectrocardiogram 0aHeart rate 0aHabituation 0aBioelectrical impedance analysis 0aSBP 0aHR 0aBIA 0aPBF 0aBFM 0aMM 0aTBW 0aECW 0aICW 0aBMI 0aBMR 0aECG 0aBR 0aHOS 0aSTAI 0aDBP 0aSW 0aANOVA 0aSEM1 aKilic, Mahmut A.1 aBilgin, Mehmet D.0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2021 Apr., v. 42 p.333-338dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011700171300001600288520130400304592002801608650001701636650002101653650002101674650002301695650001401718650002601732650001601758650001101774650001701785650001301802650000901815650000901824650001701833650000901850651001401859653003101873653002301904653001501927653001901942653002001961700002101981700001702002700001902019773011102038856008702149852000902236655001202245IND60754757820221121061215.0211023e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075475782DNAL7 a10.5958/2348-7542.2017.00100.02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrijesh Kumar,10aEffect of zinc application on yield, zinc biofortification of grain and use efficiency in rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 589-594.  aMicronutrient deficiencies or ‘hidden hunger’ particular for zinc (Zn) deficiency affect more than 270 million people worldwide and about one-third population of the world is residing in the developing countries. Globally, rice is a staple food of the population and grown approximately 90% in south, south-east and east-Asia, which is inadequate soil Zn level and ultimately causes dysfunctional food system and unbalanced diets. Therefore, the present field experiment was undertaken to study the effect of agronomic Zn fertilization on grain yield, grain Zn and efficiencies of five rice varieties viz., Pusa Basmati 1121, Pusa Basmati 1509, Sugandh 5, CSR 43 and CSR 30. A field study resulted that Pusa Basmati 1121 and Pusa Basmati 1509 were found better for improvement of grain Zn, while Pusa Basmati 1509 and Sugandh 5 for yield in response to Zn fertilization. The effect of 50 kg/ha soil Zn application on grain yield of Pusa Sugandh 5 was recorded highest during both the years of study during 2015 and 2016 and was significantly superior to other four varieties. For the human and animal nutrition points of view, zinc fertilization in rice cultivars is an important cost-effective approach, reduces Zn malnutrition and it can save the life of millions of people in Asian countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aanimal nutrition 3abiofortification 3acost effectiveness 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3ahumans 3amalnutrition 3aresearch 3arice 3asoil 3astaple foods 3azinc 3aEast Asia 0aAgronomic biofortification 0afoliar application 0agrain zinc 0arice varieties 0azinc deficiency1 aRamawat, Naleeni1 aYadav, Vivek1 aSingh, Kuldeep0 tResearch on crops.g2017 Dec., v. 18, no. 4 p.589-594dGaurav PublicationswJournal:27373x2348-75427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/2348-7542.2017.00100.03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245010600212300001800318500001900336520210400355592002802459650001602487650001702503650002402520650002602544650001502570650001202585650001302597650001702610650002202627700002102649700002002670700001902690773013302709856008202842852000902924655001202933IND60711160220221120114814.0200917e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071116022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-020-02025-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabel, Jan Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1378-938110aIsland-mainland lepidopteran assemblies: a blue-print for species conservation in fragmented habitats  ap. 3313-3325.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe theory of island biogeography predicts that species diversity is lower on small islands and on islands far distant from the mainland, and higher on large islands with high habitat heterogeneity, and on islands close to the mainland. In addition, population and species persistence (i.e. their long-term survival) depends on life-history traits, including morphological, ecological and behavioural characteristics. These theories can also be used as basic hypotheses to test species persistence and community assembly of fragmented habitats. Lepidopteran communities living on small and isolated habitats, like small islands located along the northern German coast-line, provide an excellent model system to test for potential effects of species traits on their persistence and on the community assembly on islands and the mainland. Lepidopterans were assessed on the island Hallig Gröde and on the adjoining mainland over a period of almost 50 years. About 500 species were recorded and classified according to their morphological, ecological and behavioural characteristics. Our data suggest less changes in the lepidopteran community composition on the island compared with the mainland. Yet, the number of species was considerably lower on the island compared with the mainland. The lepidopteran species community on the island was dominated by generalist species associated with meadows and grasslands. In contrast, lepidopteran species found at the mainland were frequently associated with forest and shrubs, and frequently showed a higher level of ecological specialization. Lepidopteran species caught on the island were equipped with more elongated wings compared with species found at the mainland. Our data suggest that the island situation functions as ecological filter allowing only specific species to persist and thus creates a subset of the mainland species community. Extrapolating our findings to isolated habitat patches across fragmented landscapes, we expect a similar filtering effect for species composition, and the long-term extinction of sedentary specialist species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidoptera 3abiogeography 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental factors 3aextinction 3aforests 3ahabitats 3alife history 3aspecies diversity1 aHusemann, Martin1 aSchmitt, Thomas1 aUlrich, Werner0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2020 Oct., v. 29, no. 11-12 p.3313-3325dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl50341x0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-020-02025-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245006300211300001600274520162700290592002801917650000801945650001801953650001601971650002301987650002802010650001802038650001302056650001202069650001202081650001202093650001602105650001202121650002302133650001002156650004302166650001502209650001902224650002402243650001202267650002402279651000902303653001402312653002302326653001302349653002502362700002902387700002102416700005902437700006502496700002802561700001702589700006102606773016002667856008502827852000902912655001202921IND60727235420221120101254.0220517e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072723542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhrampoush, Elham1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6395-362114aThe association of vitamin D levels and insulin resistance  ap. 325-332.  aVitamin D deficiency and insulin resistance have great prevalence in society. The latest studies indicate an inverse association between Vitamin D levels, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin D status on insulin resistance. In a cross-sectional study, 2160 participants were randomly recruited from a nutrition clinic in Tehran, Iran, 1057 (48.9%) were female and 1103 (51.1%) male. Information was gathered by a questionnaire. Following 12-h fasting, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin levels, as well as 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were measured. 2-H glucose and insulin levels measured after consumption of 75 g glucose, HOMA2-IR, and HOMA-β indices were then calculated. The average serum Vitamin D was 22.3 + 8.9 nmol/L and the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency was 100%. There was an inverse relationship between Vitamin D levels and age, BMI, waist circumference, and all metabolic parameters (p < 0.001 in all) and a direct association with levels of exercise. Two logistic regression models were used to adjust for confounding variables; firstly, for age, gender, and smoking and secondly, additionally for BMI and energy intake. Both models showed a significant inverse relationship between Vitamin D levels and FPG and insulin levels, 2-h glucose and insulin levels, and HOMA2-IR. The optimum cut point for vitamin D was calculated at about 25 nmol/L for preventing insulin resistance. This study illustrated that there is a statistically significant inverse relationship between Vitamin D levels and insulin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3aclinical nutrition 3across-sectional studies 3aenergy intake 3aexercise 3afasting 3afemales 3aglucose 3ainformation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3amales 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aprevalence 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asociety 3awaist circumference 3aIran 0aVitamin D 0aInsulin resistance 0aDiabetes 0aVitamin D deficiency1 aMirzay Razzaz, Jalaledin1 aarjmand, Hossein1 aGhaemi, Alireza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6132-10681 aRaeisi Shahraki, Hadi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3071-55871 aEbrahim Babaei, Amirali1 aOsati, Saeed1 aHomayounfar, Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5398-95190 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2021 Apr., v. 42 p.325-332dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01210naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245009200208300001200300500002200312520028100334592002800615650001200643650001900655650001500674650001400689773013800703856008200841852000900923655001200932IND60654861420221121055912.0190726e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065486142DNAL7 a10.1007/s40641-019-00139-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWing, Allison A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2194-870910aAuthor Correction: Self-Aggregation of Deep Convection and its Implications for Climate  ap. 258.  aPublished Erratum  aThe original version of this article contained a mistake.

Experiments were carried out using batch reactors for the studies of adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms, competitive adsorption and regeneration. The pseudo second-order model is the best-fit model among others suggesting that the adsorption of precious metals by MNP-G3 in water is a chemisorption process. Three adsorption isotherms namely Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm were examined and the results showed the similarities and consistency of both linear and nonlinear analyses. Pd(IV) and Au(III) with higher valence exhibited relatively better adsorption efficiency than Pd(II) and Ag(I) with lower valence suggesting that the adsorption of precious metals by MNP-G3 is a function of valence. In the presence of the competing ion Zn(II), the adsorption efficiency of MNP-G3 for all four precious metals was declined significantly. The use of MNP-G3-EDTA revealed an increase in the adsorption efficiency for all four precious metals. However, the low selectivity of MNP-G3 towards precious metals was not enhanced by the modification of EDTA onto the MNP-G3. The regeneration of metal-laden MNP-G3 can be readily performed by using 1.0% HCl solution as a desorbent solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aadsorption 3adendrimers 3agold 3ahydrochloric acid 3amagnetism 3amodels 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apalladium 3asilver 3asorption isotherms 3azinc 0aDendrimer 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aNanotechnology 0aAdsorption 0aPrecious metals1 aLien, Hsing-Lung1 aChung, Jung-Shing1 aYeh, Hund-Der0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 322 p.215-222dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.02.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245009100212300001600303500001900319506007600338520127600414536012001690592002801810506003701838650001101875650001801886650002301904650001701927650000901944650002401953650001501977650001401992650002502006650001102031650001502042650001202057650002202069650002502091650001602116650001902132650001702151650001402168653001502182653001602197653001502213653001102228653001202239653001002251700002302261700002602284700002102310700002002331773013502351856008402486852000902570655001202579IND60692898320221207132714.0200503e20140903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069289832DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2014.9650142doi7 aPMC44339292pmcid7 a260195782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoumanov, Jordan10aInteractions of pharmacologically active snake venom sPLA₂ with different cell lines  ap. 918-922.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSecreted Phospholipases A₂ (sPLA₂s) represent a large family of structurally related enzymes, which target different tissues and organs and induce numerous pharmacological effects based on their catalytic specificity – hydrolysis of the sn-2 ester bond of glycerophospholipids. The neurotoxin vipoxin, isolated from the venom of Vipera ammodytes meriodionalis, is a heterodimeric postsynaptic ionic complex composed of two protein subunits – a basic and toxic His48 sPLA₂ enzyme and an acidic, enzymatically inactive and non-toxic component. In this paper, for the first time, we demonstrate that vipoxin sPLA₂ enzyme affects cell integrity and viability of four cell types and causes different cell responses. The most dramatic local tissue effects were observed with RPE-1 (retinal pigment epithelial) cells followed by A549 (adenocarcinomic human alveolar epithelial) cells and MDCK (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney epithelial) cells. Products of the enzymatic reaction, lysophospholipids and unsaturated free fatty acids, act as lipid mediators that can induce membrane damaging or can stimulate cell proliferation. Our preliminary results on the cytotoxic effect of vipoxin sPLA₂ on A549 cells are promising in searching of its eventual anticancer potential.  aThis work was supported by the Bulgarian National Science Fund [grant number DDVU 02/10], [grant number DNTS 01-5].  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVipera 3abiotechnology 3acell proliferation 3acytotoxicity 3adogs 3aenzymatic reactions 3aepithelium 3aequipment 3aglycerophospholipids 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3akidneys 3alysophospholipids 3amedicinal properties 3aneurotoxins 3aphospholipases 3asnake venoms 3aviability 0aMDCK cells 0aRPE-1 cells 0aA549 cells 0ahBest1 0avipoxin 0asPLA21 aMladenova, Kirilka1 aAleksandrov, Radoslav1 aDanovski, Georgi1 aPetrova, Svetla0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2014 Sept. 3, v. 28, no. 5 p.918-922dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2014.9650143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245007400167300001400241500000900255520106400264592002801328650003401356650001401390650002601404650002101430650001301451650002701464650001101491650002901502650001501531650001301546650001701559651001301576651001501589651001301604651001001617700001801627700003401645700002001679700002001699773015501719852000901874856008201883655001201965IND4457507520221118030410.0191124s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445750752DNAL7 a10.4195/jnrlse.2009.0020k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScott, Timothy P.14aThe USDA and K–12 Partnership: A Model Program for Federal Agencies  ap. 29-35.  aepub  aThe Future Scientists Program of Texas A&M University and the Agricultural Research Service branch of USDA serves as a model program of effective collaboration between a federal agency and K–12.

Spontaneous roseoflavin-resistant mutants were obtained by exposing the wild strain (named L. fermentum PBCC11) to increasing concentrations of roseoflavin. Fifteen spontaneous roseoflavin-resistant mutants were isolated, and the level of vitamin B₂was quantified by HPLC. Seven mutant strains produced concentrations of vitamin B₂higher than 1 mg L⁻¹. Interestingly, three mutants were unable to overproduce riboflavin even though they were able to withstand the selective pressure of roseoflavin. Alignment of the rib leader region of PBCC11 and its derivatives showed only point mutations at two neighboring locations of the RFN element. In particular, the highest riboflavin-producing isolates possess an A to G mutation at position 240, while the lowest riboflavin producer carries a T to A substitution at position 236. No mutations were detected in the derivative strains that did not have an overproducing phenotype. The best riboflavin overproducing strain, named L. fermentum PBCC11.5, and its parental strain were used to fortify bread. The effect of two different periods of fermentation on the riboflavin level was compared. Bread produced using the coinoculum yeast and L. fermentum PBCC11.5 led to an approximately twofold increase of final vitamin B₂content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus fermentum 3abreads 3afermentation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amutants 3aphenotype 3apoint mutation 3ariboflavin 3asourdough 3ayeasts 2aBread 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aDrug Tolerance 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aLimosilactobacillus fermentumxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMetabolic Engineering 2aMutation 2aRiboflavinxanalogs & derivativesxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aCapozzi, Vittorio1 aArena, Mattia Pia1 aSpadaccino, Giuseppina1 aDueñas, María Teresa1 aLópez, Paloma,1 aFiocco, Daniela1 aSpanò, Giuseppe,0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Apr., v. 98, no. 8 p.3691-3700dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-5484-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03466naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245009300211300001600304500001900320506007600339520160900415536019702024592002802221506003702249650001202286650001802298650001602316650002502332650003802357650001402395650001702409650001702426650001502443650002502458650004502483650001802528650003202546653002402578653002302602653003502625700001802660700002002678700002202698773013502720856008402855852000902939655001202948IND60692898520221207132720.0200503e20140903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069289852DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2014.9650472doi7 aPMC44338862pmcid7 a260195772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanilov, Noyko10aColorectal cancer severity and survival in correlation with tumour necrosis factor-alpha  ap. 911-917.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aColorectal cancer (CRC) development is strongly associated with innate immune mechanisms and intestinal inflammation. The aim of the study was to investigate the pre-operative serum levels of TNF-α and its correlation with cancer progression and survival in CRC patients taking into account the genotype of –308G/A promoter polymorphism in TNF-α gene (rs1800629). TNF-α –308G/A genotypes of 119 CRC cases and 177 no CRC controls were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism assay (RFLP-PCR). TNF-α serum levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although no significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies between CRC and controls were observed, it should be noted that the minor allele-A and its homozygous genotype were overrepresented among CRC. In addition, allele-A was more frequent in early CRC patients compared to advanced cases. TNF-α serum level was significantly higher in CRC patients than in controls (36.1 ± 8.4 pg/mL vs. 18.66 ± 11 pg/mL; p = 0.0000001). In the subgroup analysis by tumour–node–metastasis stages, the highest TNF-α level was found in stage IV (42.7 ± 12.5 pg/mL) and was significantly elevated compared to earlier stages of CRC and controls. The survival rate of CRC patients with low TNF-α serum level, estimated as median survival, was significantly higher than that of patients with high levels of TNF-α (38.4 vs. 7.761 months; log rank test p = 0.00015) In conclusion, we can affirm that TNF-α affects tumour development along with disease progression which has an impact on the survival of CRC.  aThis work was supported by the Fund for Scientific and Mobile project from Faculty of Medicine at the Trakia University – Stara Zagora, Bulgaria [grant number 7/2011], [grant number 4/2012].  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3abiotechnology 3ablood serum 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aequipment 3ahomozygosity 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3aneoplasm progression 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asurvival rate 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0acytokine production 0atumour progression 0asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aMiteva, Lyuba1 aDobreva, Zlatka1 aStanilova, Spaska0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2014 Sept. 3, v. 28, no. 5 p.911-917dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2014.9650473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001200155245009500167300001400262520110200276592002801378650002101406650001301427650001001440650001301450650001101463650003301474650001901507650001201526700002001538700001901558700001901577700002001596700001701616700002101633773008001654856008901734990002301823852000901846655001201855IND60095940720221120131901.0141104e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009594072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yu10aRole of matrix modification on interlaminar shear strength of glass fibre/epoxy composites  ap. 95-98.  aInterlaminar shear properties of fibre reinforced polymer composites are important in many structural applications. Matrix modification is an effective way to improve the composite interlaminar shear properties. In this paper, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-F/diethyl toluene diamine system is used as the starting epoxy matrix. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and reactive aliphatic diluent named n-butyl glycidyl ether (BGE) are employed to modify the epoxy matrix. Unmodified and modified epoxy resins are used for fabricating glass fibre reinforced composites by a hot-press process. The interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of the glass fibre reinforced composites is investigated and the results indicate that introduction of MWCNT and BGE obviously enhances the ILSS. In particular, the simultaneous addition of 0.5wt.% MWCNTs and 10phr BGE leads to the 25.4% increase in the ILSS for the glass fibre reinforced composite. The fracture surfaces of the fibre reinforced composites are examined by scanning electron microscopy and the micrographs are employed to explain the ILSS results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3aepoxides 3aglass 3apolymers 3aresins 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashear strength 3atoluene1 aYang, Jiao-Ping1 aXiao, Hong-Mei1 aQu, Cheng-Bing1 aFeng, Qing-Ping1 aFu, Shao-Yun1 aShindo, Yasuhide0 tComposites.g2012 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.95-98dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.04.0373Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245007600165300001600241520112900257592002801386650003401414650002201448650002201470650001201492650000901504650001401513650001701527650001401544650001401558651001101572653002201583653002001605653000901625653000901634653002001643700001201663700001301675700001201688700001401700773012801714856008101842961001301923852000901936655001201945IND60523742220221117214822.0200514e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052374222DNAL7 a10.1556/0806.44.2016.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, B.W.10aInheritance and mapping of stem rust resistance of wheat line PI 410966  ap. 414-423.  aStem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp tritici of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most destructive cereal diseases globally. Concern about the disease has increased since 1999 with the discovery in Uganda of a new virulent race of Pgt, designated as race TTKSK (also known as Ug99). The objectives of this experiment were to characterize the resistance and to determine the chromosomal location of the stem rust resistance in the spring wheat line PI 410966. A mapping population was developed from a cross between PI 410966 and a susceptible wheat line OK3040. An inoculation test with isolate 04KEN156/04 of race TTKSK was conducted at the USDA-ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory in the F₆:₇ generation, and the F₆:₇ phenotypic data were used to genetically map the resistance gene to the centromeric region on chromosome 2BS. The single locus explained the observed F₆:₇ resistant and susceptible scores. The location of the gene and molecular marker banding profiles of the diagnostic markers suggest that the stem rust resistance gene in PI 410966 could be a new gene, an allele of Sr36, or Sr36.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgricultural Research Service 3aPuccinia graminis 3aTriticum aestivum 3aalleles 3aloci 3aphenotype 3aspring wheat 3astem rust 3avirulence 3aUganda 0aPuccinia graminis 0awheat stem rust 0aUg99 0aSr36 0aresistance gene1 aLiu, Y.1 aWise, K.1 aJin, Y.1 aOhm, H.W.0 tCereal research communications.g2016 Sept., v. 44, no. 3 p.414-423dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:J000000058x1788-91707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/0806.44.2016.0143Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01510naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002100135245009500156300001600251520065200267592002800919650001900947650002600966650001500992650002501007650002201032650002601054773009301080856003801173852000901211655001201220IND4467925920221122053557.0120529s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446792592DNAL7 a10.1071/CP111732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlston, Margaret10aSynthesis paper on socioeconomic factors relating to agriculture and community development  ap. 232-239.  aAgriculture is highly dependent on the social sustainability inherent in rural communities.

More than 500 fragments were studied using conventional imaging, electron diffraction and EDX microanalysis. Two categories of particles are distinguishable in equal proportions (wt%). The first one is comprised of relatively large crystalline grains (≈1μm on average), dominated by silicates (olivine and pyroxene). They display a wide range of compositions and microstructures comparable to those found in terminal particles. Minor phases including magnetite and apatite are also present. Their occurrence suggests that the Wild 2 material underwent aqueous alteration to some extent. The second type of particle, called GEMS-like material, is made of silica-rich glassy clumps embedding iron sulfide beads and vesicles. Their microstructure is characteristic of thermally modified particles that have suffered strong interaction with the silica aerogel during the hypervelocity impact. This melted material may form by shedding of melted and vaporized material, but given the shape of the impact track and high diversity of surviving mineral compositions, much of it originated from fine-grained aggregates that disaggregated during the collection. Chemical mapping at the nano-scale allowed the localization of individual components within the silica-rich glass. They are dominated by Mg-rich components with a size less than 300nm. The average composition of this thermally modified material is close to the solar abundance for the major elements Fe, Mg and S. The fine-grained material has probably not been chemically fractionated in the protoplanetary disk before its incorporation in comet Wild 2 unlike the sulfur depleted matrix of chondrites. From these two categories of particles, we deduce that Wild 2 is likely made of an assemblage of relatively large evolved grains (first category) cemented by a fine-grained material with primitive chemistry (second category). The pre-impact configuration of the incident material deduced from this study seems comparable to the matrix of the most primitive chondrites (3.0) or to chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapatite 3abulbs 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aglass 3aimage analysis 3airon 3amagnesium 3amagnetite 3amicrostructure 3amineral content 3asilica 3asilicates 3asulfur 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aJacob, Damien1 aLeroux, Hugues0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 June 15, v. 87 p.35-50dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.03.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245012400199300001800323500002000341506007600361520124700437592002801684506003701712650002801749650001301777650002001790650002501810650001401835650001301849650001401862650003201876650001801908650001101926700001701937700001301954700001701967700001701984773013302001856007302134852000902207655001202216IND60649978920221207103642.0190709e20150602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064997892DNAL7 a10.3390/nu70643082doi7 aPMC44887852pmcid7 a260430312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Gongchao12aA Comparison of Postoperative Early Enteral Nutrition with Delayed Enteral Nutrition in Patients with Esophageal Cancer  ap. 4308-4317.  aJournal Article  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe examined esophageal cancer patients who received enteral nutrition (EN) to evaluate the validity of early EN compared to delayed EN, and to determine the appropriate time to start EN. A total of 208 esophagectomy patients who received EN postoperatively were divided into three groups (Group 1, 2 and 3) based on whether they received EN within 48 h, 48 h–72 h or more than 72 h, respectively. The postoperative complications, length of hospital stay (LOH), days for first fecal passage, cost of hospitalization, and the difference in serum albumin values between pre-operation and post-operation were all recorded. The statistical analyses were performed using the t-test, the Mann-Whitney U test and the chi square test. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Group 1 had the lowest thoracic drainage volume, the earliest first fecal passage, and the lowest LOH and hospitalization expenses of the three groups. The incidence of pneumonia was by far the highest in Group 3 (p = 0.019). Finally, all the postoperative outcomes of nutritional conditions were the worst by a significant margin in Group 3. It is therefore safe and valid to start early enteral nutrition within 48 h for postoperative esophageal cancer patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achi-square distribution 3adrainage 3aenteral feeding 3aesophageal neoplasms 3ahospitals 3apatients 3apneumonia 3apostoperative complications 3aserum albumin 3at-test1 aChen, Hongbo1 aLiu, Jun1 aMa, Yongchen1 aJia, Haiyong0 tNutrients.g2015 June 02, v. 7, no. 6 p.4308-4317dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu70643083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015000167300001600317520171100333592002802044650001102072650001502083650002302098650002202121650001202143650002402155650002002179650001502199650001002214650001802224650001102242650001902253650002202272650001102294650001502305650001402320650002202334650001002356700001702366700001702383700001802400700001602418700001802434700001902452700002202471700002102493773008902514856008102603852000902684655001202693IND60440404520221119141353.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044040452DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-015-9578-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLupoi, Jason S.10aHigh-Throughput Prediction of Acacia and Eucalypt Lignin Syringyl/Guaiacyl Content Using FT-Raman Spectroscopy and Partial Least Squares Modeling  ap. 953-963.  aHigh-throughput techniques are necessary to efficiently screen potential lignocellulosic feedstocks for the production of renewable fuels, chemicals, and bio-based materials, thereby reducing experimental time and expense while supplanting tedious, destructive methods. The ratio of lignin syringyl (S) to guaiacyl (G) monomers has been routinely quantified as a way to probe biomass recalcitrance. Mid-infrared and Raman spectroscopy have been demonstrated to produce robust partial least squares models for the prediction of lignin S/G ratios in a diverse group of Acacia and eucalypt trees. The most accurate Raman model has now been used to predict the S/G ratio from 269 unknown Acacia and eucalypt feedstocks. This study demonstrates the application of a partial least squares model composed of Raman spectral data and lignin S/G ratios measured using pyrolysis/molecular beam mass spectrometry (pyMBMS) for the prediction of S/G ratios in an unknown data set. The predicted S/G ratios calculated by the model were averaged according to plant species, and the means were not found to differ from the pyMBMS ratios when evaluating the mean values of each method within the 95 % confidence interval. Pairwise comparisons within each data set were employed to assess statistical differences between each biomass species. While some pairwise appraisals failed to differentiate between species, Acacias, in both data sets, clearly display significant differences in their S/G composition which distinguish them from eucalypts. This research shows the power of using Raman spectroscopy to supplant tedious, destructive methods for the evaluation of the lignin S/G ratio of diverse plant biomass materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aEucalyptus 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abiobased products 3abiomass 3aconfidence interval 3adata collection 3afeedstocks 3afuels 3aleast squares 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3aprediction 3apyrolysis 3aspectral analysis 3atrees1 aHealey, Adam1 aSingh, Seema1 aSykes, Robert1 aDavis, Mark1 aLee, David J.1 aShepherd, Merv1 aSimmons, Blake A.1 aHenry, Robert J.0 tBioEnergy research.g2015 Sept., v. 8, no. 3 p.953-963dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-015-9578-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010900171300001400280520210300294592002802397650002202425650002302447650001502470650001302485650001502498650001302513650002202526650000902548650001902557650000702576650001702583700001502600700002102615700002002636773009702656856008102753990002302834852000902857655001202866IND60099282120221122041401.0141105e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009928212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gca.2012.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenney, Janice P.L.13aAn experimental study of Au removal from solution by non-metabolizing bacterial cells and their exudates  ap. 51-60.  aIn this study, we examine the initial interactions between aqueous Au(III)-hydroxide-chloride aqueous complexes and bacteria by measuring the effects of non-metabolizing cells on the speciation and distribution of Au. We conducted batch Au(III) removal experiments, measuring the kinetics and pH dependence of Au removal, and tracking valence state transformations and binding environments using XANES spectroscopy. These experiments were conducted using non-metabolizing cells of Bacillus subtilis or Pseudomonas putida suspended in a 5ppm Au(III)-(hydroxide)-chloride starting solution of 0.1M NaClO₄ to buffer ionic strength. Both bacterial species removed greater than 85% of the Au from solution after 2h of exposure time below approximately pH 5. Above pH 5, the extent of Au removed from solution decreased with increasing pH, with less than approximately 10% removal of Au from solution above pH 7.5. Kinetics experiments indicated that the Au removal with both bacterial species was rapid at pH 3, and slowed with increasing pH. Reversibility experiments demonstrated that (1) once the Au was removed from solution, adjusting 35 the pH alone did not remobilize the Au into solution and (2) the presence of cysteine in solution in the reversibility experiments caused Au to desorb, suggesting that the Au was not internalized within the bacterial cells. Our results suggest that Au removal occurs as a two-step pH-dependent adsorption reduction process. The speciation of the aqueous Au and the bacterial surface appears to control the rate of Au removal from solution. Under low pH conditions, the cell walls are only weakly negatively charged and aqueous Au complexes adsorb readily and rapidly. With increasing pH, the cell wall becomes more negatively charged, slowing adsorption significantly. The XANES data demonstrate that the reduction of Au(III) by bacterial exudates is slower and less extensive than the reduction observed in the bacteria-bearing systems, and we conclude that Au reduction occurs most rapidly and extensively upon interaction with cell wall functional groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aPseudomonas putida 3aadsorption 3abacteria 3acell walls 3acysteine 3aexposure duration 3agold 3aionic strength 3apH 3aspectroscopy1 aSong, Zhen1 aBunker, Bruce A.1 aFein, Jeremy B.0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 June 15, v. 87 p.51-60dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.03.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04093naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002300188245013500211300001100346506007600357520253400433592002802967506003702995650001503032650001103047650001303058650001703071650000903088650001103097650001503108650001503123650001103138650001703149650002703166650002403193650002503217650001303242650004403255700007203299700001603371700001803387773011503405856008203520852000903602655001203611IND60627617220221207055139.0210403e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062761722DNAL7 aPMC63357002pmcid7 a306511022pmid7 a10.1186/s12917-018-1722-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Britta M.10aIntravitreal injection of low-dose gentamicin for the treatment of recurrent or persistent uveitis in horses: Preliminary results.  ap. 29.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Despite appropriate medical therapy, many horses with equine recurrent uveitis continue to suffer from recurrent bouts of inflammation. Surgical intervention via the pars plana vitrectomy or suprachoroidal cyclosporine implant placement may control and/or prevent recurrences, however, these procedures may be contraindicated, unavailable, or declined by an owner. Thus, an effective adjunctive treatment option may help to improve the clinical outcomes in those situations. There are several anecdotal reports on the use of intravitreal gentamicin injections, but to date, no data evaluating the complication rate and/or treatment effect following this treatment have been published. Thus, the aim of this prospective study was to describe the intravitreal gentamicin injection technique, describe the associated peri-injection (within 24 h) and post-injection (30 to 780 days) complications, and to report the effects of the injection on the clinical signs of uveitis. Additionally, evaluation of the systemic and ocular Leptospira-status, and its effect on the treatment outcome was performed. A total of 86 horses of various ages, breeds, and gender presenting with recurrent or persistent uveitis were treated via intravitreal injection of 4 mg of undiluted gentamicin (0.04 ml, Genta 100, 100 mg/ml in 35 horses) or preservative-free gentamicin (0.05 ml, 80 mg/ml in 52 horses) under sedation and local anesthesia. All 86 horses were observed for immediate peri-injection and post-injection complications. Response to therapy was evaluated in 59 of the 86 horses (follow-up: 30 to 780 days). RESULTS: Peri-injection complications consisted of subconjunctival (26/86; 30.2%) or intracameral hemorrhage (4/86; 4.7%); both of which completely resolved within 5 days. Post-injection complications consisted of cataract formation/maturation (5/59 horses, 8.5%) and diffuse retinal degeneration (3/59 eyes 5.1%). The majority of horses 52/59 (88.1%) with a minimum follow-up period of 30 days were controlled (absence of recurrent or persistent inflammation) at their last recheck examination. Recurrent inflammation was documented in 5/59 (8.5%) horses and persistent inflammation was diagnosed in 2/59 (3.4%) horses. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal injection of low-dose gentamicin shows promise at controlling different types and stages of uveitis. The ability of intravitreal injections of low-dose gentamicin (4 mg) to control persistent and recurrent inflammation warrants further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanesthesia 3abreeds 3acataract 3acyclosporine 3aeyes 3agender 3agentamicin 3ahemorrhage 3ahorses 3ainflammation 3aintravitreal injection 3aprospective studies 3aretinal degeneration 3asedation 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans)1 aMcMullen, Richard J., JrcJr1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0635-08831 aReese, Sven1 aBrehm, Walter0 tBMC veterinary research.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.29-29dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1722-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03706naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245015700164520240400321592002802725650001102753650002102764650003102785650001002816650000902826650001102835651002102846651001502867700001902882700002402901700002002925700002202945700002502967700002102992700002403013700002503037700002203062773012803084856007503212852000903287655001203296IND60762589420221117025651.0220110e20211224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076258942DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140100822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBracci, Alessandro 10aQuantitative Precipitation Estimation over Antarctica Using Different Ze-SR Relationships Based on Snowfall Classification Combining Ground Observations  aSnow plays a crucial role in the hydrological cycle and energy budget of the Earth, and remote sensing instruments with the necessary spatial coverage, resolution, and temporal sampling are essential for snowfall monitoring. Among such instruments, ground-radars have scanning capability and a resolution that make it possible to obtain a 3D structure of precipitating systems or vertical profiles when used in profiling mode. Radars from space have a lower spatial resolution, but they provide a global view. However, radar-based quantitative estimates of solid precipitation are still a challenge due to the variability of the microphysical, geometrical, and electrical features of snow particles. Estimations of snowfall rate are usually accomplished using empirical, long-term relationships between the equivalent radar reflectivity factor (Ze) and the liquid-equivalent snowfall rate (SR). Nevertheless, very few relationships take advantage of the direct estimation of the microphysical characteristics of snowflakes. In this work, we used a K-band vertically pointing radar collocated with a laser disdrometer to develop Ze-SR relationships as a function of snow classification. The two instruments were located at the Italian Antarctic Station Mario Zucchelli. The K-band radar probes the low-level atmospheric layers, recording power spectra at 32 vertical range gates. It was set at a high vertical resolution (35 m), with the first trusted range gate at a height of only 100 m. The disdrometer was able to provide information on the particle size distribution just below the trusted radar gate. Snow particles were classified into six categories (aggregate, dendrite aggregate, plate aggregate, pristine, dendrite pristine, plate pristine). The method was applied to the snowfall events of the Antarctic summer seasons of 2018–2019 and 2019–2020, with a total of 23,566 min of precipitation, 15.3% of which was recognized as showing aggregate features, 33.3% dendrite aggregate, 7.3% plates aggregate, 12.5% pristine, 24% dendrite pristine, and 7.6% plate pristine. Applying the appropriate Ze-SR relationship in each snow category, we calculated a total of 87 mm water equivalent, differing from the total found by applying a unique Ze-SR. Our estimates were also benchmarked against a colocated Alter-shielded weighing gauge, resulting in a difference of 3% in the analyzed periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3ahydrologic cycle 3aparticle size distribution 3aradar 3asnow 3asummer 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica1 aBaldini, Luca 1 aRoberto, Nicoletta 1 aAdirosi, Elisa 1 aMontopoli, Mario 1 aScarchilli, Claudio 1 aGrigioni, Paolo 1 aCiardini, Virginia 1 aLevizzani, Vincenzo 1 aPorcù, Federico 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Dec. 24, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140100823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04378naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001600168245014600184300001800330520173700348592002802085650001302113650001402126650002302140650001702163650002602180650002302206650002702229650001202256650002002268650001602288650003702304650001702341650008302358650006502441650001202506650003102518650002802549650003702577650003702614650005302651650003402704650001902738650008502757650005202842650000902894650004402903650007302947650002803020650007203048650002603120650004303146650006303189650002803252650003203280700001703312700001603329700001503345700001603360700001503376700001903391700001603410700001303426773011103439856008503550852000903635655001203644IND4478924420221122220852.0141111e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447892442DNAL7 a221372612pmid7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Sifan10aResveratrol induces Sirt1-dependent apoptosis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by activating AMPK and suppressing AKT activity and survivin expression  ap. 1100-1112.  aResveratrol is a natural polyphenolic compound with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties, and it serves as a chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent. However, only very limited data have been obtained regarding the effects of resveratrol on preadipocytes, and the mechanisms of these effects remain largely unknown. In this study, murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were incubated with resveratrol, and cell apoptosis was investigated. Resveratrol caused S-phase arrest to inhibit cell proliferation and significantly increased the lactate dehydrogenase leaking ratio. Hoechst 33258 staining and transmission electron microscopy revealed the ultrastructural changes in nuclear chromatins of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, resveratrol activated the mitochondrial signaling with decreases in the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release and the activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3. Resveratrol treatment also increased the protein level of Sirt1. By using small interfering RNAs of Sirt1, adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α, survivin and the AMPK agonist (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-D-ribofuranoside) and specific inhibitors for protein kinase B (AKT) or caspases, it was demonstrated that activation of Sirt1 inhibited AKT activation and further decreased the expression of survivin. It could also increase AMPK activation. Both signaling pathways activated mitochondrion-mediated pathway. Our findings clarified the apoptotic effects of resveratrol in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and revealed the involved pathway including AMPK, AKT and survivin, suggesting its potential therapeutic application in the treatment or prevention of obesity and related metabolic symptoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3acytochrome c 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amembrane potential 3aneuroprotective effect 3aobesity 3aprotein kinases 3aresveratrol 3atransmission electron microscopy 2a3T3-L1 Cells 2aAMP-Activated Protein Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAdipocytes, Whitexdrug effectsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCaspase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aCaspasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aChromatin Assembly and Disassemblyxdrug effects 2aDown-Regulationxdrug effects 2aGene Silencing 2aInhibitor of Apoptosis Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Potential, Mitochondrialxdrug effects 2aMice 2aProtein Kinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-aktxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Small Interfering. 2aRepressor Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aS Phasexdrug effects 2aSecond Messenger Systemsxdrug effects 2aSirtuin 1xantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aStilbenesxpharmacology 2aUp-Regulationxdrug effects1 aXiao, Xincai1 aFeng, Xiang1 aLi, Wenxue1 aZhou, Niman1 aZheng, Lin1 aSun, Yanshuang1 aZhang, Zili1 aZhu, Wei0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2012 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.1100-1112dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245007800163300001200241520093400253592002801187650002001215650001001235650001601245650001801261650002001279650002001299650002301319650001201342650001901354650002101373653001901394653002401413653002901437653000801466700002101474773013601495856007301631852000901704655001201713IND60780280120221121061254.0220617e20220202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078028012DNAL7 a10.1637/21-001102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCervantes, Hector M.14aThe Use of Anticoccidial Sensitivity Tests (ASTs) by the Poultry Industry  ap. 1-5.  aAnticoccidial drug resistance in coccidia has been known since the 1960s, and experimental selection for resistance in the laboratory has been done for most available products. However, routine testing for sensitivity in field isolates has only begun in recent years. Poultry producers are faced with greater challenges because of consumer preferences for ‘antibiotic-free’ products and a lack of new products for disease control. The classification of some of our most effective anticoccidials as ‘antibiotics’ has severely limited their use, causing us to rely on older products that are prone to resistance development. The interaction between coccidiosis and other diseases such as necrotic enteritis places more importance on routine testing for drug sensitivity. In this review, we have summarized the use of the anticoccidial sensitivity test (AST) as it is conducted and interpreted by poultry health specialists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoccidiomorphea 3abirds 3acoccidiosis 3acoccidiostats 3adisease control 3adrug resistance 3anecrotic enteritis 3apoultry 3apoultry health 3apoultry industry 0aanticoccidials 0asensitivity testing 0aanticoccidial resistance 0aAST1 aMcDougald, L.

This study addresses the following research questions: (i) What is the effect of cattle slurry application on giant reed productivity? (ii) does giant reed use efficiently the N applied in the form of cattle slurry? (iii) does the ratio of carbon (C) to N (C/N) in harvested biomass vary with rates N supply? To explore these questions, a field experiment was carried out over 5 years in the low Po Valley, Northern Italy. Fertilization treatments annually applied were the following: (i) no fertilization (control); (ii) cattle slurry 10 mm, i.e., 10 L m⁻² (CS10); and (iii) cattle slurry 20 mm, i.e., 20 L m⁻² (CS20). Compared to the control, the cattle slurry supply substantially increased yield and yield stability of giant reed. The physiological efficiency of applied N (PEN) was 216 kg aboveground DM per kg N uptake for the favorable years 2009, 2010, and 2011. Giant reed produced a lot of biomass per kg of N uptake, therefore limiting the amount of fertilizers needed for its cultivation. The recovery efficiency of applied N (REN) varied from 0.12 to 0.39. The agronomic efficiency of applied N (AEN) varied from 18 to 51 kg aboveground DM per kg N applied, with considerable year-to-year variation. Finally, the N content of harvested biomass always remained below the threshold of 0.6 % N, which is considered the guide value for high-quality biomass feedstock for combustion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArundo donax 3aMediterranean climate 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acattle manure 3acombustion 3aenergy crops 3afeedstocks 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient use efficiency 3aItaly1 aCastelli, Fabio1 aMoschella, Anna1 aDiozzi, Michele1 aDi Candilo, Mario0 tBioEnergy research.g2015 Sept., v. 8, no. 3 p.1252-1262dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-015-9577-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245011000200300001800310500002000328506007600348520131400424592002801738506003701766650001901803650001901822650001601841650001201857650002501869650002501894650002401919650002301943650001501966650003401981650001002015650001402025650001302039651001102052700003102063700002102094700003202115700003202147700001902179773013302198856007302331852000902404655001202413IND60649979120221207114409.0190709e20150602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064997912DNAL7 a10.3390/nu70643182doi7 aPMC44887862pmcid7 a260430322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrari, Ariana10aFolate and Nutrients Involved in the 1-Carbon Cycle in the Pretreatment of Patients for Colorectal Cancer  ap. 4318-4335.  aJournal Article  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo assess the ingestion of folate and nutrients involved in the 1-carbon cycle in non-treated patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma in a reference center for oncology in southeastern Brazil. In total, 195 new cases with colorectal adenocarcinoma completed a clinical evaluation questionnaire and a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Blood samples from 161 patients were drawn for the assessment of serum folate. A moderate correlation was found between serum concentrations of folate, folate intake and the dietary folate equivalent (DFE) of synthetic supplements. Mulatto or black male patients with a primary educational level had a higher intake of dietary folate. Of patients obtaining folate from the diet alone or from dietary supplements, 11.00% and 0.10%, respectively, had intake below the recommended level. Of the patients using dietary supplements, 35% to 50% showed high levels of folic acid intake. There was a prevalence of inadequacy for vitamins B2, B6 and B12, ranging from 12.10% to 20.18%, while 13.76% to 22.55% of patients were likely to have adequate choline intake. The considerable percentage of patients with folate intake above the recommended levels deserves attention because of the harmful effects that this nutrient may have in the presence of established neoplastic lesions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenocarcinoma 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acholine 3aclinical examination 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adietary supplements 3aeducational status 3afolic acid 3afood frequency questionnaires 3amales 3anutrients 3apatients 3aBrazil1 ade Carvalho, Aline Martins1 aSteluti, Josiane1 aTeixeira, Juliana Cristina,1 aMarchioni, Dirce Maria Lobo1 aAguiar, Samuel0 tNutrients.g2015 June 02, v. 7, no. 6 p.4318-4335dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu70643183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245010400186300001800290520105900308592002801367650002601395650001801421650001101439650003001450650001101480650002201491650002401513650002501537650001501562650002701577650001401604650006001618650003801678650004101716650004901757650001101806650005501817650004901872650005501921700002701976700001802003700002002021700001802041700002402059773014402083852000902227856008202236655001202318IND4386314920221119234249.0200312e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438631492DNAL7 a171066802pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-006-0571-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVrancken, Kristof10apspA overexpression in Streptomyces lividans improves both Sec- and Tat-dependent protein secretion  ap. 1150-1157.  aStreptomyces is an interesting host for the secretory production of recombinant proteins because of its innate capacity to secrete proteins at high level in the culture medium. In this report, we evaluated the importance of the phage-shock protein A (PspA) homologue on the protein secretion yield in Streptomyces lividans. The PspA protein is supposed to play a role in the maintenance of the proton motive force (PMF). As the PMF is an energy source for both Sec- and Tat-dependent secretion, we evaluated the influence of the PspA protein on both pathways by modulating the pspA expression. Results indicated that pspA overexpression can improve the Tat-dependent protein secretion as illustrated for the Tat-dependent xylanase C and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The effect on Sec-dependent secretion was less pronounced and appeared to be protein dependent as evidenced by the increase in subtilisin inhibitor (Sti-1) secretion but the lack of increase in human tumour necrosis factor (hTNFα) secretion in a pspA-overexpressing strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces lividans 3aculture media 3aenergy 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahumans 3aprotein secretion 3aproton-motive force 3arecombinant proteins 3asubtilisin 3atumor necrosis factors 3axylanases 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEndo-1,4-beta Xylanasesxgenetics 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgenetics 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aHumans 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aStreptomyces lividansxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aDe Keersmaeker, Sophie1 aGeukens, Nick1 aLammertyn, Elke1 aAnné, Jozef,1 aVan Mellaert, Lieve0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2007 Jan., v. 73, no. 5 p.1150-1157dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-006-0571-73Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02876naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245012400177300001400301520157600315592002801891650001201919650001901931650001501950650000901965650001401974650001401988650001702002650002402019650003802043700003002081700003302111700002702144700002602171700003102197700002802228773009702256856008102353990002302434852000902457655001202466IND60099282420221123002319.0141105e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009928242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gca.2012.03.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimenez-Lopez, Concepcion10aSignatures in magnetites formed by (Ca,Mg,Fe)CO₃ thermal decomposition: Terrestrial and extraterrestrial implications  ap. 69-80.  aIt has never been demonstrated whether magnetite synthesized through the heat-dependent decomposition of carbonate precursors retains the chemical and structural features of the carbonates. In this study, synthetic (Ca,Mg,Fe)CO₃ was thermally decomposed by heating from 25 to 700°C under 1atm CO₂, and by in situ exposure under vacuum to the electron beam of a transmission electron microscope. In both cases, the decomposition of the carbonate was topotactic and resulted in porous pseudomorphs composed of oriented aggregates of magnetite nanocrystals. Both calcium and magnesium were incorporated into nanophase magnetite, forming (Ca,Mg)-magnetites and (Ca,Mg)-ferrites when these elements were present in the parent material, thus preserving the chemical signature of the precursor. These results show that magnetites synthesized in this way acquire a chemical and structural inheritance from their carbonate precursor that indicates how they were produced. These results are not only important in the determination of the origin of chemically-impure, oriented nanophase magnetite crystals in general, but they also provide important insights into the origin of the large, euhedral, chemically-pure, [111]-elongated magnetites found within Ca-, Mg- and Fe-rich carbonates of the Martian meteorite ALH84001. Based on our experimental results, the chemically-pure magnetites within ALH84001 cannot be genetically related to the Ca-, Mg- and Fe-rich carbonate matrix within which they are embedded, and an alternative explanation for their occurrence is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3aheat 3amagnesium 3amagnetite 3ananocrystals 3athermal degradation 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aRodriguez-Navarro, Carlos1 aRodriguez-Navarro, Alejandro1 aPerez-Gonzalez, Teresa1 aBazylinski, Dennis A.1 aLauer, Howard V., Jr.cJr.1 aRomanek, Christopher S.0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 June 15, v. 87 p.69-80dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.03.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245009400183300001600277520096500293592002801258650002601286650001701312650002501329650001401354650001001368650000901378650001901387650001101406650002101417650002801438650001501466650001601481653001901497653001701516653001701533653001601550653001501566700002401581700002101605700002201626700003001648773010001678856008701778852000901865655001201874IND60525970220221119201258.0190402e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052597022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGironés-Vilaplana, Amadeo10aQuality and microbial safety evaluation of new isotonic beverages upon thermal treatments  ap. 455-462.  aIn the present study, it was evaluated how two different thermal treatments (Mild and Severe) may affect the anthocyanin content, antioxidant capacity (ABTS+, DPPH, and FRAP), quality (CIELAB colour parameters), and microbiological safety of a new isotonic drink made of lemon and maqui berry over a commercial storage simulation using a shelf life of 56days at two preservation temperature (7°C and 37°C). Both heat treatments did not affect drastically the anthocyanins content and their percentage of retention. The antioxidant capacity, probably because of the short time, was also not affected. The CIELAB colour parameters were affected by the heat, although the isotonic drinks remained with attractive red colour during shelf life. From a microbiological point of view, the Mild heat treatment with storage at 7°C is the ideal for the preservation of microbial growth, being useful for keeping the quality and safety of beverages in commercial life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAristotelia chilensis 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3acolor 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3alemons 3amicrobial growth 3amicrobiological quality 3ashelf life 3atemperature 0aHeat treatment 0aMicrobiology 0aAnthocyanins 0aBioactivity 0aShelf life1 aHuertas, Juan-Pablo1 aMoreno, Diego A.1 aPeriago, Paula M.1 aGarcía-Viguera, Cristina0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 194 p.455-462dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245017500158300002000333520109000353592002801443650002501471650002201496650002401518650001601542650002201558650002001580650002401600650002001624650001701644650002101661650001101682650001301693650002101706700001601727700001801743700001901761773012501780856007401905852000901979655001201988IND60705051920221118085520.0200729e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070505192DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra03584j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jeongmoo12aA ratiometric fluorescence sensor based on enzymatically activatable micellization of TPE derivatives for quantitative detection of alkaline phosphatase activity in serum  ap. 26888-26894.  aA novel ratiometric fluorescence assay via enzymatically activatable micellization in aqueous solution was devised for quantitative detection of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. We demonstrated that the dephosphorylation of the water-soluble, phosphate-functionalized, fluorophore monomer P-TPE-TG, induced by an enzymatic reaction of ALP, leads to micelle formation in aqueous solution because its water-soluble functionality is reduced. The dephosphorylation-induced micellization of P-TPE-TG exhibited a ratiometric sensing response for various ALP concentrations (10–200 mU mL⁻¹) and provided a suitable sensing platform for naked eye detection with increased fluorescence quantum yield (Φ = 3.2%), even compared to a typical TPE-based sensor (Φ = 1.0%), where ALP can be sensed with a detection limit of 0.034 mU mL⁻¹. In addition, P-TPE-TG displayed excellent sensing performance at concentrations from 0 to 50 mU mL⁻¹ in diluted human serum (10%), which offers the capability to exploit ratiometric responses for bioactive substances under practical conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aaqueous solutions 3abioactive compounds 3ablood serum 3adephosphorylation 3adetection limit 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahumans 3amicelles 3awater solubility1 aKim, Seoyun1 aKim, Tae Hoon1 aLee, Seoung Ho0 tRSC advances.g2020 July 20, v. 10, no. 45 p.26888-26894dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra03584j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010800165300001600273500001500289520120400304592002801508650002501536650001901561650002101580650001001601650002201611650001201633650002401645650001501669650001401684650002501698650001501723650000901738650001501747650002201762650001301784650001101797653001801808700001601826700001701842700001401859700001701873773008801890856008101978852000902059655001202068IND60506242020221122003331.0160416e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6050624202DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-015-9695-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLou, Hongming10aPretreatment of Miscanthus by NaOH/Urea Solution at Room Temperature for Enhancing Enzymatic Hydrolysis  ap. 335-343.  a2019-12-06  aA novel pretreatment process using NaOH/Urea solution at room temperature was developed to overcome recalcitrance of lignocellulose for efficient bioconversion of miscanthus. The process consists of mechanical size reduction, pretreatment with NaOH/Urea solution, and filtration. The results indicated that the substrate enzymatic digestibility (SED) of miscanthus pretreated with 8 wt% NaOH and 12 wt% urea at 21 ᵒC for 30 min was up to 71.99 % at low enzyme loading of 5 filter paper units (FPU)/g glucan after 72 h hydrolysis. NaOH/Urea pretreatment efficiently removed lignin and hemicellulose. And their removal rates increased with the increase of pretreatment temperature, NaOH dosage and urea dosage. With the increase of NaOH dosage, the chemical composition removal rate decreased in the following order: lignin, xylan, araban, galactan. Meanwhile, NaOH/Urea pretreatment could open up the fiber structure, decrease cellulose crystallinity index, and prevent lignin droplets depositing on cellulose. The optimal condition for the NaOH/Urea pretreatment regarding this study was 6 wt% NaOH/12 wt% urea and 21 °C. Approximately 70 % glucose yield was achieved upon this condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3alignocellulose 3asodium hydroxide 3axylan 3acrystal structure 3aglucose 3aambient temperature 3aMiscanthus 3acellulose 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afiltration 3aurea 3ahydrolysis 3abiotransformation 3adroplets 3alignin 0ahemicellulose1 aHu, Qiaoyan1 aQiu, Xueqing1 aLi, Xiuli1 aLin, Xuliang0 tBioEnergy research.g2016 Mar., v. 9, no. 1 p.335-343dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-015-9695-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03822naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002000188245016500208300001100373506007600384520191300460592002802373596007502401596007902476596010902555506003702664650001902701650002702720650001502747650001702762650002702779650000902806650001702815650002502832650001202857650002802869650001802897700003602915700003202951700004002983700003103023700006803054773011503122856008203237852000903319655001203328IND60627617520221207055116.0210403e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062761752DNAL7 aPMC63378642pmcid7 a306548002pmid7 a10.1186/s12917-018-1743-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatilla, Elvira10aN-acetylcysteine addition after vitrification improves oocyte mitochondrial polarization status and the quality of embryos derived from vitrified murine oocytes  ap. 31.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Vitrification is the safest method to cryopreserve oocytes, however the process alters mitochondrial function resulting from increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our aim was to alleviate ROS stress in vitrified mice oocytes using N-acetylcysteine (NAC at 1 mM), to improve the oocyte’s developmental competence. RESULTS: Hence, four experimental groups were compared: fresh oocytes (F-C), vitrified oocytes (V-C), NAC addition prior to oocyte vitrification (V-NAC-Pre) and NAC addition after vitrification (V-NAC-Post). V-NAC-Pre and V-NAC-Post exhibited higher levels of mitochondrial polarization compared to vitrified oocytes (36.5 ± 3.1, 37.7 ± 1.3 and 27.2 ± 2.4 measured as the spatial coefficient of variation/oocyte respectively, mean ± SEM; p < 0.05). However, ROS production increased in vitrified oocytes added with NAC compared to the vitrified control (1124.7 ± 102.1 [V-NAC-Pre] and 1063.2 ± 82.1 [V-NAC-Post] vs. 794.6 ± 164.9 [V-C]; arbitrary fluorescence units/oocyte, mean ± SEM; p < 0.05). ATP significantly decreased in V-NAC-Pre compared to V-NAC-Post oocytes (18.5 ± 6.9 vs. 54.2 ± 4.6 fmol/oocyte respectively, mean ± SEM; p < 0.05), and no differences were observed between V-NAC-Post, F-C and V-C groups. Blastocyst rates derived from F-C oocytes was higher than those derived from V-NAC-Pre (90.7 ± 1.8 vs. 79.1 ± 1.8, respectively, mean % ± SEM,; p < 0.05) but similar to those derived from V-NAC-Post (90.7 ± 1.8, mean % ± SEM, p > 0.05). Total blastomere count of blastocysts derived from V-NAC-Post after in vitro fertilization (IVF) was higher than embryos produced from V-C. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of NAC after vitrification improves the quality of vitrified mature murine oocytes while its addition prior to vitrification is advised against.  aPublisher supplied data  aIB16159cConsejería de Educación y Empleo, Junta de Extremadura (ES)  aAGL2015-73249-JIN (AEI/FEDER/UE)cMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aAGL2017-84681-R (AEI/FEDER/UE)cMinisterio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetylcysteine 3aadenosine triphosphate 3ablastocyst 3afluorescence 3ain vitro fertilization 3amice 3amitochondria 3aoocyte vitrification 3aoocytes 3areactive oxygen species 3avitrification1 aMartín-Cano, Francisco Eduardo1 aGonzález-Fernández, Lauro1 aSánchez-Margallo, Francisco Miguel1 aÁlvarez, Ignacio Santiago1 aMacías-García, Beatriz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5331-97930 tBMC veterinary research.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.31-31dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1743-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010000171300001600271500001500287520149000302592002801792650001701820650001101837650001001848650000801858650002201866650001401888650001101902650001501913650001701928650001701945650001501962650002501977650001102002650001202013651001002025653001602035700002602051700002202077700002102099773010702120856008102227852000902308655001202317IND50071554820221119163445.0150211e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007155482DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-013-0867-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmico, Guillermo C.10aGenetic diversity and population structure of the mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus (Loranthaceae)  ap. 153-162.  a2019-12-06  aThe genetic structure of a plant species is influenced by life-history traits, geographical range and ecological interactions that shape gene flow. We examined the genetic structure of the South American mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus using random amplification of polymorphic DNA. This species is found mainly in Chile and inhabits two biomes, the Chilean matorral and the temperate forest. The main pollinator agent, a hummingbird, is the same across the whole range, but the disperser assemblage varies between biomes. We selected 22 populations, eight of which were located in the Chilean matorral, where fruits are yellow and birds act as seed dispersers, and 14 populations in the temperate forest, where fruits are green and a marsupial disperses the mistletoe seeds. A total of ten primers were used to generate amplification products for 121 individuals (ca. six individuals per population) and 91 bands were scored. Results show that this mistletoe species is highly variable with 81 % of the bands polymorphic and a Shannon’s diversity index among populations of 0.634. The temperate forest shows slightly higher diversity indices than the Chilean matorral. The central region of the mistletoe geographic range was more variable than the north and the south regions, suggesting that it is a genetically mixed zone. It is likely that gene flow occurs mainly via hummingbirds moving pollen between biomes and birds moving seeds from north to south during spring migrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3alife history 3afruits 3aseeds 3aDNA 3agenetic variation 3agene flow 3aspring 3aMetatheria 3aLoranthaceae 3ahummingbirds 3aecosystems 3apopulation structure 3apollen 3aforests 3aChile 0aMarsupialia1 aVidal-Russell, Romina1 aAizen, Marcelo A.1 aNickrent, Daniel0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2014 Jan., v. 300, no. 1 p.153-162dSpringer-Verlagx0378-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-013-0867-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01692naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007600168300001600244520070300260592002800963650002400991650001601015650001101031653001501042653001701057653001501074653002101089700001801110700001901128773012901147856008101276852000901357655001201366IND60652513720221119172200.0190713e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065251372DNAL7 a10.1017/S20404700170010782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaiful Azimi, M.10aVirtual Reality based Mobile Robot Navigation in Greenhouse Environment  ap. 854-859.  aThe difficulties of transporting heavy mobile robots limit robotic experiments in agriculture.

We tested the hypothesis that the low R : FR ratio would trigger characteristic shade avoidance responses in soybean and that the subsequent phenotype would experience reproductive costs under non––resource-limiting conditions. Soybeans were grown in a fertigation system in field trials conducted in 2007 and 2008 under two light quality treatments: (1) high R : FR ratio (i.e., weed-free) i.e., upward reflected light from a baked clay medium (Turface MVP®®), or (2) low R : FR ratio (i.e., weedy) of upward reflected light, from commercial turfgrass. Results of this study indicated that a reduction in the R : FR ratio of light reflected from the surface of turfgrass increased soybean internode elongation, reduced branching, and decreased yield per plant. Shade avoidance also increased the plant-to-plant variability in biomass and yield per plant. Per plant yield losses were, however, more closely associated with reductions in biomass accumulation than population variability as the expression of a shade avoidance response did not influence harvest index. While these results suggest that weed induced shade avoidance decreases soybean per plant yield by reducing branching, it is possible the productivity of a soybean stand as a whole may be buffered against these reduction by a similar, but opposite, expression of plasticity in branching.Nomenclature: Soybean, Glycine max (L.)

These revisited floras are bound to pre-volcanic siliciclastic facies of the Siebengebirge Mts., interpreted as marginal facies of the Köln Formation. Chronostratigraphically they are assigned to the late Oligocene (Chattian). The described leaf remains are partially compressions with preserved epidermal anatomy, and therefore highly useful for systematic determination of leaf impressions recovered from other localities of siliciclastic facies. On account of the epidermal characteristics of leaf compressions varying in gross morphology, the previously determined taxa Quercus goepperti, Laurus phoeboides, and Persea speciosa all fall into the abundantly represented Eotrigonobalanus furcinervis. The siliciclastic deposits originated in coastal and flood plain areas within fluviatile environments of variable deposition energy. Remains of Taxodium dubium, Eotrigonobalanus furcinervis, Populus germanica, and Daphnogene cinnamomifolia dominate among the recovered fossils. The general aspects of this plant assemblage correspond, together with their sedimentary settings, to riparian forest vegetation with mesophytic elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaurus 3aPersea 3aPopulus 3aQuercus 3aTaxodium 3abasins 3aenergy 3afloodplains 3afossils 3aleaves 3ariparian forests 3aGermany 0amacroflora 0aLower Rhine Embayment 0alate Oligocene 0aKöln Formation1 aKvaček, Zlatko,0 tActa palaeobotanica .g2016 June 22, v. 56, no. 1 p.41-64dDe Gruyter Openx2082-02597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/acpa-2016-00053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002200191245010800213300001800321500001900339506007600358520158900434536016002023592002802183506003702211650002702248650002602275650001302301650001802314650001502332650001402347650002302361650002102384650001502405650001602420650001502436650001202451653002302463700001802486700002502504773013602529856008402665852000902749655001202758IND60692899620221207132114.0200503e20141102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069289962DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2014.9699482doi7 aPMC44340562pmcid7 a260195942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimitrov, Zhechko10aIn vitro characterization of the adhesive factors of selected probiotics to Caco-2 epithelium cell line  ap. 1079-1083.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of the present study was to analyse the type of adhesive factors of selected probiotic strains. A large number of lactic acid bacteria with intestinal and dairy origin were collected and assessed for adhesion on Caco-2 cell line. From the best adherent bacteria, four strains were selected for further research: Lactobacillus gasseri G7, L. plantarum F1, L. helveticus AC and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus B14. The average number of adhered bacteria was 17 per one Caco-2 cell in the case of L. gasseri G7 and 21 per cell in the case of L. plantarum F1. Treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), trypsin and metaperiodic acid in separate assays revealed that cell-bonded extracellular proteins were responsible for the adhesion of the selected L. gasseri, L. plantarum and L. helveticus strains, in contrast to the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain, whose adhesive factors were identified as cell-bonded exopolysaccharides. The cell-wall proteins from the first three strains were isolated, fractionated and assessed for adhesion to Caco-2 cells. Based on the attachment properties of the purified proteins towards Caco-2 cells, it was clearly proved exactly which proteins are involved in the adherence. L. plantarum F1 strain contains two adhesive proteins in contrast to the other selected strains containing one adhesive protein each. The determination of the factors mediating the adhesive abilities of the selected strains provides important information about the possible ways to preserve and increase adhesive properties towards epithelium cells.  aThis work was supported by Operational Programme ‘Development of competiveness of Bulgarian economy 2007–2013’ [grant number BG161PO003-1.1.06-0030].  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aLactobacillus gasseri 3aadhesion 3abiotechnology 3aepithelium 3aequipment 3aexopolysaccharides 3ahuman cell lines 3aintestines 3alactic acid 3aprobiotics 3atrypsin 0acell-wall proteins1 aGotova, Irina1 aChorbadjiyska, Elena0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2014 Nov. 2, v. 28, no. 6 p.1079-1083dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2014.9699483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245011500205300001800320506007600338520172400414592002802138506003702166650000802203650001502211650002002226650001502246650001902261650001202280650002102292650002602313650002102339650001902360650002802379650001302407650001702420650001502437650002202452700001702474700001702491700001702508700001602525700001302541700001802554773011602572856008102688852000902769655001202778IND60580396420221207141419.0170916e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058039642DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2750-12doi7 aPMC56029772pmcid7 a289747992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Honghong10aTargeting the middle region of CP4-EPSPS protein for its traceability in highly processed soy-related products  ap. 3142-3151.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTransgenic components in genetically modified organisms consist not only of the transgenic genes, but also the transgenic protein. However, compared with transgenic DNA, less attention has been paid to the detection of expressed protein, especially those degraded from genetically modified soybean after food processing. In this study, the full length 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (CP4-EPSPS, 47.6 kD) protein was probed with the SC-16 (S19–R33) and the DC-16 (D219–K233) polyclonal antibodies in immunoblots. Both antibodies were able to detect the full length CP4-EPSPS and its residues in soy powder made from Roundup-Ready soybeans after heating and microwaving treatments which also reduced the molecular weight of the protein to 45.8 and 38.7 kD, respectively. Taken together the immunoblot results suggest that the middle region of the CP4-EPSPS protein possessed better stability than its N-terminal during thermal processing. This deduction was further validated by autoclave treatment, where a 37.4 kD residue of the protein was recognized by DC-16. A similar result was obtained in processed smoked sausage containing Roundup Ready soybean protein isolate (as an extender). The additional use of a further polyclonal antibody CK-17 (C372–K388), showed that compared with only the one signal for CP4-EPSPS detected by the SC-16 and CK-17 antibodies, the DC-16 middle region antibody detected four signals for CP4-EPSPS from five market sourced soy protein concentrates. Taken together, the study suggested that the middle region of CP4-EPSPS was more useful than the N- and C-terminal for tracing transgenic CP4-EPSPS protein and its remnants in highly processed soy-related products.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aautoclaves 3afood processing 3aglyphosate 3aheat treatment 3amarkets 3amolecular weight 3apolyclonal antibodies 3aprotein isolates 3asmoked sausage 3asoy protein concentrate 3asoybeans 3atraceability 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants1 aWang, Xiaofu1 aZhou, Xinghu1 aZhang, Yihua1 aHuang, Ming1 aHe, Jian1 aShen, Wenbiao0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2017 Sept., v. 54, no. 10 p.3142-3151dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-017-2750-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009300169500002200262520094200284592002801226650001601254650001401270650002001284650001801304650001801322650002801340650001101368650001501379653003601394653001701430653002501447653002801472653001701500700002101517700001901538700005901557773009201616856008701708852000901795655001201804IND60646660820221122045505.0190613e20190606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064666082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1134412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosain, M.L.10aSmoothed Particle Hydrodynamics modeling of industrial processes involving heat transfer  aPre-press version  aSmoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a mesh-free particle method that has been widely used over the past decade to model complex flows. The method has mainly been used to investigate problems related to hydrodynamics and maritime engineering, in which heat transfer does not play a key role. In this article, the heat-conduction equation is implemented in the open-source code DualSPHysics, based on the SPH technique, and applied to different study cases, including conduction in still water in a cavity, laminar water flow between two infinite parallel plates and tube bank heat exchanger. The thermal solutions obtained from SPH are benchmarked with the solutions from Finite Volume Method (FVM) and validated using available analytical solutions. DualSPHysics results are in good agreement with FVM and analytical models, and demonstrate the potential of the meshless approach for industrial applications involving heat transfer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3aequations 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3ahydrodynamics 3aindustrial applications 3amodels 3awater flow 0aSmoothed Particle Hydrodynamics 0aDualSPHysics 0aFinite Volume Method 0atransient heat transfer 0aCFD analysis1 aDomínguez, J.M.1 aBel Fdhila, R.1 aKyprianidis, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8466-356X0 tApplied energy.g2019 June 06,  p.113441-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1134413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011100170300001200281520114400293592002801437596008901465596008901554650001901643650001901662650001201681650001201693650002101705650001201726650002301738650001601761650000901777651002301786653001901809653001201828653002201840653002101862653001601883700002601899700002201925700002501947773012601972856008502098852000902183655001202192IND60595344820221116225647.0180602e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059534482DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2017.13489462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatoka, Jiří10aWhich Wild Aardvarks Are Most Suitable for Outdoor Enclosures in Zoological Gardens in the European Union?  ap. 1-7.  aThe aardvark is popular in many zoological gardens in the European Union. These creatures are nocturnal, and aardvarks in the wild are known to walk distances of 4 km to 7 km per night. Despite what is known about their biology, most aardvarks are kept in zoological gardens in indoor enclosures with little space for movement. This lack of space leads to a tendency toward obesity and compromised welfare. With their wide distribution in Sub-Saharan Africa, aardvarks are perceived as thermophilic nonhuman animals. Nevertheless, some records suggest they may be able to adapt to colder climates and can be active outside their burrows when temperatures fall to 2°C. These findings suggest there may be a wild African population that is suitable for partial outdoor keeping under European climatic conditions. Therefore, a climate match was computed between the source area with aardvark occurrence and a target area of the European Union. Data revealed that the Free State, a South African province, was the area with the best climate similarity, and aardvarks from this area are recommended as suitable for the aforementioned purpose.  aPublisher supplied data  aCIGA 20152007cInternal grant agency of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague  aCIGA 20152004cInternal grant agency of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague 3aEuropean Union 3aanimal welfare 3aanimals 3aburrows 3aclimatic factors 3aobesity 3aoutdoor enclosures 3atemperature 3azoos 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aAnimal welfare 0aclimate 0amovement activity 0aOrycteropus afer 0atemperature1 aVejtrubová, Markéta1 aVrabec, Vladimír1 aMasopustová, Renata0 tJournal of applied animal welfare science.g2018 Jan. 2, v. 21, no. 1 p.1-7dRoutledgewJournal:jnl56472x1532-76047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2017.13489463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03438naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245006600166500001900232520231500251592002802566650002402594650001602618650002302634650001502657650002402672650001702696650001902713653002302732653002002755653002202775653002602797653001502823700002602838773010302864856008802967852000903055655001203064IND60725830120221119060833.0210305e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072583012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.1035192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jie10aApplication of percolation theory to microtomography of rocks  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPercolation Theory has made significant breakthroughs in the understanding of physical processes through identification of an infinite connected cluster. It allows the definition of critical material parameters such as percolation threshold, critical exponents, crossover length and fractal dimension and has evolved from a purely mathematical approach to an applied field of study. In geosciences, the most popular application of percolation theory is the analysis of fluid flow in porous media. The capability to image the 3D structure of such porous networks through Computed Tomography (CT) opens new avenues for the concise application of percolation theory. Here we summarize digital rock techniques developed to derive rock properties and the critical percolation parameter from CT-scans and compare the results to the mathematical ideal structures and laboratory experiments. We demonstrate that a near ideal synthetic rock, which has been designed to reproduce a homogenous sample for geophysical experiments, portrays significantly different percolation properties to their mathematical counterparts. Furthermore, we present a variety of rock specimens with different microstructures and report stronger departures to the mathematical ideal structures. The generation of derivative models of the digital rock and their percolation analysis allows the identification of the percolation threshold, crossover length and critical exponent of correlation length. The technique is demonstrated in application for upscaling permeability, elastic moduli and yield stress. Three independent techniques for the identification of a Representative Volume Element (RVE) are presented: stochastic analysis, thermodynamic averaging and crossover length. A worked example for a dynamic environment is presented in a transect across a deformation zone, where several RVE subsamples are analyzed in terms of their percolation properties. A clear trend from a 2-D dominated to a 3-D network in the deformation center allowed unprecedented insights into the microphysical dynamic processes that established the percolation network. Examples for the newly emerging trend of time-lapse imaging (so-called 4-D tomography) are also discussed. The provided techniques and concepts thus open a new era in digital rock physics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputed tomography 3adeformation 3afractal dimensions 3ageophysics 3amathematical theory 3apermeability 3athermodynamics 0aPercolation theory 0aMicrotomography 0aCritical exponent 0aPercolation threshold 0aUp-scaling1 aRegenauer-Lieb, Klaus0 tEarth-science reviews.g2021 Mar., v. 214 p.103519-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.1035193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03946naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245012000207300001100327506007600338520208900414592002802503506003702531650001502568650001102583650002502594650001702619650001602636650001102652650002002663650001702683650002802700650001302728650000902741650001102750650001402761650001202775650001302787650001102800650001102811650001102822650001002833650002102843650001602864650001902880650001702899650001002916650001502926651001202941700002502953700001902978700002402997700001903021700002203040700002103062700002103083773009003104856008103194852000903275655001203284IND60123995820221207115051.0150808e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012399582DNAL7 a10.1186/s12937-015-0018-z2doi7 aPMC43968342pmcid7 a258901552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWruss, Jürgen10aDifferences in pharmacokinetics of apple polyphenols after standardized oral consumption of unprocessed apple juice  ap. 18.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Polyphenols are chemical compounds of the secondary plant metabolism. High concentrations can be found in various fruits including apples, berries and grapes. Polyphenols are associated with numerous health beneficial effects including a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease or diabetes. The human body cannot synthesize or store polyphenols and relies on continuous replenishment by daily diet. Unfortunately, knowledge on absorption, metabolization and excretion is still limited. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic fate of apple polyphenols in young healthy adults. METHODS: Volunteers consumed 500 mL of an unfiltered apple juice. Blood and urine samples were collected within a time period of ten hours and analyzed for their total phenolic content, concentration of selected individual polyphenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity. RESULTS: Large differences in apple polyphenol pharmacokinetics between single subjects were observed. Those could be divided into subgroups according to fast or slow rates of polyphenol metabolism. Some subjects showed no detectable metabolism within the study time frame at all. An increase in the total phenolic content over time did not correlate with an observed, highly elevated antioxidant capacity (AOC) in the blood plasma after apple juice consumption. The determined increase of the AOC was rather a result of a high fructose content of the apple juice. No differences in renal excretion were detected between female and male subjects. However, relative concentrations were slightly higher in male subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Apple derived polyphenols can be readily detected in human blood and urine after juice consumption. The existence of sub-populations with different pharmacokinetics suggests significant variations in the individual metabolism rates of polyphenolic substances with implications on bioavailability and potential health effects within the body.

We investigated the spatio-temporal characteristics and health risks of the ambient VOCs emitted in a typical e-waste dismantling region by conducting multi-site sampling campaigns in four seasons. The pollution of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) in the e-waste dismantling park has relation to e-waste dismantling by seasonal trend analysis. The highest concentrations of most VOCs occurred in winter and autumn, while the lowest levels were observed in summer and spring. The spatial distribution map revealed the e-waste dismantling park to be a hotspot of BTEX, 1,2-dichloropropane (1,2-DCP), and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), while two major residential areas were also the hotspots of BTEX. The e-waste emission source contributed 20.14% to the total VOCs in the e-waste dismantling park, while it was absent in the major residential and rural areas. The cancer risk assessment showed that six VOCs exceeded 1.0 × 10⁻⁶ in the e-waste dismantling park, while only three or four compounds exceeded this risk in other areas. The noncancer risks of all compounds were below the safety threshold. This study supplements the existing knowledge on VOC pollution from e-waste dismantling and expands the research scope of chemical pollution caused by e-waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,2-dichloropropane 3aautumn 3abenzene 3aelectronic wastes 3aethylbenzene 3aethylene dichloride 3ahuman health 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aspring 3asummer 3atoluene 3avolatile organic compounds 3awinter 0aVolatile organic compounds 0aE-waste dismantling region 0aSeasonal variation 0aSpatial distribution 0aSource apportionment 0aHealth risk1 aLiu, Ranran1 aLin, Qinhao1 aMa, Shengtao1 aLi, Guiying1 aYu, Yingxin1 aZhang, Chaosheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7913-48581 aAn, Taicheng0 tChemosphere.g2021 July, v. 275 p.130022-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1300223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02164naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009900161300001800260520092800278592002801206650000801234650002901242650002701271650001301298650001001311650001901321650001501340650001701355650000701372650001701379650001301396650001801409650001601427700002001443700001401463700001201477700005101489773011001540856008301650852000901733655001201742IND60638157720221120152609.0190816e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063815772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02378-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTu, Chao12aA pH indicating carboxymethyl cellulose/chitosan sponge for visual monitoring of wound healing  ap. 4541-4552.  aA type of carboxymethyl cellulose/chitosan composite sponge that is able to indicate pH changes was prepared and characterized. This sponge, dyed with the natural dye cyanine, showed a rather rapid response by changing from blue to green as the solution pH changed from 4 to 8. This visible color change indicated that the sponge could be a pH sensor with high sensitivity. The carboxymethyl cellulose/chitosan composite sponges exhibited a good air permeability and high porosity because the sponge’s pores were all open and interconnected. The porosity, the moisture vapor transmission rate, and the water vapor permeability all increased as the chitosan content increased. The chitosan microparticles added in carboxymethyl cellulose reinforced the composite sponge and improved its antibacterial activity. The cyanine dyed carboxymethyl cellulose/chitosan sponges have substantial potential as wound-healing monitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aantibacterial properties 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3achitosan 3acolor 3amicroparticles 3amonitoring 3anatural dyes 3apH 3apermeability 3aporosity 3atissue repair 3awater vapor1 aZhang, Run-dong1 aYan, Chao1 aGuo, Yi1 aCui, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3648-39270 tCellulose.g2019 May, v. 26, no. 7 p.4541-4552dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02378-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01736naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245004600160300002000206520080000226592002801026650002401054650002601078650001101104650001501115650001401130650002301144650001901167700001601186773012901202856008201331852000901413655001201422IND60565983820221121230603.0170330e20151203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056598382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b082072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jun10aElectronic States of Lead-Salt Nanosheets  ap. 26809-26816.  aThe electronic states of lead-salt nanosheets are calculated with an effective mass model. In recognition of the anisotropic shape of the structure, the electron wave functions are separated into two parts. Motion along the narrow dimension is dominated by the quantum confinement, while the lateral motion is dominated by the Coulomb interaction. Strong contrast of the dielectric constant of the host environment further strengthens the Coulomb interaction. The calculated exciton binding energy for lead-salt nanosheets is smaller than that of nanowires of similar size but still larger than the thermal energy at room temperature, so it should be possible to observe excitons at room temperature. The calculation results are compared with existing data, and show good quantitative agreement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3adielectric properties 3amodels 3ananosheets 3ananowires 3aphysical chemistry 3athermal energy1 aWise, F.

Each mouse was infected with 50 embryonated eggs of T. muris by oral gavage. Acute colitis was triggered by administering 4% dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) in the drinking water for nine consecutive days at different times after infection. Concurrent infection and DSS administration exacerbate the severity of the colitis while favouring the permanence of parasites in the intestine. The induction of ulcerative colitis from days 54 to 62 post-infection (p.i.), when all worms had been expelled, ameliorated the course of the inflammatory disease. When ulcerative colitis was triggered earlier on, from days 27 to 35 p.i., the beneficial effects on inflammatory events were clearly shown with signs of mucosal epithelization and regeneration as early as day 1 after DSS administration. Previous infections by T. muris therefore accelerate recovery from subsequently induced inflammatory bowel disease and such an effect assists the nematode to persist in the intestinal niche.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichuris muris 3acolitis 3adextran 3adrinking water 3aeggs 3aintestines 3amice 3amixed infection 3aparasites1 aRollán-Landeras, E.1 aGarcía-Rodríguez, J.J.1 aBolás-Fernández, F.0 tJournal of helminthology.g2015 Sept., v. 89, no. 5 p.593-600dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X140005583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011600160300001800276520129200294592002801586650001301614650001301627650001301640650001201653650002201665650001401687650001301701650001301714650001301727650002001740650001001760650001201770650003101782650001801813650001801831650000701849650001401856650001901870650001801889650001201907650001101919700001201930700001401942700001901956700001701975700002401992773010402016856008102120852000902201655001202210IND60439362120221121053600.0151024e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043936212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-015-1894-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYong, P.10aOne step bioconversion of waste precious metals into Serratia biofilm-immobilized catalyst for Cr(VI) reduction  ap. 2181-2191.  aOBJECTIVES: For reduction of Cr(VI) the Pd-catalyst is excellent but costly. The objectives were to prove the robustness of a Serratia biofilm as a support for biogenic Pd-nanoparticles and to fabricate effective catalyst from precious metal waste. RESULTS: Nanoparticles (NPs) of palladium were immobilized on polyurethane reticulated foam and polypropylene supports via adhesive biofilm of a Serratia sp. The biofilm adhesion and cohesion strength were unaffected by palladization and catalytic biofilm integrity was also shown by magnetic resonance imaging. Biofilm-Pd and mixed precious metals on biofilm (biofilm-PM) reduced 5 mM Cr(VI) to Cr(III) when immobilized in a flow-through column reactor, at respective flow rates of 9 and 6 ml/h. The lower activity of the latter was attributed to fewer, larger, metal deposits on the bacteria. Activity was lost in each case at pH 7 but was restored by washing with 5 mM citrate solution or by exposure of columns to solution at pH 2, suggesting fouling by Cr(III) hydroxide product at neutral pH. CONCLUSION: A ‘one pot’ conversion of precious metal waste into new catalyst for waste decontamination was shown in a continuous flow system based on the use of Serratia biofilm to manufacture and support catalytic Pd-nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSerratia 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abiotransformation 3acatalysts 3achromium 3acitrates 3acohesion 3adecontamination 3afoams 3afouling 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amanufacturing 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apalladium 3apolypropylenes 3apolyurethanes 3awashing 3awastes1 aLiu, W.1 aZhang, Z.1 aBeauregard, D.1 aJohns, M.

In the present study, 5370 proteins of Plasmodium falciparum genome were screened for the presence of signal peptide/anchor and GPI anchor motifs. Out of 45 screened surface-associated proteins, 22 were consensually predicted as antigens and had no orthologs in human and mouse except circumsporozoite protein (PF3D7_0304600). Among 22 proteins, 19 were identified as new antigens. In the next step, a total of 4944 peptides were predicted as CD8+ T cell epitopes from 22 probable antigens. Of these, the highest scoring 262 epitopes from each antigen were taken for optimization study in the malaria-endemic regions which covered a broad human population (~93.95%). The predicted epitope 13ILFYFFLWV21 of antigen 6-cysteine (PF3D7_1346800) was binding to the HLA-A*0201 allele with the highest fraction (26%) of immunogenicity in the target populations of North-East Asia, South-East Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, these epitopes are proposed to be favored in vaccine designs against malaria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aalleles 3abioinformatics 3aclinical trials 3aepitopes 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3amalaria 3amice 3apeptides 3aproteins 3asignal peptide 3avaccines 3aSouth East Asia 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aSrivastava, Deeksha1 aMishra, BhartenduNath0 t3 Biotech.g2017 Oct., v. 7, no. 5 p.318-318dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-0947-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006400168300001800232520099900250592002801249650002201277650002401299650001501323650001401338650002201352650002801374650002501402650001801427650001901445650001801464650001101482700002201493700001801515700002101533700001901554700002101573773011001594856008301704852000901787655001201796IND60638157920221120122848.0190816e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063815792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02390-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKluge, Stefanie10aEnzymatic production of cello-oligomers with endoglucanases  ap. 4279-4290.  aCello-oligomers have a wide application range and are gained from three different cello-oligomer production paths, which show different drawbacks, namely acid or alkaline hydrolysis of cellulose, chemical or enzymatic synthesis, and enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose using cellulase mixtures. Therefore, this study aims at a novel route towards cello-oligomers using purified endoglucanases. From the renewable raw material cellulose, pretreated by an ionic liquid, cello-oligomers with a weight average degree of polymerization (DPW) of 65 were directly obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis. During hydrolysis, between 14.1 and 24.5 mass percent of monomeric and dimeric sugars were formed as byproduct. A second ionic liquid pretreatment of the cellulose, remaining after the first hydrolysis, and a second enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in cello-oligomers with a DP of 35. XRD deconvolution and Raman analysis confirmed that crystallinity remained unchanged during enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3abyproducts 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aionic liquids 3apolymerization 3araw materials 3asugars1 aBonhage, Benjamin1 aViell, Jörn,1 aGranström, Mari1 aKindler, Alois1 aSpiess, Antje C.0 tCellulose.g2019 May, v. 26, no. 7 p.4279-4290dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02390-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245016500188300001600353520182400369592002802193650002502221650002302246650001802269650001402287650002402301650000902325650001002334650001002344650001302354650002002367650001302387650001102400650001402411650001802425700002602443700002702469700002602496773012602522856008202648852000902730655001202739IND60516751820221120085725.0190727e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051675182DNAL7 a252263952pmid7 a10.1017/S0022149X140006742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan-Pérez, J.I.10aReduction of benzimidazole resistance in established Haemonchus contortus populations in goats using a single infection with a benzimidazole-susceptible isolate  ap. 641-645.  aAn in vivo study in goats evaluated the effect of superimposing a single artificial infection with a benzimidazole (BZ)-susceptible Haemonchus contortus isolate upon established H. contortus populations of known BZ resistance by measuring the phenotypic BZ resistance of eggs collected from faeces before and after re-infection. Two H. contortus isolates, one benzimidazole resistant (BZR) and the other susceptible (BZS), were used to infect worm-free goats. Eight goats were initially infected with 2000 third-stage larvae (L3). In each case the inoculum contained a pre-determined proportion of the two isolates: 100% BZS (one goat), 75% BZS/25% BZR (two goats), 50% BZS/50% BZR (two goats), 25%BZS/75% BZR (two goats) and, finally, 100% BZR (one goat). The phenotypic BZ susceptibility of the H. contortus population formed in each goat after the first infection was determined on days 30 and 36 post-infection using an egg-hatch assay (EHA) that estimated the concentration of thiabendazole (TBZ) required for 95% inhibition of larval hatching (EC₉₅) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). On day 49 post-infection, goats were re-infected with 2000 L3 of the BZS isolate alone. A second set of EHA bioassays was performed 28 days and 34 days after re-infection. The first infection protocol produced three populations classified as BZS (EC₉₅ 0.055–0.065 μg TBZ/ml) while four were categorized as BZR (EC₉₅ 0.122–0.344 μg TBZ/ml). The status of one other population could not be determined. After re-infection with BZS L3, the number of susceptible populations increased to six (EC₉₅ 0.043–0.074 μg TBZ/ml) while the remaining two were deemed resistant (EC₉₅ 0.114–119 μg TBZ/ml). Re-infection with BZS L3 thereby reduced the resistance status of most H. contortus populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aat-risk population 3abenzimidazole 3abioassays 3aconfidence interval 3aeggs 3afeces 3agoats 3ahatching 3ain vivo studies 3ainoculum 3alarvae 3aphenotype 3athiabendazole1 aTorres-Acosta, J.F.J.1 aRodríguez-Vivas, R.I.1 aVillegas-Pérez, S.L.0 tJournal of helminthology.g2015 Sept., v. 89, no. 5 p.641-645dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X140006743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008900165300001800254520108900272592002801361650001501389650001501404650001301419650001901432650004801451650001801499700001701517700001601534700002501550773010401575856008101679852000901760655001201769IND60439362320221121053604.0151024e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043936232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-015-1911-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolska, Julia14aThe addition of transglutaminase improves the physical quality of extruded fish feed  ap. 2265-2270.  aOBJECTIVES: The possibility of improving the physical quality of extruded fish feed using transglutaminase (TGase) treatment at different stages of the production process was investigated. RESULTS: The addition of TGase to the raw material mix and processing under high and medium moisture conditions significantly increased (p > 0.05) the durability, hardness and elasticity of fish feed pellets. However, the water stability of feeds was only improved when the TGase was applied in the vacuum coater; when it was mixed with the dry raw materials, the water stability of the product decreased. By further optimization of the enzyme dose when added to the vacuum coater, an increase in pellet durability was observed at enzyme dosages between 2.5 and 5 g kg⁻¹. Application of TGase in the coating step allowed an 87.5 % decrease in the dose of enzyme in feed produced under high moisture conditions. CONCLUSIONS: TGase treatment improves the physical quality of extruded fish feed, and the importance of optimization of enzyme dosage and processing conditions was demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3adurability 3afish feeds 3ahardness 3apelleted feeds 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3araw materials1 aJonkers, Jan1 aHolst, Olle1 aAdlercreutz, Patrick0 tBiotechnology letters.g2015 Nov., v. 37, no. 11 p.2265-2270dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-015-1911-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245013300181300001800314520123500332592002801567650002201595650001801617650001201635650001301647650001701660650001401677650001001691650000901701650001501710650001401725650002501739650001701764650001001781650001201791650001101803650004601814650010401860650004601964650004602010650000902056650007802065650006102143650002002204650002902224651001002253651001002263700001402273700001502287700001902302700001602321700001702337773009902354856004802453852000902501655001202510IND50068824220221116181516.0130828e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006882422DNAL7 a235919722pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-013-1685-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yan10aGenetic characterization of H1N2 swine influenza virus isolated in China and its pathogenesis and inflammatory responses in mice  ap. 1965-1972.  aIn 2009, two H1N2 influenza viruses were isolated from trachea swabs of pigs in Hubei in China. We compared these sequences with the other 18 complete genome sequences of swine H1N2 isolates from China during 2004 to 2010 and undertook extensive analysis of their evolutionary patterns. Six different genotypes – two reassortants between triple reassortant (TR) H3N2 and classical swine (CS) H1N1 virus, three reassortants between TR H1N2, Eurasian avian-like H1N1 swine virus and H9N2 swine virus, and one reassortant between H1N1, H3N2 human virus and CS H1N1 virus – were observed in these 20 swine H1N2 isolates. The TR H1N2 swine virus is the predominant genotype, and the two Hubei H1N2 isolates were located in this cluster. We also used a mouse model to examine the pathogenesis and inflammatory responses of the two isolates. The isolates replicated efficiently in the lung, and exhibited a strong inflammatory response, serious pathological changes and mortality in infected mice. Given the role that swine can play as putative “genetic mixing vessels” and the observed transmission of TR H1N2 in ferrets, H1N2 influenza surveillance in pigs should be increased to minimize the potential threat to public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aanimal models 3aferrets 3agenotype 3ainflammation 3ainfluenza 3alungs 3amice 3amonitoring 3amortality 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogenesis 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aHumans 2aInfluenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtypexgenetics 2aInfluenza A Virus, H1N2 Subtypexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aInfluenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtypexgenetics 2aInfluenza A Virus, H9N2 Subtypexgenetics 2aMice 2aOrthomyxoviridae Infectionsximmunologyxmortalityxveterinaryxvirology. 2aReassortant Virusesxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSwinexvirology 2aSwine Diseasesxvirology 3aChina 0aChina1 aWang, Nan1 aCao, Jiyue1 aChen, Huanchun1 aJin, Meilin1 aZhou, Hongbo0 tArchives of virology.g2013 Sept., v. 158, no. 9 p.1965-1972dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-013-1685-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245008000209300001600289520111500305592002801420650001901448650001501467650001801482650002301500651001701523651001801540700005801558700005701616700002201673700005701695700005401752700005701806700001901863700001901882700006101901700005701962773010102019856008302120852000902203655001202212IND60755990020221119133655.0220301e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075599002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10745-021-00269-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKassam, Karim-Aly1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4495-857410aEngaging Transformation: Using Seasonal Rounds to Anticipate Climate Change  ap. 509-523.  aSeasonal rounds are deliberative articulations of a community’s sociocultural relations with their ecological system. The process of visualizing seasonal rounds informs transdisciplinary research. We present a methodological approach for communities of enquiry to engage communities of practice through context-specific sociocultural and ecological relations driven by seasonal change. We first discuss historical précis of the concept of seasonal rounds that we apply to assess the spatial and temporal communal migrations and then describe current international research among Indigenous and rural communities in North America and Central Asia by the creation of a common vocabulary through mutual respect for multiple ways of knowing, validation of co-generated knowledge, and insights into seasonal change. By investigating the relationship between specific biophysical indicators and livelihoods of local communities, we demonstrate that seasonal rounds are an inclusive and participatory methodology that brings together diverse Indigenous and rural voices to anticipate anthropogenic climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3ahuman ecology 3aseasonal variation 3aCentral Asia 3aNorth America1 aRuelle, Morgan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4999-93081 aHaag, Isabell1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3308-52451 aBulbulshoev, Umed1 aKaziev, Daler1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2609-08521 aLouis, Leo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8223-23551 aUllmann, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5059-50201 aEdwards, Iriel1 aKhan, Aziz Ali1 aTrabucco, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0743-36801 aSamimi, Cyrus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7001-78930 tHuman ecology.g2021 Oct., v. 49, no. 5 p.509-523dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4653x0300-78397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-021-00269-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008200156520213700238592002802375650001402403650001502417650001102432650002002443650001902463650001102482650001502493650003102508650001902539650001502558650002102573650002002594650001702614700001402631700001802645700001702663700002002680700002402700773012802724856007502852852000902927655001202936IND60703945020221120233301.0200722e20200406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070394502DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120711762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yukun 10aContinuous Monitoring of Cotton Stem Water Potential using Sentinel-2 Imagery  aMonitoring cotton status during the growing season is critical in increasing production efficiency. The water status in cotton is a key factor for yield and cotton quality. Stem water potential (SWP) is a precise indicator for assessing cotton water status. Satellite remote sensing is an effective approach for monitoring cotton growth at a large scale. The aim of this study is to estimate cotton water stress at a high temporal frequency and at a large scale. In this study, we measured midday SWP samples according to the acquisition dates of Sentinel-2 images and used them to build linear-regression-based and machine-learning-based models to estimate cotton water stress during the growing season (June to August, 2018). For the linear-regression-based method, we estimated SWP based on different Sentinel-2 spectral bands and vegetation indices, where the normalized difference index 45 (NDI45) achieved the best performance (R² = 0.6269; RMSE = 3.6802 (-1*swp (bars))). For the machine-learning-based method, we used random forest regression to estimate SWP and received even better results (R² = 0.6709; RMSE = 3.3742 (-1*swp (bars))). To find the best selection of input variables for the machine-learning-based approach, we tried three different data input datasets, including (1) 9 original spectral bands (e.g., blue, green, red, red edge, near infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR)), (2) 21 vegetation indices, and (3) a combination of original Sentinel-2 spectral bands and vegetation indices. The highest accuracy was achieved when only the original spectral bands were used. We also found the SWIR and red edge band were the most important spectral bands, and the vegetation indices based on red edge and NIR bands were particularly helpful. Finally, we applied the best approach for the linear-regression-based and the machine-learning-based methods to generate cotton water potential maps at a large scale and high temporal frequency. Results suggests that the methods developed here has the potential for continuous monitoring of SWP at large scales and the machine-learning-based method is preferred.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium 3aalgorithms 3acotton 3adata collection 3agrowing season 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3avegetation index 3awater potential 3awater stress1 aZhu, Zhe 1 aGuo, Wenxuan 1 aSun, Yazhou 1 aYang, Xiaoyuan 1 aKovalskyy, Valeriy 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Apr. 06, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120711763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011500167520117600282592002801458650001501486650001501501650001101516650001801527650001301545650001001558650002001568650001301588650001901601653001601620653002001636653002001656653001501676653001601691700001701707700001601724700002001740773010401760856008501864852000901949655001201958IND60725830820221119060734.0211206e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072583082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1106982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiyun10aFacile preparation of robust dual MgO-loaded carbon foam as an efficient adsorbent for malachite green removal  aThis study developed a facile approach for the fabrication of dual MgO-loaded carbon foam (DMCF) via carbonization of a cured MgO/cyanate ester resin mixture, which underwent self-foaming of the resin followed by the carbothermal reduction of MgO. The features of the prepared DMCF prepared were characterized by FESEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, XPS and so on, and the effects of adsorption conditions, adsorption isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics on malachite green (MG) removal using the DMCF as adsorbents were investigated through batch adsorption experiments. Results demonstrate that the DMCF possesses a unique dual loading of MgO particles which are not only loaded onto its foam walls but also filled within the walls with a graphene-wrapped core-shell structure. The experimental maximum adsorption capacity of MG reaches up to 1874.18 mg/g with a partition coefficient of 10.87 mg/g/μM. The adsorption process can be better described with Langmuir, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion models. Moreover, the DMCF exhibits a removal percentage of 84.85% after five reuses, indicating that it is an efficient and promising adsorbent for MG adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3acyanates 3afoams 3amalachite green 3aresearch 3athermodynamics 0aCarbon foam 0aMagnesium oxide 0aMalachite green 0aAdsorption 0aReusability1 aZheng, Ding,1 aLin, Qilang1 aFang, Changqing0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 Apr., v. 195 p.110698-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1106983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008900165300001600254520174000270592002802010650001302038650001102051650001602062650001802078650002602096650001502122650001502137650000702152650002402159650001402183650001602197653000702213653000802220653000802228653000902236653001002245653000902255653000802264653000802272653000902280653002402289653002602313653003402339653002502373653002602398700003002424700002202454773010602476856008202582852000902664655001202673IND60573520920221119005651.0180905e20171025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057352092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2017.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Vrieze, Jo14aThe microbiome as engineering tool: Manufacturing and trading between microorganisms  ap. 206-214.  aThe integration of microbial technologies within the framework of the water-energy nexus has been taking place for over a century, but these mixed microbial communities are considered hard to deal with ‘black boxes’. Process steering is mainly based on avoiding process failure by monitoring conventional parameters, e.g., pH and temperature, which often leads to operation far below the intrinsic potential. Mixed microbial communities do not reflect a randomised individual mix, but an interacting microbiological entity. Advance monitoring to obtain effective engineering of the microbiome is achievable, and even crucial to obtain the desired performance and products. This can be achieved via a top-down or bottom-up approach. The top-down strategy is reflected in the microbial resource management concept that considers the microbial community as a well-structured network. This network can be monitored by means of molecular techniques that will allow the development of accurate and quick decision tools. In contrast, the bottom-up approach makes use of synthetic cultures that can be composed starting from defined axenic cultures, based on the requirements of the process under consideration. The success of both approaches depends on real-time monitoring and control. Of particular importance is the necessity to identify and characterise the key players in the process. These key players not only relate with the establishment of functional conversions, but also with the interaction between partner bacteria. This emphasises the importance of molecular (screening) techniques to obtain structural and functional insights, minimise energy input, and maximise product output by means of integrated microbiome processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3aenergy 3aengineering 3amanufacturing 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3amonitoring 3apH 3aresource management 3ascreening 3atemperature 0aAB 0aCHP 0aCOD 0aFISH 0aFTHFS 0amcrA 0aOTU 0aPCR 0aqPCR 0aMicrobial community 0aMicrobial engineering 0aMicrobial resource management 0aMolecular techniques 0aSynthetic communities1 aChristiaens, Marlies E.R.1 aVerstraete, Willy0 tNew biotechnology.g2017 Oct. 25, v. 39 p.206-214dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4392691x1871-67847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2017.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245005000168300001600218520107800234592002801312650000801340650001301348650001501361650001001376650001001386650002901396650000901425650000901434650001101443651001101454653001901465653002001484653002101504653002301525653002001548773015001568856008301718852000901801655001201810IND60776895620221118193334.0220511e20220509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077689562DNAL7 a10.2317/0022-8567-94.2.1582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrummond, Frank10aHoney bee cleansing flights…just cleansing?  ap. 158-162.  aThe first major cleansing flight during the winter in a honey bee apiary was witnessed on February 6, 2021. A light snowfall and freezing rain prior to the flight allowed delineation of the distribution of distances from the aggregation of hives of fecal depositions and immobilized honey bees fallen to the ground. Five transects were surveyed radiating from the aggregation of four overwintered hives to collect the data. The frequency distributions of these events were fit to Gamma probability density functions and then a test of the following hypothesis was constructed. Are cleansing flights solely comprised of local defecation by workers and then return to the hive? Or do workers also commence foraging in suboptimal air temperatures for flight? We found evidence that cleansing flights are comprised of two behaviors, local deposition of feces and long-distance foraging. This is based upon a significant difference (P < 0.001) between the mean distance from the hives of fecal deposition (3.01 ± 0.36(se)) and immobilized bees on the ground (9.49 ± 1.21(se)).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aapiaries 3adefecation 3afeces 3ahoney 3aprobability distribution 3arain 3asnow 3awinter 3aKansas 0aApis mellifera 0atransect sample 0afecal deposition 0adistance from hive 0awinter foraging0 tJournal of the Kansas Entomological Society.g2022 May 9, v. 94, no. 2 p.158-162dKansas Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl44728x0022-85677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2317/0022-8567-94.2.1583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245010900208300001800317520115700335592002801492650001401520650001801534650002101552650001601573650002301589650001701612650001301629650001501642700001601657700002001673700002001693700002501713773011001738856008301848852000901931655001201940IND60638158120221120162954.0190816e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063815812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02377-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiLoreto, Edward1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3921-798210aFreeze dried cellulose nanocrystal reinforced unsaturated polyester composites: challenges and potential  ap. 4391-4403.  aFunctionalized cellulose particles were studied as a potential reinforcement for an unsaturated polyester resin (UPR) system, a common material for automotive applications of fiber reinforced plastics. A preliminary process for incorporating freeze-dried cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) powder into UPR was developed. Three surface chemistries were explored including sulfonated, methyl(triphenyl) phosphonium (PhCNC), and maleic acid (MCNC). By optical microscopy the filler was seen to be agglomerated within the matrix. Fractography showed that these agglomerates acted as stress concentration points resulting in decreased tensile and flexural strength. With the addition of 1 wt% CNCs, the flexural and tensile modulus increased by up to 53% and 22%, respectively. Dynamic mechanical analysis indicated that the PhCNC- and MCNC-UPR samples had a 61% and 66% higher glassy modulus than neat UPR, respectively. Despite the lack of nano-scale dispersion of CNC in UPR, these results reflect potential in the use of functionalized CNC agglomerates as an additive in UPR systems to produce composites with high moduli and good thermo-mechanical stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3afreeze drying 3alight microscopy 3amaleic acid 3amodulus of rupture 3ananocrystals 3aplastics 3apolyesters1 aHaque, Ejaz1 aBerman, Arielle1 aMoon, Robert J.1 aKalaitzidou, Kyriaki0 tCellulose.g2019 May, v. 26, no. 7 p.4391-4403dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02377-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014100168300001800309520154100327592002801868650002401896650001201920650002301932650001401955650002201969650001001991650000902001650003002010650002702040650001202067650001402079650003002093650002502123650002202148650001302170650001302183700001902196700001802215700001802233700001802251700001902269700001902288700001802307700001802325700001802343773010802361856008102469852000902550655001202559IND60580397320221118053240.0170916e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058039732DNAL7 a10.1007/s13258-017-0582-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Sang Wook10aDevelopment of EST-SSR markers through de novo RNA sequencing and application for biomass productivity in kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.)  ap. 1139-1156.  aKenaf is a multipurpose crop, but a lack of genetic information hinders genetic and molecular research. In this study, we aimed to develop EST-SSR markers from mutant and wild-type cultivars, and to assess the genetic diversity of the kenaf resources. A total of 33 Gb of sequence data comprising 130,480 unigenes was assembled by de novo RNA-sequencing of six kenaf cultivars, and 5619 SSRs were identified. Tri-nucleotide motifs occurred most frequently (82.67%) followed by di-, tetra-, and penta-motifs. In total, 515 polymorphic EST-SSRs were derived by pairwise comparisons of the cultivars based on in silico analyses. Of these, 70 markers were successfully validated among six cultivars. We used the six cultivars, together with 39 kenaf accessions from worldwide to assess genetic diversity and to characterize the EST-SSRs. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 8. PIC and genetic diversity values ranged from 0.08 to 0.79 and 0.08–0.82, respectively. The phylogenetic and population structure showed that the 45 accessions could be clearly divided into three groups based on different days to flowering (DTF). Genetic differentiation among the DTF groups showed a proportionally high level of variance. Association analysis between the DTF and the markers revealed three significant associations. Furthermore, using a multiplex PCR with three markers, DTF could be perfectly discriminated. These markers will be useful in marker-assisted selection after further validation with segregating populations of kenaf.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHibiscus cannabinus 3aalleles 3abiomass production 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3akenaf 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amutants 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation structure 3asequence analysis 3aunigenes 3avariance1 aKwon, Soon-Jae1 aRyu, JaiHyunk1 aKim, Jin-Baek1 aAhn, Joon-Woo1 aKim, Sang Hoon1 aJo, Yeong Deuk1 aChoi, Hong-Il1 aIm, Seung Bin1 aKang, Si-Yong0 tGenes & genomics.g2017 Oct., v. 39, no. 10 p.1139-1156dThe Genetics Society of Koreax1976-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-017-0582-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010700171520106600278592002801344650001101372650001901383650003001402650001501432650001601447650001101463650001101474650000901485650001401494650002301508650001701531650001601548650000901564653001601573653001601589653001701605653004501622700002101667700001901688700001801707700002701725700002401752700006001776700002001836700002001856700006801876700001901944700002101963773009801984856008702082852000902169655001202178IND60646661820221122034937.0190620e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064666182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1134512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGravogl, Georg10aPressure effects on the carbonation of MeO (Me = Co, Mn, Pb, Zn) for thermochemical energy storage  aMetal carbonates are attractive materials for combining carbon capture and thermochemical energy storage. Carbonate materials feature high decomposition and formation temperatures and may be considered in applications in combination with concentrating solar power. In the present study in-situ P-XRD carbonation (1–8 bar CO2) and reactor-based experiments (1–55 bar CO2) are combined focusing on the effect of elevated CO2 pressures on carbonation of metal oxides. Carbonation of MnO and PbO at CO2 pressures between 8 and 50 bar in the presence of moisture resulted in reaction with CO2, forming the corresponding carbonates at notably lower temperatures than under dry CO2 atmosphere of 1 bar. This enables the application of metal oxide/metal carbonate reaction couples for energy storage at temperatures between 25 and 500 °C. Based on the reversible carbonation/decarbonation of PbO under varying CO2 pressures, an isothermal storage cycle between PbO/PbCO3·2PbO, triggered by changing the CO2 pressure between 2 and 8 bar, was developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acarbonates 3acarbonation 3acobalt 3aenergy 3alead 3amanganese 3amanganese monoxide 3asolar energy 3atemperature 3azinc 0aCarbonation 0aMetal oxide 0aCO2 pressure 0aIsothermal thermochemical energy storage1 aKnoll, Christian1 aArtner, Werner1 aWelch, Jan M.1 aEitenberger, Elisabeth1 aFriedbacher, Gernot1 aHarasek, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6490-58401 aHradil, Klaudia1 aWerner, Andreas1 aWeinberger, P.q(Peter),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4172-61931 aMüller, Danny1 aMiletich, Ronald0 tApplied energy.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 252 p.113451-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1134513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245011900159300001800278520144800296592002801744650001001772650002001782650001901802650002601821650002301847650002201870650001601892650001801908700002201926773009801948856007902046852000902125655001202134IND60123996520221117233923.0150419e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012399652DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.128192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Peng10aQuantification of Visual Characteristics of Whipped Cream by Image Analysis and Machine Vision: Method Development  ap. E750-E758.  aThe appearance (color, shine, surface roughness, bumpiness, view area, height) of whipped cream samples change with time. Quantitative methods based on image analysis were developed to measure these parameters in cream samples stored at 3 temperatures (room temperature, 10 °C and 2 °C) for up to 24 h. There was a small decrease in L* and a* values over time, and a significant increase in b* values. ΔE values suggest that these color changes are significant and observable (2.96 for room temperature, 9.46 for 10 °C, 12.6 for 2 °C). Difference between polarized and nonpolarized images was used to quantify shine. The length of a laser line over the cream sample was measured to quantify the change in bumpiness of the surface (33.8%, 41.78%, and 33.27% reduction in laser line length for room temperature, 10 °C, and 2 °C, respectively). For room temperature stored samples, most changes occurred during the first 5 min. For samples stored at 10 °C and 2 °C, most changes occurred during the first 30 min. Turn angles data did not provide useful information. The changes in view area depended on temperature: at room temperature the area increased over time, at 10 °C it increased first then decreased; at 2 °C the view area decreased over time. Correlation of the results of these methods with sensory evaluation can make the evaluation of the appearance of whipped cream more objective, repeatable, and quantitative.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3acomputer vision 3aimage analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3asensory evaluation 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3awhipped cream1 aBalaban, Murat O.0 tJournal of food science.g2015 Apr., v. 80, no. 4 p.E750-E758dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.128193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013500162300002000297520080900317592002801126650001401154650001501168650001101183650001301194650001301207650002001220650002801240650001201268653001901280653001801299653002801317653003901345653002601384700001801410700001801428700005401446700001401500700005101514773014201565856007801707852000901785655001201794IND60656439420221120062337.0190814e20190724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065643942DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b093242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Qiaomei10aHarnessing the Day–Night Rhythm of Humidity and Sunlight into Mechanical Work Using Recyclable and Reprogrammable Soft Actuators  ap. 29290-29297.  aToward a sustainable society, soft actuators driven by environmentally friendly energy from nature are of great social and economic significance. Meanwhile, recyclability, repeated reconfiguration for other use, and complex three-dimensional (3D) geometries are also essential for mitigating the energy crisis and practical application demands. Here, we integrate all of the above features in one actuator using vitrimers with exchangeable disulfide links. By reconfiguration, welding, patterning, and kirigami techniques, complex 3D actuators can be easily fabricated, which can be repeatedly reconfigured for other applications to save cost in new material preparation. These actuators operate synergistically with the day–night rhythm of humidity and sunlight without the need of extra energy input.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactuators 3adisulfides 3aenergy 3ageometry 3ahumidity 3asolar radiation 3asustainable communities 3awelding 0asoft actuators 0aenergy-saving 0avitrimer-based bilayers 0ahumidity and sunlight responsivity 0acomplex 3D structures1 aQian, Xiaojie1 aXu, Yanshuang1 aYang, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6417-34831 aWei, Yan,1 aJi, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1363-65130 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 July 24, v. 11, no. 32 p.29290-29297dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b093243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02144naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245007400165300001300239520092300252592002801175650002501203650001601228650001001244650001701254650002101271650001201292650001301304650002801317651001101345653001101356653001101367653001201378653002201390653002101412700001701433700002201450700001901472773014501491856007701636852000901713655001201722IND60776895820221118191909.0220511e20220503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077689582DNAL7 a10.1660/062.125.01012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambert, Sheryl S.10aStructural Determinants of Blue to Red Fluorescent Protein Conversion  ap. 1-10.  aThe color, brightness, and stability of a fluorescent protein are dictated by its amino acid sequence. Attempts to alter the physical properties of fluorescent proteins have focused on random amino acid changes directed at positions known to be a part of or near the fluorophore in the protein. In this study TagBFP and TagRFP, which differ by 13 amino acid mutations, are compared to understand which amino acids are critical for the fluorophore's color. Several site-directed mutants were created, and the in vivo fluorescence of the 17 different mutant proteins were evaluated. The fluorescence of the proteins was measured in vivo, skipping the time-consuming step of protein purification since the fluorescence was not affected by purification. Nearly all mutants exhibit blue fluorescence. The color conversion from blue to red required the mutation of a full set of six amino acids that contact the fluorophore.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3acolor 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3amutants 3amutation 3ared fluorescent protein 3aKansas 0aTagBFP 0aTagRFP 0ain vivo 0amutant amino acid 0acolor conversion1 aLarsen, Ryan1 aWheatley, Nora E.1 aSimons, Kim T.0 tTransactions of the Kansas Academy of Science.g2022 May 3, v. 125, no. 1-2 p.1-10dKansas Academy of SciencewJournal:6278x0022-84437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1660/062.125.01013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01758naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245012100168300002000289520062000309592002800929650001400957650001300971650001700984650004401001650001501045650001501060650002301075650002001098700002101118700002601139700002301165773012901188856008201317852000901399655001201408IND60565984420180611000000.0170330e20151203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056598442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b084882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReeve, Zoë

The TEGDME electrolyte demonstrated superior stability to the TMP electrolyte. Li₂O₂ and evidence of electrolyte breakdown was observed in the TEGDME cell, whereas only electrolyte breakdown products were discovered within the TMP cell. Potential decomposition pathways of TMP are proposed here that account for the formation of the discharge species observed in the ¹⁷O, ⁷Li, ¹H, and ³¹P solid-state NMR of the cycled cathodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acathodes 3aelectrolytes 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphysical chemistry 3astable isotopes1 aPauric, Allen D.1 aHarris, Kristopher J.1 aGoward, Gillian R.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Dec. 03, v. 119, no. 48 p.26840-26848dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b084883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245012200206520177400328592002802102650001802130650001102148650001702159650002102176650003502197650001302232653001702245653002002262653003402282653002102316653002502337700001602362700002002378700001702398700001502415700001902430700002502449773010402474856008502578852000902663655001202672IND60725831120221119060659.0211206e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072583112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2021.1107362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBos, Brendan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7172-485310aTaxi drivers’ exposure to black carbon and nitrogen dioxide in electric and diesel vehicles: A case study in London  aNitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and black carbon (BC) concentrations were measured inside London taxicabs across 40 work shifts in a real-world occupational study. The shifts were measured across five plug-in hybrid range-extender electric taxicabs (TXe City) and five diesel taxicabs (TX4 Diesel). The aim of this study was to characterise the impact of fuel and cabin design on professional drivers' air pollution exposures. Personal exposure was monitored using portable BC, NO₂ and GPS devices. A controlled study replicating a typical taxi drivers' route in central London was conducted. Simultaneous inside and outside BC concentrations were measured to assess infiltration rates. The drivers were instructed to keep the BC devices with them at all times, providing a comparison of exposures at work and outside of work. The driver's average BC and NO₂ exposure while working was nearly twice as high for diesel taxicab drivers (6.8 ± 7.0 μg/m³, 101.9 ± 87.8 μg/m³) compared with electric drivers (3.6 ± 4.9 μg/m³, 55.3 ± 53.0 μg/m³, respectively). The exposure to BC while not working was 1.6 μg/m³ for diesel drivers and 1.1 μg/m³ for electric drivers, highlighting the very high exposures experienced by this occupational sector. The analysis of vehicle type on BC concentrations showed that the airtight cabin design and presence of an in-built filter in the electric TXe City reduced the exposure to BC substantially; indoor to outdoor ratios being 0.63 on the electric taxi compared to 0.99 on the diesel taxi with recirculate ventilation mode off and 0.07 to 0.44 with recirculate on. These findings provide important evidence for occupational health of professional drivers through exposure reduction measures in vehicle design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3acarbon 3acase studies 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoccupational health and safety 3aresearch 0aTaxi drivers 0aDiesel exposure 0aTraffic related air pollution 0aVentilation mode 0aCabin air filtration1 aLim, Shanon1 aHedges, Michael1 aMolden, Nick1 aBoyle, Sam1 aMudway, Dr Ian1 aBarratt, Dr Benjamin0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 Apr., v. 195 p.110736-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1107363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008700170300001400257520102800271536011801299592002801417650001901445650001501464650001801479650000901497650002001506650002001526650001201546653001401558653002001572653001301592653002001605653001701625700001801642700002001660700001701680700002501697773012801722856008501850852000901935655001201944IND60595345720221116221449.0180602e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059534572DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2017.13762042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlenko, Anne10aBehavior and Performance of Dairy Cows After Transfer from Tied to Cubicle Housing  ap. 82-92.  aBehavior and performance changes when tied dairy cows were moved to a loose housing system in a cubicle system were investigated. Behavioral observations were made for 3 consecutive days in 3 periods after transition. The cows (n = 105) were observed on 18 sampling occasions for 1 month. Recordings were made of body positions and general and social behaviors. Monthly milk records were collected 1 year before and 1 year after transition. Cows walked more during the 1st observation period than during the other periods (p < .05). Walking activity also differed between days when nested to period (p < .05). During the 1st period, cows ruminated while standing more than during the 3rd period (p < .05). Cows ate and groomed less and vocalized more during the 1st period (p < .05). It was concluded that after transition from a tied to a cubicle system, several behaviors were affected during the 1st days, and milk production of multiparous cows was negatively affected, although this effect was not long-term.  aThis work was supported by institutional research fund IUT8-1 of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3adairy cows 3aloose housing 3amilk 3amilk production 3asocial behavior 3awalking 0aDairy cow 0acubicle housing 0abehavior 0amilk production 0areproduction1 aLidfors, Lena1 aArney, David R.1 aKaart, Tanel1 aAland, A.q(Andres),0 tJournal of applied animal welfare science.g2018 Jan. 2, v. 21, no. 1 p.82-92dRoutledgewJournal:jnl56472x1532-76047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2017.13762043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245011600164520222500280592002802505650002102533650002102554650002202575650003102597650001502628650001902643650001502662650001602677700002802693700001902721700002102740700002002761700001802781700002602799773012802825856007502953852000903028655001203037IND60703945520221120233234.0200722e20200407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070394552DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120711802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInnerkofler, Josef 10aPrecise Orbit Determination for Climate Applications of GNSS Radio Occultation including Uncertainty Estimation  aGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) is a highly valuable remote sensing technique for probing the Earth’s atmosphere, due to its global coverage, high accuracy, long-term stability, and essentially all-weather capability. In order to ensure the highest quality of essential climate variables (ECVs), derived from GNSS signal tracking by RO satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), the orbit positions and velocities of the GNSS transmitter and LEO receiver satellites need to be determined with high and proven accuracy and reliability. Wegener Center’s new Reference Occultation Processing System (rOPS) hence aims to integrate uncertainty estimation at all stages of the processing. Here we present a novel setup for precise orbit determination (POD) within the rOPS, which routinely and in parallel performs the LEO POD with the two independent software packages Bernese GNSS software (v5.2) and NAPEOS (v3.3.1), employing two different GNSS orbit data products. This POD setup enables mutual consistency checks of the calculated orbit solutions and is used for position and velocity uncertainty estimation, including estimated systematic and random uncertainties. For LEOs enabling laser tracking we involve position uncertainty estimates from satellite laser ranging. Furthermore, we intercompare the LEO orbit solutions with solutions from other leading orbit processing centers for cross-validation. We carefully analyze multi-month, multi-satellite POD result statistics and find a strong overall consistency of estimates within LEO orbit uncertainty target specifications of 5 cm in position and 0.05 mm/s in velocity for the CHAMP, GRACE-A, and Metop-A/B missions. In 92% of the days investigated over two representative 3-month periods (July to September in 2008 and 2013) these POD uncertainty targets, which enable highly accurate climate-quality RO processing, are satisfied. The moderately higher uncertainty estimates found for the remaining 8% of days (∼5–15 cm) result in increased uncertainties of RO-retrieved ECVs. This allows identification of RO profiles of somewhat reduced quality, a potential benefit for adequate further use in climate monitoring and research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth atmosphere 3aclimatic factors 3acomputer software 3aglobal positioning systems 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3auncertainty1 aKirchengast, Gottfried 1 aSchwarz, Marc,1 aPock, Christian 1 aJäggi, Adrian,1 aAndres, Yago 1 aMarquardt, Christian 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Apr. 07, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120711803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04184naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013000168520260000298592002802898650001102926650002302937650001402960650001202974650000902986650002102995650000903016650001403025650002403039650002103063650001303084650000903097650001903106650001603125651001003141653001403151653004403165653003503209653002103244700001703265700001503282700001703297700001403314700001603328700001603344700001803360700001403378700005203392773010403444856008503548852000903633655001203642IND60725831220221119060835.0211206e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072583122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2021.1107382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiangguo10aAssociation between cold spells and childhood asthma in Hefei, an analysis based on different definitions and characteristics  aAs the global climate continues to warm, there is an increased focus on heat, but the role of low temperatures on health has been overlooked, especially for developing countries. Methods We collected the admission data of childhood asthma in 2013–2016 from Anhui Provincial Children's Hospital, as well as meteorological data from the Meteorological Bureau for the study period and collected data of pollutants from 10 monitoring stations around Hefei city. Poisson's generalized additive model (GAM) combined with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was used to estimate the short-term effects of cold spell on childhood asthma in cold seasons (November to March). 16 definitions of cold spells were clearly compared, which combining 4 temperature indexes (daily minimum and mean temperature; daily minimum and mean apparent temperature), 2 temperature thresholds (2.5th and 5th) and 3 durations of at least 2–4 days. We then have an analysis of the modifying effect of characteristics of cold spells and individuals(gender and age), with a view to discovering the susceptible population to cold spell. Results There was significant association between cold spells and admission risk for childhood asthma. And the definition, in which daily minimum apparent temperature falls below 5th percentile for at least 3 consecutive days, produced the optimum model fit performance. Based on this optimal fit we found that, for the total population, the effect of cold spell lasted approximately five days (lag1-lag5), with the largest effect occurring in lag 3 (RR = 1.110; 95% CI: 1.052–1.170). In subgroup analysis, the cumulative effect of lag0-7 was higher in males and school-age children than in females and other age groups, respectively. In addition, we found that the effect of is higher as the duration increases. Conclusion This study suggests an association between cold spell and childhood asthma, and minimum AT may be a better indicator to define the cold spells. Boys and school-age children are more vulnerable to cold spell. And one of our very interesting findings is that if a cold spell lasts for several days, the impact of the cold spell on those later days is likely to be greater than that of the previous days. In conclusion, we should pay more attention to the protection of boys and school-aged children in our future public health protection and give more attention to those cold spells that last longer. Therefore, we recommend that schools and health authorities need to take targeted measures to reduce the risk of asthma in children during the cold spell.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasthma 3aat-risk population 3achildhood 3aclimate 3acold 3ahealth promotion 3aheat 3ahospitals 3ameteorological data 3anonlinear models 3aresearch 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3atemperature 3aChina 0aColdspell 0aDistributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) 0aCharacteristics of cold spells 0aModifying effect1 aHe, Yangyang1 aTang, Chao1 aWei, Qiannan1 aXu, Zihan1 aYi, Weizhuo1 aPan, Rubing1 aGao, Jiaojiao1 aDuan, Jun1 aSu, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4673-64490 tEnvironmental research.g2021 Apr., v. 195 p.110738-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1107383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245013300181300001600314520129700330536007701627592002801704596004801732650001201780650001901792650001501811650001401826650000901840650002401849650002501873650001201898650002401910651001801934653002201952653001601974653002301990700002102013700002102034700002102055773013002076856008502206852000902291655001202300IND60595345820221116222412.0180602e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059534582DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2017.13785782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDecker Sparks, Jessica L.10aRace and ethnicity are not primary determinants in utilizing veterinary services in underserved communities in the United States  ap. 120-129.  aA retrospective database analysis (2011–2015) evaluated associations between race and ethnicity and veterinary service utilization by sampling 83,260 companion animals whose guardians (owners) self-identified as White, Black, or Latino/a from 39 Humane Society of the United States Pets for Life (PFL) sites across the United States. Controlling for socioeconomic status, the percentage of nonhuman animals sterilized through PFL whose owners were Latino/a or Black was substantially higher than in previously reported findings. While Latinos/as had the highest mean number of days from first contact with the program to consent, they also had the highest percentage of owners accepting the voucher during initial contact. Logistic regression models suggested that although meaningful, race and ethnicity were not primary determinants of veterinary service utilization. When veterinary and animal welfare organizations deliberately remove structural barriers embedded with racial inequalities, individuals, regardless of race and ethnicity, proceed with companion-animal sterilization.

Although a number of researches on PHBs were performed in different plant species, a systematic analysis of the PHB family in soybean is still remains uncharacterized. In the present study, 24 putative PHB genes have been first systemically identified in soybean. According to phylogenetic analysis, these GmPHBs could be classified into four groups. Gene structures and motif patterns showed high levels of conservation within the phylogenetic subgroups. Several members of this family have undergone purifying selection based on Ka/Ks analysis on duplicated PHB genes in soybean. We performed microsynteny analysis across four legume species based on the comparisons among the specific regions contained in PHB genes. As a result, numerous microsyntenic gene pairs among soybean, Medicago, Lotus and Phaseolus were identified. Most soybean PHB genes exhibited different expression levels in various tissues and developmental stages through expression analysis using publicly available RNA-seq datasets. The 11 GmPHB genes from III_B subgroup were examined by qPCR for their expression in two soybean cultivar after infection by Phytophthora sojae. Besides three GmPHB genes previous reported by us, here other four genes also were rapidly induced by P. sojae infection in the resistant genotype, while induction was very weak in the susceptible genotype. The comprehensive overview of the PHB gene family in soybean genome will provide useful information for further functional analysis of the PHB gene family in soybean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aLotus 3aMedicago 3aPhaseolus 3aPhytophthora sojae 3acultivars 3adata collection 3adevelopmental stages 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3agenotype 3aphylogeny 3aprokaryotic cells 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asoybeans 3atissues1 aPeng, Xiangyong1 aDu, Caifu1 aLei, Lei1 aZhang, Tao1 aXiang, Yang0 tGenes & genomics.g2017 Oct., v. 39, no. 10 p.1095-1106dThe Genetics Society of Koreax1976-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-017-0580-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012800165300001600293520142000309592002801729650000801757650001601765650001301781650001601794650001601810650001201826650001301838650001601851650003901867650001001906650001801916650001901934650003001953650001601983650001801999650001602017650001402033650001402047700001902061773012402080856008102204852000902285655001202294IND60518425220221118085642.0160417e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051842522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-016-1767-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIcgen, Bulent10aUse of cadA-Specific Primers and DNA Probes as Tools to Select Cadmium Biosorbents with Potential in Remediation Strategies  ap. 685-693.  aBiosorption, using cadmium-resistant bacterial isolates, is often regarded as a relatively inexpensive and efficient way of cleaning up wastes, sediments, or soils polluted with cadmium. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to the isolation of cadmium-resistant isolates for the efficient management of cadmium remediation processes. However, isolation, identification and in situ screening of efficient cadmium-resistant isolates are primary challenges. To overcome these challanges, in this study, cadA, cadmium resistance coding gene, specific primers and DNA probes were used to identify and screen cadmium-resistant bacteria in the cadmium-polluted river waters through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescein in situ hybridization (FISH). PCR amplification of the cadA amplicon coupled with 16S rRNA sequencing revealed various gram-positive and -negative bacterial isolates harboring cadA. Accordingly, a cadA-mediated DNA probe was prepared and used for in situ screening of cadmium-resistant isolates from water samples collected from cadmium-polluted river waters. The FISH analyses of cadA probe showed highly specific and efficient hybridization with cadA harboring isolates. The use of primers and DNA probes specific for cadA gene seems to be very helpful tools for the selection and screening of cadmium biosorbents with potential to be used in the remediation of cadmium-polluted sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3abacteria 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3acadmium 3acleaning 3afluorescein 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3ahybridization 3apolluted soils 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aremediation 3aribosomal RNA 3ariver water 3ascreening 3asediments1 aYilmaz, Fadime0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2016 May, v. 96, no. 5 p.685-693dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-016-1767-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003200113040001800145100002100163245008800184300001800272500000900290520179800299592002802097650002702125650001902152650002402171650002002195650002102215650001302236650002702249650001902276650002602295650001002321650001902331650000902350650001902359650001502378650002002393650003602413650002502449700002402474700001902498700002902517700002002546773013902566852000902705856011202714856007902826961001302905655001202918IND4413853420221118010523.0191228e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441385342DNAL7 a10113/271912hdl7 a10.2136/sssaj2007.04232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarren, Jason G.12aA New Method of Poultry Litter Application to Perennial Pasture: Subsurface Banding  ap. 1831-1837.  aepub  aRecently, incorporation of poultry litter by subsurface band application into pasture has been shown to reduce surface runoff transport of nutrients; however, data to evaluate the impact of this potential management strategy on forage production, forage nutrient concentrations, or the accumulation of soil nutrients after multiyear applications is limited. Therefore, two experiments, one in bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] and one in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) were initiated in which treatments included (i) a standard commercial fertilizer application, (ii) a surface broadcast litter application, (iii) poultry litter applied in subsurface bands placed 25 cm apart, and (iv) poultry litter applied in subsurface bands placed 38 cm apart. The experiments were conducted for 3 yr on a Hartsells (fine-loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic Typic Hapludult) soil at Crossville, AL, and showed that subsurface band applications resulted in forage yields equivalent to those achieved by conventional broadcast litter applications. Subsurface band applications also did not generally impact forage N, P, and K concentrations compared with surface litter applications. Three years of subsurface band applications to a depth of approximately 4 cm did not significantly alter the Mehlich 3 extractable nutrient content of soils collected at a depth of 0 to 15 cm. Data suggest, however, that subsurface band application would allow increases in subsurface movement of nutrients, as was evidenced by increased Cu concentrations at the 15- to 30-cm depth. The data suggest that the environmental benefits of subsurface band application of poultry litter into grass production systems are achieved without detrimental impacts on forage productivity or nutrient concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical concentration 3aband placement 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aplant nutrition 3aCynodon dactylon 3apastures 3afertilizer application 3asoil nutrients 3anutrient availability 3adepth 3apoultry manure 3asoil 3aforage grasses 3acrop yield 3anutrient uptake 3achemical constituents of plants 3aspatial distribution1 aSistani, Karamat R.1 aWay, Thomas R.1 aMays, D.

The present study aimed to evaluate the participation of the cannabinoid system of Dm telencephalon on nociception modulation in the fish Leporinus macrocephalus. We demonstrated that cannabidiol microinjection in Dm telecephalon inhibits the behavioral nociceptive response to the subcutaneous injection of 3% formaldehyde, and this antinociception is blocked by previous treatment with AM251 microinjection. Furthermore, AM251 microinjection in Dm prior to restraint stress also blockades the stress-induced antinociception. These results reinforce the hypothesis that this pallial telencephalic structure has a pivotal role in nociception modulation in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeporinus macrocephalus 3aamygdala 3acannabidiol 3afish 3aformaldehyde 3amammals 3anociception 3asubcutaneous injection 0aAmygdala 0aCannabidiol 0aCB1 0aNociception1 aMenescal-de-Oliveira, Leda1 aHoffmann, Anette0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 179 p.504-509dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01879naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245010100160300001600261520080800277592002801085650001201113650001201125650001501137650001301152650001701165650000901182650001201191650001201203650001401215650001701229651001001246651001801256700001701274773012401291856008101415852000901496655001201505IND60518425320221118085658.0160417e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051842532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-016-1772-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jian10aHeavy Metal Concentrations in Fish Species from Three Gorges Reservoir, China, After Impoundment  ap. 616-621.  aThe concentrations of Pb, Cr, Cd, As, and Hg were analyzed in the muscles of eleven fish species collected from the Wanzhou section of the Three Gorges Reservoir, Yangtze River, China.

Golden Orphan suitable for mass propagation  aFig (Ficus carica L.) is from the Moraceae family and is rich in essential nutrients, natural fiber and vitamins. The Golden Orphan cultivar is a yellow fig that is sweet, firm and can thrive in tropical climates. Current conventional propagation methods for the multiplication of plant stocks were found to be less efficient in producing healthy plant stocks. Micropropagation offers an alternative in the production of plant stocks resembling the quality of mother plants. The current study aims to fine tune the micropropagation protocol of the Golden Orphan cultivar for efficient production of plant stocks. Sterile nodal bud explants were subjected to different media treatments, carbon source and combinations of auxin and cytokinin. Rooting of explants was induced in auxin and rooted explants were acclimatized in cocopeat. The optimal basal medium for shoot elongation was Murashige and Skoog (MS) Medium, whereas 20 g/L sucrose resulted in the highest shoot length (2.00 ± 0.22 cm) facilitating the production of nodal segments for subsequent multiplication. The highest shoot induction (4.15 ± 0.43 shoots/explant) was observed in the treatment of 0.8 mg/L 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP), whereas the combination of 0.8 mg/L BAP and 0.5 mg/L indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) resulted in the highest shoot length (2.23 ± 0.09 cm). Treatment of 0.4 mg/L indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) produced the optimal percentage of rooting (83.33%) whereas acclimatization with cocopeat resulted in maximum survival rate. The present study has successfully optimised the crucial aspects of micropropagation for the Golden Orphan cultivar suitable for rapid plant stock production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFicus carica 3aacclimation 3aagricultural biotechnology 3abenzyladenine 3abiocatalysis 3acarbon 3acultivars 3aculture media 3acytokinins 3afigs 3aindole acetic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3amicropropagation 3asucrose 3asurvival rate 0aGolden orphan 0a6-Benzylaminopurine 0aIndole-3-butyric acid 0aCocopeat 0aMS 0aWPM 0aBAP 0aTDZ 0aNAA 0aIAA 0aIBA 0aSTN1 aLiew, Yoon Xuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9040-63861 aKhor, Soo Ping1 aMerican, Faradina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1441-01341 aSubramaniam, Sreeramanan1 aChew, Bee Lynn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6678-08690 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2021 Nov., v. 38 p.102225-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2021.1022253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03758naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012800167300001100295520216700306592002802473596004902501596004902550650001902599650001402618650003402632650002302666650001302689650001602702650001602718650001302734650002002747650003102767650001002798650001302808650001302821650001102834650001302845650001502858650001202873650001602885700002102901700002302922700001902945700005902964700002003023773010503043856008303148852000903231655001203240IND60772306220221118103601.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077230622DNAL7 a10.1186/s13007-022-00876-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanton, Monica13aAn efficient chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) protocol for studying histone modifications in peach reproductive tissues  ap. 43.  aBACKGROUND: Perennial fruit trees display a growth behaviour characterized by annual cycling between growth and dormancy, with complex physiological features. Rosaceae fruit trees represent excellent models for studying not only the fruit growth/patterning but also the progression of the reproductive cycle depending upon the impact of climate conditions. Additionally, current developments in high‐throughput technologies have impacted Rosaceae tree research while investigating genome structure and function as well as (epi)genetic mechanisms involved in important developmental and environmental response processes during fruit tree growth. Among epigenetic mechanisms, chromatin remodelling mediated by histone modifications and other chromatin-related processes play a crucial role in gene modulation, controlling gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation is an effective technique to investigate chromatin dynamics in plants. This technique is generally applied for studies on chromatin states and enrichment of post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) in histone proteins. RESULTS: Peach is considered a model organism among climacteric fruits in the Rosaceae family for studies on bud formation, dormancy, and organ differentiation. In our work, we have primarily established specific protocols for chromatin extraction and immunoprecipitation in reproductive tissues of peach (Prunus persica). Subsequently, we focused our investigations on the role of two chromatin marks, namely the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine in position 4 (H3K4me3) and trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) in modulating specific gene expression. Bud dormancy and fruit growth were investigated in a nectarine genotype called Fantasia as our model system. CONCLUSIONS: We present general strategies to optimize ChIP protocols for buds and mesocarp tissues of peach and analyze the correlation between gene expression and chromatin mark enrichment/depletion. The procedures proposed may be useful to evaluate any involvement of histone modifications in the regulation of gene expression during bud dormancy progression and core ripening in fruits.  aPublisher supplied data  aBIRD 2019cUniversità degli Studi di Padova  aBIRD 2019cUniversità degli Studi di Padova 3aPrunus persica 3achromatin 3achromatin immunoprecipitation 3aclimacteric fruits 3adormancy 3aepigenetics 3afruit trees 3afruiting 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahistones 3alysine 3amesocarp 3anectarines 3apeaches 3atree growth1 aFarinati, Silvia1 aForestan, Cristian1 aJoseph, Justin1 aBonghi, Claudio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7100-81601 aVarotto, Serena0 tPlant methods.g2022 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.43-43dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4337304x1746-48117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-022-00876-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01498naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007800170520055100248592002800799650004600827650001000873650001700883653004600900653001600946653003200962700002100994773009801015856008601113852000901199655001201208IND60793093820221119152202.0220929e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079309382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2022.1108522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelvin, Shamar10aFrom paper to plastic: How the transition to EBT affected SNAP enrollment  aWe duplicate and then build upon Ganong and Liebman (2018) work documenting the effects of unemployment and state policies on enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly The Food Stamp Program).

This review summarizes some recent developments in analytical procedures for measuring soil carbohydrates, amino compounds (amino acids and amino sugars), and phenols. The emphasis is on methods for soil carbohydrates and amino compounds involving anion chromatography and pulsed amperometry, a sensitive form of detection that has otherwise not been widely used in soil science. This carbohydrate procedure has become a leading method, with high resolution, sensitivity, and reproducibility. The pulsed amperometry analysis for amino compounds may be incrementally better than the conventional approach by HCl extraction, cation exchange chromatography, ninhydrin derivatization, and detection by visible light absorption. The two amino approaches need more rigorous comparison with regard to extraction efficiency and sensitivity for each amino compound. The pulsed amperometry approach also needs evaluation in a wider range of research settings. A recently developed procedure for measuring soil phenols is based on plant biochemistry studies and distinguishes ether-linked phenols (mostly vanillyl and syringyl) from ester-linked phenols (mostly coumaric acid and ferulic acid). Its applications in a limited number of studies linked specific phenols to soil aggregation and C sequestration. It needs calibration with other phenol methods favored by soil scientists and biogeochemists, and it needs to be evaluated in a range of research settings. Like the pulsed amperometry analysis for amino compounds, this distinction of ether- and ester-linked phenols is likely to complement existing techniques. A future goal will be the integration of results from complementary analyses for these biochemical compounds to help us better understand soil processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphenols 3asoil organic matter 3achemical analysis 3achromatography 3aamino acids 3aamino sugars 3asoil biological properties 3ameasurement 3adetection 3atechnology0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2008 Nov., v. 72, no. 6 p.1672-1682dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/271923Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2007.04063Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03458naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245013300178520215800311592002802469650001602497650001502513650001202528650001602540650002402556650002002580650001002600650001802610650001402628650001502642650001002657650002102667650001002688650002202698651001302720700002702733700002702760700002202787773013402809856008402943852000903027655001203036IND60794050220221119041028.0220922e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079405022DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120913522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTesfaye, Andualem Aklilu10aEnhancing Smallholder Wheat Yield Prediction through Sensor Fusion and Phenology with Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods  aField-scale prediction methods that use remote sensing are significant in many global projects; however, the existing methods have several limitations. In particular, the characteristics of smallholder systems pose a unique challenge in the development of reliable prediction methods. Therefore, in this study, a fast and reproducible new approach to wheat prediction is developed by combining predictors derived from optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) sensors using a diverse set of machine learning and deep learning methods under a small dataset domain. This study takes place in the wheat belt region of Ethiopia and evaluates forty-two predictors that represent the major vegetation index categories of green, water, chlorophyll, dry biomass, and VH polarization SAR indices. The study also applies field-collected agronomic data from 165 farm fields for training and validation. According to results, compared to other methods, a combined automated machine learning (AutoML) approach with a generalized linear model (GLM) showed higher performance. AutoML, which reduces training time, delivered ten influential parameters. For the combined approach, the mean RMSE of wheat yield was from 0.84 to 0.98 ton/ha using ten predictors from the test dataset, achieving a 99% confidence interval. It also showed a correlation coefficient as high as 0.69 between the estimated yield and measured yield, and it was less sensitive to the small datasets used for model training and validation. A deep neural network with three hidden layers using the ten influential parameters was the second model. For this model, the mean RMSE of wheat yield was between 1.31 and 1.36 ton/ha on the test dataset, achieving a 99% confidence interval. This model used 55 neurons with respective values of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 × 10⁻⁴ for the hidden dropout ratio, input dropout ratio, and l2 regularization. The approaches implemented in this study are fast and reproducible and beneficial to predict yield at scale. These approaches could be adapted to predict grain yields of other cereal crops grown under smallholder systems in similar global production systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aautomation 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aconfidence interval 3adata collection 3afarms 3alinear models 3aphenology 3aprediction 3aradar 3avegetation index 3awheat 3ayield forecasting 3aEthiopia1 aAwoke, Berhan Gessesse1 aSida, Tesfaye Shiferaw1 aOsgood, Daniel E.0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Sept. 01, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120913523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010000161300001600261520097800277592002801255650002201283650003001305650001801335650002501353650002001378650001101398650001801409650001801427650001201445650001201457650003001469650003301499700001601532700001601548700001701564773012401581856008101705852000901786655001201795IND60518425520221119034101.0160417e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051842552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-016-1763-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarro, N.10aLevels of PCBs in Oysters Coming from Galicia Coast: Comparison to Mussels from the Same Region  ap. 608-615.  aPCBs were analyzed in two species of oyster (Crassostrea gigas and Ostrea edulis) cultured in intertidal beds and rafts coming from the Galician Rías during the period 2011–2014.

The effect of biological parameters (shell length, lipid content and condition index) on bioaccumulation of PCBs was also evaluated. ANOVA showed a statistically significant difference between species for higher chlorinated biphenyls (CBs 153 and 138). The spatial patterns were investigated.

Recent studies propose that microbiome play an integral role in precision medicine. A study of the relationship between prakriti – the basis of personalized medicine in Ayurveda and that of gut microbiome, and possible biomarker of an individual’s health, would vastly improve precision therapy. Towards this, we analyzed bacterial metagenomes from buccal (oral microbiome) and fecal (gut microbiome) samples of 272 healthy individuals of various predominant prakritis. Major bacterial genera from gut microbiome included Prevotella, Bacteroides and Dialister while oral microbiome included Streptococcus, Neisseria, Veilonella, Haemophilus, Porphyromonas and Prevotella. Though the core microbiome was shared across all individuals, we found prakriti specific signatures such as preferential presence of Paraprevotella and Christensenellaceae in vata individuals. A comparison of core gut microbiome of each prakriti with a database of ‘healthy’ microbes identified microbes unique to each prakriti with functional roles similar to the physiological characteristics of various prakritis as described in Ayurveda. Our findings provide evidence to Ayurvedic interventions based on prakriti phenotyping and possible microbial biomarkers that can stratify the heterogenous population and aid in precision therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aBacteroides 3aDialister 3aHaemophilus 3aNeisseria 3aPorphyromonas 3aPrevotella 3aStreptococcus 3abiomarkers 3adatabases 3adigestive system 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiome 3aphenotype 3aprecision medicine1 aJnana, Apoorva1 aSriranjini, Sitaram Jaideep1 aTanwar, Ankit Singh1 aBrand, Angela1 aMurali, Thokur Sreepathy1 aSatyamoorthy, Kapaettu1 aGangadharan, G.

Method: We analyzed the gut microbiome in 6-month-old Latino infants from an ongoing urban mother–child cohort. Alpha and beta diversity were assessed in relation to infants’ early dietary exposure and anthropometrics including obesity. Results: Infants exclusively breastfed at 4 to 6 weeks had lower alpha diversity and less bacterial abundance compared with those who did not. Breastfeeding status at 4 to 6 weeks and 6 months of age accounted for differences in alpha and beta diversity. Infants who were obese at 6 months of age had higher levels of alpha diversity compared with non-obese infants. Conclusions: Early exclusive breastfeeding and obesity impacts microbial diversity by 6 months of age in Latino infants, a group at high risk for future obesity.  aThis study was supported by the National Institutes of Health DK08082 and DK097458 and Hellman Family Foundation, Sugar, Stress, Environment and Weight Pilot Grant Program, UCSF.  aPublisher supplied data  aDK08082aDK097458cNational Institutes of Health  cHellman Family Foundation, Sugar, Stress, Environment and Weight Pilot Grant Program, UCSF.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLatinos 3aanthropometric measurements 3aantibiotics 3abreast feeding 3adietary exposure 3ainfants 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aobesity 3aspecies diversity 0aMicrobiome 0ainfant 0aobesity 0aLatino 0abreastfeeding1 aLevine, Emma1 aZhi, Degui1 aLararia, Barbara1 aWojcicki, Janet M.0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 39, no. 1 p.47-53dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33742x1541-10877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2019.16067443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011800165300001200283520143400295592002801729650002101757650001401778650002401792650001801816650002701834650001601861650002301877650002201900650001001922650001101932650002001943650000901963650001901972650001601991653001402007653002402021653001602045653000902061653001002070700001802080700001602098700001302114700001602127700001602143700001602159700001802175700005602193773010202249856008502351852000902436655001202445IND60609619820221118050514.0180823e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060961982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.08.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hui10aLong term impairment of cognitive functions and alterations of NMDAR subunits after continuous microwave exposure  ap. 1-9.  aThe long term effects of continuous microwave exposure cannot be ignored for the simulation of the real environment and increasing concerns about the negative cognitive effects of microwave exposure.In this study, 220 male Wistar rats were exposed by a 2.856GHz radiation source with the average power density of 0, 2.5, 5 and 10mW/cm² for 6min/day, 5days/week and up to 6weeks. The MWM task, the EEG analysis, the hippocampus structure observation and the western blot were applied until the 12months after microwave exposure to detect the spatial learning and memory abilities, the cortical electrical activity, changes of hippocampal structure and the NMDAR subunits expressions.Results found that the rats in the 10mW/cm² group showed the decline of spatial learning and memory abilities and EEG disorders (the decrease of EEG frequencies, and increase of EEG amplitudes and delta wave powers). Moreover, changes of basic structure and ultrastructure of hippocampus also found in the 10 and 5mW/cm² groups. The decrease of NR 2A, 2B and p-NR2B might contribute to the impairment of cognitive functions.Our findings suggested that the continuous microwave exposure could cause the dose-dependent long term impairment of spatial learning and memory, the abnormalities of EEG and the hippocampal structure injuries. The decrease of NMDAR key subunits and phosphorylation of NR 2B might contribute to the cognitive impairment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3adose response 3aelectroencephalography 3ahippocampus 3alaboratory animals 3along term effects 3amales 3amemory 3aphosphorylation 3arats 3aultrastructure 3awater power 0aMicrowave 0aCognitive functions 0aHippocampus 0aRats 0aNMDAR1 aTan, Shengzhi1 aXu, Xinping1 aZhao, Li1 aZhang, Jing1 aYao, Binwei1 aGao, Yabing1 aZhou, Hongmei1 aPeng, Ruiyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3500-299X0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 181 p.1-9dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.08.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01924naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001400112245009600126300001400222520092200236592002801158650001701186650001201203650001601215650002601231650001701257651001001274653001601284653002201300653002401322700001801346700001701364700002001381773017601401852000901577655001201586IND60710192320221119130516.0200908e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071019232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsman, M.12aA Case Study of Drought in Andhra Pradesh: Socio-Economic Impacts and Mitigating Strategies  ap. 44-57.  aDrought is a recurring unavoidable natural calamity faced by India and many other countries.

Transgenic cotton expressing the cry1Ac gene from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has been widely planted for control of this pest. For managing the potential risk from resistance evolution in this pest, a new transgenic Bt cotton containing cry1Ac and cry2Ab genes (gene pyramided strategy) was designed as a successor of cry1Ac cotton. This article reports on levels of Cry2Ab tolerance in H. armigera populations from Cry1Ac cotton planting region in China based on bioassays of F1 and F2 offspring of isofemale lines. In total, 572 isofemale families of H. armigera from Xiajin County of Shandong Province (an intensive Bt cotton-planting area) and 124 families from Anci County of Hebei Province [a multiple-crop system, including corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Gycine max (L.) Merr., peanut (Arachis spp.), and Bt cotton] were screened with both Cry1Ac- and Cry2Ab-containing diets in 2008. The bioassays results indicated that relative average development rates (RADR) of F1 full-sib families from field-collected female moths on Cry1Ac- and Cry2Ab-containing diet were positively correlated. The same correlation was found in the F2 generation, indicating cross-tolerance between Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab in field populations of H. armigera in Yellow River cotton-farming region of China. This cross-tolerance must be considered in evaluating the utility of pyramiding Bt genes in cotton for delaying evolution of resistance. 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3atransgenic plants 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3acrystal proteins 3agenes 3ainsecticide resistance 3across resistance 3aprogeny 3adietary exposure 3agenetic resistance 3ainsect development 3aresistance management 3aChina 0aBt cotton 0across-tolerance 0aresistance genes1 aWu, Kongming1 aGould, Fred1 aShen, Zhicheng0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2009 June, v. 102, no. 3 p.1217-1223dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/029.102.03473Available from publisher's Web site  a20090708b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/07/07  aOther US 7aarticle02702naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014500163520137800308592002801686650001201714650002301726650000901749650004901758650002201807650001701829650001401846650001601860653001801876653002901894653001701923653002201940653002501962653001401987700001702001700001502018700001502033700001602048773012402064856008302188852000902271655001202280IND60793094420221119152108.0220921e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079309442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2022.1056982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yunfei10aInsight into co-pyrolysis interaction of Pingshuo coal and low-density polyethylene under varied mixing configurations via in-situ Py-TOF-MS  aThe real-time detection of volatiles is crucial for exploring co-pyrolysis mechanisms. In this study, the co-pyrolysis interaction mechanism of Pingshuo coal (PC) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with three varied mixing configurations was explored based on the product distribution and stable radicals in char by using in-situ pyrolysis time-of-flight mass spectrometry with vacuum ultraviolet photoionization as well as electron paramagnetic resonance. Total ion currents results show that mixing configurations have an obvious impact on the release of volatiles. In the coal-LDPE test, the volatiles from coal promotes the cracking of long-chain branches in LDPE, resulting in high alkenes content. Meanwhile, the LDPE melts delay the release of coal volatiles causing a higher peak temperature of 478 °C. As for the LDPE-coal configuration, the LDPE volatiles has a better hydrogen-donor effect, which can interact with volatiles and char from coal pyrolysis to facilitate the formation of aromatics and phenols. Comparatively, coal/LDPE configuration prompts the molten LDPE to coat coal particles and exhibits poor synergies between coal and LDPE. In addition, LDPE-coal char has higher spin concentrations of C-, and O-centered radicals, indicating that the released ·H radicals from LDPE pyrolysis can well interact with char and unreleased volatiles in coal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3aaromatic compounds 3acoal 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amass spectrometry 3apolyethylene 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aLow-rank coal 0aLow-density polyethylene 0aCo-pyrolysis 0aIn-situ Py-TOF-MS 0aMixing configuration 0aPy-TOF-MS1 aZhu, Jialong1 aYang, Juan1 aJin, Lijun1 aHu, Haoquan0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2022 Nov., v. 168 p.105698-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2022.1056983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04521naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011000167300001100277520214100288592002802429596007302457596007802530596007302608596004902681650001302730650001202743650002202755650001302777650003502790650001402825650001502839650001302854650001402867650002502881650001502906650002402921650000902945650000902954650001602963651001202979700001802991700002103009700002103030700002003051700002803071700002403099700002303123700002203146700001903168700002103187700001903208700002303227700002603250700002403276700002103300700001803321700002003339700001703359700001903376700002203395700002003417700001803437700001603455700001603471700001903487700006003506773009303566856008303659852000903742655001203751IND60741344320221120143243.0220225e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074134432DNAL7 a10.1186/s12284-021-00481-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiggins, Janet10aResequencing of 672 Native Rice Accessions to Explore Genetic Diversity and Trait Associations in Vietnam  ap. 52.  aBACKGROUND: Vietnam possesses a vast diversity of rice landraces due to its geographical situation, latitudinal range, and a variety of ecosystems. This genetic diversity constitutes a highly valuable resource at a time when the highest rice production areas in the low-lying Mekong and Red River Deltas are enduring increasing threats from climate changes, particularly in rainfall and temperature patterns. RESULTS: We analysed 672 Vietnamese rice genomes, 616 newly sequenced, that encompass the range of rice varieties grown in the diverse ecosystems found throughout Vietnam. We described four Japonica and five Indica subpopulations within Vietnam likely adapted to the region of origin. We compared the population structure and genetic diversity of these Vietnamese rice genomes to the 3000 genomes of Asian cultivated rice. The named Indica-5 (I5) subpopulation was expanded in Vietnam and contained lowland Indica accessions, which had very low shared ancestry with accessions from any other subpopulation and were previously overlooked as admixtures. We scored phenotypic measurements for nineteen traits and identified 453 unique genotype-phenotype significant associations comprising twenty-one QTLs (quantitative trait loci). The strongest associations were observed for grain size traits, while weaker associations were observed for a range of characteristics, including panicle length, heading date and leaf width. CONCLUSIONS: We showed how the rice diversity within Vietnam relates to the wider Asian rice diversity by using a number of approaches to provide a clear picture of the novel diversity present within Vietnam, mainly around the Indica-5 subpopulation. Our results highlight differences in genome composition and trait associations among traditional Vietnamese rice accessions, which are likely the product of adaption to multiple environmental conditions and regional preferences in a very diverse country. Our results highlighted traits and their associated genomic regions that are a potential source of novel loci and alleles to breed a new generation of low input sustainable and climate resilient rice.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB/N013735/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aBBS/E/T/000PR9818cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aBB/CSP1720/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  a172732508cThe British Council's Newton Fund 3aancestry 3aclimate 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3agenotype-phenotype correlation 3alandraces 3aleaf width 3apanicles 3aphenotype 3apopulation structure 3aprovenance 3aquantitative traits 3arain 3arice 3atemperature 3aVietnam1 aSantos, Bruno1 aTran Dang Khanh,1 aTrung, Khuat Huu1 aDuong, Tran Duy1 aDoai, Nguyen Thi Phuong1 aKhoa, Nguyen Truong1 aHa, Dang Thi Thanh1 aDiep, Nguyen Thuy1 aDung, Kieu Thi1 aPhi, Cong Nguyen1 aThuy, Tran Thi1 aTuan, Nguyen Thanh1 aTrần, Hoàng Dũng,1 aTrung, Nguyen Thanh1 aGiang, Hoang Thi1 aNhung, Ta Kim1 aTran, Cuong Duy1 aLang, Son Vi1 aNghia, La Tuan1 aVan Giang, Nguyen1 aXuan, Tran Dang1 aHall, Anthony1 aDyer, Sarah1 aHam, Le Huy1 aCaccamo, Mario1 aDe Vega, Jose J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2847-51580 tRice.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.52-52dSpringer USwJournal:J000001787x1939-84257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12284-021-00481-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010800166300001800274520155200292592002801844650004401872650002201916650001501938650001301953650002001966650001201986650000901998650001102007650002002018650000702038650001602045650001602061700001902077700001802096700001602114700001802130773009802148856008602246852000902332655001202341IND60577409620221120090840.0170808e20160517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057740962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b005632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yanli10aAdsorption of Lysine on Na-Montmorillonite and Competition with Ca2+: A Combined XRD and ATR-FTIR Study  ap. 4746-4754.  aLysine adsorption at clay/aqueous interfaces plays an important role in the mobility, bioavailability, and degradation of amino acids in the environment. Knowledge of these interfacial interactions facilitates our full understanding of the fate and transport of amino acids. Here, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) measurements were used to explore the dynamic process of lysine adsorption on montmorillonite and the competition with Ca²⁺ at the molecular level. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to determine the peak assignments of dissolved lysine in the solution phase. Three surface complexes, including dicationic, cationic, and zwitterionic structures, were observed to attach to the clay edge sites and penetrate the interlayer space. The increased surface coverage and Ca²⁺ competition did not affect the interfacial lysine structures at a certain pH, whereas an elevated lysine concentration contributed to zwitterionic-type coordination at pH 10. Moreover, clay dissolution at pH 4 could be inhibited at a higher surface coverage with 5 and 10 mM lysine, whereas the inhibition effect was inconspicuous or undetected at pH 7 and 10. The presence of Ca²⁺ not only could remove a part of the adsorbed lysine but also could facilitate the readsorption of dissolved Si⁴⁺ and Al³⁺ and surface protonation. Our results provide new insights into the process of lysine adsorption and its effects on montmorillonite surface sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3abioavailability 3acalcium 3aclay 3alysine 3amontmorillonite 3apH 3areflectance 3azwitterions1 aWang, Shengrui1 aLiu, Jingyang1 aXu, Yisheng1 aZhou, Xiaoyun0 tLangmuir.g2016 May 17, v. 32, no. 19 p.4746-4754dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b005633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245012400135300001400259520196000273592002802233650001302261650002802274650001502302650002202317650001002339650002602349650001202375650000902387650001502396650001602411650002502427651001002452653001602462653001702478653001702495700002502512700002802537773017602565852000902741655001202750IND60710192620221119130306.0200908e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071019262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, B.

The studies revealed that the productivity was higher with first fortnight of June sown crops, whereas the mean productivity was significantly decreased with successive delay in sowing time. Groundnut yield equivalents were higher with June second fortnight sown crop (593 kg/ha) and was comparable with June first sown crop (585 kg/ha) and significantly superior than other three dates of sowing. Groundnut crop recorded highest pod yield (1023 kg/ha) followed by sorghum (914 kg/ha) and better than cluster bean and castor. Two years pooled data indicates that in groundnut, higher pod yield was recorded with July first FN sowing (1355 kg/ha) followed by June second FN sowing (1305 kg/ha), June first FN sowing (1174 kg/ha) and significantly superior than July second FN sowing and August first FN sowing. In sorghum, higher seed yield was recorded with August first FN sowing (1020kg/ha) and lower with second FN of June (817 kg/ha). In redgram (1188kg/ha) and cluster bean (569kg/ha) higher seed yield was recorded with first FN of June sowing and gradually decreases with successive delayed sowings. In castor, higher yield was recorded with second FN of June (707 kg/ha) followed by first FN of June (675 kg/ha). Groundnut, redgram and cluster bean crops recorded positive net returns in all dates of sowing tried. Rain water use efficiency was gradually decreased if the sowings delayed beyond July second fortnight. Results revealed that, for groundnut, July first FN is the most appropriate time for sowing whereas, for redgram, castor and cluster bean June month is the suitable time for sowing. August first FN is the optimum time to sow the sorghum under dryland Alfisols of Anantapur district.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlfisols 3aCyamopsis tetragonoloba 3aarid lands 3acosts and returns 3acrops 3afield experimentation 3apeanuts 3arain 3aseed yield 3asowing date 3awater use efficiency 3aIndia 0aSowing time 0akharif crops 0aproductivity1 aReddy, A.

However, their potential as an archaeological archive is not fully acknowledged yet. Here we present several stalagmites containing soot and charcoal layers from various caves in Turkey and provide evidence that these black carbon layers are directly related to human activity. The archaeological artefacts found in Tabak and Kocain caves in SW Turkey support the linkage between soot and charcoal layers existence and human activity in the caves. For this study, we focus on stalagmites from Tabak and Kocain cave. To explore the age and nature of the soot and charcoal layers within stalagmites Ta-9, Ta-10 and Ko-1, Uranium series dating, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and thin section analyses were performed. The episodic soot and charcoal deposition in stalagmites Ta-9 and Ta-10 occurred between 7424 ± 225 yr BP and 6670 ± 218 yr BP while the soot and charcoal layers in stalagmite Ko-1 formed between 2830 ± 189 yr BP and 470 ± 56 yr BP. In combination with the archaeological inventory in Tabak Cave, the soot and charcoal layers within stalagmites Ta-9 and Ta-10 show that the cave was used repeatedly as a burial site during Chalcolithic period. In Kocain Cave was also used repeatedly between the Iron Age and Medieval Period, most likely for ritual activities and for providing animals with water from a small spring in the entrance to the cave. The soot and charcoal layers within stalagmites from Turkey prove that speleothems are also important as archaeological archives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTurkey (country) 3aarchaeology 3acarbon 3acharcoal 3ahumans 3ainventories 3asoot 3aspring 3auranium 0aStalagmite 0aGeoarchaeology 0aUranium series dating 0aSW Anatolia 0aTurkey1 aKoşun, Erdal1 aCheng, Hai1 aDemirtaş, Ferdi1 aLawrence Edwards, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7027-58811 aFleitmann, Dominik1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5977-88350 tJournal of archaeological science.g2020 Nov., v. 123 p.105255-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2020.1052553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245012800174300001600302520121300318592002801531650001701559650001601576650001001592650001601602650002201618650003701640650001001677651001101687651001601698700002101714700001901735700002901754700001901783700002601802700002701828700002801855773011001883856008101993852000902074655001202083IND60518425920221119033811.0160417e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051842592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-016-1192-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuevara Soto, Maricruz14aThe emergence of epitheliocystis in the upper Rhone region: evidence for Chlamydiae in wild and farmed salmonid populations  ap. 315-324.  aWe present the first study comparing epitheliocystis in a wild and farmed salmonid in Europe. Sampling three tributaries to the Lake Geneva, including one from headwaters to river mouth, revealed an unequal distribution of epitheliocystis in brown trout (Salmo trutta). When evaluated histologically and comparing sites grouped as wild versus farm, the probability of finding infected trout is higher on farms. In contrast, the infection intensities, as estimated by the number of cysts per gill arch, were higher on average and showed maximum values in the wild trout. Sequence analysis showed the most common epitheliocystis agents were Candidatus Piscichlamydia salmonis, all clustering into a single clade, whereas Candidatus Clavichlamydia salmonicola sequences cluster in two closely related subspecies, of which one was mostly found in farmed fish and the other exclusively in wild brown trout, indicating that farms are unlikely to be the source of infections in wild trout. A detailed morphological analysis of cysts using transmission electron microscopy revealed unique features illustrating the wide divergence existing between Ca. P. salmonis and Ca.

Of those, 4975 SNPs yielded successful assays after array manufacturing. These SNPs were discovered based on a variety of bioinformatics pipelines in complementary DNA (cDNA) and genomic DNA originating from 20 or more diverse oat cultivars. The array was validated in 1100 samples from six recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping populations and sets of diverse oat cultivars and breeding lines, and provided approximately 3500 discernible Mendelian polymorphisms. Here, we present an annotation of these SNPs, including methods of discovery, gene identification and orthology, population-genetic characteristics, and tentative positions on an oat consensus map. We also evaluate a new cluster-based method of calling SNPs.

We investigate the surface charging of a variety of polymer particles with different surface functionality in alkane solutions of a custom-synthesized and purified polyisobutylene succinimide (PIBS) polyamine surfactant and a related commercial surfactant mixture commonly used to control particle charge. We find that the observed electrophoretic particle mobility cannot be explained exclusively by donor–acceptor interactions between surface functional groups and surfactant polar moieties. Our results instead suggest an interplay of multiple charging pathways, which likely include the competitive adsorption of ions generated among inverse micelles in the solution bulk. We discuss possible factors affecting the competitive adsorption of micellar ions, such as the chemical nature of the particle bulk material and the size asymmetry between inverse micelles of opposite charge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalkanes 3aasymmetry 3adispersions 3aelectrophoresis 3aindustrial applications 3aions 3amicelles 3amoieties 3apolyamines 3apolymers 3asurfactants1 aZhou, Zhang-Lin1 aBehrens, Sven Holger0 tLangmuir.g2016 May 17, v. 32, no. 19 p.4827-4836dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b005833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03408naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245015300205506011700358520142300475592002801898506003701926650002301963650001801986650002002004650002702024650001202051650002202063650002102085650001802106650001502124650001202139650002002151650002202171650001302193650001802206650002402224650001202248651001102260651001802271651001802289651002802307653001302335653002202348653001702370653001802387653001502405653003002420700006302450700006602513700005902579773010102638856008202739852000902821655001202830IND60756991120221207105221.0220314e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075699112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gfs.2021.1005942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Meara, Lydia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0670-532210aConsumer experiences of food environments during the Covid-19 pandemic: Global insights from a rapid online survey of individuals from 119 countries  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aThis study investigates consumer experiences of food environments and food acquisition practices during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our rapid assessment online survey featured a convenience sample of 2015 individuals from 119 countries, spanning Western Europe, North America, Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and Africa. Data collection took place in April 2020 during the second month of the pandemic. Participants were recruited via existing networks of the United Nations System Standing Committee on Nutrition, through social media, and by snowballing. The majority of participants were female (71.9%), from low- and middle-income countries (51.0%), and working in nutrition or healthcare (39.3%). Qualitative thematic analysis and descriptive statistics reveal a series of common global experiences related to food availability and accessibility, food prices and affordability, food acquisition practices, and food preparation and consumption. The importance of community food participation, food sharing, and resource allocation are highlighted, along with increasing awareness of healthy diets and food waste. We identify ten synergistic policy entry points to: 1) build resilient and equitable food environments resistant to stresses and shocks; 2) harness positive dietary-related behaviors manifested during the pandemic; and, 3) mitigate the projected nutrition crisis and promote sustainable healthy diets for all.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aaffordability 3adata collection 3adescriptive statistics 3afemales 3afood availability 3afood preparation 3afood security 3afood waste 3aharness 3ahealth services 3aissues and policy 3apandemic 3arapid methods 3aresource allocation 3asurveys 3aAfrica 3aLatin America 3aNorth America 3aWestern European region 0aCovid-19 0aFood environments 0aFood systems 0aFood security 0aResilience 0aSustainable healthy diets1 aTurner, Christopher1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8091-11081 aCoitinho, Denise Costa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4189-86251 aOenema, Stineke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0914-51480 tGlobal food security.g2022 Mar., v. 32 p.100594-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21608x2211-91247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2021.1005943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013300166500001900299520104700318592002801365650001801393650001801411650003001429650001401459651001001473653002601483653001801509653002601527653001401553700006101567700005801628700005901686700002001745700005501765773011301820856008201933852000902015655001202024IND60713532620221117190942.0210121e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071353262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2020.1052592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarron, Aleese10aSnapshots in time: MicroCT scanning of pottery sherds determines early domestication of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) in East Africa  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicroCT visualisations of organic inclusions within pottery sherds from Khashm el Girba 23 (KG23), Sudan, reveal domesticated sorghum (Sorghum bicolor subsp. bicolor) at c. 3700–2900 BCE. The percentage of non-shattering spikelet bases was c. 73% of identifiable visualizations, with c. 27% representing wild types. These analyses demonstrate the domestication of sorghum is significantly earlier than suggested by previous archaeological research. These results also demonstrate that microCT scanning is a major qualitative and quantitative advance on pre-existing methods for the investigation of crop remains in pottery sherds, which hitherto have been reliant on surface impressions; it is non-destructive, provides higher resolution 3D imaging of organic inclusions, and enables greater archaeobotanical recovery of inclusions within a sherd. MicroCT analysis of ceramics, mudbrick and other building materials has considerable potential for improving the chronologies and resolution for the domestication of other cereals in the past.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeobotany 3adomestication 3amicro-computed tomography 3aspikelets 3aSudan 0aDomestication episode 0aSpikelet base 0aMicroCT visualisation 0aNeolithic1 aFuller, Dorian Q.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4859-080X1 aStevens, Chris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2669-57151 aChampion, Louis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0136-91361 aWinchell, Frank1 aDenham, Tim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8164-29900 tJournal of archaeological science.g2020 Nov., v. 123 p.105259-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2020.1052593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100006100192245006100253300001400314506007600328520111800404592002801522506003701550650002501587650002001612650001501632650001801647650001801665650001501683653001201698653002001710653001901730653000801749653001401757700001801771700001701789773010401806856008501910852000901995655001202004IND60609620220221207120010.0180823e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060962022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.09.0022doi7 aPMC56335232pmcid7 a288902722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattfeld, Ryan S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8116-275112aA comparison of bite size and BMI in a cafeteria setting  ap. 38-42.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOur study investigated the relationship between BMI and bite size in a cafeteria setting.

Bite weights were measured with a table embedded scale. Data were analyzed with ANOVAs, regressions, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, and a repeated measures general linear model for quartile analysis. Obese participants were found to take larger bites than both normal (p=0.002) and overweight participants (p=0.017). Average bite size increased by 0.20g per point increase in BMI. Food bites and drink bites were analyzed individually, showing 0.11g/BMI and 0.23g/BMI slopes, respectively. Quartiles of bites were also analyzed, and a significant interaction was found between normal and obese participants (p=0.034) such that the lower two quartiles were similar, but the upper two quartiles showed an increase in bite size for obese participants. The source of these effects could be the result of a combination of several uncontrolled factors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of variance 3abody mass index 3acafeterias 3adata analysis 3alinear models 3aoverweight 0aObesity 0aEating behavior 0aCalorie intake 0aBMI 0aBite size1 aMuth, Eric R.1 aHoover, Adam0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 181 p.38-42dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012900153300001800282520124600300592002801546650002501574650001401599650002001613650001901633650001101652650001301663650002401676650001101700650001401711650001701725650001101742700001701753700002101770773010501791856007501896852000901971655001201980IND60534128420221117171340.0160802e20141120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053412842DNAL7 a10.1021/ef50124622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayat, M.10aUltrapure Hydrogen Production via Dehydrogenation of Heavy Paraffin in a Linear Alkyl Benzenes Plant: Dynamic Modeling Study  ap. 7097-7108.  aNowadays, hydrogen is recognized as a clean fuel with the potential to meet future energy demand and the capability of diminishing reliance on fossil fuels. In the current work, a novel configuration for heavy paraffin dehydrogenation named as radial-flow membrane reactor (RF-MR) is proposed that combines a membrane concept with the radial-flow pattern for both sweep gas and paraffin feed. To provide this configuration, we divided the cross section area of the industrial radial-flow tubular reactor (RF-TR) into some subsections. Moreover, a system for hydrogen production is developed in this reactor based on separating hydrogen from the reaction side through a thin layer of Pd–Ag membrane, covering the gaps wall. Different major operational variables, including inlet molar flow rates of the reaction and permeation side streams, catalyst mass, H₂/HC molar ratio, and membrane thickness are numerically studied to evaluate the performance of RF-MR. Dynamic modeling results show an average 118.9 ton/day olefin production during 29 d of operation, which is a gain of 28.33% over an RF-TR, using the same catalyst loading and duty. Besides, the ultrapure hydrogen production rate of RF-MR in permeation side is ∼3.21 tons/day.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acatalysts 3adehydrogenation 3adynamic models 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aolefin 3apalladium 3aparaffin wax 3asilver1 aDehghani, Z.1 aRahimpour, M.

The pore properties of co-pyrolytic char were investigated via Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and fractal theory analyses. Synergistic effects were examined by comparing the experimental and theoretical product yields, gas compositions, and fractal dimensions (D) of residual char. Complex synergistic effects affecting product yield and gas composition were observed. Significant positive synergistic effects promoting gas formation were found with 50% PW mass ratio within the temperature scope of 800–1000 °C. In contrast, negative synergistic effects inhibited the formation of char and liquid products. The H₂ composition increased owing to the positive synergistic effects at a pyrolysis temperature of 1000 °C, whereas remarkable positive synergistic effects on CO generation were observed with 30% PW blending ratio from 600° to 700°C. PW promoted the specific surface area of co-pyrolytic char. The D values of co-pyrolytic char increased as the PW blending proportion was enlarged. Moreover, the D of residual char indicated higher values than the theoretical results. The higher content of volatile matter and the existence of alkali and alkaline-earth metals in PW were beneficial for forming mesopores and micropores with pore aperture of smaller than 10 nm, resulting in the complexity promotion of the pore structure. An exponential correlation between D and surface area was observed.

However, the 29 formally described species based on the combination of morphological traits and genetic diversity woefully underrepresented the overall species-level diversity recognized in the genus. In Trebouxia, reliable differentiation and characterization of the species-level lineages can be achieved by studying the diversity of key diagnostic features of pyrenoid ultrastructure and chloroplast morphology of axenically grown algal cultures. Here, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to analyze the pyrenoid and the chloroplast of 20 Trebouxia species-level lineages grown directly on solid agar medium and on cellulose-acetate discs laid over the agar medium. With the new, detailed morphoanatomical characterization of these species-level lineages, we reappraise Trebouxia taxonomy in light of the most recent phylogenetic delimitation provided by Muggia et al.

However, when large concentrations of ammonium are present the competition between microalgae and ammonium-oxidising bacteria plays a significant role. Microalgae use ammonium to synthesise proteins, photosynthetic pigments and nucleic acids, while ammonium-oxidising bacteria use it as a source of electrons and oxidise it to nitrite.Several authors have studied the isolated factors that influence microalgae-nitrifying bacteria competition, although a comprehensive analysis of this interesting topic is still lacking. This review makes an overall assessment of the competition between microalgae and ammonium-oxidising bacteriafor ammonium uptake, focusing on: I) factors that influence the competition; II) methods of measuring the activity and concentrations of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria; III) useful strategies to control nitrification to improve the performance of microalgae-based wastewater treatment systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acarbon dioxide 3amicroalgae 3anitrification 3aphotosynthesis 3aresearch 3awastewater treatment 0aCompetition 0aWastewater1 aAparicio, S.1 aPachés, M.1 aBorrás, L.1 aSeco, A.0 tAlgal research.g2022 Jan., v. 61 p.102563-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2021.1025633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245006900205300001100274520173800285592002802023650001302051650002802064650001302092650001202105650001002117650002402127650002602151650002402177650001902201650001502220650001102235650002102246650001302267700002002280700001802300700001902318700002202337773014302359856008302502852000902585655001202594IND60741345120221120174117.0211230e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074134512DNAL7 a10.1186/s12970-021-00443-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurner, Ollie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7931-504510aElite squash players nutrition knowledge and influencing factors  ap. 46.  aBACKGROUND: There is a reported mismatch between macronutrient consumption and contemporary macronutrient guidelines in elite standard squash players. Suboptimal dietary practices could be due to a lack of nutrition knowledge among players. Subsequently, the purpose of this study was to assess the sports nutrition knowledge of elite squash players through the Nutrition for Sport Knowledge Questionnaire (NSKQ) and provide an indication of whether players require nutrition support to increase their nutrition knowledge. METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed the nutrition knowledge of 77 elite squash players via the NSKQ over the period of June 2020 to August 2020. RESULTS: Players conveyed average nutrition knowledge with a mean NSKQ score of 48.78 ± 10.06 (56.07% ± 11.56%). There were no significant differences in NSKQ score between male and female players (p = .532). There was found to be a weak positive association between world ranking and NSKQ score (r = .208) and age and NSKQ score (r = .281). Players who had a relevant undergraduate degree (e.g. BSc Sport & Exercise Science) had significantly greater NSKQ score than players with no relevant qualifications (p = .022). Players who consulted a sports nutritionist to obtain their main source of nutrition information were shown to have significantly greater knowledge than those who acquired knowledge from a sports scientist (p = .01) or the internet / social media (p = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Players should consult with a sports nutritionist to increase their sport nutrition knowledge. Future research should quantify the effectiveness of a nutritional education intervention at increasing nutrition knowledge in players.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3across-sectional studies 3aexercise 3afemales 3amales 3anutrition education 3anutrition information 3anutrition knowledge 3aquestionnaires 3ascientists 3asports 3asports nutrition 3asquashes1 aMitchell, Nigel1 aRuddock, Alan1 aPurvis, Alison1 aRanchordas, Mayur0 tJournal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.g2021 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.46-46dBioMed CentralwJournal:21397x1550-27837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12970-021-00443-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009700169300001600266520105900282592002801341650001501369650002501384650002201409650002301431650001801454650003101472650001401503650002101517650000901538650001601547653002801563653002201591653002101613700002001634700001801654700001801672700001801690700001301708773011101721856008501832852000901917655001201926IND60680826720221119020615.0200110e20200217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068082672DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2019.15667422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, YuanHua10aSpectral and thermal analysis of Eucalyptus wood drying at different temperature and methods  ap. 313-320.  aIn order to better understand the chemical changes after wood drying, Eucalyptus wood was dried to an absolutely dry state following the five types of treatment: oven-dried at 60, 90, 120, and 150 °C, and vacuum freeze-dried. The tangential shrinkage rate () of oven-dried specimens was increased from 7.63 to 9.90% as treatment temperature was increased, and theof the specimen submitted to vacuum freeze drying was 7.40%, scoring close to the specimen oven-dried at 60 °C. The chemical characteristics and thermogravimetric analysis of the specimens were studied based on the drying results. Here, the results confirmed that vacuum freeze drying has little effect on the chemical composition of wood and showed that, for oven-dried samples, the chemical composition of wood varies with the drying temperature. Concerning crystallinity of the oven-dried specimens, it was decreased from 38.57 to 26.22% as the treatment temperature was incremented. In turn, the crystallinity of the specimen processed with vacuum freeze drying was the lowest one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3achemical composition 3acrystal structure 3adrying temperature 3afreeze drying 3aphysicochemical properties 3ashrinkage 3athermogravimetry 3awood 3awood drying 0aWood drying temperature 0aspectral analysis 0athermal analysis1 aGao, Zhenzhong,1 aHou, XianFeng1 aChen, ZhiYong1 aJiang, JianYi1 aSun, Jin0 tDrying technology.g2020 Feb. 17, v. 38, no. 3 p.313-320dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2019.15667423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03899naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245010100129300001600230520208600246592002802332650001902360650001502379650001502394650001502409650000902424650002602433650002202459650001002481650001702491650001202508650002702520650001602547650001502563650001502578650001302593650002102606650001202627650000902639650002002648650001202668650001902680650001102699650001902710650001802729650001102747650002302758650001302781651001002794653002502804653003402829653001202863653003402875700001802909700001802927700001802945700001802963700002402981700002703005700001803032773017803050852000903228655001203237IND60710193820221119130358.0200908e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071019382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, S.K.10aImpact of Improved Dryland Technologies on Crop Yields in a Microwatershed in Southern Rajasthan  ap. 131-141.  aRainfed agriculture is the main source of livelihood for farmers in the southern region of Rajasthan. Farmers in the semi arid zone have normally very few options in terms of crop choice. Maize is the dominant crop in the region. Due to low and erratic rainfall, poor fertility of soils and non adoption of improved land, water and crop management practices, productivity levels of different crops in rainfed areas are not encouraging. On-farm trials/were conducted during 2002 to 2006 to validate important dryland agriculture technologies in comparison to traditional practices in village Pathliyas (Mangrope watershed). Overall increase in crop production by use of improved seed over local seed of different crops ranged from 17.4 to 133.7 per cent. Supplemental irrigation through harvested rainwater in maize + blackgram (2:2) and groundnut + sesame (6:2) intercropping systems is most promising for enhancing productivity and higher B: C ratio under rainfed conditions. Maize + blackgram intercropping (2:2) system gave highest net returns (Rs. 8640 ha⁻¹) and B: C ratio (2.00) in comparison to sole and strip cropping of maize. Deep tillage + ridging 30 days after sowing + 100% recommended nitrogen through farm yard manure increased the grain yield of maize to the tune of 52.70 per cent as compared to farmer's practice. Gram + mustard intrcropping (sowing of mustard across the gram at 4 m. interval) gave the highest net return (Rs. 22824/- ha⁻¹) and B: C ratio (3.98) as compared to other methods of gram cultivation. Application of sulphur in groundnut was found beneficial and gave higher benefit-cost ratio (2.26) and net returns (Rs.11520 ha¹) as compared to control (1.88 and Rs. 7515 ha⁻¹). Improved technology increased the productivity of kharif and rabi crops to the tune of 18.4 to 51.77 and 35.2 to 48.4 per cent, respectively over the traditional practice of the farmers. Improved bio-diverse farming system was found more profitable over the traditional system of maize cropping with higher net returns (Rs. 3141 ha⁻¹) and B: C ratio (1.42).  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3aarid lands 3aarid zones 3ablack gram 3acorn 3acost benefit analysis 3acosts and returns 3acrops 3adeep tillage 3afarmers 3afertilizer application 3agrain yield 3airrigation 3alivelihood 3anitrogen 3aon-farm research 3apeanuts 3arain 3arainfed farming 3aridging 3asoil fertility 3asowing 3astrip cropping 3asubwatersheds 3asulfur 3asulfur fertilizers 3avillages 3aIndia 0aOperational research 0aImproved dryland technologies 0aRainfed 0aMaize based production system1 aKothari, A.K.1 aSharma, R.

Earlier, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) TMS ether was converted by trimethylsilyl bromide into the 10-β-bromide that with amine nucleophiles provided the amino-artemisinins. In an attempt to develop more economic approaches, direct N-glycosylation of DHA was examined but 2-deoxyartemisinin was invariably obtained. However, hydroxyl group activation by conversion into the 10β-halide in non-polar solvents with anhydrous HCl and Group I and II metal halides, oxalyl chloride or thionyl chloride with catalytic DMSO, and oxalyl bromide did succeed. The β-halides were converted in situ by thiomorpholine into artemiside, and by thiomorpholine-1,1-dioxide into artemisone respectively in scalable reactions. Hydrogen peroxide-acetonitrile or the urea-hydrogen peroxide complex efficiently oxidized the sulfide artemiside to the sulfone artemisone. Overall, a generalized approach to 10-alkylamino-artemisinins is now available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3abromides 3achlorides 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aglycosylation 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrogen 3alipophilicity 3amalaria 3amoieties 3aorganobromine compounds 3aorganochlorine compounds 3asolvents 3asulfides 0aMalaria 0aAntimalarial drugs 0aArtemisinins 0aN-glycosylation 0aAmino-artemisinins 0aArtemisone1 aWai Chan, Dennis Ho1 aLee, Kin Wo1 aTin, Wing Shan1 aWong, Ho Ning1 aHaynes, Richard K.0 tTetrahedron.g2018 Sept. 20, v. 74, no. 38 p.5156-5171dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2018.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245011800129300001600247520149700263592002801760650001901788650001501807650001001822650001701832650000901849650001001858650002401868650002801892650002601920650001601946650002401962650001301986650002001999650001402019650001502033650001402048650002102062650001502083650001202098650001002110650001102120650001802131650000902149653001502158653001302173653002402186653001002210653001602220653001502236700001602251773017802267852000902445655001202454IND60710193920221119130408.0200908e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071019392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Rahul10aEffect of Inorganics and Organics on Soil Characteristics and Crop Yield under Rainfed Maize Gobi Sarson Sequence  ap. 142-153.  aA field experiment on effect of inorganics and organics on soil characteristic and crop yield under rainfed Maize- Gobhi sarson sequence was conducted during 2006–07 and 2007 -08 at research farm of Dryland Research Sub Station, Rakh Diansar to develop suitable integrated nutrient supply system for Maize-Gobi sarson sequence. Results indicated that integrated application of inorganics and organics influenced the grain and straw yield of Maize and Gobi sarson crops significantly over chemical fertilizer alone. The highest grain yield (35.6 q ha⁻¹) and straw yield (106 q ha⁻¹) of maize were recorded under the treatments which received 50% N,P,K through inorganics and 50% through organics (vermicompost) along with 25kg sulphur + 5kg zinc and 1kg boron per ha as compared to the yield of control plots (18.7 and 54.6 q ha⁻¹). These values were at par with the application of farm yard manure. The residual effect of organics and S, Zn and B was also registered on succeeding gobhi sarson crop which produced 12.97 and 37.33 q ha⁻¹ seed yield and straw yield respectively. The incorporation of organic sources of nutrients considerably improved the soil characteristics. The bulk density decreased with increase in organic carbon and available N, P, K status of soil, where as no remarkable change in soil pH and EC was recorded. The values of nutrient uptake by maize - gobi sarson crops also showed significant increase under integrated application of organics inorganics  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3aarid lands 3aboron 3abulk density 3acorn 3acrops 3ademonstration farms 3aelectrical conductivity 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aresidual effects 3aseed yield 3asoil pH 3astraw 3asulfur 3avermicomposts 3azinc 0aInorganics 0aorganics 0asoil characteristic 0amaize 0agobi sarson 0acrop yield1 aSharma, M.P0 tIndian journal of dryland agricultural research and development.g2010 Dec., v. 25, no. 2 p.142-153dThe Indian Society of Dryland AgriculturewJournal:2079x2231-67017nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245004800170520123400218592002801452650002001480650001301500650001001513650002001523653002001543653001101563653001301574653002301587653002201610700001701632773009401649856008201743852000901825655001201834IND60750318920221120032923.0211030e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075031892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2021.1073442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSumikawa, Yasunobu10aAnnotated dataset of history-related tweets  aIn this article, we present a dataset containing history-related content obtained from social media. It contains hashtags and tweets that include these hashtags, as well as the results of third party tools applied to the tweets that include extracted entities, years, and url categories, and the categories for the history-related hashtags we used to crawl the tweets. We collected the tweets from Twitter official API using hashtag-based crawling. The crawling process had been performed from March 2016 to July 2018. During the crawling, we applied a bootstrapping approach which is an iterative process of collecting tweets using a small set of seed hashtags, and a manual inspection of newly acquired hashtags that co-occur with the seed hashtags to include those they are related to history. Finally, we collected 147 history-related hashtags and 2,370,252 tweets. We then defined 6 categories for the collected hashtags after their manual investigation. The presented dataset could be useful for further analysis on how people refer to history in Twitter, for collecting new history-related tweets, for training classifiers to detect history-related tweets, or for further investigations of the proposed hashtag categories.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aseed set 3aseeds 3asocial networks 0aDigital history 0aTweets 0aHashtags 0aHashtag categories 0aTemporal analysis1 aJatowt, Adam0 tData in Brief.g2021 Oct., v. 38 p.107344-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2021.1073443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245006800170300001600238520135900254592002801613650002101641650001401662650002301676650002601699650001301725650002201738650001601760651001401776773013201790856008201922852000902004655001202013IND60772307720221118103941.0220402e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077230772DNAL7 a10.1134/S20751117220101432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShalovenkov, N.

Depending on the scale of their distribution in the Black Sea, nonnative zoobenthos species are combined into three groups: (1) five species have spread over the entire sea shelf, (2) 35 species were found in several areas, and (3) 25 species were found only in one of the areas of the sea. Six areas of the Black Sea shelf have been identified (Varna–Burgas, Danube, Northwestern, Crimean, Caucasian, and Anatolian) in accordance with the seasonal and annual values of the thermohaline characteristics. The zoobenthos differed not only in quantity but also in the composition of nonnative species. The results of multivariate statistical analysis revealed a low level of similarity between these areas of the Black Sea shelf. The greatest similarity in the composition of alien zoobenthos species was observed for the Danube region to the Varna and Burgas bays, which border each other. The species composition of the alien species of the Caucasian shelf was more similar to the Varna–Burgas and Danube areas than to the neighboring Crimean and Anatolian areas. Spatial gradients of temperature and salinity form hydrological fronts of water masses, which are a kind of ecological barrier and can limit the natural exchange of alien species between shelf areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTurkey (country) 3ahydrology 3aintroduced species 3amultivariate analysis 3asalinity 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3aBlack Sea0 tRussian journal of biological invasions.g2022 Mar., v. 13, no. 1 p.123-139dPleiades PublishingwJournal:2272x2075-11177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S20751117220101433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012000206300001600326520195200342592002802294596002502322596003802347650002302385650002502408650001202433650002002445650002402465650001802489650001302507650001302520650001402533650001402547650002002561650001802581651001302599651001102612700002102623700002302644700002402667700001802691700002102709700002202730700002802752773013402780856008302914852000902997655001203006IND60755987120221119133346.0211216e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075598712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-021-02365-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuzemil, Sadik1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6424-372010aEvaluation of 20 enset (Ensete ventricosum) landraces for response to Xanthomonas vasicola pv. Musacearum infection  ap. 821-836.  aXanthomonas wilt, caused by Xanthomonas vasicola pv. musacearum (Xvm), formerly X. campestris pv. musacearum, is the most threatening and economically important disease of enset (Ensete ventricosum), the multipurpose food security crop orphan in south and southwestern Ethiopia. Xvm has also had a major impact on banana and plantain production in east Africa following its detection in Uganda in 2001 and subsequent spread. The only current effective control of this disease relies on integrated disease management strategies including minimizing field pathogen inoculum and deployment of wilt-resistant enset landraces. Identifying landraces with stable and durable Xvm resistance will greatly accelerate breeding programmes. While previous reports have identified landraces with varying degrees of tolerance to Xvm, no systematic study has collectively assessed their relative resistance. Here we undertook a detailed “common garden” analysis of 20 enset landraces previously reported to exhibit lower susceptibility to Xvm using an aggressive Xvm inoculum isolated from a disease hotspot area. Detailed longitudinal and survival analyses were applied to each landrace, using a combination of area-under-disease progress stairs, disease index and apparent infection rate to capture disease metrics as well as disease progression symptoms. Considerable variation was observed among the 20 landraces; however, none exhibited full immunity to Xvm infection. Landraces Haella, Mazia and Lemat showed the lowest susceptibility to Xvm as evidenced by reduced disease units and higher survival rates compared to the susceptible control landrace Arkiya, which exhibited the highest infection level and lowest survival rate, consistent with a high degree of susceptibility to Xvm. Thus, we have in this controlled experiment identified new material suitable for incorporation into future breeding programmes to develop Xvm-resistant enset varieties.  aPublisher supplied data  a727624chorizon 2020  aBB/GCRF-IAA/17/22cbbsrc gcrf-iaa 3aEnsete ventricosum 3aXanthomonas vasicola 3abananas 3adisease control 3adisease progression 3afood security 3aimmunity 3ainoculum 3alandraces 3apathogens 3aplant pathology 3asurvival rate 3aEthiopia 3aUganda1 aChala, Alemayehu1 aTesfaye, Bizuayehu1 aStudholme, David J.1 aGrant, Murray1 aYemataw, Zerihun1 aMekonin, Shiferaw1 aOlango, Temesgen Magule0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2021 Dec., v. 161, no. 4 p.821-836dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-021-02365-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03589naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013100164300001600295520109700311592002801408650002401436650001901460650001801479650001201497650001601509650002201525650001801547650001601565650002301581650001901604650002201623650001101645650002101656650002001677650004801697650002001745650000901765650001701774653000801791653000801799653000801807653000701815653000701822653001001829653001001839653000801849653000801857653000801865653000801873653000801881653001201889653001101901653001101912653000801923653001001931653003501941653003601976653003202012653003702044653005702081653004502138653004102183653003802224653004002262653002402302653002002326653002502346653002602371653002302397653003702420700001502457700001402472700001502486700001802501773011302519856008202632852000902714655001202723IND60573518120221119004801.0210311e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057351812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2017.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Wen-Bing10aPolysaccharides from Cyclocarya paliurus: Chemical composition and lipid-lowering effect on rats challenged with high-fat diet  ap. 262-273.  aThe present study was performed to analyse the chemical composition of Cyclocarya paliurus polysaccharides (CPP) and investigate their lipid-lowering effects on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hyperlipidaemic rats. CPP mainly consisted of two polysaccharides with an average molecular weight (MW) of 190.1 and 2.1kDa, as well as 67.8% total sugar, 19.23% uronic acid, 6.56% proteins, and six monosaccharides. CPP treatment markedly reduced the plasma glucose level, restored lipid profile changes, modulated the activities of hepatic lipid-related enzymes, suppressed hypertrophy of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and improved hepatic steatosis. In addition, CPP ameliorated glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, which could be attributed to the regulation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, PPARδ, and c-Cbl-associated protein (CAP) expression. The present findings suggest that CPP exhibit a lipid-lowering effect by regulating the activities of hepatic lipid metabolism-related enzymes and alleviating insulin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyclocarya paliurus 3aadipose tissue 3ablood glucose 3aenzymes 3afatty liver 3aglucose tolerance 3ahigh fat diet 3ahypertrophy 3ainsulin resistance 3alipemic effect 3alipid composition 3alipids 3amolecular weight 3amonosaccharides 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3apolysaccharides 3arats 3auronic acids 0aCPP 0aHFD 0aVAT 0aTC 0aTG 0aLDL-C 0aHDL-C 0aGLU 0aFAS 0aLPL 0aACC 0aHSL 0aC/EBPα 0aPPARγ 0aPPARδ 0aCAP 0aGAPDH 0aAcetic acid (PubChem CID: 176) 0aPicric acid (PubChem CID: 6954) 0aFormalin (PubChem CID: 712) 0aSimvastatin (PubChem CID: 54454) 0aSodium carboxymethylcellulose (PubChem CID: 6328154) 0aTrifluoroacetic acid (PubChem CID: 6422) 0aAcetic anhydride (PubChem CID: 7918) 0aSodium adize (PubChem CID: 33557) 0aSodium chloride (PubChem CID: 5234) 0aCyclocarya paliurus 0aPolysaccharides 0aChemical composition 0aLipid-lowering effect 0aInsulin resistance 0aLipid metabolism-related enzymes1 aZhao, Jing1 aChen, Hui1 aXiong, Lei1 aWang, Wen-Jun0 tJournal of functional foods.g2017 Sept., v. 36 p.262-273dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2017.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006000169300001800229520099900247592002801246650003101274650002301305650002001328650001401348650001901362650001601381650001101397650003101408650002201439650001201461651001001473653001601483653001201499653001601511653001401527653001501541700001701556773016701573856008601740852000901826655001201835IND60544406720221117215457.0190416e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054440672DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61125-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHUANG, Ji-kun10aConsumers' perceptions on GM food safety in urban China  ap. 2391-2400.  aThe debate about the safety of genetically modified (GM) food has attracted public attention in concurrence with the rapid development of agricultural biotechnology. This paper examines the consumers' perceptions on the safety of GM food in China. Based on a unique survey dataset, this study shows that consumers in urban China have significantly changed their perceptions on GM food safety. The percentage of consumers who perceived such food as unsafe for consumption increased by more than 30% in the 2002–2012 period. Approximately half of the consumers did not have an opinion on this issue. Major shifts have been occurred after 2010, likely because of the increasing influence of negative media reports on GM technology in recent years. Several individual and household's characteristics are shown to significantly affect consumers' perceptions on GM food safety, such as gender, education, food allergy experience and resident city size. The paper concludes with policy implications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural biotechnology 3aconsumer attitudes 3adata collection 3aeducation 3afood allergies 3afood safety 3agender 3agenetically modified foods 3aissues and policy 3asurveys 3aChina 0afood safety 0aGM food 0aurban China 0aconsumers 0aperception1 aPENG, Bo-wen0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2015 Nov., v. 14, no. 11 p.2391-2400dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61125-X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245012900209300001800338506007600356520139300432592002801825506003701853650002301890650002401913650002901937650001201966650001401978650001201992650001302004650001302017650001302030650000902043650001002052650001202062650000902074650000902083650001102092650002002103700001902123700002002142773011602162856008102278852000902359655001202368IND60580394320221207141426.0170916e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058039432DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2741-22doi7 aPMC56029682pmcid7 a289747902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrikaew, Benyapa10aInnovative production of fungal pulp from Trametes versicolor and its application in a fungal paper box containing clove oil  ap. 3058-3064.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aims of this study were to develop fungal pulp from Trametes versicolor (white-rot fungi) and apply it with clove oil in a paper box to inhibit mold growth on the surface of peanuts. Broken rice media with different sugar solutions (2–10% w w⁻¹) were prepared and then inoculated with T. versicolor mycelium at amounts from 0.5 to 1.5% w w⁻¹. Fungal pulp and commercial paper (50 g) at different ratios (100:0, 70:30, 50:50, 30:70 and 0:100) were mixed and prepared before being placed into a stainless box (5 cm long by 5 cm wide). For the antimicrobial activity against Aspergillus flavus on peanuts, a paper box was incorporated with 2.5, 5 and 7.5% w w⁻¹ of clove oil, eugenol, caryophyllene, and a combination of eugenol and caryophyllene at ratios of 7:1, 4:4, and 1:7. Results indicated that the highest fungal pulp biomass of T. versicolor in broken rice media was found when using 6% sugar with 1% mycelium inoculums. Fungal pulp and commercial paper at the ratio of 70:30 produced the highest value of hardness. The paper box containing clove oil at 7.5% w w⁻¹ inhibited A. flavus on peanuts for at least 28 days while the control had mold growth within 3 days. Combining eugenol and caryophyllene, the main components of clove oil, at the ratio of 7:1 (7.5% w w⁻¹) in the paper box should be a key factor to inhibit A. flavus during storage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspergillus flavus 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiomass 3aclove oil 3aeugenol 3ahardness 3ainoculum 3amycelium 3aoils 3apaper 3apeanuts 3apulp 3arice 3asugars 3awhite-rot fungi1 aMatan, Narumol1 aAewsiri, Tanong0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2017 Sept., v. 54, no. 10 p.3058-3064dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-017-2741-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245007900184300001600263520122000279592002801499650001501527650002101542650001501563650001601578650002101594650001401615650000901629650002601638650001001664650002801674650001301702650001401715650001301729650001101742650001401753650001201767700001701779700002001796773012501816856008201941852000902023655001202032IND60516749620221120211852.0190727e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051674962DNAL7 a247801582pmid7 a10.1017/S0022149X140002732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambert, K.A.10aDoes host immunity influence helminth egg hatchability in the environment?  ap. 446-452.  aTransmission success for helminths with free-living stages depends on the ability of eggs and larvae to develop and survive once in the environment. While environmental conditions are often suggested to influence egg phenology and hatching rate, immunity against parasite eggs might also play a role. We examined this hypothesis using the gastrointestinal helminths Trichostrongylus retortaeformis and Graphidium strigosum, two common infections of the European rabbit. Changes in egg hatching rate and volume were examined in relation to specific antibodies in the serum and bound to eggshells, using eggs shed in host faeces over a 15-week period. Hatching rate was consistently higher for T. retortaeformis than G. strigosum and no changes were observed between weeks. Egg volume increased for G. strigosum but decreased for T. retortaeformis. We did find evidence of egg-specific antibody responses and fewer antibodies were bound to eggs of T. retortaeformis compared to G. strigosum. Little to no association was found between antibodies and hatchability, or volume, for both helminths. We suggest that host antibodies play a relatively minor role in the egg hatching rate of these gastrointestinal helminths.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGraphidium 3aTrichostrongylus 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3aegg hatchability 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3aenvironmental factors 3afeces 3agastrointestinal system 3ahatching 3ahelminths 3aimmunity 3alarvae 3aphenology 3arabbits1 aPathak, A.K.1 aCattadori, I.M.0 tJournal of helminthology.g2015 July, v. 89, no. 4 p.446-452dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X140002733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02012naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245011800209300001600327506007600343520059500419592002801014506003701042650000801079650002001087650002001107650001101127650002301138650001501161653000901176653001301185653000901198653000801207653000801215653000801223653000701231653002601238653002501264653001001289700001801299700002001317700001801337773007301355856008101428852000901509655001201518IND60554950820221207082139.0170105s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055495082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fob.2015.09.0032doi7 aPMC45759542pmcid7 a265047392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Saori12aA novel method to analyze 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in CpG sequences using maintenance DNA methyltransferase, DNMT1  ap. 741-747.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHydroxymethylcytosine has been shown to be involved in DNA demethylation and gene expression.

One possibility is that many juveniles are lost at seeding because they are either impaired or killed by the process of transporting juveniles from collection sites to coastal nursery farms, or because they detach and move away from aquaculture substrata at, or soon after deployment, via secondary settlement behaviour. Three laboratory experiments were used to assess detachment of juvenile mussels from aquaculture substrates following periods of emersion for two batches of wild juveniles undergoing actual transport and one batch of hatchery-reared juveniles during simulated transport periods. The percentage of juveniles retained on their substrates (i.e., not detaching) after a two-minute immersion in seawater and the percentage of dead juveniles were quantified, as was the size of the mussels that were retained on, or detached from, their substrates. Detachment occurred in all experiments (16.9–53.8%) and was greater when the average size of the mussels was small (0.75 ± 0.01 mm). Across all the experiments, larger juvenile mussels were retained in greater numbers with mussels less than 1.75 mm in shell length having a greater propensity to detach from their substrates upon immersion. Very few mussels were dead at the end of the experiments and large proportions of mussels reattached in the aquaria, when given the opportunity. Together, the results of this study indicate that detachment of juvenile mussels is size-specific and driven by secondary settlement behaviour occurring upon or soon after (< 2 mins) immersion. New nursery techniques are required to grow small juvenile mussels to a size beyond which their migratory secondary settlement behaviour is reduced, so that they are less likely to detach upon or soon after immersion while seeding out to farm sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3ajuveniles 3amigratory behavior 3amollusc culture 3aseawater 3asowing 0aSeeding efficiency 0aPerna canaliculus 0aKaitaia spat 0aSecondary settlement1 aFloerl, Oliver1 aJeffs, Andrew G.0 tAquaculture.g2021 May 30, v. 538 p.736548-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7365483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01857naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012500165300001600290520082000306592002801126650001101154650002101165650001001186650001301196650001101209650000901220650001601229651002101245700002101266700001801287773012401305856008101429852000901510655001201519IND60123993720221117233810.0151123e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012399372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-015-1527-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasmaz, Merve10aDistribution and Accumulation of Selenium in Wild Plants Growing Naturally in the Gumuskoy (Kutahya) Mining Area, Turkey  ap. 598-603.  aThis study investigated selenium uptake and transport from the soil to 12 plant species in the mining area of Gumuskoy (Kutahya), Turkey.

Mean Se values in the soils, roots, and shoots of all plants were 0.9, 0.6, and 0.8 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. The mean enrichment coefficients for roots (ECR) and shoots (ECS) of these plants were 0.78 and 0.97. The mean translocation factors (TLF) were 1.33. These values indicate that all 12 plant species had the ability to transfer Se from the roots to the shoot, but that transfer was more efficient in plants with higher ECR and ECS. Therefore, these plants may be useful in phytoremediation in rehabilitating areas contaminated by Se because their ECR, ECS and TLFs are >1.  aPublisher supplied data 3amining 3aphytoremediation 3aroots 3aselenium 3ashoots 3asoil 3awild plants 3aTurkey (country)1 aAkgül, Bunyamin1 aSasmaz, Ahmet0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2015 May, v. 94, no. 5 p.598-603dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-015-1527-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002200150245013900172300001800311500000900329520150700338592002801845650001401873650001801887650001301905650003701918650001701955650002201972650002001994650002002014650003102034650002602065650002002091650001002111650002502121650002402146700002302170700001802193700001702211700002602228700001702254773013402271852000902405856008702414655001202501IND4403516220221122045928.0191228e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440351622DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2007.08.0434tpg2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaughan, Peter J.10aConstruction of an Amaranthus hypochondriacus Bacterial Artificial Chromosome Library and Genomic Sequencing of Herbicide Target Genes  ap. S-85-S-94.  aepub  aBefore the Spanish conquest of the ancient Americas, the grain amaranths (Amaranthus caudatus L., A. cruentus L., A. hypochondriacus L.) were a staple food of the New World. Recently, the grain amaranths have regained international attention for their nutritional quality and importance as a symbol of indigenous cultures. Here we report the development of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library constructed from the cultivar ‘Plainsman’ (A. hypochondriacus; 2n = 2x = 32). The library consists of a total of 36,864 clones with an average insert size of 147 kb with less than 1.8% of the clones containing empty vectors. The frequency of BAC clones carrying inserts derived from chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA was estimated to be 6.9%. Thus, based on a haploid genome size of 466 Mb per haploid nucleus, the BAC library coverage is approximately 10.6 times the haploid genome content. The genome coverage estimate was empirically confirmed by screening the library with seven low copy amaranth probe sequences. The utility of the amaranth BAC library was demonstrated by identification and full-length genomic sequencing of the acetolactate synthase and protoporphyrinogen oxidase genes—both major targets for several classes of important herbicides. The quality of the BAC library for BAC end sequencing projects was evaluated by bidirectional end sequencing of 384 random clones.

In 2009, three treatments were applied: unamended soil (untreated), soil amended with lime, and soil amended with lime + compost. For each field plot, main soil physico-chemical characteristics were determined (pH, organic matter, moisture content at field capacity and exchangeable Cu), while plant colonist development was assessed (plant cover and aboveground biomass). The same evaluation was carried out in 2015. A single application of amendments maintains a neutral pH after 6 years. Thus, neutralization of the soil acidity was stable over time. In 2009, lime + compost was the best treatment for increasing the plant cover. Although the soil organic matter content decreases in year 6, plant cover remained stable over time in this treatment. Incorporation of both organic matter and lime was pivotal at the beginning of the revegetation process, allowing the creation of a potentially self-sustaining ecosystem. No maintenance and/or additional application of amendments was required. Aboveground biomass showed differences between years, possibly explained by changes in climate conditions between 2009 and 2015, and/or changes in nutritional conditions (soil fertility) and plant competition. Plant biodiversity in year 6 was similar for all treatments. The long-term results of plant cover show lime and specially lime + compost as promising amendments to revegetate polluted soils of the Puchuncaví Valley.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneutralization 3acopper 3asoil pH 3acomposts 3asoil organic matter 3aaboveground biomass 3asoil degradation 3aland restoration 3aplant competition 3afield capacity 3aremediation 3aecosystems 3abiodiversity 3asoil fertility 3awater content 3apolluted soils 3aclimate 0aNatural attenuation 0aorganic matter 0aPuchuncaví valley 0aAided phytostabilisation 0aVentanas industrial complex 0aSoil remediation1 aMondaca, Pedro1 aCelis-Diez, Juan L.1 aGinocchio, Rosanna1 aNavarro-Villarroel, Claudia1 aNeaman, Alexander0 tGeoderma.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 331 p.81-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04077naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245015900206300001800365500001500383506007600398520209000474592002802564506003702592650003402629650002702663650001202690650003202702650001602734650002002750650001402770650001102784650001802795650001802813650001602831650002002847650002002867650001302887650001702900650002502917650001702942650001402959650001002973650001102983650001302994650001903007650001303026650001303039650001403052650001803066650000903084651001003093653001003103700002303113700002403136700001703160700002003177773011603197856008103313852000903394655001203403IND60580394720221207141430.0170916e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058039472DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2756-82doi7 aPMC56029812pmcid7 a289748032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGajera, H.

The fruit parts (pulp, seed, seed coat, kernel) of underutilized indigenous six black jamun landraces (Syzygium cumini L.), found in Gir forest region of India and differed in their fruit size, shape and weight, are evaluated and correlated with antidiabetic, DPPH radical scavenging and phenolic constituents. The α-amylase inhibitors propose an efficient antidiabetic strategy and the levels of postprandial hyperglycemia were lowered by restraining starch breakdown. The sequential solvent systems with ascending polarity—petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, methanol and water were performed for soxhlet extraction by hot percolation method and extractive yield was found maximum with methanolic fruit part extracts of six landraces. The methanolic extracts of fruit parts also evidenced higher antidiabetic activity and hence utilized for further characterization. Among the six landraces, pulp and kernel of BJLR-6 (very small, oblong fruits) evidenced maximum 53.8 and 98.2% inhibition of α-amylase activity, respectively. The seed attained inhibitory activity mostly contributed by the kernel fraction. The inhibition of DPPH radical scavenging activity was positively correlated with phenol constituents. An HPLC–PDA technique was used to quantify the seven individual phenolics. The seed and kernel of BJLR-6 exhibited higher individual phenolics—gallic, catechin, ellagic, ferulic acids and quercetin, whereas pulp evidenced higher with gallic acid and catechin as α-amylase inhibitors. The IC₅₀ value indicates concentration of fruit extracts exhibiting ≥50% inhibition on porcine pancreatic α-amylase (PPA) activity. The kernel fraction of BJLR6 evidenced lowest (8.3 µg ml⁻¹) IC₅₀ value followed by seed (12.9 µg ml⁻¹), seed coat (50.8 µg ml⁻¹) and pulp (270 µg ml⁻¹). The seed and kernel of BJLR-6 inhibited PPA at much lower concentrations than standard acarbose (24.7 µg ml⁻¹) considering good candidates for antidiabetic herbal formulations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3asolid phase extraction 3aforests 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3acorrelation 3aSyzygium cumini 3alandraces 3astarch 3aethyl acetate 3ahyperglycemia 3agallic acid 3aglycemic effect 3aenzyme activity 3acatechin 3aferulic acid 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aquercetin 3aswine 3afruits 3amethanol 3afruit extracts 3aacarbose 3asolvents 3aseed coat 3aalpha-amylase 3apulp 3aIndia 0aseeds1 aGevariya, Shila N.1 aHirpara, Darshna G.1 aPatel, S.

Rosa damascena (RD) is well known for its aromatic flowers. This aesthetic has led it to be used in the cosmetic industry to provide fragrances. Additionally, RD has been used as an herbal remedy for pharmacological conditions; it has not, however, been tested for its effect on photoaged skin. In this study, we investigated whether treatment with 50% ethanol RD extract induces a protective effect on photoaging. We found that RD impacted MMP transcription by suppressing AP-1 activation. Simultaneously, RD reversed the UV-induced reduction in Type 1 procollagen and TGF-β1 expression by regulating Smads. Finally, we observed a reduction in wrinkle formation after RD treatment on photoaging-induced hairless mice. Together, our findings indicate that RD may act as an effective anti-aging treatment if consumed as functional food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa damascena 3aaesthetics 3acollagen 3acosmetics 3aethanol 3aflowers 3afunctional foods 3ametalloproteinases 3amice 3aodors 3aphotoaging 3aprotective effect 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aPhotoaging 0aMMP-1 0aTGF-β 0aSmad 0aCollagen 0aRosa damascena1 aHwang, Eunson1 aSeo, Seul A.1 aZhang, Mengyang1 aPark, Sang Yong,1 aYi, Tae-Hoo0 tJournal of functional foods.g2017 Sept., v. 36 p.480-489dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2017.07.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245021100176300001600387520143300403592002801836596005801864650000801922650002501930650001601955650001601971650001801987650001402005650001102019650001802030650002002048650001102068650001202079650001602091700002602107700003302133700001902166700002302185773013402208856008302342852000902425655001202434IND60755987620221119133144.0211216e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075598762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-021-02366-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVithanage, I.

Anthracnose is a major disease in anthurium, known to be manifested as spadix rot and leaf spot, and caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides or its teleomorph, Glomerella cingulata. The objective of the present study was to describe spathe rot, a new disease, and identify Colletotrichum species associated with spathe rot, spadix rot and leaf spot, using multi-locus DNA sequence analyses. Diseased spathes were obtained from anthurium var. Tropical Red while the diseased spadix and leaves were from var. Hawaiian Butterfly. Colletotrichum was isolated from diseased spathe, spadix, and leaf on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) following surface sterilization. DNA, extracted from the isolates, was subjected to multigene DNA sequence analyses using ITS, β-tubulin and GAPDH. The two isolates from the spathe rot were identified as C. fructicola and C. orchidearum and the isolates from the spadix rot and leaf spot were identified as C. fruiticola and C. siamense respectively. Koch’s postulates were performed using C. fructicola and C. orchidearum, isolated from the spathe rot, and their pathogenicity was confirmed. The manuscript reports C. fructicola and C. orchidearum as the causal agents of the new disease, the spathe rot, and the association of C. fructicola and C. siamense with the spadix rot and leaf spot respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  aresearch grant RG/2014/37/ScUniversity of Peradeniya 3aDNA 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aanthracnose 3abutterflies 3aculture media 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathology 3aspadix 3aspathes 3ateleomorphs1 aYakandawala, D.

This study examined the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the rabbit leptin gene with growth traits, slaughter traits and physicochemical parameters of New Zealand White (NZW) and Belgian Giant Grey (BGG) crossbreed rabbits. In total, 320 crossbreed animals were genotyped for polymorphisms within exon 2—g.16081633T>C, intron 1_2—g.16081420C>T, and within UTR—g.16079636C>G for association analysis. Identified polymorphisms within rabbits leptin gene showed significant differences for dissectible fat percentage in carcass and dissectible fat weight in intermediate part (g.16081633T>C). Moreover, meat traits like protein content (g.16081633T>C; g.16079636C>G), intramuscular fat content (g.16081633T>C; g.16079636C>G, g.16081420C>T), dry matter (g.16081420C>T), ash (g.16081420C>T), water (g.16081420C>T), and cohesiveness (g.16081420C>T, g.16079636C>G) were affected by polymorphisms in leptin gene. We conclude that polymorphism in the rabbit leptin gene influences important carcass and meat traits of NZW × BGG crossbreeds. Therefore, polymorphisms identified in this study may be used in selection as a meat trait markers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcass quality 3acohesion 3acrossbreds 3aenergy balance 3aexons 3agenotyping 3agrowth traits 3aintramuscular fat 3aintrons 3aleptin 3ameat quality 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprotein content 3arabbit meat 3arabbits 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aslaughter 0aFatness traits 0ameat traits 0arabbits 0aSNPs1 aKozioł, Konrad,1 aPalka, Sylwia1 aMigdal, Wladyslaw1 aZabek, Tomasz1 aOtwinowska-Mindur, Agnieszka1 aMigdal, Anna1 aKmiecik, Michal1 aMaj, Dorota1 aBieniek, Józef,0 tAnimal biotechnology.g2018 Apr. 3, v. 29, no. 2 p.153-159dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl48639x1532-23787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10495398.2017.13478813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245010800163300001800271520148300289592002801772650002201800650001201822650001501834650002401849650001101873650001701884650002301901650000901924650001701933650001701950650001101967650000901978650001401987650002702001650001202028650001302040650001202053650001402065650001202079650002002091653001002111653001102121653000902132653003002141653001702171700001802188700001402206700001502220700001902235700002102254700001602275700002002291700001502311700001902326773016702345856008602512852000902598655001202607IND60544407220221117215050.0190416e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054440722DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61130-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPAN, Yu12aA maize bundle sheath defective mutation mapped on chromosome 1 between SSR markers umc1395 and umc1603  ap. 1949-1957.  aThe bsd-pg (bundle sheath defective pale green) mutant is a novel maize mutation, controlled by a single recessive gene, which was isolated from offspring of maize plantlets regenerated from tissue callus of the maize inbred line 501. The characterization was that the biogenesis and development of the chloroplasts was mainly interfered in bundle sheath cells rather than in mesophyll cells. For mapping the bsd-pg, an F2 population was derived from a cross between the mutant bsd-pg and an inbred line Xianzao 17. Using specific locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-Seq) technology, a total of 5 783 polymorphic SLAFs were analysed with 1 771 homozygous alleles between maternal and paternal parents. There were 49 SLAFs, which had a ratio of paternal to maternal alleles of 2:1 in bulked normal lines, and three trait-related candidate regions were obtained on chromosome 1 with a size of 3.945 Mb. For the fine mapping, new simple sequence repeats (SSRs) markers were designed by utilizing information of the B73 genome and the candidate regions were localized a size of 850 934 bp on chromosome 1 between umc1603 and umc1395, including 35 candidate genes. These results provide a foundation for the cloning of bsd-pg by map-based strategy, which is essential for revealing the functional differentiation and coordination of the two cell types, and helps to elucidate a comprehensive understanding of the C4 photosynthesis pathway and related processes in maize leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 photosynthesis 3aalleles 3abiogenesis 3abundle sheath cells 3acallus 3achloroplasts 3achromosome mapping 3acorn 3ahomozygosity 3ainbred lines 3aleaves 3aloci 3amesophyll 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amutants 3amutation 3aparents 3aplantlets 3aprogeny 3arecessive genes 0amaize 0absd-pg 0aSLAF 0aSSR assossiation analysis 0afine mapping1 aCHEN, Xu-qing1 aXie, Hua,1 aDeng, Lei,1 aLI, Xiang-long1 aZHANG, Xiao-dong1 aHAN, Li-xin1 aYANG, Feng-ping1 aXue, Jing,1 aZHANG, Li-quan0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2015 Oct., v. 14, no. 10 p.1949-1957dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61130-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245009500213300001600308500001900324520143700343592002801780650002401808650001101832650001401843650001301857650001301870650001101883650001701894650001101911653004001922653001501962653002701977653003202004700001802036700002302054700002302077700001902100773010002119856008502219852000902304655001202313IND60725828320221119062526.0210320e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072582832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.01.1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Katherine T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8584-557610aGraphene synthesized by chemical vapor deposition as a hydrogen isotope permeation barrier  ap. 106-117.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis work presents the results of gas concentration driven deuterium permeation experiments through chemical vapor deposited graphene on copper. Since the graphene is synthesized directly onto the copper, the permeation experiments are able to be performed over a large area (16.62 mm²) without the detrimental impact of transfer-induced tears and holes. Thus, permeation through intrinsic defects of the graphene are probed. The graphene-coated copper shows a reduction in permeation by a factor of ∼28 compared to copper alone. The permeation results are modeled with a composite permeation model. The permeation of copper alone is shown to be proportional to the square root of pressure, whereas the permeation through graphene samples is proportional to pressure. The graphene permeance follows an Arrhenius behavior. The room temperature pore permeation coefficients for the small and large grain graphene samples are ∼7.0 × 10⁻²⁸±5.0 × 10⁻²⁸ and ∼1.9 × 10⁻²⁷±1.4 × 10⁻²⁷ mol s⁻¹ MPa⁻¹, respectively. These results suggest that grain boundaries are not the main diffusion pathways, and instead other intrinsic defects in the graphene demonstrate less resistance to permeation. This study advances the fundamental understanding of the intrinsic permeation of chemical vapor deposited graphene, as well as the use of graphene in hydrogen isotope permeation barrier applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acopper 3adeuterium 3agraphene 3aisotopes 3amodels 3apermeability 3avapors 0aHydrogen isotope permeation barrier 0aPermeation 0aGas permeation barrier 0aPermeation reduction factor1 aSmith, Colter1 aKrentz, Timothy M.1 aHitchcock, Dale A.1 aVogel, Eric M.0 tCarbon.g2021 May, v. 176 p.106-117dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.01.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013700167300001600304520102100320592002801341650004101369650002201410650001201432650001201444650001101456650001501467650002901482650001501511650001701526650001701543650000901560650001201569650001801581650001101599650001401610650001101624650002301635650001801658650000901676651001101685700002501696700002401721700002801745700002601773700002501799700002501824773012401849856008101973852000902054655001202063IND60123994120221117234725.0151123e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012399412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-015-1473-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPáez-Osuna, F.10aHeavy Metals in Waters and Suspended Sediments Affected by a Mine Tailing Spill in the Upper San Lorenzo River, Northwestern México  ap. 583-588.  aConcentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), silver (Ag) and zinc (Zn) were evaluated in water and suspended sediments of the upper waters of San Lorenzo River in NW Mexico following a mine tailing spill.

For these materials to be used in unsound infrastructure protections, they are required to present enhanced robustness while bearing functionalities to meet multiple uses. Single-function coating is not smart enough to provide satisfactory protection, and the preparation process of multifunctional materials is complex, costly, and provides poor durability. Thus, existing coatings are not suitable to generate an intelligent closed-loop protection system. Herein, we report an innovative 5S multifunctional intelligent coating (5SC) for existing construction materials with superdurable, superhydrophobic, self-monitoring, self-heating, and self-healing properties. The 5SC material showed highly durable superhydrophobic properties as revealed by the main failure tests of building materials including physical friction (abrasion, scratching), 100% tensile strain, photoaging (3000 h of ultraviolet (UV) aging), acid corrosion (concentrated hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid), and freeze–thaw aging (salty solution). The coated surface was highly sensitive to pressure, with monitoring thresholds from 1 to 30 000 N per 0.01 m². It showed an early heating rate as high as 6 °C/min while maintaining very good self-monitoring and ice-melting drainage performance to protect the existing structures. This novel composite material is suitable for constructions in extreme areas where corrosion and freeze–thaw damage can occur. This multifunctional material presents a very broad range of applications and development potential in the construction field.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acomposite materials 3aconstruction materials 3acorrosion 3adrainage 3adurability 3aengineering 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afriction 3aheat 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrophobicity 3ainfrastructure 3amonitoring 3aphotoaging 3asulfuric acid 3atensile strength 0asuperhydrophobic 0aself-heating 0aself-healing 0adurable1 aQian, Jiajia1 aZhang, Yunsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5630-45701 aJia, Yantao1 aNi, Henmei1 aPang, Sze Dai1 aLiu, Guojian1 aQian, Rusheng1 aShe, Wei1 aYang, Lin1 aLiu, Zhiyong0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 July 18, v. 11, no. 32 p.29242-29254dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b083033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245009500175300001600270520166100286592002801947650002101975650001301996650001602009650001902025650002202044650003802066650001302104650001002117650002102127650001802148650001302166650001402179650001002193650001302203650001102216650001002227650001702237650003702254700001902291700003202310773012002342856008202462852000902544655001202553IND60638155920221122043256.0190425e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063815592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-019-02667-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhodashenas, Shabanali12aA cell ELISA based method for exosome detection in diagnostic and therapeutic applications  ap. 523-531.  aOBJECTIVE: Exosomes are nano-scaled carriers of miRNA, mRNA and proteins which are secreted from viable cells. Exosome detection within serum, saliva and semen offers diagnostic value for detection of various diseases including cancer. In the present study, we have lunched an in vitro study to develop a more efficient method for exosome detection. In this regard, the recombinant LAMP-DARPins (capable of Her2 targeting) gene was packed within the lentiviral particles and stably transferred into the HEK293T cells. The morphology and sizes of the obtained exosomes were characterized by TEM and zeta sizer. The expression of LAMP-DARPins antigen on the exosome surface was verified by western blotting. Ultimately, the efficiency of cell surface ELISA in suspension method was examined for exosome detection. RESULTS: The exosome particles were successfully harvested and purified from transfected cells. The sizes of exosome particles were determined to be 90 nm using zeta sizer instrument. The TEM scan showed that the exosomes are cap like shaped and their sizes range between 40 and 150 nm. An observed 120 kDa band on western blotting paper indicated the LAMP-DARPins antigen expression on exosome surfaces. The results of cell surface ELISA in suspension method were superior to the results of conventional cell ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: It could be concluded that the cell surface ELISA in suspension method could be an amenable method to detect exosome particles within the biological samples. Moreover, the method could be modified to evaluate the ability of exosomes to interact with target cells in both diagnostic and therapeutic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3acell viability 3adisease diagnosis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aexosomes 3agenes 3ain vitro studies 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasms 3apaper 3aproteins 3asaliva 3asemen 3atherapeutics 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aKhalili, Saeed1 aForouzandeh Moghadam, Mehdi0 tBiotechnology letters.g2019 May, v. 41, no. 4-5 p.523-531dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-019-02667-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245017300162300001800335520114700353592002801500650005701528650002101585650002501606650001401631650001801645650001001663650002101673650001801694650001201712650001101724650002901735650001601764650004301780700001301823700001201836700001801848700001701866773010401883856008101987852000902068655001202077IND60439360420221120134348.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043936042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-015-1875-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yuejun10aRegulation analysis of AcMNPV-mediated expression of a Chinese scorpion neurotoxin under the IE1, P10 and PH promoter in vivo and its use as a potential bio-insecticide  ap. 1929-1936.  aOBJECTIVE: To analyze the regulation mechanism of AcMNPV (Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus)—mediated expression of BmK IT under IE1, P10 and PH promoters in the larva of Heliothis armigera..

TdT-UTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed the degree of apoptotic cell death in the midgut tissue of AcMNPV-BmK IT-transfected insect larvae was higher than that in the AcMNPV treatment group at 8 h post-infection. The time–effect relationship between the insect’s humoral immunity and regulation of promoters was confirmed in the phenoloxidase activity assay. CONCLUSION: The anti-insect mechanism and regulation of different promoters in AcMNPV-BmK IT at molecular and cellular levels provide an experimental basis for the development of recombinant baculovirus biopesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAutographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aButhus martensii 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aapoptosis 3abiopesticides 3agenes 3ahumoral immunity 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3amidgut 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aneurotoxins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction1 aLi, Xing1 aDu, Jun1 aZheng, Shuhua1 aLiang, Aihua0 tBiotechnology letters.g2015 Oct., v. 37, no. 10 p.1929-1936dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-015-1875-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04478naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006300152245012300215300001400338520232200352592002802674650000802702650001702710650001702727650002502744650001802769650001502787650001502802650001502817650002602832650001902858650001002877650002202887650003002909650001902939650001502958650001402973650001202987650001002999650001303009650002003022650001203042650003703054650001503091650001703106650001803123650002503141650001903166650001203185651001203197653002003209653002103229653002903250653001803279653003703297653001303334653002403347700002403371700005603395700001603451700002003467700005903487700002003546773009403566856008703660852000903747655001203756IND60605191320221121230629.0190613e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060519132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchlüter, Steffen,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3140-905810aLong-term effects of conventional and reduced tillage on soil structure, soil ecological and soil hydraulic properties  ap. 10-19.  aThere is a long-lasting debate about the effects of tillage practices on soil structure and structure-mediated ecosystem properties like hydraulic conductivity and crop productivity. This is investigated in a long-term field experiment on tillage practices at the Westerfeld trial in Bernburg, Germany (25 years of different management). Here we combine soil structure information obtained by X-ray microtomography with bulk properties like bulk density, air capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity, as well as integrative, ecological properties like earthworm abundance and crop yield. This study goes beyond previous studies in that the soil microstructure is investigated in two different depths, within (13–23 cm) and underneath (28–38 cm) the plow horizon. Furthermore the microstructure is investigated at two different resolutions (60 μm and 20 μm) by employing a nested sampling design.The plowed horizon in the conventional tillage plots differs from the undisturbed soil underneath the cultivator depth (13–23 cm) in the reduced tillage plot by lower bulk density, higher air capacity, higher saturated hydraulic conductivity, higher macroporosity and pore connectivity. After 25 years of reduced tillage saturated hydraulic conductivity only marginally recovered in the abandoned plow pan (28–38 cm). Macropore density and connectivity did not change significantly as compared to the current plow pan under conventional tillage. The topsoil underneath the cultivator depth in the reduced tillage plot developed a “no-till pan”, as porosity and pore connectivity where smaller than in greater soil depths. Image-based macroporosity and laboratory-based air capacity showed good agreement.Overall, the combination of hydraulic measurements and X-ray CT imaging of soil microstructure at different resolutions provides a comprehensive view on soil structure modification by tillage practices. The change from conventional to reduced tillage led to a compaction of soil that was not compensated by higher bioturbation as reported for other sites. This is explained by unfavorable conditions for anecic earthworms (frequent dry periods with severely impaired penetrability of the loess substrate) as well as the absence of very deep rooting, perennial crops in crop rotation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abioturbation 3abulk density 3aconventional tillage 3acrop rotation 3acrop yield 3aearthworms 3aecosystems 3afield experimentation 3aimage analysis 3aloess 3along term effects 3amicro-computed tomography 3amicrostructure 3aperennials 3aplow pans 3aplowing 3aplows 3aporosity 3areduced tillage 3arooting 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil depth 3asoil ecology 3asoil horizons 3asoil micromorphology 3asoil structure 3atopsoil 3aGermany 0aTillage effects 0aX-ray tomography 0aConservation agriculture 0aMacroporosity 0aSaturated hydraulic conductivity 0aPlow pan 0aEarthworm abundance1 aGroßmann, Caroline1 aDiel, Julius1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4663-08361 aWu, Gi-Mick1 aTischer, Sabine1 aDeubel, Annette1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5504-30811 aRücknagel, Jan0 tGeoderma.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 332 p.10-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015600165520224000321592002802561650001602589650000902605650002002614650001102634650001602645650001602661651001102677653002702688653003102715653001402746653001102760700002502771773011302796856008202909852000902991655001203000IND60646659320221122133833.0190725e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064665932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2019.1049722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasas, Lluís10aInvestigating the expected archaeomagnetic dating precision in Europe: A temporal and spatial analysis based on the SCHA.DIF.3K geomagnetic field model  aArchaeomagnetic dating is a chronometric dating technique, based on the ability of baked clay archaeological structures and artifacts to acquire a thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) when heated at high temperatures and cooled in the presence of the Earth's magnetic field. The precision of archaeomagnetic dating depends on several factors, among others the availability of a detailed reference secular variation (SV) curve for a given territory. In this study, we investigate the precision that archaeomagnetic dating can reach in Europe. We used the SCHA.DIF.3K European geomagnetic field model to calculate the dating uncertainties for the last 3000 years, taking into consideration only the uncertainties depending on the change rate of the geomagnetic field in the past and the reference SV curve's uncertainty envelope. Such uncertainties were calculated both in time and space, they are usually asymmetrically distributed around the considered year and it have been represented as dynamic maps of uncertainties. The obtained results show that archaeomagnetic dating based solely on directional data (declination and inclination) can be very precise for the last four centuries, with total uncertainties being almost always lower than 100 years all around Europe. Inherent dating uncertainties are also low for the last millennium, with values ranging from 50 to 300 years. These results underline the great potential of archaeomagnetism on dating baked clays belonging to the last 1000 years. For older periods, the uncertainty maps show that the dating precision may importantly vary from place to place, but with local non-symmetric uncertainty ranges generally below 400 years. The obtained maps also show that adding the intensity to the computation of the inherent uncertainties does not always reduce the uncertainty. The temporal and spatial analysis presented here does not give the total dating imprecision of archaeomagnetic dating (that definitely depends on numerous, often uncontrollable, factors), but aims at offering a useful tool to archaeomagnetic and archaeological research to check the feasibility of archaeomagnetic dating for determining the age of an archaeological structure below a desired precision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3aclay 3amagnetic fields 3amodels 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3aEurope 0aArchaeomagnetic dating 0aGeomagnetic field modeling 0aPrecision 0aEurope1 aTema, E.q(Evdokia),0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2019 Aug., v. 108 p.104972-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2019.1049723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011100157520188600268592002802154650001202182650001502194650002702209650001402236650004302250650001602293650001602309650001902325650000902344650001702353650002202370650001502392650001502407700001502422700001702437700001502454700001902469700001702488700001502505700001402520700002402534773012802558856007502686852000902761655001202770IND60703943020221120140425.0200722e20200404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070394302DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120711582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiang 10aSpectral Response Assessment of Moss-Dominated Biological Soil Crust Coverage Under Dry and Wet Conditions  aBiological soil crusts (BSCs) are a major functional vegetation unit, covering extensive parts of drylands worldwide. Therefore, several multispectral indices have been proposed to map the spatial distribution and coverage of BSCs. BSCs are composed of poikilohydric organisms, the activity of which is sensitive to water availability. However, studies on dry and wet BSCs have seldom considered the mixed coverage gradient that is representative of actual field conditions. In this study, in situ spectral data and photographs of 136 pairs of dry and wet plots were collected to determine the influence of moisture conditions on BSC coverage detection. Then, BSC spectral reflectance and continuum removal (CR) reflectance responses to wetting were analyzed. Finally, the responses of four commonly used indices (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); crust index (CI); biological soil crust index (BSCI); and band depth of absorption feature after CR in the red band, (BD_red)), calculated from in situ hyperspectral data resampled to two multispectral data channels (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2), were compared in dry and wet conditions. The results indicate that: (i) on average, the estimated BSC coverage using red-green-blue (RGB) images is 14.98% higher in wet than in dry conditions (P < 0.001); (ii) CR reflectance features of wet BSCs are more obvious than those of dry BSCs in both red and red-edge bands; and (iii) NDVI, CI, and BSCI for BSC coverage of 0%–60% under dry and wet conditions are close to those of dry and wet bare sand, respectively. NDVI and BD_red cannot separate dead wood and BSC with low coverage. This study demonstrates that low-coverage moss-dominated BSC is not easily detected by the four indices. In the future, remote-sensing data obtained during the rainy season with red and red-edge bands should be considered to detect BSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aarid lands 3abiological soil crusts 3adead wood 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphotographs 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asand 3aspatial data 3aspectral analysis 3avegetation 3awet season1 aWang, Tao 1 aLiu, Shulin 1 aPeng, Fei 1 aKang, Wenping 1 aGuo, Zichen 1 aFeng, Kun 1 aLiu, Jia 1 aTsunekawa, Atsushi 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Apr. 04, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120711583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014900165300001600314520086200330592002801192596005101220650002701271650002101298650001701319650002101336650000701357700001701364700001601381700005901397700002001456700001501476773012001491856008201611852000901693655001201702IND60638156020221121052641.0190425e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063815602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-019-02665-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Yun-Feng10aEnzymatic transformation of ginsenosides Re, Rg1, and Rf to ginsenosides Rg2 and aglycon PPT by using β-glucosidase from Thermotoga neapolitana  ap. 613-623.  aOBJECTIVES: To enzymatically transform protopanaxatriol by using β-glucosidase from Thermotoga neapolitana (T. neapolitana) DSM 4359.

The objective of this work was to determine if satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) vineyard images could be used to compute optimal spatially explicit sampling protocols for determining fruit maturation and quality, and minimize the number of locations physically sampled in a vineyard. An algorithm was designed to process Landsat images to locate three consecutive pixels that best represent the three quantile means representing the left tail, center, and right tail of the NDVI pixel population of a vineyard block. This new method (NDVI3) was compared to a commonly used method (CM8) and random sampling (R20) in 13 and 16 vineyard blocks in 2016 and 2017, respectively, in the Central Valley of California. Both NDVI3 and CM8 were highly correlated with R20 in pairwise comparisons of soluble sugars, pH, titratable acidity, and total anthocyanins. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests indicated that NDVI pixels sampled via the NDVI3 method generally better represented the block population than pixels selected by CM8 or R20. Analysis of 24 blocks over a 3-year period indicated that sampling solutions were temporally stable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3aanthocyanins 3afruits 3agrapes 3agrowing season 3aimage analysis 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apH 3aremote sensing 3asugars 3atitratable acidity 3avineyards 3aCentral Valley of California1 aDokoozlian, Nick 1 aRyan, Casey 1 aBioni, Cella 1 aVanden Heuvel, Justine  E.0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Apr. 04, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120711593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009400170300001600264520154600280592002801826650001901854650001701873650002201890650000901912650001301921650001201934650001901946650003101965650002001996650001002016650001102026650003202037650001902069700002002088773011902108856008202227852000902309655001202318IND60620027520221122140635.0181105e195507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062002752DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517555025007012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvin, Victor S.10aService Fading of Disperse Dyestuffs by Chemical Agents Other than the Oxides of Nitrogen  ap. 571-583.  aAn extensive trial of acetate drapery fabrics dyed with new "gas-fast" blues has shown that active agents in the atmosphere, in addition to the oxides of nitrogen, can cause fading in service. This fading is oxidative in nature. It has been reproduced by an accelerated laboratory test in which fabrics have been exposed to concentrations of ozone somewhat higher than those ordinarily found in the atmosphere. This type of fading has been designated as "O-fading." All of the disperse blue dyes and some of the reds and yellows have been found to be subject to O-fading. However, the major problem is with the blues. Anthraquinone blues are bleached by O-fading without the reddening associated with gas fading. The O-fading can be inhibited by antioxidants such as the gas-fading inhibitor diphenyl ethylene diamine and the nongas-fading inhibitor p-octyl phenol. For optimum re sistance to both forms of atmospheric fading, acetate fabrics dyed with disperse blues, including gas-fast blues, should be processed with inhibitors. Laboratory tests have shown that O-fading takes place on Dacron¹ as well as on acetate and Arnel.² With Arnel and Dacron, a marked increase in resistance to O-fading is obtained on heat treatment. The penetration of the dye into the fiber is a factor in O-fading behavior, as evidenced by the increase in resistance to O-fading of Dacron fabrics dyed with carrier and by the effect of heat treatment. Optimum resistance to atmospheric fading of Arnel is obtained by the use of inhibitor plus heat treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthraquinones 3aantioxidants 3acellulose acetate 3adyes 3aethylene 3afabrics 3aheat treatment 3alaboratory experimentation 3anitrogen oxides 3aozone 3aphenol 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3atextile fibers1 aWalker, Ruth A.0 tTextile research journal.g1955 July, v. 25, no. 7 p.571-583dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517555025007013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100006100185245009700246300002000343506007600363520123800439592002801677506003701705650002401742650001901766650001701785650001601802650001101818650001301829650001801842650001401860650001301874650002801887653002301915653002001938653000801958653001801966700002301984700002402007700002502031700006002056700005702116700006102173773014202234856007802376852000902454655001202463IND60656437520221207084708.0190814e20190719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065643752DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b083862doi7 aPMC70390412pmcid7 a313219732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouché, Mathilde1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2707-129010aActivatable Hybrid Polyphosphazene-AuNP Nanoprobe for ROS Detection by Bimodal PA/CT Imaging  ap. 28648-28656.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOverproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is often related to inflammation or cancer and can cause tissue damage. Probes that have been previously reported to image ROS typically rely on imaging techniques that have low depth penetration in tissue, thus limiting their use to superficial disease sites. We report herein a novel formulation of hybrid nanogels loaded with gold nanoparticles (AuNP) to produce contrast for computed tomography (CT) and photoacoustics (PA), both being deep-tissue imaging techniques. The polyphosphazene polymer has been designed to selectively degrade upon ROS exposure, which triggers a switch-off of the PA signal by AuNP disassembly. This ROS-triggered degradation of the nanoprobes leads to a significant decrease in the PA contrast, thus allowing ratiometric ROS imaging by comparing the PA to CT signal. Furthermore, ROS imaging using these nanoprobes was applied to an in vitro model of inflammation, that is, LPS-stimulated macrophages, where ROS-triggered disassembly of the nanoprobe was confirmed via reduction of the PA signal. In summary, these hybrid nanoprobes are a novel responsive imaging agent that have the potential to image ROS overproduction by comparing PA to CT contrast.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomputed tomography 3aimage analysis 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amodels 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apolymers 3areactive oxygen species 0agold nanoparticles 0apolyphosphazene 0aROS 0aphotoacoustic1 aPühringer, Manuel1 aIturmendi, Aitziber1 aAmirshaghaghi, Ahmad1 aTsourkas, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7758-17531 aTeasdale, Ian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5953-90841 aCormode, David P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8391-95000 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 July 19, v. 11, no. 32 p.28648-28656dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b083863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010800166300001600274520137500290592002801665650001501693650001101708650002001719650002401739653001901763653001101782653003201793653001601825653001901841653000801860700001801868773009001886856008501976852000902061655001202070IND60607861320221120053129.0180830e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060786132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrahimi, F.10aBlade dynamical response based on aeroelastic analysis of fluid structure interaction in turbomachinery  ap. 986-995.  aThe flow around airfoils being an energy tank; instabilities are then possible, leading often to dangerous vibratory levels. In order to predict and control aeroelastic instabilities, this investigation aims to provide a detailed understanding of the flow interaction within the complex geometry of moving blades cascade. Among the working parameters, we consider the effect of the pressure rate on the blades aeroelastic instabilities under an unsteady compressible flow. We investigate the consequences of the airfoil motion onto the aerodynamic performances, the energy transfer between the flow and the structure and the aerodynamic stability. The nonlinear aeroelastic model is based on a dynamic fluid code, a structure code and a weak coupling algorithm. Numerical simulations are conducted in three airfoil situations: fixed, pitching and free motions. The simulation results show that the pressure rate has an effect on the blade aeroelastic instabilities, their amplitude and their type: flutter and limit cycle oscillations (LCOs). The oscillation amplitude and the energy transferred to the airfoil increase more rapidly as the pressure rate increases. These instabilities have significant effects on the aerodynamic loads. Analysing the energy exchange and the aerodynamic work, we note that the aerodynamic stability is very sensible to the pressure ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ablades 3aenergy transfer 3amathematical models 0aAeroelasticity 0aEnergy 0aFluid-structure interaction 0aInstability 0aTurbomachinery 0aCFD1 aOuibrahim, A.0 tEnergy.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 115 p.986-995dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245015200163300002000315520158900335592002801924650001301952650001801965650002501983650001602008650001102024650001302035650001102048650002302059650001202082650001502094650001302109653001302122653002002135653002402155653002302179653002402202700002002226700002502246700002402271773012602295856008002421852000902501655001202510IND60569776720221120143759.0170610e20170607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056977672DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b147862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhowmik, Rahul10aPrediction of the Wetting Behavior of Active and Hole-Transport Layers for Printed Flexible Electronic Devices Using Molecular Dynamics Simulations  ap. 19269-19277.  aMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to predict the wetting behavior of materials typical of active and hole-transport layers in organic electronics by evaluating their contact angles and adhesion energies. The active layer (AL) here consists of a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and phenyl-C₆₁-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM), whereas the hole-transport layer (HTL) consists of a blend of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Simulations of the wetting of these surfaces by multiple solvents show that formamide, glycerol, and water droplet contact angle trends correlate with experimental values. However, droplet simulations on surfaces are computationally expensive and would be impractical for routine use in printed electronics and other applications. As an alternative, contact angle measurements can be related to adhesion energy, which can be calculated more quickly and easily from simulations and has been shown to correlate with contact angles. Calculations of adhesion energy for 16 different solvents were used to rapidly predict the wetting behavior of solvents on the AL and HTL surfaces. Among the tested solvents, pentane and hexane exhibit low and similar adhesion energy on both of the surfaces considered. This result suggests that among the tested solvents, pentane and hexane exhibit strong potential as orthogonal solvent in printing electronic materials onto HTL and AL materials. The simulation results further show that MD can accelerate the evaluation of processing parameters for printed electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acontact angle 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3aglycerol 3ahexane 3amolecular dynamics 3apentane 3aprediction 3asolvents 0adroplets 0asurface wetting 0aprinted electronics 0amolecular dynamics 0aorthogonal solvents1 aBerry, Rajiv J.1 aDurstock, Michael F.1 aLeever, Benjamin J.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 June 07, v. 9, no. 22 p.19269-19277dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b147863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03471naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100003100192245008700223500001900310506007600329520180600405592002802211506003702239650001502276650001502291650002402306650001702330650001502347650001602362650001902378650002102397650001902418650001602437650002402453650000902477650001902486653001702505653002202522653002302544653002102567653003402588653002402622700002802646700002502674700002002699700002302719773009202742856008602834852000902920655001202929IND60690889120221207123836.0201230e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069088912DNAL7 a311935322pmid7 aPMC65367262pmcid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e017742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeerawattanapong, Nipaporn10aBlood leukocyte LINE-1 hypomethylation and oxidative stress in knee osteoarthritis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aJoints inflammation is one of the most pathologic processes leading to the development of osteoarthritis (OA), possibly leading to genomic instability. LINE-1 is transposable elements, and alterations in LINE-1 methylation induced by 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) can cause genomic instability contributing to OA development. Herein, the present study examined associations between LINE-1 methylation, 8-OHdG, and knee OA severity.LINE-1 methylation levels were measured in 104 knee OA patients and 96 healthy controls by quantitative combined bisulfite restriction analysis. 8–OHdG was investigated by ELISA. The knee OA severity was appraised by questionnaires (VAS, WOMAC, KOOS, and lequesne index) and radiological severity based on the grading of Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) standard criteria.Blood leukocyte LINE-1 methylation levels were significantly lower in knee OA patients than in healthy controls. Interestingly, individuals with LINE-1 hypomethylation were significantly associated with an elevated risk of knee OA. Linear regression analysis revealed that LINE-1 methylation was independently associated with KL grading of knee OA. Furthermore, plasma 8–OHdG levels in OA cases were not significantly different from those in healthy volunteers, whereas synovial fluid 8–OHdG values were considerably higher than in paired plasma specimens of the OA subjects.This study demonstrated that LINE-1 hypomethylation in blood leukocytes was associated with increased risk and radiographic severity of knee OA, and increased synovial fluid 8–OHdG levels were observed in knee OA patients. Collectively, LINE-1 hypomethylation and elevated 8–OHdG could emerge as biomarkers indicating the severity of knee OA and may take a possible part in the pathological process of knee OA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomarkers 3abisulfites 3agenetic instability 3ainflammation 3aleukocytes 3amethylation 3aosteoarthritis 3aoxidative stress 3aquestionnaires 3aradiography 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asynovial fluid 0aBiochemistry 0aMolecular biology 0aLINE-1 methylation 0aBlood leukocytes 0a8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine 0aKnee osteoarthritis1 aUdomsinprasert, Wanvisa1 aNgarmukos, Srihatach1 aTanavalee, Aree1 aHonsawek, Sittisak0 tHeliyon.g2019 May, v. 5, no. 5 p.e01774-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e017743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008200175520162100257592002801878650002001906650001301926650002101939650001501960650001801975653002601993653003202019653002702051653004802078700002002126773011202146856008602258852000902344655001202353IND60683677720221120074416.0200412e20200520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068367772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Bernardi, Chiara10aEntrepreneurial behaviour: Getting eco-drunk by feeling environmental passion  aThe antecedents of entrepreneurial behaviours with an orientation toward the natural environment are attracting academic interest. At this point, however, little is known about the relationship between environmental passion, environmental identity and environmental entrepreneurial behaviours. This paper is aimed at understanding how unique emotions that feed environmental passion impact on the development of entrepreneurs’ identities and behaviours. With this goal in mind, a qualitative inductive study of 22 entrepreneurs was conducted using the Italian wine industry as a research setting, and their histories were analysed. The findings suggest that environmental passion does affect entrepreneurial behaviours and that different levels of passion lead to different identities and behaviours. Thus, the results prove that entrepreneurial behaviours with an environmental orientation are passion- and identity-relevant. The interviews revealed that they do not make decisions in a calculating manner, but rather apply criteria related to their passions and identities. The study results show that entrepreneurs that have an intense passion for the natural environment develop an environmental identity, which in turn leads to entrepreneurial behaviours with a stronger environmental orientation. These significant findings open interesting avenues for future research, such as the analysis of the studied relationships under a family business lens. The research also offers practical implications for helping managers develop an alternative perspective to that of traditional economy-oriented entrepreneurs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aemotions 3aentrepreneurship 3ainterviews 3awine industry 0aEnvironmental passion 0aEnvironmental self-identity 0aEnvironmental identity 0aPro-environmental entrepreneurial behaviour1 aPedrini, Matteo0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 May 20, v. 256 p.120367-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245010900210300002000319506007600339520145100415592002801866506003701894650004301931650002501974650002601999650001602025650001302041650001902054650002102073650001702094650001302111650000902124650002502133650001802158650001402176653002002190653002602210700002202236700002202258700001902280700001702299700002002316700002202336700002302358700002202381700001802403700001902421700001402440700002102454700002002475773017602495856007902671852000902750655001202759IND60178670820221207091147.0150604e20140729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017867082DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13230251112doi7 aPMC41218122pmcid7 a250241992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSampson, Timothy R.12aA CRISPR-Cas system enhances envelope integrity mediating antibiotic resistance and inflammasome evasion  ap. 11163-11168.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aClustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats–CRISPR associated (CRISPR-Cas) systems defend bacteria against foreign nucleic acids, such as during bacteriophage infection and transformation, processes which cause envelope stress. It is unclear if these machineries enhance membrane integrity to combat this stress. Here, we show that the Cas9-dependent CRISPR-Cas system of the intracellular bacterial pathogen Francisella novicida is involved in enhancing envelope integrity through the regulation of a bacterial lipoprotein. This action ultimately provides increased resistance to numerous membrane stressors, including antibiotics. We further find that this previously unappreciated function of Cas9 is critical during infection, as it promotes evasion of the host innate immune absent in melanoma 2/apoptosis associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (AIM2/ASC) inflammasome. Interestingly, the attenuation of the cas9 mutant is complemented only in mice lacking both the AIM2/ASC inflammasome and the bacterial lipoprotein sensor Toll-like receptor 2, but not in single knockout mice, demonstrating that Cas9 is essential for evasion of both pathways. These data represent a paradigm shift in our understanding of the function of CRISPR-Cas systems as regulators of bacterial physiology and provide a framework with which to investigate the roles of these systems in myriad bacteria, including pathogens and commensals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFrancisella tularensis subsp. novicida 3aToll-like receptor 2 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3aknockout mutants 3alipoproteins 3amelanoma 3amice 3amicrobial physiology 3anucleic acids 3apathogens 0agene regulation 0ainnate immune evasion1 aNapier, Brooke A.1 aSchroeder, Max R.1 aLouwen, Rogier1 aZhao, Jinshi1 aChin, Chui-Yoke1 aRatner, Hannah K.1 aLlewellyn, Anna C.1 aJones, Crystal L.1 aLaroui, Hamed1 aMerlin, Didier1 aZhou, Pei1 aEndtz, Hubert P.1 aWeiss, David S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 July 29, v. 111, no. 30 p.11163-11168dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13230251113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245018200165300001600347520109300363592002801456650001201484650002001496650001201516650002301528650003101551650001501582650001401597650001601611700005901627773013301686856008001819852000901899655001201908IND60627170120221118022720.0190128e20181210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062717012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b074462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuroki, Nahoko10aApplicability of Effective Fragment Potential Version 2-Molecular Dynamics (EFP2-MD) Simulations for Predicting Dynamic Liquid Properties Including the Supercritical Fluid Phase  ap. 194-200.  aEffective fragment potential version 2-molecular dynamics (EFP2-MD) simulations, where the EFP2 is a polarizable force field based on ab initio electronic structure calculations, were applied to predict the static and dynamic liquid properties of compressed liquid NH₃. By analyzing the temperature dependence of the radial distribution function, the autocorrelation functions of velocity (Cᵥ(t)) and reorientation (Cᵣ(t)), and the self-diffusion constant, we clarified that the ab initio EFP2 force field can effectively describe the properties of compressed liquids. These descriptions can be performed with at least semiquantitative accuracy and at a sufficiently low computational cost. In the EFP2-MD protocol, no force field training is required. This training is mandatory when simulating liquid properties with classical MD techniques (especially in extreme conditions with high pressures and temperatures). EFP2-MD is a promising technique for predicting the physicochemical properties of novel functional compressed liquids, including supercritical fluid phase properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aautocorrelation 3aliquids 3aphysical chemistry 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprediction 3aprotocols 3atemperature1 aMori, Hirotoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7662-96360 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Dec. 10, v. 123, no. 1 p.194-200dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b074463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001900187245009500206300001600301506007600317520237000393592002802763506003702791650002002828650001702848650002002865650002302885650001502908650002202923650002402945650002302969700001802992700005903010773013303069856008003202852000903282655001203291IND60627170220221207140903.0190128e20181203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062717022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b074652doi7 aPMC68001262pmcid7 a305071992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFirman, Taylor10aMaximum Caliber Can Build and Infer Models of Oscillation in a Three-Gene Feedback Network  ap. 343-355.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSingle-cell protein expression time trajectories provide rich temporal data quantifying cellular variability and its role in dictating fitness. However, theoretical models to analyze and fully extract information from these measurements remain limited for three reasons: (i) gene expression profiles are noisy, rendering models of averages inapplicable, (ii) experiments typically measure only a few protein species while leaving other molecular actors—necessary to build traditional bottom-up models—unnoticed, and (iii) measured data are in fluorescence, not particle number. We recently addressed these challenges in an alternate top-down approach using the principle of Maximum Caliber (MaxCal) to model genetic switches with one and two protein species. In the present work we address scalability and broader applicability of MaxCal by extending to a three-gene (A, B, C) feedback network that exhibits oscillation, commonly known as the repressilator. We test MaxCal’s inferential power by using synthetic data of noisy protein number time traces—serving as a proxy for experimental data—generated from a known underlying model. We notice that the minimal MaxCal model—accounting for production, degradation, and only one type of symmetric coupling between all three species—reasonably infers several underlying features of the circuit such as the effective production rate, degradation rate, frequency of oscillation, and protein number distribution. Next, we build models of higher complexity including different levels of coupling between A, B, and C and rigorously assess their relative performance. While the minimal model (with four parameters) performs remarkably well, we note that the most complex model (with six parameters) allowing all possible forms of crosstalk between A, B, and C slightly improves prediction of rates, but avoids ad hoc assumption of all the other models. It is also the model of choice based on Bayesian information criteria. We further analyzed time trajectories in arbitrary fluorescence (using synthetic trajectories) to mimic realistic data. We conclude that even with a three-protein system including both fluorescence noise and intrinsic gene expression fluctuations, MaxCal can faithfully infer underlying details of the network, opening future directions to model other network motifs with many species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3aphysical chemistry 3aprediction 3aprotein synthesis 3asingle cell protein 3atheoretical models1 aAmgalan, Anar1 aGhosh, Kingshuk1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4976-09860 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Dec. 03, v. 123, no. 2 p.343-355dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b074653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100003400192245009800226500001900324506007600343520094500419592002801364506003701392650002701429650001101456650001801467650001701485650001901502651001701521653001301538653003401551653004901585653003001634773009301664856008501757852000901842655001201851IND60690889420221207123824.0200508e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069088942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e019322doi7 aPMC66119202pmcid7 a313170792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIredele, Oluwamayowa Olalekan10aExamining the association between quality of integrated reports and corporate characteristics  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper examines the quality of integrated reports of listed firms in South Africa and the associated factors. Data were obtained from a sample comprising 100 firm-year observations of 20 companies in Johannesburg Stock Exchange over the period (2013–2017). Analysis of data involves descriptive statistics, spearman rank correlation analysis and Kruskal-Wallis H test. The result shows a significant relationship between the quality and length of integrated reports. Firms vary in the level of quality of their integrated reports on the account of differences in profitability, board size, gender and firm size. No significant relationship was found between quality of integrated reports and leverage. The result of this study indicates that the length of the integrated report signals the level of quality of such report, which may be necessary in disclosing all material matters to satisfy the needs of a wide range of stakeholders.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adescriptive statistics 3agender 3aprofitability 3astakeholders 3astock exchange 3aSouth Africa 0aBusiness 0aQuality of integrated reports 0aInternational integrated reporting framework 0aCorporate characteristics0 tHeliyon.g2019 July, v. 5, no. 7 p.e01932-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e019323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245013000179300001600309520142100325592002801746650001501774650001001789650001101799650001701810653001501827653002401842653001901866653001701885653001201902653002501914700002301939773011001962856008702072852000902159655001202168IND60634394820221119190904.0200210e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063439482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2019.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Giesen, Roxanne I.10aToo ugly, but I love its shape: Reducing food waste of suboptimal products with authenticity (and sustainability) positioning  ap. 249-259.  aIn the societal change towards a more sustainable future, reducing food waste is one of the mostly discussed topics. One significant source of food waste is the reluctance of supply chains and consumers to sell, purchase, or consume products that deviate from optimal products on the basis of only cosmetic specifications. Yet, it is currently unclear how consumers can be motivated to purchase such suboptimal products. The present research suggests that presenting suboptimal products with a sustainability positioning or with an authenticity positioning can positively affect consumers’ purchase intentions and quality perceptions of suboptimal products. Two studies (total N = 1804) presenting suboptimal products with a sustainability positioning, an authenticity positioning, or no positioning under varying price levels reveal that especially authenticity positioning can increase purchase intentions for and quality perceptions of suboptimal products independent of the prices of suboptimal products. A sustainability positioning appears to work best when combined with a moderate price discount. Moreover, the findings show that respondents have lower intentions to waste suboptimal foods when a clear positioning is provided compared to when this is not provided. Together, these findings provide a constructive first step towards a more sustainable solution for the suboptimal product waste problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood waste 3afoods 3aprices 3asupply chain 0aFood waste 0aSuboptimal products 0aSustainability 0aAuthenticity 0aPricing 0aMarketing strategies1 ade Hooge, Ilona E.0 tFood quality and preference.g2019 July, v. 75 p.249-259dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2019.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001500184242009800199245012200297300001600419506007600435520154100511592002802052506003702080650002502117650001402142650000902156650001302165650001402178650001602192650001402208650002002222650002102242650003602263650002202299650001802321650001802339650001602357650001202373650001002385650002002395650001102415650001302426650001702439650001202456650001302468650003602481650003202517700001802549700002102567700001602588700002102604700001802625700001302643700001702656773011602673856007702789852000902866655001202875IND60572905320221207100255.0170724e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057290532DNAL7 a10.1631/jzus.B16000782doi7 aPMC51726002pmcid7 a279214012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Lin10a大豆异黄酮对饲喂氧化鱼油新生仔猪肠道抗氧化功能及细胞因子的影响10aEffects of soybean isoflavone on intestinal antioxidant capacity and cytokines in young piglets fed oxidized fish oil  ap. 965-974.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo investigate the effect of glycitein, a synthetic soybean isoflavone (ISF), on the intestinal antioxidant capacity, morphology, and cytokine content in young piglets fed oxidized fish oil, 72 4-d-old male piglets were assigned to three treatments. The control group was fed a basal diet containing fresh fish oil, and the other two groups received the same diet except for the substitution with the same dosage of oxidized fish oil alone or with ISF (oxidized fish oil plus ISF). After 21 d of feeding, supplementation of oxidized fish oil increased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-2 (IL-2), nuclear factor κ B (NF-κB), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), NO, and Caspase-3 in jejunal mucosa, and decreased the villous height in duodenum and the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and IL-4 in the jejunal mucosa compared with supplementation with fresh oil. The addition of oxidized fish oil plus ISF partially alleviated this negative effect. The addition of oxidized fish oil plus ISF increased the villous height and levels of sIgA and IL-4 in jejunal mucosa, but decreased the levels of IL-1β and IL-2 in jejunal mucosa (P<0.05) compared with oxidized fish oil. Collectively, these results show that dietary supplementation of ISF could partly alleviate the negative effect of oxidized fish oil by improving the intestinal morphology as well as the antioxidant capacity and immune function in young piglets.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidant activity 3acaspase-3 3adiet 3aduodenum 3afish oils 3aglutathione 3aglycitein 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin A 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-4 3aisoflavones 3ajejunum 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amucosa 3anecrosis 3anitric oxide 3apiglets 3asoybeans 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aMa, Xian-yong1 aJiang, Zong-yong1 aHu, You-jun1 aZheng, Chun-tian1 aYang, Xue-fen1 aWang, Li1 aGao, Kai-guo0 tJournal of Zhejiang University.g2016 Dec., v. 17, no. 12 p.965-974dZhejiang University Pressx1673-15817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1631/jzus.B16000783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245013300168300001600301520077700317592002801094650001801122650001301140650002901153650000901182650001701191650001401208650001201222650001901234653003701253653002301290653003501313700001601348700001901364700001801383700002401401700002301425700002101448700002201469700002901491773013901520856007901659852000901738655001201747IND60720268520221119191745.0210822e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026852DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2013-01012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaworski, Sławomir10aComparison of tumour morphology and structure from U87 and U118 glioma cells cultured on chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane  ap. 593-598.  aThe objective of this study was the morphological and structural characterisation of glioblastoma multiforme grown in ovo. Glioma cells U87 and U118 were implanted in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chicken egg. After 10 days of incubation, tumours were resected for further analyses. Culturing two types of glioblastoma tumours from U87 and U118 cell lines has shown a number of differences in their morphology, histology, and ultrastructure. CAM assay proved to be a useful tool for studying glioblastoma growth. The model provides an excellent alternative to current rodent models and could serve as a preclinical screening assay for anticancer molecules. It might increase the speed and efficacy of the development of new drugs for the treatment of glioblastoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3achick embryos 3achickens 3achorioallantoic membrane 3aeggs 3aglioblastoma 3ahistology 3arodents 3aultrastructure 0aextended glioblastoma multiforme 0aU87 and U118 cells 0achorioallantoic membrane model1 aSawosz, Ewa1 aGrodzik, Marta1 aKutwin, Marta1 aWierzbicki, Mateusz1 aWłodyga, Karolina1 aJasik, Agnieszka1 aReichert, Michał1 aChwalibog, A.q(André),0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 57, no. 4 p.593-598dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2013-01013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01105naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245006900165300001600234520027600250592002800526650001200554650001600566650001600582651001200598773014600610856007400756852000900830655001200839IND60695936620221118235833.0200520e19961129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069593662DNAL7 a10.3372/wi.26.26092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLye, Kåre Arnstein,12aA new species of Cyperus subg.

They include reduction of ROS formation, cell death and cardiometabolic abnormalities. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of the underlying signaling mechanisms involved in cardioprotection afforded by MA. Isolated perfused working rat hearts subjected to global ischemia and anaesthetized rats in vivo exposed to LAD coronary artery occlusion were used. Myocardial infarct size, cell membrane damage, cardiac dysfunction and metabolic state of the heart were used as indices of I/R injury at the end of reperfusion. Administration of specific inhibitors of MEK1/2, PI3K, NO synthase (NOS) or the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K⁺ (mito KATP) channels (UO126, LY294002, L-NAME or 5-hydroxydecanoate, respectively) reduced protective efficacy of MA in both models of I/R injury. This was evidenced by abrogation of infarct size limitation, deterioration of cardiac function recovery, and attenuation of metabolic restoration and sarcolemmal integrity. An enhancement of functional and metabolic recovery in isolated reperfused hearts treated with MA was suppressed by U-73122, chelerythrine, amiloride or KB-R7943 (inhibitors of phospholipase С (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC), Na⁺/H⁺ or Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchange, respectively). Additionally, co-infusion of MA with amiloride or L-NAME reduced the integrity of cell membranes at early reperfusion compared with the effect of peptide alone. In conclusion, cardioprotection with MA is mediated by signaling via PLC and survival kinases, PKC, PI3K, and MEK1/2, with activation of downstream targets, NOS and mito KATP channels, and the sarcolemmal Na⁺/H⁺ and Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchangers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiac output 3acardioprotective effect 3acell membranes 3acoronary vessels 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aheart 3ainfarction 3amitochondria 3amodels 3amyocardial infarction 3anitric oxide synthase 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphospholipases 3apotassium 3aprotein kinase C 3aprotons 3arats 3asignal transduction 3asodium 0aStructural analogue of apelin-12 0aSignal transduction 0aIschemia/reperfusion injury 0aCardioprotection1 aShulzhenko, Valentin S.1 aStudneva, Irina M.1 aSerebryakova, Larisa I.1 aPelogeykina, Yulia A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4189-232X1 aVeselova, Oxana M.0 tPeptides.g2015 Nov., v. 73 p.67-76dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2015.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014700168300001800315520158500333592002801918596006401946596006002010650004402070650004102114650001302155650001402168650001102182650001402193700002002207700003302227700002402260700002202284700002002306700002702326700001902353773014802372856008102520852000902601655001202610IND60604936620221119002150.0180718e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060493662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1185-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKappler, Andrea,10aComparison of μ-ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and py-GCMS as identification tools for microplastic particles and fibers isolated from river sediments  ap. 5313-5327.  aIn recent years, many studies on the analysis of microplastics (MP) in environmental samples have been published. These studies are hardly comparable due to different sampling, sample preparation, as well as identification and quantification techniques. Here, MP identification is one of the crucial pitfalls. Visual identification approaches using morphological criteria alone often lead to significant errors, being especially true for MP fibers. Reliable, chemical structure-based identification methods are indispensable. In this context, the frequently used vibrational spectroscopic techniques but also thermoanalytical methods are established. However, no critical comparison of these fundamentally different approaches has ever been carried out with regard to analyzing MP in environmental samples. In this blind study, we investigated 27 single MP particles and fibers of unknown material isolated from river sediments. Successively micro-attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (μ-ATR-FTIR) and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (py-GCMS) in combination with thermochemolysis were applied. Both methods differentiated between plastic vs. non-plastic in the same way in 26 cases, with 19 particles and fibers (22 after re-evaluation) identified as the same polymer type. To illustrate the different approaches and emphasize the complementarity of their information content, we exemplarily provide a detailed comparison of four particles and three fibers and a critical discussion of advantages and disadvantages of both methods.  aPublisher supplied data  aBMBF 03F0734DcBundesministerium für Bildung and Forschung  agrant number SAW-2014-IOW-2cGerman Leibniz Association 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aplastics 3apyrolysis 3arivers 3asediments1 aFischer, Marten1 aScholz-Böttcher, Barbara M.1 aOberbeckmann, Sonja1 aLabrenz, Matthias1 aFischer, Dieter1 aEichhorn, Klaus-Jochen1 aVoit, Brigitte0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2018 Aug., v. 410, no. 21 p.5313-5327dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-018-1185-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245007700161300001600238520110100254592002801355650001901383650001801402650001701420650001701437650001501454650001701469650001601486650001301502650002101515650001101536650002601547650001801573650000901591650001701600650001601617650002001633650001701653650001401670653002101684653001701705653001501722653001001737653001801747700001701765700002901782773013901811856007901950852000902029655001202038IND60720268620221119191810.0210822e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026862DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2013-01022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadko, Lidia10aInfluence of fluoroquinolones on viability of Balb/c 3T3 and HepG2 cells  ap. 599-606.  aThe cytotoxic potential of fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, difloxacin, sarafloxacin, danofloxacin, norfloxacin and marbofloxacin) was investigated using mouse fibroblasts Balb/c 3T3 and human hepatoma HepG2 cell lines. The cells were exposed for 24, 48, and 72 h to drugs at eight concentrations ranged from 0.78 to 100 μg/mL. Four independent cytotoxicity assays were applied, in which various endpoints were assessed: mitochondrial activity - MTT reduction, lysosomal activity - neutral red uptake, total protein content, and cellular membrane integrity - lactate dehydrogenase release. Mean effective cytotoxic concentrations (EC₅₀) calculated at different time points from concentration-response curves ranged from 10 to 100 μg/mL. The most affected endpoint in both cell lines was mitochondrial activity. The EC₅₀₋MTT₋₇₂ ₕ <10 μg/mL was found for difloxacin, marbofloxacin (fibroblasts), sarafloxacin, and norfloxacin (HepG2).

We have previously grown Apostichopus japonicus triploids with a growth advantage. The body length, body weight, and aestivation time of triploid and diploid A. japonicus were measured in this study, and the transcriptome and metabolome were used to examine the growth advantage of triploids A. japonicus. The results showed that the proportion of triploid A. japonicus with a body length of 6–12 cm and 12–18 cm was significantly higher than that of diploid A. japonicus, and triploid A. japonicus had a shorter aestivation time (39 days) than diploid (63 days). We discovered 3296 differentially expressed genes (DEGs); 13 DEGs (for example, cyclin-dependent kinase 2) related to growth advantage, immune regulation, and energy storage were screened as potential candidates. According to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, DEGs were significantly enriched in the cytoplasm (cellular component), ATP binding process (molecular function), oxidation–reduction process (biological process), and other pathways. According to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment data, DEGs were significantly enriched in ribosome production and other areas. We discovered 414 significant differential metabolites (SDMs), with 11 important SDMs (for example, nocodazole) linked to a growth advantage. SDMs are significantly enriched in metabolic pathways, as well as other pathways, according to the KEGG enrichment results. According to a combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis, 6 DEGs have regulatory relationships with 11 SDMs, which act on 11 metabolic pathways together. Our results further enrich the biological data of triploid A. japonicus and provide useful resources for genetic improvement of this species.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.31772849cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aDL201901cLiaoning Provincial Department of Education in 2019  aLT2019003cProgram for Liaoning Innovative Research Team in University  a2020RD03cHigh-level talent support grant for innovation in Dalian 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aaquaculture 3abiotechnology 3abody length 3abody weight 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3adiploidy 3aenergy 3aestivation 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenetic improvement 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3aribosomes 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atriploidy1 aSun, Yi1 aCao, Yue1 aHan, Lingshu1 aLi, Yuanxin1 aDing, Beichen1 aGao, Chuang1 aHao, Pengfei1 aJin, Xin1 aChzhan, I︠A︡t︠s︡in,1 aSong, Jian1 aYin, Donghong1 aDing, Jun0 tMarine biotechnology.g2022 Feb., v. 24, no. 1 p.151-162dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870069x1436-22287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-022-10093-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011500168300001600283520110800299592002801407650002201435650001501457650001501472650001501487650001101502650002201513650003501535650001201570650001101582650001001593650001401603650001801617650000701635650003301642650002701675653002701702653001101729653000901740700001901749700001701768700001801785773011601803856008601919852000902005655001202014IND60551902020221116161125.0161019e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055190202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.03.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Haixia,10aOne-step synthesis of CDTA coated magnetic nanoparticles for selective removal of Cu(II) from aqueous solution  ap. 209-214.  aA novel 1,2-cyclohexylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid (CDTA) modified Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) was synthesized by one-step solvothermal method and used as solid phase extraction (SPE) material to preconcentrate trace copper coupled with flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS).

The optimum conditions for the absorption process were investigated on several commonly tested experimental parameters such as pH of the solution, ultrasound time, sample volume, concentration and volume of elution solution. The influences of some anions and cations on the recoveries of Cu(II) ions were also investigated, and no considerable interference was observed. The maximum adsorption capacity of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles and CDTA modified Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles were found to be 27.50mg/g and 78.24mg/g for Cu(II).

The preparation of sample was achieved by liquid–liquid extraction with tertiary butyl methyl ether. The analysis was performed on a reversed-phase C₁₈column (1.7 µm, 2.1 × 30 mm) using acetonitrile: 0.1% formic acid (80:20, v/v) as the mobile phase and pumped in an isocratic mode at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min using citalopram (CIT) as an internal standard. Tandem mass spectrometric detection was carried out by both positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) in the multiple-reaction monitoring mode (MRM). The analysis was carried out within 1 min for each sample which made it possible to analyze more than 350 human samples per day. Validation of the method was performed according to FDA guidelines for bio-analytical method. The method was found to be linear in the range of 25–2500 ng/mL and 100–10,000 ng/mL for DAN and PAR, respectively. The method was applied successfully for the determination of the two analytes in the plasma after oral administration of Dantrelax® compound capsules to healthy volunteers. The study was accomplished after approval of the ethics committee.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aacetonitrile 3achemical species 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aethics 3aformic acid 3ahumans 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amethyl ethers 3aoral administration 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aUPLC–MS/MS 0aEgyptian healthy volunteers 0aParacetamol 0aDantrolene 0aDantrelax® compound capsules 0aBioanalytical method validation1 aSultan, Maha1 aMohamed, Dalia1 aMoussaTony, Rehab0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 1179 p.122816-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1228163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010200162300001600264520130400280592002801584650001801612650002301630650002201653650001001675650001201685650001501697650001101712650001601723650001901739650001701758650001301775650001401788650001401802650002201816650002601838653001001864653001901874653001901893653001301912653001001925700001201935700001301947700001201960700001201972773014601984856008302130852000902213655001202222IND60647378020221119095415.0190718e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064737802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, X.P.10aHMGA1 promoting gastric cancer oncogenic and glycolytic phenotypes by regulating c-myc expression  ap. 457-465.  aThe high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) protein, an architectural transcription factor, is profoundly implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of multiple malignant tumors. Reprogrammed energy metabolism is a hallmark of diverse types of cancer cells. However, little is known about the regulatory role of HMGA1 in aerobic glycolysis. In this study, we found that HMGA1 was highly expressed in many types of human cancers including gastric cancer and predicted a poor prognosis. However, high HMGA1 expression was not correlated with TNM stages. Gene set enrichment analysis result suggested a link between HMGA1 expression and glycolytic phenotype in gastric cancer. Genetic silencing of HMGA1 significantly inhibited gastric cancer glycolytic activity as revealed by reduced glucose uptake, lactate release, and extracellular acidification ratio. In addition, cell proliferation and invasive capacity of gastric cancer cells were also suppressed by HMGA1 knockdown. Mechanistically, the key glycolysis regulator c-Myc was identified as a downstream target of HMGA1. In gastric cancer patients, HMGA1 and c-Myc expression were closely associated with the glycolysis gene signature. Taken together, our findings identify a novel function of HMGA1 in regulating aerobic glycolysis in gastric cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3acell proliferation 3aenergy metabolism 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3ahumans 3alactic acid 3aneoplasm cells 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprognosis 3astomach neoplasms 3atranscription factors 0aHMGA1 0aWarburg effect 0aGastric cancer 0aOncogene 0ac-Myc1 aCao, Y.1 aZhao, H.1 aYin, J.1 aHou, P.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 516, no. 2 p.457-465dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011900167300001600286520121200302592002801514650001901542650001601561650001601577650001001593650001401603650001001617650004301627650002701670650001601697650001401713653002501727653002501752653001601777653002001793700002001813700006401833700003301897700001901930700006401949773011202013856008202125852000902207655001202216IND60558652520221121114305.0190410e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055865252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfda.2016.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero, Tamara10aAlbendazole residues in goat's milk: Interferences in microbial inhibitor tests used to detect antibiotics in milk  ap. 302-305.  aAlbendazole (ABZ) residues in goat's milk and their effect on the response of microbial inhibitor tests used for screening antibiotics were evaluated. A total of 18 Murciano-Granadina goats were treated with ABZ and individually milked once a day over a 7-day period. ABZ quantification was performed by high performance liquid chromatography. The ABZ parent drug was not detected. The maximum concentration of its metabolites (ABZ sulfoxide, ABZ sulfone, and ABZ 2-aminosulfone) was reached on the 1st day post treatment (260.0 ± 70.1 μg/kg, 112.8 ± 28.7 μg/kg, 152.0 ± 23.6 μg/kg, respectively), decreasing to lower than the maximum residue limit (MRL, 100 μg/kg) on the 3rd day post treatment. Milk samples were also analyzed by microbial tests [Brilliant Black Reduction Test (BRT) MRL, Delvotest SP-NT MCS and Eclipse 100], and only one positive result was found for Delvotest SP-NT MCS and Eclipse 100. However, a high occurrence of positive outcomes was obtained for BRT MRL during 6 days post treatment, whereas ABZ residues were not detected from the 4th day post administration, suggesting that factors other than the antiparasitic agent might affect the microbial test response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMurcia-Granada 3aalbendazole 3aantibiotics 3adrugs 3agoat milk 3agoats 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amaximum residue limits 3ametabolites 3ascreening 0aantiparasitic agents 0aalbendazole residues 0agoat's milk 0ascreening tests1 aAlthaus, Rafael1 aMoya, Vicente Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6769-05151 aBeltrán, María del Carmen,1 aReybroeck, Wim1 aMolina, María Pilar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0647-86090 tYàowù shípǐn fēnxī.g2017 Apr., v. 25, no. 2 p.302-305dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23274x1021-94987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfda.2016.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245008800159300001600247520105000263592002801313650003201341650002301373650000801396650003701404650001201441650001401453650001101467650001801478650001401496650005201510650001201562653000901574653000901583653000901592653000901601653000901610653001101619653000901630653001701639700002001656700001401676700001501690700001201705700002201717773012301739856008101862852000901943655001201952IND60774677320221120162428.0220422e19991101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467732DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.47.1999.4.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiss, I.10aObservations on the quasispecies composition of three animal pathogenic rna viruses  ap. 471-480.  aThe quasispecies nature of three animal pathogenic RNA viruses of field origin was examined by testing variants of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) originating from geographically different areas, feline coronavirus (FCoV) detected from the same animal by successive sampling, and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) originating from successive outbreaks in the same geographic area. Clinical samples were investigated using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and ensuing single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) assay. By the combination of these methods even subtle differences could be detected among the amplified fragments of the same virus species of different origin. FCoV proved to comprise the most and CSFV the less heterogeneous virus quasispecies.

The complete liquid-liquid phase diagrams (binodal curves and tie-lines) for several ternary systems of {water + 1-propanol / 2-propanol + sugar (mono- and di-saccharides, and their polyols)} were determined, for the first time. The main factors which affect the phase separation ability of these systems, such as temperature, structure and stereochemistry of sugars, and the alcohol type were discussed. In all the studied ABS, the top phase is alcohol-rich with lower water content, while the bottom phase is sugar-rich with higher water content. The partitioning behavior of two alkaloids (caffeine and codeine) and a flavoring antioxidant (vanillin) in the produced ABS was evaluated. In all the partitioning experiments, caffeine and vanillin have a preferable tendency to concentrate in the more hydrophobic alcohol-rich phase, however, codeine preferentially migrate to the more hydrophilic sugar-rich phase. The selectivity index of the alcohol-sugar ABS to separate compounds of the same family (caffeine and codeine) was calculated and found to be higher than 25 at optimum conditions. In general, the more soluting-out ability of sugars, the more difference in the water content of the coexisting phases, and the longer tie-line length lead to the better extraction performance of the propanol-sugar ABS. Heating has a favorable effect on the preferential partitioning of caffeine and codeine, but it is unfavorable for extraction of vanillin. From the results gathered, the novel ABS produced in this work provide efficient and money-saving extraction platforms, and can selectively separate similar biomolecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3aantioxidants 3acaffeine 3achromatography 3acodeine 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aisopropyl alcohol 3aphysical phases 3apolyols 3aseparation 3astereochemistry 3asugars 3atemperature 3avanillin 3awater content 0aAqueous biphasic systems 0aSugars 0aPropanol 0aPartitioning 0aCaffeine 0aCodeine 0aVanillin1 aSadeghi, Rahmat0 tJournal of chromatography.g2018 Dec. 21, v. 1581-1582 p.156-167dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2018.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008000165300001600245500001400261520146700275592002801742650002001770650001601790650000801806650001801814650001901832650001601851650001601867650001601883650001701899650001101916650001101927650001601938650001801954650001901972650001001991650001202001650001102013650002202024650001502046650001302061650001102074650001302085650001002098650001002108650002402118651001102142653001502153653003102168700002102199700002202220700001902242773011502261856008202376852000902458655001202467IND60720269120221119192149.0201225e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026912DNAL7 a10.2478/jvetres-2020-00652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnarska, Anna14aThe influence of high and low doses of acrylamide on porcine erythropoiesis  ap. 609-614.  aNAL-light  aDue to the widespread occurrence of acrylamide in the environment, its likely carcinogen status, and the suitability of the pig model as a human analogue, the authors decided to evaluate the impact of high and low doses of this compound on the processes of erythropoiesis in swine bone marrow. The experiment was carried out on Danish Landrace pigs at the age of eight weeks and body weight about 20 kg. The animals were divided into three equal groups consisting of five pigs in each. Control animals received empty gelatin capsules (placebos). Animals from the first experimental group received a low dose of acrylamide of 0.5 μg/kg b.w./day (> 99% purity; Sigma-Aldrich, Poland), and animals from the second experimental group received a dose 10 times higher. Placebos and acrylamide capsules were administered with feed every morning for 28 days. After anaesthetisation of the animals, bone marrow from the femur was collected into tubes without an anticoagulant on days 0 and 28. After drying and staining, bone marrow smears were subjected to detailed cytological evaluation using a light microscope. This study showed that high and low doses of acrylamide affected the process of porcine erythropoiesis. The cytotoxic effect of acrylamide on this process was demonstrated in a change of the polychromatic erythroblasts/normochromatic erythroblasts ratio. Both doses of acrylamide caused a decrease in the number of ortho- and polychromatic erythroblasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanish Landrace 3aacrylamides 3aage 3aanimal models 3aanticoagulants 3abody weight 3abone marrow 3acarcinogens 3acytotoxicity 3adosage 3adrying 3aenvironment 3aerythroblasts 3aerythropoiesis 3afemur 3agelatin 3ahumans 3alight microscopes 3aoccurrence 3aplacebos 3apurity 3astaining 3aswine 3atubes 3aveterinary medicine 3aPoland 0aacrylamide 0apolychromatic erythrocytes1 aPalus, Katarzyna1 aWysocka, Dominika1 aRytel, Liliana0 tJournal of Veterinary Research.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 64, no. 4 p.609-614dSciendowJournal:23185x2450-86087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jvetres-2020-00653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245016800178300001600346520121100362592002801573650001201601650001301613650001301626650001301639650001501652650001601667650002001683650001001703650001101713650004101724650002101765650001601786653001101802653001201813653001801825653001501843653001601858700004101874700002901915700002201944773011201966856008202078852000902160655001202169IND60558652620221121114249.0190410e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055865262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfda.2016.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPano-Farias, Norma Susana10aValidation and assessment of matrix effect and uncertainty of a gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry method for pesticides in papaya and avocado samples  ap. 501-509.  aIn this paper a method of using the “quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe” (QuEChERS) extraction and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detection (GC–MS) was developed for the analysis of five frequently applied pesticides in papaya and avocado. The selected pesticides, ametryn, atrazine, carbaryl, carbofuran, and methyl parathion, represent the most commonly used classes (carbamates, organophosphorous, and triazines). Optimum separation achieved the analysis of all pesticides in < 6.5 minutes. Validation using papaya and avocado samples established the proposed method as linear, accurate, and precise. In this sense, the correlation coefficients were > 0.99. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) in papaya ranged from 0.03 mg/kg to 0.35 mg/kg and from 0.06 mg/kg to 0.75 mg/kg, respectively. Meanwhile for avocado, LOD values varied from 0.14 mg/kg to 0.28 mg/kg and LOQ values ranged from 0.22 mg/kg to 0.40 mg/kg. Recoveries obtained for each pesticide in both matrices ranged between 60.6% and 104.3%. The expanded uncertainty of the method was < 26% for all the pesticides in both fruits. Finally, the method was applied to other fruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aametryn 3aatrazine 3aavocados 3acarbaryl 3acarbofuran 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3adrugs 3afruits 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aparathion-methyl 3auncertainty 0afruits 0aGC–MS 0amatrix effect 0apesticides 0auncertainty1 aCeballos-Magaña, Silvia Guillermina1 aMuñiz-Valencia, Roberto1 aGonzález, Jorge,0 tYàowù shípǐn fēnxī.g2017 July, v. 25, no. 3 p.501-509dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23274x1021-94987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfda.2016.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245014500161300002000306520064400326592002800970650001500998650002301013650002501036650002201061700001901083700001601102773012101118856008101239852000901320655001201329IND60550487920221119141051.0160911e20151120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055048792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b019402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jun-Hua10aConstruction of Spirocyclopropane-Linked Heterocycles Containing Both Pyrazolones and Oxindoles through Michael/Alkylation Cascade Reactions  ap. 11369-11377.  aAn effective diastereoselective Michael/alkylation cascade reaction of arylidenepyrazolones with 3-chlorooxindoles catalyzed by DIPEA was developed.

Gandou decoction (GDD), a traditional Chinese medicinal formula, has been used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of HLD in China for decades. Recent pharmacological evaluation in our laboratory has demonstrated that GDD exerts positive and beneficial effects on HLD model rats. However, its underlying therapeutic mechanisms are not yet well understood. To explore the potential therapeutic effects of GDD against HLD, liver and urine metabolomics approach combined with histopathological examination were performed to reveal the underlying mechanisms. Changes in metabolic profiles were estimated by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analyses. The results indicated that GDD could significantly improve liver pathological variations. Moreover, 19 and 11 significantly altered metabolites were found in the liver and urine between the normal and model groups, respectively. After GDD treatment, the levels of all these disordered metabolites showed different degrees of improvement compared with the model group, including lysoPC(18:2), lysoPE(20:2/0:0), PC(18:1/14:1), alpha-linolenic acid, sphinganine, taurochenodesoxycholic acid, tetracosahexaenoic acid, 13-OxoODE, and 13-L-hydroperoxyl inoleic acid. Metabolic pathway enrichment suggested that lipid and oxidative stress metabolism were the two main pathways that participated in copper-laden rat models with GDD administration. This work indicates that GDD could achieve a therapeutic effect on HLD by ameliorating the associated metabolic disturbances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3acopper metabolism 3ahepatolenticular degeneration 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aliver 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3arats 3asphinganine 3atherapeutics 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aurine 3aChina 0aGandou decoction 0aWilson's disease 0aUPLC-Q-TOF-MS 0aMetabolic pathways1 aLiang, Juan1 aCheng, Meimei1 aWu, Hongfei1 aWu, Huan1 aCao, Shijian1 aZhao, Wenchen1 aXu, Ruichao1 aZhou, An1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6176-95160 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 1179 p.122844-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1228443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245011400177300001800291520169400309592002802003650001602031650001302047650001202060650001102072650001402083650001402097650001302111650002402124650001602148650001602164650001402180700003102194773011202225856008202337852000902419655001202428IND60749502720221118170424.0210903e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074950272DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-020-10183-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamírez-Verduzco, L. F.10aBlends of Green Diesel (Synthetized from Palm Oil) and Petroleum Diesel: a Study on the Density and Viscosity  ap. 1002-1013.  aGreen diesel, also known as renewable diesel, is a biofuel obtained from biomass with similar physical properties than petroleum diesel. Renewable diesel is mainly composed by hydrocarbons free of oxygen, which can be blended at high concentrations with petroleum diesel due to their chemical affinity. Density and viscosity are two important physical properties of fuels that play an important role in the processes of atomization and injection in engines. Also, the knowledge of these properties is important for the correct design, operation, and optimization of chemical processes. Despite their importance, there is low information about experimental data and developed models related to the renewable diesel–petroleum diesel blend. To overcome the above limitation, this paper is focused on the study of four blends of renewable diesel and petroleum diesel in order to study the variation of density and kinematic viscosity with respect to the concentration and temperature. In addition, empirical correlations to predict the density and kinematic viscosity as function of temperature and concentration were developed. Density and viscosity of renewable diesel, petroleum diesel, and their blends were simultaneously measured with a densitometer–viscometer device with an uncertainty in density and viscosity of 0.1 kg/m³ and 1 × 10⁻⁸ m²/s. The parameters of the developed correlations were adjusted by the Levenberg–Marquardt optimization method. There was a good agreement between the calculated and experimental data because an average absolute deviation (AAD) of 0.07 and 1.66% were obtained for the predictions of density and kinematic viscosity respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomization 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aoxygen 3apalm oils 3apetroleum 3aresearch 3asystem optimization 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3aviscosity1 aHernández-Sánchez, M.

Unfortunately, these ecosystems have been increasingly disturbed due to forest conversions to anthropogenic land uses, illegal logging, and limestone quarrying. Karst regions have a high degree of endemic species, so their loss is likely to have negative consequences for species conservation as well as ecological processes. We investigated dung‐beetle communities from primary forests (PF), old secondary forests (>15 years since abandonment, OSF), young secondary forests (<10 years since abandonment, YSF), and Acacia plantations (<10 years old, AP) of karst ecosystems on Cat Ba Island (northern Vietnam). Our main aim was to provide a thorough and quantitative assessment of the taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetles in the examined forests, and subsequently to determine the value of specific types of disturbed forests for biodiversity conservation. In total, 1458 dung beetles of 34 taxa were recorded. Community composition varied significantly among the forest types and was broadly separated into two groups: old‐growth forests (i.e., PF and OSF) and young‐growth forests (i.e., YSF and AP). While YSF and AP hosted severely impoverished dung‐beetle communities, OSF with a high forest canopy cover and high ground vegetation cover harbored species‐rich dung‐beetle communities similar to those found in PF. However, functional diversity significantly differed between PF and OSF. The data also revealed that community responses were due to changing patterns of trait compositions rather than species richness.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe Nagao Natural Environment Foundation (NEF) (Tokyo, Japan) 3aAcacia 3abiodiversity conservation 3acommunity structure 3afeces 3aforest canopy 3aforest damage 3afunctional diversity 3aground vegetation 3aindigenous species 3akarsts 3alandscapes 3alimestone 3aresearch 3aspecies richness 3avegetation cover 3aVietnam1 aTran, Dung Van1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6211-93601 aBui, The Doi1 aLe, Bao Thanh1 aBai, Ming0 tEcological research.g2022 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.544-553dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3870047x0912-38147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1440-1703.123083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03433naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245012100177300001400298520170800312592002802020650001302048650001602061650001502077650001802092650002302110650002002133650002502153650003002178650001502208650001302223650001102236650000902247650000902256650002102265650000902286650001302295653000702308653000902315653001102324653000902335653000802344653000802352653000702360653000702367653000702374653001002381653001002391653001102401653001002412653000802422653001202430653000902442653002702451653002202478700001702500700001702517700002002534700002302554773008702577856008602664852000902750655001202759IND60602773420221122222336.0180711e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060277342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2015.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarshall, Kathryn M.10aRetro-inverso forms of gastrin5–12 are as biologically active as glycine-extended gastrin in vitro but not in vivo  ap. 16-22.  aNon-amidated gastrin peptides such as glycine-extended gastrin (Ggly) are biologically active in vitro and in vivo and have been implicated in the development of gastric and colonic cancers. Previous studies have shown that the truncated form of Ggly, the octapeptide LE5AY, was still biologically active in vitro, and that activity was dependent on ferric ion binding but independent of binding to the cholecystokinin 2 (CCK2) receptor. The present work was aimed at creating more stable gastrin-derived ‘super agonists’ using retro-inverso technology. The truncated LE5AY peptide was synthesized using end protecting groups in three forms with l-amino acids (GL), d-amino acids (GD) or retro-inverso (reverse order with d-amino acids; GRI). All of these peptides bound ferric ions with a 2:1 (Fe: peptide) ratio. As predicted, Ggly, GL and GRI were biologically active in vitro and increased cell proliferation in mouse gastric epithelial (IMGE-5) and human colorectal cancer (DLD-1) cell lines, and increased cell migration in DLD-1 cells. These activities were likely via the same mechanism as Ggly since no CCK1 or CCK2 binding was identified, and GD remained inactive in all assays. Surprisingly, unlike Ggly, GL and GRI were not active in vivo. While Ggly stimulated colonic crypt height and proliferation rates in gastrin knockout mice, GL and GRI did not. The apparent lack of activity may be due to rapid clearance of these smaller peptides. Nevertheless further work designing and testing retro-inverso gastrins is warranted, as it may lead to the generation of super agonists that could potentially be used to treat patients with gastrointestinal disorders with reduced mucosal function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aamino acids 3acell lines 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3acholecystokinin 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adigestive system diseases 3aepithelium 3agastrins 3ahumans 3aions 3airon 3aknockout mutants 3amice 3apatients 0aPG 0aGgly 0aGamide 0aCTFP 0aCCK 0aCRC 0aGL 0aGD 0aGL 0aDLD-1 0aCOS-7 0aIMGE-5 0aGASKO 0aDFO 0aGastrin 0aGgly 0aRetro-inverso peptides 0aColorectal cancer1 aLaval, Marie1 aSims, Ioulia1 aShulkes, Arthur1 aBaldwin, Graham S.0 tPeptides.g2015 Dec., v. 74 p.16-22dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2015.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010700171300001600278520071200294592002801006650001201034650003101046650001301077650001301090650001101103650002101114650001001135650001201145650002101157650003201178650002101210650001601231650000901247650001401256650001701270653000801287653000801295653001101303653000801314653002101322653001401343653002101357653001701378653001201395700001801407700002201425700002201447700002101469700002801490700002701518700002301545773011601568856008601684852000901770655001201779IND60551902820221116160939.0161019e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055190282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShukla, Harish10aIsocitrate lyase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is inhibited by quercetin through binding at N-terminus  ap. 137-141.  aCombating tuberculosis requires new therapeutic strategies that not only target the actively dividing bacilli but also the dormant bacilli during persistent infection. Isocitrate lyase (ICL) is a key enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, crucial for the survival of bacteria in macrophages and mice. MtbICL is considered as one of the potential and attractive drug targets against persistent infection. We report the inhibition of MtbICL by quercetin with IC50 of 3.57μM. In addition, quercetin strongly inhibited the growth of Mtb H37Rv utilizing acetate, rather than glucose as the sole carbon source, suggesting the inhibition of glyoxylate shunt. Quercetin binds at the N-terminus of MtbICL (Kd – 6.68μM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacilli 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aacetates 3abacteria 3acarbon 3achronic diseases 3adrugs 3aglucose 3aglyoxylate cycle 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aisocitrate lyase 3amacrophages 3amice 3aquercetin 3atuberculosis 0aMtb 0aICL 0aMtbICL 0aSEC 0aIsocitrate lyase 0aQuercetin 0aGlyoxylate shunt 0aMycobacteria 0aDocking1 aKumar, Vikash1 aSingh, Amit Kumar1 aRastogi, Shivangi1 aKhan, Shaheb Raj1 aSiddiqi, Mohammad Imran1 aKrishnan, Manju Yasoda1 aAkhtar, Md.

The results have shown high heritability and genetic advance for the number of fruits per plant (96.14 and 193.5), fruit weight (87.61 and 96.70), yield per plant (95.45 and 78.90) and lycopene content (98.31and 43.44) which indicated that these traits based selection is adequate. Among the accessions, extensive genetic diversity was observed for both quantitative traits and molecular analysis. From cluster means, accession Khasi Local was superior for fruit weight (80.30 g), LE-1-2 for lycopene (12.23 mg/100g) and S. peruvianum (1) for TSS (6.17) and vitamin-C (46.63mg/100g) content. In molecular analysis (35 microsatellite markers), a total of 118 alleles were observed with an average of 3.47 alleles per marker, and polymorphism information content ranged from 0.25 (SLM6-38) to 0.79 (LEat-015). From group based genetic diversity analyses, maximum diversity was observed in common cultivated tomato (100%) followed by cherry tomato (82.35%) and local landraces (Khasi Local and Tura-1). The molecular markers associated to QTLs for tolerance to bacterial wilt (SLM6-17, SLM6-14), fruit firmness (LEga7, LEaat7, and LEaat1), shelf life (LEat16) and yield (LEaat1 and LEaat18) have also shown wider diversity. Moreover, marker SLM6-17(150bp) tightly linked to major QTL associated with bacterial wilt was unique to accession LE-1-2, DMT-1 and BWT-3 and SLM-6-14 (240bp) for Sel-3, BWT-3, and RCT-3. These markers could be utilized in the selection of genotype having multiple desirable traits through MAS approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3abacterial wilt 3acherry tomatoes 3afruit quality 3afruit weight 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aheritability 3alandraces 3alycopene 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3ashelf life 0aGenetic diversity 0aQuality 0aMolecular markers 0aTomato 0aYield1 aPandey, Avinash1 aKumar, Anjani Jha0 tIndian journal of plant genetic resources.g2021 Dec. 18, v. 34, no. 3 p.437-446dIndian Society Of Plant Genetic ResourceswJournal:2090x0976-19267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0976-1926.2021.00037.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245014300165300001600308520139900324592002801723650001801751650001301769650002401782650001401806650002001820650001601840650002301856650001701879650002301896650001001919650002001929650001701949650002301966653001501989653001402004653001202018653001302030653002702043700001902070773012302089856007802212852000902290655001202299IND60774678020221120232023.0220422e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467802DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.2014.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhajali, Fariborz12aL-carnitine supplementation decreases lipid peroxidation and improves cardiopulmonary function in broiler chickens reared at high altitude  ap. 489-499.  aAn experiment was carried out to examine the effects of L-carnitine supplementation on growth performance and cardiopulmonary function of broiler chickens reared at high altitude (2100 m above sea level). A total of 96 day-old male chicks (Cobb 500) were randomly assigned into two dietary treatments containing 0 (control group) and 200 mg/kg L-carnitine. The experimental diets were fed for a period of 42 days consisting of the starting (days 1 to 21) and growing periods (days 21 to 42). Nutrient requirements of chickens met the NRC (1994) recommendations. The results showed that dietary L-carnitine had no significant influence on body weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio. L-carnitine reduced plasma concentration of malondialdehyde, packed cell volume (PCV) and abdominal fat deposition compared to the control (P < 0.05). A significant (P < 0.05) decrease was observed in the right to total ventricular weight ratio (RV:TV) in birds receiving L-carnitine when compared to the control. Supplementation of L-carnitine increased plasma nitric oxide and immune responsiveness, which manifested in an increased toe-web thickness index measured at 24 h following the injection of phytohaemagglutinin P. In conclusion, supplementation of L-carnitine had beneficial effects on preventing lipid peroxidation and pulmonary hypertension in broiler chickens raised at high altitude.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3aaltitude 3abody weight changes 3acarnitine 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3ahypertension 3alipid peroxidation 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3anitric oxide 3aphytohemagglutinin 0aAmino acid 0acarnitine 0achicken 0aimmunity 0apulmonary hypertension1 aKhajali, Zahra0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2014 Dec. 1, v. 62, no. 4 p.489-499dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.2014.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007900169300001600248520158700264592002801851650002101879650001901900650001201919650001101931650002101942650001801963650003201981650001602013650002702029650001202056650001302068700006802081773011002149856008202259852000902341655001202350IND60749503020221118170411.0210903e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074950302DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-020-10193-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaliskan, Meltem10aPotential of Biogas and Electricity Production from Animal Waste in Turkey  ap. 860-869.  aIn this paper, biogas potential produced from animal manure has been calculated using data for various regions of Turkey between 2007 and 2019. Moreover, generation of electricity potential that can be provided using biogas obtained from animal manure resources has been examined. The animal numbers subjected to the study have been reached via the Turkish Statistical Institute. The amount of animal manure, which is the basis for calculating the amount of biogas, has been calculated using the average number of animals and the animal weight. Eastern Anatolia and Central Anatolia Regions have the highest biogas potential with 19% compared with the other regions due to amount of manure obtained from animal. The finding of this study denotes that 76,448 × 10⁶ m³ potential of methane content can be obtained from biogas for the mentioned years, and 2,339,296 × 10⁶ MJ potential of heating value can be obtained from this methane value. While the potential of electricity energy, which can be provided from animal manure wastes, has been 231,009 × 10⁶ between 2007 and 2019 in Turkey, the total electricity consumption in 2007–2019 is 2,898,040 × 10⁶ kWh. The results show that the potential electricity that can be provided from animal manure could meet 7.99% of the electricity consumed in the same years. Furthermore, the cost analysis of biogas facility, which is established in Eastern Anatolia Region, has been performed using circular economy model. According to calculations, the discounted payback period has been found to be 10 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTurkey (country) 3aanimal manures 3aanimals 3abiogas 3acircular economy 3acost analysis 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3amethane 3aresearch1 aTumen Ozdil, Naime Filiz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0083-75240 tBioEnergy research.g2021 Sept., v. 14, no. 3 p.860-869dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4138147x1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-020-10193-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245010200175300001600277520105900293592002801352650001301380650001001393650001001403650001201413650001301425650001301438650001401451650001101465650002001476653002701496653001001523653001601533653002701549653000801576653000801584653000801592653000801600653000801608700002501616700002201641700002501663700002301688700002101711700002301732773014601755856008301901852000901984655001201993IND60647378620221119100515.0190725e20190827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064737862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaytseva, Anastasia K.10aCharacterization of a novel SCN5A genetic variant A1294G associated with mixed clinical phenotype  ap. 777-783.  aMutations in gene SCN5A, which encodes cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.5, are associated with multiple clinical phenotypes. Here we describe a novel A1294G genetic variant detected in a male patient with combined clinical phenotype including atrioventricular II block, Brugada-like ECG, septal fibrosis, right ventricular dilatation and decreased left ventricular contractility. Residue A1294 is located in the IIIS3–S4 extracellular loop, in proximity to several residues whose mutations are associated with sodium channelopathies. The wild-type channel Nav1.5 and mutant Nav1.5-A1294G were expressed in the CHO–K1 and HEK293T cells and whole-cell sodium currents were recorded using the patch-clamp method. The A1294G channels demonstrated a negative shift of steady-state inactivation, accelerated fast and slow inactivation and decelerated recovery from intermediate inactivation. Our study reveals biophysical mechanism of the Nav1.5-A1294G dysfunction, which may underlie the combined phenotypic manifestation observed in the patient.  aPublisher supplied data 3afibrosis 3agenes 3amales 3amutants 3amutation 3apatients 3aphenotype 3asodium 3asodium channels 0aSodium channelopathies 0aSCN5A 0aPatch-clamp 0aAtrioventricular block 0aBrS 0aCCD 0aINa 0aLQT 0aSSS1 aKarpushev, Alexey V.1 aKiselev, Artem M.1 aMikhaylov, Evgeny N.1 aLebedev, Dmitry S.1 aZhorov, Boris S.1 aKostareva, Anna A.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Aug. 27, v. 516, no. 3 p.777-783dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245007300163300001600236520141000252592002801662650001501690650001401705650002301719650001001742700002101752773008401773856004801857852000901905655001201914IND4472780020221119005541.0120727e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447278002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-011-9643-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazeau, Karim14aThe molecular basis of the adsorption of xylans on cellulose surface  ap. 337-349.  aIn order to model the adsorption of xylan on cellulose, we have simulated, at the atomic level, the gas phase adsorption of small xylan fragments having 5 skeletal β (1 → 4) xylosyl residues (X5), using molecular dynamics simulations. A first regime was considered, corresponding to a low surface coverage, with the adsorption of isolated X5 in various initial orientations. In this regime, the simulation indicated that X5 moved toward extended conformations, some of them being helical, with the possibility of either 21 or left-handed 31 helices. During the simulation, the X5 fragments became preferentially oriented, parallel or anti parallel with respect to the cellulose chain axis. Substitution of the X5 backbone by either GlcA and/or Araf side chains had no major influence on either the conformation or the efficiency of the interaction. However, the presence of side chains favored orientations of the X5 backbone inclined with respect to the cellulose chain axis. In a second regime corresponding to monolayer coverage, the geometrical features of the adsorption of the xylan fragments on cellulose was roughly the same as that in the individual coverage situation. In this case, the monolayer became equilibrated at 0.14 g of xylan fragments for each g of cellulose, a figure that compared favourably with the values obtained in experimental adsorption of xylan on bacterial cellulose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3amolecular dynamics 3axylan1 aCharlier, Landry0 tCellulose.g2012 Apr., v. 19, no. 2 p.337-349dSpringer-Verlagx0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-011-9643-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013700169300001600306520105800322592002801380650002101408650001401429650001201443650002201455650001301477650002601490650002101516653001801537653002001555653003601575653001601611653002201627700001801649700002001667700001501687773015901702856008701861852000901948655001201957IND60773717020221122023059.0220419e20211218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077371702DNAL7 a10.5958/0976-1926.2021.00038.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohal, Norah10aMoisture Induced Changes in Root Attributes and Selection Indices for Drought Tolerance in Desi, Kabuli and Wild Chickpea Accessions  ap. 447-454.  aRoot traits i.e. root length (RL), root weight (RW) and root area (RA) and root indices i.e. root length density (RLD) and root:shoot ratio (RSR) were evaluated in leaves of desi, kabuli and wild chickpea accessions at 70 DAS under receding moisture conditions (control, 50% and 75% reduction). The tolerance of desi genotypes was recorded to be significantly higher than kabuli and wild accessions. Check desi genotype PBG 7 was observed to be tolerant to moisture stress with 13.15% and 34.04% decline in root length density as well as root length under 50% moisture reduction conditions respectively. However, wild accessions sustained low stress injuries in terms of low membrane permeability index (MPI) (12.76 and 28.46%) and less decline in cellular respiration (26.06 and 43.23%) highlighting their resistance at 50 and 75% moisture reduction respectively. The tolerance capacity of the desi genotypes was attributed to high root area that contributed directly to root length density (P=0.89) and was instrumental in maintaining yield stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell respiration 3achickpeas 3adecline 3adrought tolerance 3agenotype 3amembrane permeability 3aroot shoot ratio 0aCicer species 0aMoisture stress 0aPath coefficient analysis (PCA) 0aRoot traits 0aSelection indices1 aKaur, Jagmeet1 aSingh, Sarvjeet1 aPal, Mamta0 tIndian journal of plant genetic resources.g2021 Dec. 18, v. 34, no. 3 p.447-454dIndian Society Of Plant Genetic ResourceswJournal:2090x0976-19267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0976-1926.2021.00038.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245008100169300002000250520113300270592002801403650001101431650001301442650003401455650001501489650001301504650001401517650002401531650001101555653000901566653002001575653002301595653001701618653003501635700005701670700001501727700002101742700001801763700006001781773014201841856007801983852000902061655001202070IND60689672720221121185214.0200422e20200320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068967272DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c016112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, A.

Specifically, for state-of-the-art Ni-cermet anodes, reduction/oxidation (redox) cycles during fuel-rich and fuel-starved conditions cause a huge volume change, eventually leading to cell failure. Here, we report a robust redox-stable SrFe₀.₂Co₀.₄Mo₀.₄O₃ (SFCM)/Ce₀.₉Gd₀.₁O₂ ceramic anode-supported LT-SOFC with high performance and remarkable redox stability. The anode-supported configuration tackles the high ohmic loss associated with conventional ceramic anodes, achieving a high open circuit voltage of ∼0.9 V and a peak power density of 500 mW/cm² at 600 °C in hydrogen. In addition, ceramic anode-supported SOFCs are stable over tens of redox cycles under harsh operating conditions. Our study reveals that oxygen nonstoichiometry of SFCM compensates for the dimensional changes that occur during redox cycles. Our results demonstrate the potential of all ceramic cells for the next generation of LT-SOFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aceramics 3aelectric potential difference 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3aoxygen 0aSOFC 0aredox stability 0asurface decoration 0ainfiltration 0alow temperature ceramic anodes1 aHuang, Yi-Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1886-33521 aPan, Ke-Ji1 aRobinson, Ian A.1 aWang, Xizheng1 aWachsman, E.

Our approach to BT-sulfonamides starts from simple commercially available building blocks (benzo[d]thiazole-2-thiol and primary and secondary amines) that are connected via (a) a S oxidation/S–N coupling approach, (b) a S–N coupling/S-oxidation sequence, or via (c) a S-oxidation/S–F bond formation/SuFEx approach. The labile N–H bond in N-monoalkylated BT-sulfonamides (pKₐ (BTSO₂N(H)Bn) = 3.34 ± 0.05) further allowed us to develop a simple weak base-promoted N-alkylation method and a stereoselective microwave-promoted Fukuyama–Mitsunobu reaction. N-Alkyl-N-aryl BT-sulfonamides were accessed with the help of the Chan–Lam coupling reaction. Developed methods were further used in stereo and chemoselective transformations of podophyllotoxin and several amino alcohols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3achemoselectivity 3aorganic chemistry 3apodophyllotoxin 3astereoselectivity1 aKováč, Ondřej1 aLachetová, Eliška1 aŠt’astná, Nikola1 aPospíšil, Jiří,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0198-81160 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2021 Aug. 16, v. 86, no. 17 p.11291-11309dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.1c003173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010400164300001600268500001400284520150200298592002801800650002301828650002501851650001601876650001501892650002101907650001101928650000901939650001101948650001401959650000901973650001001982650003101992650002802023650002002051650001402071650001502085650001402100650001602114650001402130650002402144651001002168653001902178653004602197653002502243700001502268700001702283700001602300700002102316700001402337700001402351700001902365700002002384700001602404700002002420700001902440700001702459773011502476856008202591852000902673655001202682IND60720269720221119191519.0201225e20201106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026972DNAL7 a10.2478/jvetres-2020-00712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuowu, Zhang10aOccurrence of gastrointestinal parasites in camels in the Tianshan Mountains pastoral area in China  ap. 509-515.  aNAL-light  aGastrointestinal parasites are some of the most common pathogens which are seriously harmful to the camel’s health. The infection status of gastrointestinal parasites in camels (Camelus bactrianus) in the Tianshan Mountains pastoral area in China is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the species and infection intensity of gastrointestinal tract parasites in local camels. A total of 362 fresh faecal samples were collected and examined for parasite eggs using the saturated saline floating and natural sedimentation method. The parasite eggs were subjected to morphological and molecular examination and identification, and the infection rate and mean intensity of the parasites were analysed. A total of 15 gastrointestinal tract parasite species’ eggs were identified, with a detection rate of 100%. Ostertagia spp. (100%) and Trichostrongylus spp. (98.1%) were dominant. Camels were often coinfected by 5–14 species. The average number of eggs per gram of faeces was higher for Ostertagia spp. (298), Haemonchus contortus (176) and Nematodirus spp. (138). The number of species of parasites infecting young camels was significantly lower than that of adult camels, but the infection intensity in young camels was significantly higher. Gastrointestinal parasites were highly prevalent in camels from the Tianshan Mountains pastoral area in China. This finding provides important epidemiological data for the prevention and control of associated infections in camels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelus bactrianus 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aNematodirus 3aOstertagia 3aTrichostrongylus 3aadults 3aarea 3acamels 3adetection 3aeggs 3afeces 3agastrointestinal parasites 3agastrointestinal system 3amixed infection 3amountains 3aoccurrence 3aparasites 3apastoralism 3apathogens 3aveterinary medicine 3aChina 0aOstertagia spp 0aTianshan Mountains pastoral area in China 0aTrichostronglyus spp1 aKai, Zhang1 aXifeng, Wang1 aChunhui, Ji1 aChengcheng, Ning1 aYue, Zhao1 aJun, Qiao1 aQingling, Meng1 aXingxing, Zhang1 aKuojun, Cai1 aJinsheng, Zhang1 aZaichao, Zhang1 aXuepeng, Cai0 tJournal of Veterinary Research.g2020 Nov. 06, v. 64, no. 4 p.509-515dSciendowJournal:23185x2450-86087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jvetres-2020-00713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014700165300001800312520171700330592002802047596005902075650002802134650001602162650001502178650001302193650002002206650001202226650002502238650001102263650001602274650002702290650002502317650001002342650001502352650001602367651001002383700001702393700001702410700001802427700001402445700001802459700001802477700001702495773014802512856008102660852000902741655001202750IND60604937720221119001532.0180718e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060493772DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1186-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chenglong10aHigh-throughput and sensitive determination of urinary zearalenone and metabolites by UPLC-MS/MS and its application to a human exposure study  ap. 5301-5312.  aBiomarker-based strategies to assess human exposure to mycotoxins have gained increased acceptance in recent years. In this study, an improved method based on UPLC-MS/MS following 96-well μElution solid-phase extraction was developed and validated for the sensitive and high-throughput determination of zearalenone (ZEN) and its five metabolites α-zearalenol (α-ZEL), β-zearalenol (β-ZEL), α-zearalanol (α-ZAL), β-zearalanol (β-ZAL), and zearalanone (ZAN) in human urine samples, using ¹³C-ZEN as an internal standard for accurate quantification. Two plates of samples (n = 192) could be processed within 2 h, and baseline separation of all the analytes was achieved in a total runtime of 6 min. The proposed method allowed ZEN and its metabolites to be sensitively determined in a high-throughput way for the first time, and with significantly improved efficiency and accuracy with respect to existing methods. The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantitation (LOQs) ranged from 0.02 to 0.06 ng mL⁻¹ and from 0.05 to 0.2 ng mL⁻¹, respectively. The recoveries for the spiked samples were from 87.9 to 100%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of less than 7%. 301 urine samples collected from healthy volunteers aged 0–84 years in China were analyzed with and without enzyme hydrolysis to determine total and free ZEN biomarkers, respectively. ZEN, ZAN, α-ZEL, and β-ZEL were detected in 71.4% of the samples at levels of 0.02–3.7 ng mL⁻¹ after enzyme hydrolysis. The estimated mean probable daily intake (PDI) was much lower than the tolerable daily intake (TDI). Adolescents had higher exposure than children, adults, and the elderly.

In Experiment 1, autumn-lambing (AL, n = 27) and spring-lambing (SL, n = 37) ewes were investigated. Ovarian activity was monitored by means of individual progesterone (P4) profiles from day 5 to day 100 post partum. Most of the AL dams (89%) ovulated till day 35 after parturition and became cyclic thereafter. Incidence of persistent corpus luteum (CLP) and short luteal phases (sCL) was frequent (18% and 29%, respectively) among non-conceiving dams. In contrast, only 24% of the SL ewes ovulated before day 35. P4 levels during the luteal phase were lower in cyclic animals, and the cycle was longer in SL than in AL animals. No CLP or sCL was detected in the spring-lambing group, and 61% of SL ewes remained acyclic till the end of the trial. Lactation length was significantly longer in SL dams than in AL ewes (P = 0.008). According to the plasma metabolites (BHB, NEFA) and metabolic hormones (insulin, IGF-I, thyroxine) examined, negative energy balance did not appear in any of the animals. However, seasonal differences were seen in IGF-I and thyroxine levels, which were higher in the SL dams. In Experiment 2, influence of additional lighting was studied in autumn-lambing ewes. The long-day photoperiod (LD, n = 23) group was exposed to artificial light from sunset till midnight (approx. 16 h light/8 h dark) from some weeks before the expected date of delivery in mid-September until the end of December. The control group (n = 25) experienced only natural daylength. The first postpartum ovulation tended to occur later in the LD animals than in the controls (P = 0.047). The lactation of the LD group tended to be longer (P = 0.061). NEFA, BHB, insulin, IGF-I and thyroxine levels did not differ between the groups. Conclusions: (i) The ovarian function of the Awassi population is seasonal under temperate continental climate conditions. (ii) The first postpartum ovulation of non-suckling, autumn-lambing dams may occur very early, even before the completion of uterine involution. (iii) Additional artificial lighting may delay the time of first postpartum ovulation in AL ewes. (iv) Postpartum negative energy balance is unlikely to occur in dairy Awassi ewes even in high-producing intensive systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAwassi 3acontinental climates 3acorpus luteum 3aenergy balance 3ainsulin 3alactation 3alighting 3amenstrual cycle 3amilk production 3aovulation 3aparturition 3aphotoperiod 3aprogesterone 3athyroxine 3auterine involution 0aEwe 0aseasonality 0aphotoperiod 0ametabolites 0aovarian activity1 aKeresztes, Mónika1 aMárton, Alíz1 aFébel, Hedvig1 aKulcsár, Margit,1 aNagy, Sándor1 aCseh, Sándor1 aSolti, László1 aHuszenicza, Gyula0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 59, no. 4 p.497-510dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.2011.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01192naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245009700166300002000263520020400283592002800487650001400515650002300529650001300552650002200565650001400587650002200601700002500623700001900648773012100667856008100788852000900869655001200878IND60550488420221119141532.0160911e20151120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055048842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b020532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHinze, Meagan

Tissue sections were stained according to the standard haematoxylin and eosin (HE) technique and with toluidine blue to demonstrate cytoplasmic granules. Immunohistochemical studies were performed, using the cell markers CD117 (c-kit), p16 and von Willebrand factor (FVIII). In CD117 three different staining patterns were observed: (1) membranous reaction, (2) intense staining of cytoplasm, and (3) a diffuse, delicate cytoplasmic reaction. Von Willebrand antibody was evaluated on the basis of the number of blood vessels stained. p16 expression was evaluated by scoring positive nuclear reaction. Positive expression was demonstrated for all examined antigens, but their level of expression differed depending on the grades of tumour malignancy. Statistical analysis of the results documented a pronounced positive correlation between the markers studied and the grade of tumour malignancy (P < 0.001). It was shown that each of the cell markers examined represents a useful prognostic indicator for patients with mast cell tumours. The calculated correlation coefficients demonstrate a strong association between the expressions of CD117, FVIII and p16, and the histological malignancy of a tumour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3ablood 3ablood coagulation factors 3adogs 3aeosin 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amast cells 3aneoplasms 3aprognosis 3astatistical analysis 3atoluidine blue 0aMast cell tumour 0adog 0ap16 0aCD117 0aFVIII1 aNowak, Marcin1 aMadej, Janusz1 aDzimira, Stanisław1 aCiaputa, Rafal1 aJanus, Izabela0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2015 Mar. 1, v. 63, no. 1 p.49-59dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.2015.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01528naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245016500160300002000325520044900345592002800794650001100822650002300833650002300856650002200879650002400901700001300925700001600938700001700954700002000971773012100991856008101112852000901193655001201202IND60550488520221119141433.0160911e20151120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055048852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b020572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yufeng10aPolysubstituted 2-Aminopyrrole Synthesis via Gold-Catalyzed Intermolecular Nitrene Transfer from Vinyl Azide to Ynamide: Reaction Scope and Mechanistic Insights  ap. 11407-11416.  aA gold-catalyzed intermolecular reaction of vinyl azides and ynamides is described.

From the crosses of Illinois High Oil (IHO) × Illinois Low Oil (ILO) and of Illinois High Protein (IHP) × Illinois Low Protein (ILP), 500 S₂ lines were developed. Each IHO×ILO line was genotyped for 479 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, and each IHP×ILP line was genotyped for 499 SNP markers. Per se and testcross progenies of each S₂ line were evaluated for oil, protein, and starch. A large number of QTL were found to control these traits. The objective of this paper is to report the results of analysis of these crosses for two-way epistatic interactions. More epistatic interactions were significant than expected by chance. The proportion of significant interactions that involved a marker significant in a single marker analysis (SMA) was no greater than expected by chance. The number of markers associated only with significant epistatic effects ranged from 46.3 to 72.2% of the total number of markers significant for either an interaction effect or from SMA. The number of QTL controlling a trait is much greater than will be found by analyzing for significant QTL main effects. Thus, epistasis could contribute to the long continued response to selection in the Illinois long-term selection strains and also may help explain the continued success of commercial corn breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3alipid content 3acorn oil 3acorn protein 3aprotein content 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3ahybridization 3aepistasis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3acorn starch 3aquantitative trait loci 3aIllinois0 tCrop science.g2008 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.59-68dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2007.04.02423Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01391naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245009200158300002000250520044400270592002800714650001200742650001300754650001400767650001400781650002200795650001400817700001900831700001600850773012100866856008100987852000901068655001201077IND60550488720221119141534.0160911e20151120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055048872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b020842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tao10aAsymmetric Reduction of tert-Butanesulfinyl Ketimines by N-Heterocyclic Carbene Boranes  ap. 11441-11446.  aN-heterocyclic carbene borane (NHC-borane) based on a triazole core is demonstrated for the first time to be efficient for reduction of a variety of tert-butanesulfinyl ketimines.

Emerging evidence suggests that one near‐term approach to offset the negative consequences of weight stigma could be to capitalize on benefits of patient–physician weight concordance. However, it is likely that patient attitudes towards physicians with overweight are complicated and multifaceted and may include stigmatization of providers with overweight. METHODS: Two‐hundred ninety‐eight women with overweight completed an online questionnaire and indicated preference for a physician who is ‘overweight’, ‘not overweight’, or indicated no preference. Participants provided reasons for their choice and answered questions about their weight‐related beliefs and experiences. RESULTS: The majority of women indicated no weight preference (63%), and a portion (36%) of the sample explicitly preferred physicians who are not overweight. Reasons provided for these preferences were primarily based on stereotyped notions of physician aptitude based on weight. Compared with having no preference, those who preferred physicians who are not overweight had fewer previous negative weight‐related physician interactions and had increased beliefs about the controllability of weight. CONCLUSIONS: These findings elucidate patient attitudes towards physicians with overweight in a sample at increased risk for weight stigmatization. Findings underscore the need for stigma‐reducing interventions so that clinical experiences for both women and physicians with overweight can be improved.  aPublisher supplied data  aZ01‐HG200383‐17cNational Institutes of Health 3aobesity 3apatients 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3astigma1 aPersky, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7768-57440 tObesity science & practice.g2018 June, v. 4, no. 3 p.250-258dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27210x2055-22387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/osp4.1623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002900165245011400194300001600308500001500324520162800339592002801967650002601995650001902021650002602040650001802066650001502084650001502099650001002114650002102124650001602145650003802161650001002199650001802209650003902227650004802266650002502314650001202339650002802351650004302379650003902422650003802461650002402499650003202523650001002555651002902565653000902594653001902603653001002622653002002632653002602652653002002678653001202698700002402710700002002734700002102754773013202775852000902907856008302916655001202999IND4394492220221120141317.0181012e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439449222DNAL7 a174026152pmid7 a10.1177/1040638707019002092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManning, Elizabeth J.

This issue of compromised specificity was evaluated by testing 771 adult goats from 10 Midwestern goat herds in 2004. Assays for MAP infection included radiometric fecal culture and 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs); ELISA-positive samples were tested by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID). A synergistic hemolysin inhibition assay (SHI) was used to detect C. pstb antibody. Four infection status categories were evaluated. Category 1 goats (free of both MAP and C. pstb infection) tested negative on all MAP fecal cultures and SHI tests. Five of 181 goats were positive in both ELISAs, and 2 more were positive in ELISA-1 only. For Category 2 (MAP infected; no C. pstb infection), all animals were SHI negative. Six goats were fecal culture positive and strongly positive in both ELISAs; 2 more goats were positive only in ELISA-1. For Category 3 (C. pstb infected or vaccinated; no history of MAP infection), all fecal cultures were negative and 91% were SHI test-positive. In this population, only 2 goats were positive in both MAP ELISAs, while 84 additional goats were test-positive only on ELISA-1. In the absence of C. pstb infection, both ELISAs performed comparably, but when C. pstb infection was present the performance of ELISA-1 was significantly perturbed. Use of the ELISA-2 for goats is an effective and efficient method for Johne's disease surveillance in any goat herd.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunodiffusion tests 3across reaction 3adiagnostic techniques 3aserodiagnosis 3ahemolysins 3aantibodies 3agoats 3aparatuberculosis 3avaccination 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3agoat diseases 3aCorynebacterium pseudotuberculosis 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3adisease surveillance 2aAnimals 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aCorynebacterium Infectionsxveterinary 2aCorynebacterium pseudotuberculosis 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aGoat Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aGoats 3aMidwestern United States 0agoat 0afalse positive 0aELISA 0aimmune response 0acaseous lymphadenitis 0aJohne's disease 0aCaprine1 aCushing, Heather F.1 aHietala, Sharon1 aWolf, Cynthia B.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 19, no. 2 p.187-190dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638707019002093Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03378naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100002000192245011600212500001900328506007600347520194700423592002802370506003702398650001402435650001202449650001902461650001202480650002502492650001002517650001502527650001202542650001602554650001302570653002602583653001702609700001602626700001902642700002002661700002102681700001902702773009202721856008602813852000902899655001202908IND60690885720221207122624.0201230e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069088572DNAL7 a311930272pmid7 aPMC65138112pmcid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e016462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Kenjiro10aEffects of post-weaning social isolation on social behaviors and oxytocinergic activity in male and female rats  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPost-weaning social deprivation is known to induce behavioral and neuronal alterations associated with anxiety and stress responses in adulthood. However, the effects of social deprivation on the development of sociability are poorly understood. We examined the effects of social deprivation on subsequent social behaviors and oxytocinergic activity using socially-isolated (approximately two months post-weaning) male and female rats.The behaviors were analyzed using a social preference test and a social approach test. Immunohistochemical investigations were conducted in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) to examine the effects of social isolation on oxytocinergic activity in these regions. Oxytocinergic activity was measured by quantifying the number of oxytocin neurons expressing Fos following exposure to a novel conspecific. In all of the experiments of this study, ovariectomized females were used for social stimuli.The behavioral results show that isolation-reared females, but not males, displayed impaired social preference and decreased social approach towards ovariectomized females, compared with the pair-reared group, suggesting low priority of processing social versus non-social stimuli and low motivation for contact with a stranger, respectively. The immunohistochemical results show that social isolation decreased both the number and the ratio of Fos-positive cells in oxytocin neurons in the PVN in females, but not in males, following exposure to ovariectomized females. In the SON, the Fos-positive ratio was decreased in isolation-reared females, but not in males, compared with the pair-reared group.Post-weaning social isolation changed social behaviors and oxytocinergic activity in female rats, suggesting that in female rats post-weaning social experiences contribute to the development of sociability. These findings could impact the treatment of social dysfunction in humans.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadulthood 3aanxiety 3aconspecificity 3afemales 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amales 3amotivation 3aneurons 3aovariectomy 3aoxytocin 0aDevelopmental biology 0aNeuroscience1 aOsako, Yoji1 aTakahashi, Kou1 aHidaka, Chiharu1 aTomita, Kōichi,1 aYuri, Kazunari0 tHeliyon.g2019 May, v. 5, no. 5 p.e01646-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e016463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245007300209300001600282506007600298520144300374592002801817506003701845650001401882650001401896650001001910650001301920650001101933650001101944650001201955650001101967651001301978653001701991653002002008653001902028653002102047653002102068700001902089700002002108700002502128700002202153700002002175773017102195856007902366852000902445655001202454IND60178668420221207093710.0150604e20140114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017866842DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13186161112doi7 aPMC38961912pmcid7 a243670982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaichlen, David A.10aEvidence of Lévy walk foraging patterns in human hunter–gatherers  ap. 728-733.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhen searching for food, many organisms adopt a superdiffusive, scale-free movement pattern called a Lévy walk, which is considered optimal when foraging for heterogeneously located resources with little prior knowledge of distribution patterns [Viswanathan GM, da Luz MGE, Raposo EP, Stanley HE (2011) The Physics of Foraging: An Introduction to Random Searches and Biological Encounters ]. Although memory of food locations and higher cognition may limit the benefits of random walk strategies, no studies to date have fully explored search patterns in human foraging. Here, we show that human hunter–gatherers, the Hadza of northern Tanzania, perform Lévy walks in nearly one-half of all foraging bouts. Lévy walks occur when searching for a wide variety of foods from animal prey to underground tubers, suggesting that, even in the most cognitively complex forager on Earth, such patterns are essential to understanding elementary foraging mechanisms. This movement pattern may be fundamental to how humans experience and interact with the world across a wide range of ecological contexts, and it may be adaptive to food distribution patterns on the landscape, which previous studies suggested for organisms with more limited cognition. Additionally, Lévy walks may have become common early in our genus when hunting and gathering arose as a major foraging strategy, playing an important role in the evolution of human mobility.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acognition 3aevolution 3afoods 3aforaging 3ahumans 3amemory 3aphysics 3atubers 3aTanzania 0aLévy flight 0aBrownian motion 0asuperdiffusion 0ascale invariance 0aoptimal foraging1 aWood, Brian M.1 aGordon, Adam D.1 aMabulla, Audax Z.

However, the geographical barriers between continents should have resulted in intraspecific population differentiation with reflection on individual biological and ecological traits. Our aim was to test for potential differences in Chironomidae species/genus and traits between the Nearctic and Palearctic regions. We compared the Chironomidae trait information gathered in two databases; one database was developed in Europe and the other in North America. Common genera and species of both databases were selected, and the common traits were adjusted into the same trait categories. Data were transformed into presence/absence and divided into Eltonian (biological/functional) and Grinnellian (ecological) traits. Common genera and common species were analyzed using Fuzzy correspondence analysis (FCA). Differences between databases occur for all trait domains. Yet, Eltonian traits showed lower level of concordance than Grinnellian traits at the species level. Different biological characteristics in the Nearctic and Palearctic regions may indicate that Chironomidae have different adaptions to similar ecological environments due to intraspecific variability or even trait plasticity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPalearctic region 3aintraspecific variation 3acorrespondence analysis 3adatabases 3aChironomidae 3aNorth America 3aEurope 3aArctic region 0aPalaearctic region1 aGraça, Manuel A.

Hairy root culture of Psoralea corylifolia L. was developed for biomass and enhanced daidzin production using signalling compounds such as jasmonic acid (JA) and acetyl salicylic acid (ASA). Best response of 2.8-fold daidzin (5.09% DW) with 1 μM JA treatment after second week and 7.3-fold (3.43% DW) with 10 μM JA elicitation after 10th week was obtained from hairy roots compared to untreated control. ASA at 10 μM promoted 1.7-fold increase in daidzin (1.49% DW) content after seventh week compared to control (0.83% DW). Addition of 25 μM ASA resulted in 1.44% DW daidzin (1.5-fold increase) with 0.91% DW in control after fifth week and 1.44% DW daidzin (2.3-fold increase) after eighth week when compared to untreated control (0.62% DW).

The site became an experimental catchment to investigate the water fluxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum and the impact of vegetation on runoff generation in 2012. The elevation of the catchment ranges from 598 to 721 m a.s.l. and the climate is humid temperate. The bedrock consists of rhyolites and dacites; the soil is a Cambisol. The catchment is covered by a dense forest, dominated by beech, chestnut, maple, and hazel trees. The field set up includes measurements of the rainfall in an open area, streamflow at the outlet, soil moisture at various depths and locations, and depth to water table in six piezometers at a 5‐ or 10‐min interval. Samples of precipitation, stream water, shallow groundwater and soil water are collected monthly for tracer analysis (stable isotopes (²H and ¹⁸O), electrical conductivity and major ions), and during selected rainfall–runoff events to determine the contribution of the various sources to runoff. Since 2017, soil and plant water samples have been collected to determine the sources of tree transpiration. Data collected in the period 2012–2016 are publicly available. Data collection is ongoing, and the data set is expected to be updated on an annual basis to include the most recent measurements.  aPublisher supplied data  aBando Starting Grants 2015cFondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Padova e Rovigo  aPRIN 2017, project 2017SL7ABCcMinistero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca  aproject "SILVA‐Water fluxes between soil, vegetation and atmosphere: a comparative analysis in two Italian forested catchments"cPremio Florisa Melone 2018, Italian Hydrological Society  aBando 2014 per il finanziamento di attrezzature scientifiche finalizzate alla ricerca", project "Giovani Studiosi‐Ricerche di carattere innovativo e di eccellenza proposte da giovani non strutturati, decreto rettorale n. 800‐2011, 23/03/2011"cUniversità degli Studi di Padova: grant " 3aCambisols 3aCastanea 3aFagus 3abedrock 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aelectrical conductivity 3aforested watersheds 3aforests 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic cycle 3apiezometers 3arain 3arunoff 3asoil water 3astream flow 3astreams 3atranspiration 3atrees 3awater table1 aMarchina, Chiara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8496-635X1 aGelmini, Ylenia1 aAmin, Anam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3202-82461 avan Meerveld, H.

Improvements in water quality in developed countries have reignited debate about the limitations of family-level taxonomy to detect subtle change, and is resulting in a shift back towards generic and species-level analysis to assess smaller effects. Although the scale of pollution characterizing past condition of streams in developed countries persists in many developing regions, some areas are still considered to be only moderately disturbed. We sampled streams in Belize to investigate the ability of family-level macroinvertebrate metrics to detect change in stream catchments where less than 30% of forest had been cleared. Where disturbance did not co-vary with natural gradients of change, and in areas characterized by low intensity activities, none of the metrics tested detected significant change, despite evidence of environmental impacts. We highlight the need for further research to clarify the response of metrics to disturbance over a broader study area that allows replication for confounding sources of natural variation. We also recommend research to develop more detailed understanding of the taxonomy and ecology of Neotropical macroinvertebrates to improve the robustness of metric use.  aPublisher supplied data 3amacroinvertebrates 3ataxonomy 3awater quality 3astreams 3awatersheds 3apollution 3aenvironmental impact 3aNeotropics 3adeveloped countries 3aforests 3aBelize 0aecology1 aDobson, Michael1 aBarlow, Jos0 tHydrobiologia.g2017 June, v. 794, no. 1 p.257-271dSpringer International Publishingx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3100-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011100170300001600281520124100297592002801538650001701566650002501583650001201608650001901620650001801639650002801657650002501685650001801710650001901728650001201747650002001759650001501779653004001794653001601834653002401850653002301874700002301897700002101920773014101941856008602082852000902168655001202177IND60576316620221121222540.0180727e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057631662DNAL7 a10.1080/14486563.2017.13287112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalzman, Scott10aExploring the economic viability of using constructed wetlands to manage waste-water in the dairy industry  ap. 276-288.  aIndustry faces increasing problems in dealing with waste products resulting from production processes. One specific problem is that of waste-water, where the management of production process waste often imposes costs, not only to the firm, but also to society. This article addresses the management of industry waste-water, from the perspective of both the individual firm and society in general, by analysing a case study of a dairy factory. Construction costs of horizontal subsurface flow wetlands of a sufficient size to treat a dairy factory’s process waste-waters are estimated. Short-term profitability objectives do not prompt project development, however, over the long term, some of the project options modelled reveal both a net private benefit and a net social benefit. In the absence of estimated externalities, projects become viable after 11 years (2 per cent discount rate), and 16 years (7 per cent discount rate). Without some form of environmental policy, no project options will be considered because of the company’s four-year return on investment rule. This highlights the policy dilemma associated with sharing the burden of the costs of improved environmental outcomes between the private and public sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aconstructed wetlands 3adairies 3adairy industry 3adiscount rate 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenvironmental policy 3aprofitability 3asocial benefit 3asociety 3asubsurface flow 3awastewater 0aHorizontal subsurface flow wetlands 0awaste-water 0anet private benefit 0anet social benefit1 aScarborough, Helen1 aAllinson, Graeme0 tAustralasian journal of environmental management.g2017 July 3, v. 24, no. 3 p.276-288dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19691x2159-53567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14486563.2017.13287113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245014900184520175900333592002802092650002402120650002502144650001402169650001102183650001402194650002302208650001002231650001302241650001502254650001002269650004102279650001002320650001302330650002102343650001302364650000902377650001102386650001702397650001902414650001902433650001702452650001402469650001402483650001402497650000902511650001102520653002802531653001702559653001802576653001602594653001402610653001002624700001802634700002702652700003202679700001702711773011202728856008602840852000902926655001202935IND60683674420221121101538.0210121e20200510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068367442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbas-Abadi, Mehrdad Seifali14aThe atmospheric, vacuum and pressurized pyrolysis of used bleaching soils along with polymeric wastes to reach the valuable and economical fuels  aThe atmospheric, vacuum and pressurized pyrolysis of oil-rich bleached soil with polymeric wastes was investigated using a semi batch stirred reactor. Also, the gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (GC/MS) instrument was used to measure the hydrocarbon components containing paraffin, olefin, naphtehene and aromatic (PONA) and carbon number of the liquid product which the liquid products were classified to the different commercial fuel ranges. The atmospheric co-pyrolysis of oil-rich bleached soil with polyethylene tended to produce the heavy hydrocarbons while the pressurized pyrolysis decreased the products molecular weight obviously. The atmospheric co-pyrolysis of oil-rich bleached soil with polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) shifted to the medium and light fuels respectively. Also, manual filtration of the co-pyrolysis oils with the regenerated fluid cracking catalyst (FCC) at ambient temperature showed that the obtained oil from co-pyrolysis of polypropylene and bleached soil did not require re-filtration and had a very light color. The vacuum co-pyrolysis of bleached soil and the polymers produced more liquid with less cyclic compounds and lighter color compared to nitrogen pyrolysis. The pressurized pyrolysis of polyethylene and bleached soil using different carrier gases such as nitrogen, hydrogen, ethylene and propylene, tended to produce the lighter products in the commercial fuels range. Also, re-polymerization of the obtained liquid from co-pyrolysis, was carried out using benzoyl peroxide at 95 °C and atmospheric pressure, which only polystyrene and bleached soil co-pyrolysis product was able to take part in the polymerization process and two other co-pyrolysis products did not react with peroxide clearly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aatmospheric pressure 3ableaching 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic cracking 3acolor 3aethylene 3afiltration 3afuels 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agases 3ahydrogen 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3aoils 3aolefin 3apolyethylene 3apolymerization 3apolypropylenes 3apolystyrenes 3apropylene 3apyrolysis 3arecycling 3asoil 3awastes 0aOil-reach bleached soil 0aPolyethylene 0aPolypropylene 0aPolystyrene 0aPyrolysis 0aFuel.1 aJalali, Aazam1 aRostami, Mohammad Reza1 aHaghighi, Mehdi Nekoomanesh1 aFarhadi, Ali0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 May 10, v. 255 p.120328-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005200138245015500190300001600345500002000361520157700381592002801958596005001986650001402036650002002050650002402070650001402094650001202108650002102120650001702141650001602158700001702174700001402191700001502205700001302220700001802233773012202251856007302373852000902446655001202455IND60789449520221119005154.0220820e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078944952DNAL7 a10.1002/osp4.2702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoda, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1492-014510aMen who were thin during early adulthood exhibited greater weight gain‐associated visceral fat accumulation in a study of middle‐aged Japanese men  ap. 289-295.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the relationship between weight gain from early adulthood and visceral fat accumulation. METHODS: The participants were 549 men aged 42 to 64 years who were randomly selected from the local resident registry for the National Institute for Longevity Sciences' neighbourhood. They were asked to recall their weight at 18 years of age, and then, post‐18 weight‐change values were calculated for each participant (their current weight minus their weight at 18). The participants were divided according to their median body mass index (BMI) at 18 years of age (initial BMI) (<20.14 and ≥20.14 kg m⁻²). Visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) were measured on computed tomography scans. RESULTS: The participants with initial BMI of <20.14 kg m⁻² exhibited greater post‐18 weight changes than those with initial BMI of ≥20.14 kg m⁻². The participants' post‐18 weight‐change values were negatively correlated with their initial BMI and positively correlated with both VFA and SFA. The slope of the regression line for the relationship between post‐18 weight change and VFA was steeper in the participants with initial BMI of <20.14 kg m⁻² (β = 4.36) than in those with initial BMI of ≥20.14 kg m⁻² (β = 3.23). CONCLUSIONS: Visceral fat accumulation is affected not only by an individual's post‐18 weight gain but also by their initial BMI. Men who were thin in early adulthood experienced greater weight gain‐associated VFA increases, but the same was not true for SFA.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan 3aadulthood 3abody mass index 3acomputed tomography 3alongevity 3aobesity 3asubcutaneous fat 3avisceral fat 3aweight gain1 aKitamura, I.1 aOkura, T.1 aOtsuka, R.1 aAndo, F.1 aShimokata, H.0 tObesity science & practice.g2018 June, v. 4, no. 3 p.289-295dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27210x2055-22387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/osp4.2703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04813naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100002300192245014300215506007600358520278100434592002803215506003703243650000803280650002203288650001203310650001903322650001503341650002803356650002903384650002503413650003003438650000903468650001603477650001303493650002203506650002803528650001303556650000703569650001803576650001503594650001103609650001103620650002803631650002503659650001303684650001803697651001003715653002403725653002603749653007303775653002103848653004003869653002203909700002503931700001903956773009303975856008604068852000904154655001204163IND60690886320221207130945.0210619e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069088632DNAL7 a313044132pmid7 aPMC66032832pmcid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e019252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBedu-Addo, Kenneth14aThe AKOBEN programme as a tool towards responsible gold mining in Ghana, business as usual or a commitment towards sustainable development  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe AKOBEN Programme, an environmental performance rating and disclosure initiative that show the environmental performance of gold mining firms with reference to their daily activities post environmental impact assessment and issuance of an environmental permit was introduced in Ghana to serve as a monitoring and verification tool towards environmental compliance and responsible mining. As to whether the AKOBEN Programme is enhancing the environment and or safeguarding public health in Ghana needs to be investigated. A systematic multi-methods environmental audit approach comprising of comparative analysis, time series analysis, air and water quality indices were used within the framework of the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response to answer the questions what is happening to the environment and what the consequences for the environment and humanity are. The quality and suitability of River Kwabrafo as a habitat for aquatic life, for agricultural, recreational and drinking purposes pre and post AKOBEN Programme introduction as well as the quality of agricultural soils and river sediments in gold mining communities was determined. The study revealed that the AKOBEN Programme rates gold mining firms based on variable-by-variable concentrations of toxic water pollutants such as As, Cd, Hg, CN and non-toxic water pollutants such as pH, suspended solids, dissolved solids and electrical conductivity without taking into account the cumulative effect of the pollutants and the various uses of water. Results on the quality of River Kwabrafo based on the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index confirmed no differences in water quality concerning use for agriculture, recreation, drinking and as a habitat for aquatic life before and after the introduction of the AKOBEN Programme. The study also revealed the quality of air at Anyinam to be acceptable with reference to PM10 and unhealthy with reference to total suspended particulate (TSP). The AKOBEN Programme failed to delineate TSP into oxides of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methyl mercury and oxides of sulphur for which reason the impacts of greenhouse gases and methyl mercury on the Obuasi Municipality could not be investigated under the AKOBEN Programme. Mean arsenic concentrations for all study sites exceeded the arsenic reference for Ghana with significant differences existing between mean soil Cd and Hg levels at AKOBEN sites, Non-AKOBEN sites and Control sites. This study will not only elucidate the environmental and health problems associated with gold mining operations at AKOBEN and Non-AKOBEN sites in Ghana, but will also present complex water quality data into simple communication format for easy understanding to policy makers and non-expert audience.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aaquatic organisms 3aarsenic 3acarbon dioxide 3acompliance 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental audits 3aenvironmental performance 3agold 3agreenhouses 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3amethylmercury compounds 3anitrogen 3apH 3apublic health 3arecreation 3arivers 3asulfur 3asustainable development 3atime series analysis 3atoxicity 3awater quality 3aGhana 0aAtmospheric science 0aEnvironmental science 0aCanadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index 0aAKOBEN programme 0aVariable-by-variable concentrations 0aAir quality index1 aOfori-Kuragu, Martha1 aArthur, Abeiku0 tHeliyon.g2019 June, v. 5, no. 6 p.e01925-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e019253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245006700172506002800239506003200267520137900299592002801678596008301706596004501789506003701834650001201871650001201883650001401895650002401909650000901933650001801942650002001960650002201980650002202002650001702024650001502041650000702056650002402063650002402087650001702111650001302128700001702141700002202158700002302180700002702203700002302230773012702253856008502380903002202465852000902487655001202496IND60742634920221207090152.0210624e20210608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074263492DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90612442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehnke, Gevan D.10aSoil Microbial Indicators within Rotations and Tillage Systems  aResource is Open Access  aMDPI AG License Information  aRecent advancements in agricultural metagenomics allow for characterizing microbial indicators of soil health brought on by changes in management decisions, which ultimately affect the soil environment. Field-scale studies investigating the microbial taxa from agricultural experiments are sparse, with none investigating the long-term effect of crop rotation and tillage on microbial indicator species. Therefore, our goal was to determine the effect of rotations (continuous corn, CCC; continuous soybean, SSS; and each phase of a corn-soybean rotation, Cs and Sc) and tillage (no-till, NT; and chisel tillage, T) on the soil microbial community composition following 20 years of management. We found that crop rotation and tillage influence the soil environment by altering key soil properties, such as pH and soil organic matter (SOM). Monoculture corn lowered pH compared to SSS (5.9 vs. 6.9, respectively) but increased SOM (5.4% vs. 4.6%, respectively). Bacterial indicator microbes were categorized into two groups: SOM dependent and acidophile vs. N adverse and neutrophile. Fungi preferred the CCC rotation, characterized by low pH. Archaeal indicators were mainly ammonia oxidizers with species occupying niches at contrasting pHs. Numerous indicator microbes are involved with N cycling due to the fertilizer-rich environment, prone to aquatic or gaseous losses.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArchaea 3aammonia 3achiseling 3acommunity structure 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3aedaphic factors 3aindicator species 3along term effects 3ametagenomics 3ano-tillage 3apH 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil organic matter 3asoil quality 3asoybeans1 aKim, Nakian 1 aZabaloy, Maria C.1 aRiggins, Chance W.1 aRodriguez-Zas, Sandra 1 aVillamil, Maria B.0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 June 08, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90612443Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle03542naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002600176245009900202300001500301520178400316592002802100650002002128650001702148650001602165650001902181650004102200650001902241650001902260650002102279650001902300650001502319650002802334650002402362650001102386650001302397650001402410650001202424650001702436650003302453700001502486700001802501700002302519700001802542700002202560700001802582700002202600773015202622856007002774856010002844990002302944852000902967655001202976IND60608614820221120164824.0190510e20171110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060861482DNAL7 a10.3791/565962doi7 aPMC57553432pmcid7 a291557762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadasamy, Shanmugavel10aDifferential effects of lipid-lowering drugs in modulating morphology of cholesterol particles  ap. e56596.  aTreatment of dyslipidemia patients with lipid-lowering drugs leads to a significant reduction in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) level and a low to moderate level of increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in plasma. However, a possible role of these drugs in altering morphology and distribution of cholesterol particles is poorly understood. Here, we describe the in vitro evaluation of lipid-lowering drug effects in modulating morphological features of cholesterol particles using the plaque array method in combination with imaging flow cytometry. Image analyses of the cholesterol particles indicated that lovastatin, simvastatin, ezetimibe, and atorvastatin induce the formation of both globular and linear strand-shaped particles, whereas niacin, fibrates, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin induce the formation of only globular-shaped particles. Next, purified very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL particles incubated with these drugs showed changes in the morphology and image texture of cholesterol particles subpopulations. Furthermore, screening of 50 serum samples revealed the presence of a higher level of linear shaped HDL cholesterol particles in subjects with dyslipidemia (mean of 18.3%) compared to the age-matched normal (mean of 11.1%) samples. We also observed considerable variations in lipid-lowering drug effects on reducing linear shaped LDL and HDL cholesterol particles formation in serum samples. These findings indicate that lipid-lowering drugs, in addition to their cell-mediated hypolipidemic effects, may directly modulate morphology of cholesterol particles by a non-enzymatic mechanism of action. The outcomes of these results have potential to inform diagnosis of atherosclerosis and predict optimal lipid-lowering therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3aatorvastatin 3ablood serum 3aflow cytometry 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahyperlipidemia 3aimage analysis 3ain vitro studies 3alipemic effect 3alovastatin 3alow density lipoprotein 3amechanism of action 3aniacin 3apatients 3ascreening 3atexture 3atherapeutics 3avery low density lipoprotein1 aLiu, David1 aLundry, Jason1 aAlderete, Benjamin1 aKong, Raymond1 aRobinson, J.

However, little is known about pipe‐to‐stream connectivity and whether blocking methods used to impede flow in open ditch networks and gullies also work on pipe networks. Two streams in a heavily degraded blanket bog (southern Pennines, UK) were used to assess whether impeding drainage from pipe networks alters the streamflow responses to storm events, and how such intervention affects the hydrological functioning of the pipe network and the surrounding peat. Pipeflow was impeded in half of the pipe outlets in one stream, either by inserting a plug‐like structure in the pipe‐end or by the insertion of a vertical screen at the pipe outlet perpendicular to the direction of the predicted pipe course. Statistical response variable η² showed the overall effects of pipe outlet blocking on stream responses were small with η² = 0.022 for total storm runoff, η² = 0.097 for peak discharge, η² = 0.014 for peak lag, and η² = 0.207 for response index. Both trialled blocking methods either led to new pipe outlets appearing or seepage occurring around blocks within 90 days of blocking. Discharge from four individual pipe outlets was monitored for 17 months before blocking and contributed 11.3% of streamflow. Pipe outlets on streambanks with headward retreat produced significantly larger peak flows and storm contributions to streamflow compared to pipe outlets that issued onto straight streambank sections. We found a distinctive distance‐decay effect of the water table around pipe outlets, with deeper water tables around pipe outlets that issued onto straight streambanks sections. We suggest that impeding pipeflow at pipe outlets would exacerbate pipe development in the gully edge zone, and propose that future pipe blocking efforts in peatlands prioritize increasing the residence time of pipe water by forming surface storage higher up the pipe network.  aPublisher supplied data  aEU‐MoorLife2020‐D3cMoors for the Future Partnership 3acarbon 3adrainage 3apeat 3apeatlands 3ariparian areas 3aseepage 3astorms 3astormwater 3astream flow 3astreams 3asurface storage 3awater table1 aChapman, Pippa J.1 aPilkington, Michael G.1 aChandler, David M.1 aEvans, M.

Dichocarpum auriculatum (Franch.) W. T. Wang et P. K. Hsiao has the effect of clearing away heat, removing toxicity, and relieving swelling in southwestern China. Intriguingly, its root and whole herb also used as remedy for the neurological disease epilepsy. However, there are not any scientific reports on the phytochemistry and pharmacological activities of D. auriculatum.Traditional and folk medicinal knowledge would be useful for finding new pharmaceutical resources. There are many evidences over the years reported that an interaction probably exists between epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the study was to investigate the potential AChE inhibitors and the phytochemical profiles of the specie D. auriculatum.The AChE inhibitory activity of plant extracts of D. auriculatum and other 6 species from different regions of the genus Dichocarpum were evaluated in vitro assays and the UPLC-Q-TOF-MS technique was used to analyze the chemical constituents. Moreover, UPLC-ESI-MS/MS was used to determine the distribution of 12 standard compounds in samples.As a preferred source of potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors of the genus Dichocarpum, D. auriculatum has been further investigated. The screening results show that the ability of root extracts from D. auriculatum (IC50 = 0.15 mg·mL-1) to inhibit AChE was better than other samples, it is consistent with traditional medicinal records. The phytochemical constituents of D. auriculatum was surveyed firstly by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis, and 36 compounds, including 14 alkaloids, 16 flavonoids, 6 others, were identified tentatively. Further experiments showed that five compounds (columbamine, palmatine, dauricine, jatrorrhizine and berberine) from D. auriculatum were confirmed the potential inhibition of AChE activity in vitro (IC50: 0.24–6.37 μM) and UPLC-ESI-MS/MS results showed that the content of most active compounds in roots was much higher than in aerial parts. Palmatine (IC50 = 0.34 μM) and columbamine (IC50 = 0.24 μM) showed prominent AChE inhibitory activity among the tested compounds.This is the first report about the evaluation of AChE inhibitory activity and phytochemical profiles of D. auriculatum, led to the identification of 36 compounds including alkaloids and flavonoids, and five alkaloids exhibited a significant AChE inhibitory activity and had the potential as AChE inhibitors. This study provided scientific experimental basis for the traditional efficacy of neurological disease of the plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aDichocarpum auriculatum 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aactive ingredients 3aaerial parts 3aberberine 3achemical constituents of plants 3acholinesterase inhibitors 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aepilepsy 3aflavonoids 3aheat 3ain vitro studies 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amedicinal properties 3aroot extracts 3aroots 3ascreening 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aChina 0aAlkaloids 0aPhytochemical analysis 0aUPLC-MS1 aLiu, Shuangshuang1 aLiu, Qing1 aShen, Jie1 aYang, Runmei1 aJiang, Baoping1 aChunnian, He1 aXiao, Peigen0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2019 Aug. 22, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1121853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012000170520126900290592002801559650002301587650001801610650003301628651001601661653002901677653001401706653001701720653001601737653003401753700001801787700001901805700001501824773011201839856008601951852000902037655001202046IND60683675020221122065044.0210121e20200510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068367502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAitken, Robert14aThe positive role of labelling on consumers’ perceived behavioural control and intention to purchase organic food  aThe consumption of organic food has increased dramatically in recent years in response to consumers’ concerns with issues related to health, well-being and the environment. However, further increases are restricted by a number of barriers, one of the most important of which is information. Using the Reasoned Action Approach (RAA), this study is the first to examine the role of product specific information (labelling) to understand the gap between consumer attitude and behavioural intention to purchase organic food products. Based on responses from 1,052 New Zealand consumers, analysis using structural equation modelling demonstrates that labelling plays an important role within the perceived behavioural control dimension of the RAA, as well as directly on attitudes, in influencing behavioural intention. The more that respondents agree that labelling is actionable, the more positive their attitude and sense of control, and hence intention and (self-reported) behaviour. These findings suggest that by improving labelling systems to include more actionable information, such as the health, environmental and societal benefits of products, consumers perceived behavioural control can be increased to strengthen intentions to purchase organic products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer attitudes 3aorganic foods 3astructural equation modeling 3aNew Zealand 0aReasoned action approach 0aLabelling 0aOrganic food 0aInformation 0aPerceived behavioural control1 aWatkins, Leah1 aWilliams, John1 aKean, Anna0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 May 10, v. 255 p.120334-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03262naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012400165520163700289592002801926650001301954650001701967650001501984650001701999650001902016650002102035650001902056650002802075650001302103650000902116650001802125650003102143650001202174650001902186650001602205650001702221650001302238650000902251653003202260653003302292653003002325653002302355653002102378700001702399700001602416700001902432700001702451700001502468700001802483773011202501856008602613852000902699655001202708IND60683675120221122065030.0200412e20200520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068367512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yi10aDeveloping a stable high-performance soybean meal-based adhesive using a simple high-pressure homogenization technology  aSoybean meal (SM), a byproduct of bean oil production, was recycled to develop a bio-adhesive capable of replacing formaldehyde-based wood adhesives. However, SM’s large particle size, uneven particle size distribution, and hydrophilic hydrogen bonds result in SM adhesives’ exhibiting low adhesion stability and poor water resistance. Traditional chemical modification methods do not sufficiently mitigate these complications, and consequently SM adhesives must overcome some significant challenges before they can be considered for industrial application. In this work, we propose a simple, clean and physical high-pressure homogenization (HPH) technology in conjunction with eco-friendly cross-linking to develop a stable high-performance bio-based adhesive. Results showed that HPH treatment reduced the SM’s particle size by 62% and increased the particle size distribution uniformity, which significantly enhanced the adhesive’s bonding stability. Furthermore, many active functional groups inside the soy protein were simultaneously unmasked during HPH, which increased their reactivity with the cross-linker. This facilitated the formation of covalent bond complexes with a denser structure in the adhesive system, thereby improving the SM adhesive’s water resistance. Specifically, after the HPH treatment, the resultant plywood’s wet shear strength marked a 212% increase compared to that of untreated SM adhesive, which meets the requirements for indoor use. Moreover, this method has been successfully applied in pilot scale industrial production, and thereby shows broad prospects for practical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abioadhesives 3abyproducts 3acrosslinking 3ahomogenization 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophilicity 3aindustrial applications 3amoieties 3aoils 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aplywood 3ashear strength 3asoy protein 3asoybean meal 3asoybeans 3awood 0aSoybean meal-based adhesive 0aHigh-pressure homogenization 0aCrosslinking modification 0aAdhesion stability 0aWater resistance1 aShi, Ruiqing1 aXu, Yecheng1 aChen, Mingsong1 aZhang, Jieyu1 aGao, Qiang1 aLi, Jianzhang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 May 20, v. 256 p.120336-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009300173300001800266520138500284592002801669650001101697650001501708650002001723650001201743650001201755650001001767650002001777650001401797650002201811650002101833650002001854651001701874651001201891653001401903653002201917653001101939653002101950700002101971700002601992700002402018700002702042700002202069773012602091856008602217852000902303655001202312IND60576317120221122023209.0190523e20170726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057631712DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2017.13327902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuirola, Diego R.10aUse of a rostral appendage during social interactions in the Ecuadorian Anolis proboscis  ap. 1625-1638.  aThe use of sexually selected characters in inter- and intra-sexual interactions has long been of interest to evolutionary biologists. Recently, a distinction between sexually selected traits as ornaments versus weapons has been advanced. We investigated the behaviour of an enigmatic lizard with a prominent sexually dimorphic trait in an effort to describe whether the trait was the product of sexual selection and further whether it functioned as a weapon or an ornament. The subject of our study was the Ecuadorian proboscis anole (Anolis proboscis), a slow-moving cryptic species endemic to the north-western slopes of the Andes in Ecuador. Males, but not females, of this species bear a rostral appendage that has been described as an exaggerated trait resulting from sexual selection. However, a thorough description of the use of the rostral appendage in social interactions is lacking. Here, we describe social interactions of this species during 11 male–female courtships and mating interactions, as well as three male–male agonistic interactions. We describe four types of displays by males, many involving the rostral appendage. We found that the rostral appendage is used as an ornament in social displays but not as a weapon in combat. We also show that, unlike other lizards with rostral appendages, male A. proboscis hatch with this structure already developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnolis 3aappendages 3acryptic species 3afemales 3alizards 3amales 3amating behavior 3aproboscis 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual selection 3asocial behavior 3aAndes region 3aEcuador 0aBehaviour 0aexaggerated trait 0aAnolis 0asexual selection1 aMármol, Andrés1 aTorres-Carvajal, Omar1 aNarváez, Andrea E.1 aAyala-Varela, Fernando1 aMoore, Ignacio T.0 tJournal of natural history.g2017 July 26, v. 51, no. 27-28 p.1625-1638dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12296x1464-52627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2017.13327903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009600168300001800264520140600282592002801688650001701716650002301733650002001756650002401776650001101800650001001811650001101821650002501832653003201857653002201889653001701911653003501928653004901963700001402012700001602026700001802042700001902060773009202079856008502171852000902256655001202265IND60607859720221118041421.0180830e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060785972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Yongchang10aTrip-oriented stochastic optimal energy management strategy for plug-in hybrid electric bus  ap. 1259-1271.  aA trip-oriented stochastic optimal energy management strategy for plug-in hybrid electric bus is presented in this paper, which includes the offline stochastic dynamic programming part and the online implementation part performed by equivalent consumption minimization strategy. In the offline part, historical driving cycles of the fixed route are divided into segments according to the position of bus stops, and then a segment-based stochastic driving condition model based on Markov chain is built. With the segment-based stochastic model obtained, the control set for real-time implemented equivalent consumption minimization strategy can be achieved by solving the offline stochastic dynamic programming problem. Results of stochastic dynamic programming are converted into a 3-dimensional lookup table of parameters for online implemented equivalent consumption minimization strategy. The proposed strategy is verified by both simulation and hardware-in-loop test of real-world driving cycle on an urban bus route. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms both the well-tuned equivalent consumption minimization strategy and the rule-based strategy in terms of fuel economy, and even proved to be close to the optimal result obtained by dynamic programming. Furthermore, the practical application potential of the proposed control method was proved by hardware-in-loop test.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3abus transportation 3acontrol methods 3adynamic programming 3aenergy 3afuels 3amodels 3avehicles (equipment) 0aPlug-in hybrid electric bus 0aEnergy management 0aMarkov chain 0aStochastic dynamic programming 0aEquivalent consumption minimization strategy1 aZhao, Yue1 aWang, Qinpu1 aZhang, Yuanbo1 aXia, Huaicheng0 tEnergy.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 115 p.1259-1271dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245018000167300001600347520143500363592002801798650003201826650003101858650000901889650002601898650002601924650001301950650001201963650002101975650001001996650001802006650001702024650001302041650001602054651001202070700002302082700002402105700001902129700002202148700002302170700002302193700002302216700002002239700001902259773010702278856008102385852000902466655001202475IND60572903320221118221853.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057290332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-017-3137-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMozsár, Attila10aInfluence of environmental factors and individual traits on the diet of non-native hybrid bigheaded carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix × H. nobilis) in Lake Balaton, Hungary  ap. 317-332.  aPlanktivorous silver carp and bighead carp (collectively, the bigheaded carps) have been stocked worldwide and their invasion has caused severe impacts on many freshwater ecosystems. Exploiting the chance provided by the specific hybrid bigheaded carp stock in Lake Balaton (Hungary) covering the entire morphological range between the two species (including gill raker morphology), we implemented a comprehensive study (1) to reveal the feeding habits of hybrid bigheaded carps living in a mesotrophic, lacustrine habitat and (2) to assess how biotic and abiotic environmental factors and gill raker morphology affect diet composition. We found that all bigheaded carps utilized primarily zooplankton and neglected the scarce and inefficiently digestible phytoplankton, irrespective of gill raker morphology. Moreover, we observed strikingly high levels of inorganic debris consumption, but the proportion of inorganic matter in the guts was not associated directly with the concentration of suspended inorganic particles. Variance in the diet composition of bigheaded carps was related mostly to environmental factors, including the wind-induced resuspension of inorganic particles and seasonally variable availability of food resources. In conclusion, the effects of abiotic environmental factors and available food resources could overwhelm the effect of gill raker morphology in shaping the feeding habits of bigheaded carps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3aHypophthalmichthys nobilis 3adiet 3aenvironmental factors 3afreshwater ecosystems 3ahabitats 3ahybrids 3ainorganic matter 3alakes 3aphytoplankton 3aplanktivores 3avariance 3azooplankton 3aHungary1 aSpecziár, András1 aBattonyai, Izabella1 aBorics, Gábor1 aGörgényi, Judit1 aHorváth, Hajnalka1 aPrésing, Mátyás1 aG.-Tóth, László1 aVitál, Zoltán1 aBoros, Gergely0 tHydrobiologia.g2017 June, v. 794, no. 1 p.317-332dSpringer International Publishingx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3137-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011000164300001800274520132400292592002801616650001101644650002101655650002601676650002701702653002601729653002201755653002901777653002101806653001801827700001401845700001401859773009201873856008501965852000902050655001202059IND60607859820221118041420.0180830e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060785982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, W.10aNumerical investigation into the effects of arm motion and camber on a self-induced oscillating hydrofoil  ap. 1010-1021.  aA new concept of power generator using self-induced oscillating hydrofoil with upwind arm and downwind arm configurations to extract energy from fluid is proposed and numerically tested in the present study. The pitching motion of the symmetrical hydrofoil with camber is induced by the shedding vortexes downward the hydrofoil, and a pitching damper with critical pitching angle is utilized to control the pitching amplitude. Two-dimensional Navier-Stokes simulation at Re = 1100 are carried out to study the fluid-hydrofoil interaction as well as the performance of energy extraction. The effects of camber, critical pitching angle, arm length and swing direction are systematically studied. Numerical results demonstrate that camber and critical pitching angle have significant effects on the energy extraction performance of the power generator, and optimized camber and critical pitching angle configurations can increase the power coefficient and efficiency dramatically. With best structural parameters and hydrofoil shape, the power generator can reach maximum power coefficient of 0.8 and energy extraction efficiency of 0.285. Besides, the upwind arm configuration achieves better performance over the downwind arm configuration. The effect of arm length is not so profound as other parameters in our study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aequipment design 3aequipment performance 3agenerators (equipment) 0aOscillating hydrofoil 0aEnergy extraction 0aVortex-induced vibration 0aRenewable energy 0aCamber effect1 aZhang, D.1 aXie, Y.H.0 tEnergy.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 115 p.1010-1021dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01703naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012300166300001800289520061100307592002800918650004300946650001200989650002001001653002901021653003501050653001601085700001501101700001801116700001501134700001701149773010501166856008501271852000901356655001201365IND60524198420221122220331.0160705e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052419842DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.11135302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jing10aMulti-components determination by single reference standard and HPLC fingerprint analysis for Lamiophlomis rotata Pill  ap. 1561-1564.  aA validated HPLC method was developed to evaluate the quality of Lamiophlomis rotata Pill combining the multi-components analysis by single reference standard with HPLC fingerprint analysis.

However, few studies have focused on the effects of fire on soil respiration (Rₛ) and its heterotrophic (Rₕ) and autotrophic (Rₐ) components. In this study, we examined the response of Rₛ, Rₕ, and Rₐ to fire and the driving factors that affect Rₛ after a fire disturbance in a Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii) forest in northeastern China. Fire disturbance significantly increased Rₕ by approximately 24% and significantly reduced Rₐ by approximately 66% in burned plots compared to unburned plots. The ratio of Rₕ to Rₛ significantly increased from 0.57 in the unburned plots to 0.79 in the burned plots. Fire disturbance also led to cumulative Rₛ C efflux increasing by approximately 10% and 28% during the growing season and the period of spring freeze–thaw cycles (FTC) in the burned plots. Furthermore, using structural equation modelling, we showed that T₅ (soil temperature at 5 cm depth) was the main abiotic factor affecting Rₛ in both unburned and burned plots. Fine root biomass (FR) was the dominant biotic driver of Rₛ in the control plots, whereas microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was the dominant biotic driver of Rₛ in burned plots. Our findings demonstrated a significant discrepancy in the response of Rₛ components to fire disturbance. Forest fires can cause considerable losses of soil C in a cold temperate forest ecosystem, which suggests that proactive management of forest regeneration should be carried out after forest fire disturbances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix gmelinii 3abiomass 3acold 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3afine roots 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest fires 3aforest regeneration 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3amicrobial carbon 3asoil carbon 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3aspring 3atemperate forests 3aChina 0aFire disturbance 0aSoil respiration 0aSoil heterotrophic respiration 0aSoil autotrophic respiration 0aLarix gmelinii 0aCold temperature forest1 aZhao, Binqing1 aLi, Fei1 aDou, Xu1 aHu, Haiqing1 aSun, Long0 tGeoderma.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 402 p.115273-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1152733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013900168300001800307520160600325592002801931650001501959650001501974650002501989650002302014650001202037650002602049650001102075650002202086650002302108650001202131650001502143650002502158650001302183650001302196650001102209650001202220650001002232650001202242651001102254700002202265700002602287700002602313773010702339856004802446852000902494655001202503IND50069366920221122063143.0130926e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006936692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-013-0545-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabrini, Isaías10aRichness and composition of Calliphoridae in an Atlantic Forest fragment: implication for the use of dipteran species as bioindicators  ap. 2635-2643.  aStudies measuring the damage in degraded environments have increased, and it is necessary to obtain reliable biological and ecological indicators for the recovery of such degraded environments and subsequent preservation. This study aimed to conduct a survey of local insects and evaluate their utility in monitoring forest restoration in a degraded area in the Atlantic Forest biome in Ribeirao Grande, State of São Paulo, Brazil. Collections with Shuey traps were conducted from 2006 to 2011 in four distinct forest fragments characterized by environmental impacts, human actions, and phytophysiognomic profiles: Forest (FO), a preserved area with native plant species; "Capoeira" (CA), an area in the natural regeneration process; Planting (PL), an area reforested with native plants; and Pasture (PA), an area with only shrubs. A total of 2,456 specimens of Calliphoridae (Diptera) were collected. Mesembrinella bellardiana was the most abundant (n = 1,884) and dominant species in all environments sampled. The relative abundance of M. bellardiana in the most preserved environment (60.2 % FO, 24.4 % CA, 8.6 % PL, and 6.7 % PA) and other ecological parameters showed that it could be a bioindicator species, i.e., data on its presence or absence directly reflected the status of local preservation. Information on Neotropical dipterans associated with the forested environment is very scarce in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the occurrence of Calliphora lopesi (Calliphoridae) in the State of São Paulo. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalliphora 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest restoration 3aforests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahumans 3aindicator species 3aindigenous species 3ainsects 3amonitoring 3anatural regeneration 3apastures 3aplanting 3ashrubs 3asurveys 3atraps 3atropics 3aBrazil1 aGrella, Maicon D.1 aAndrade, Carlos F.

Inbred lines 38-11 (moderately resistant) and H55 (susceptible) and their F₁, F₂, BC₁, and BC₂ progenies were evaluated at two testing sites. Numerous variables, including the possible confounding effect of the presence of additional viruses inciting stunting in corn, prevented a valid classical Mendelian analysis. Genetic ratios proved meaningless due to substantial variation in disease scores even in true-breeding entries. However, resistance appeared to be partially dominant, and indirect evidence from other studies in Missouri indicate that (1) resistance is due to more than one gene, or (2) the host plants respond differentially to a heterogeneous virus population. Artificial inoculations of corn with pure isolates of maize dwarf mosaic virus are recommended for the determination of genetic ratios and gene numbers associated with resistance. But for experiments in the field in which the objectives are to determine the level of resistance and dominance relationships, diallel mating schemes employing F₁ hybrids are recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaize dwarf mosaic virus 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3acorn 3agenes 3aviruses 3aMissouri1 aZuber, M.

The main steps involved are fixation of the bacterial cell culture, permeabilization of cell membranes, and hybridization of the target transcripts with sets of commercially available short fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide probes. smFISH can allow the imaging of the transcripts of multiple genes in the same cell, with limitations imposed by the spectral overlap between different fluorescent markers. Following completion of the protocol illustrated below, cells can be readily imaged using a microscope coupled with a camera suitable for low-intensity fluorescence. These images, together with cell contours obtained from segmentation of phase contrast frames, or from cell membrane staining, allow the calculation of the mRNA copy number distribution of a sample of cells using open-source or custom-written software. The labeling method described here can also be applied to image transcripts with stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3acameras 3acell culture 3acell membranes 3acomputer software 3afluorescence 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3aimage analysis 3amessenger RNA 3amicroscopy 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aoligonucleotide probes 3apermeability 3astaining1 aShapiro, Yonathan,1 aStavans, Joel0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Dec. 21, , no. 130 p.e56600-e56600dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/566003Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56600/method-for-labeling-transcripts-individual-escherichia-coli-cells-for  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003900147245010700186300001400293520141100307592002801718650001601746650001101762650002201773650001501795650001701810650001201827650002501839650001501864650001301879651001101892651001101903651001501914651001201929651001201941651000901953651001701962651001201979651001401991700002602005700004002031700003702071700003502108700002202143700002902165773010502194856008102299852000902380655001202389IND60572903720221118221845.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057290372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-016-3082-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Maria Jaqueline Sousa10aTwo African origins of naturalized brown mussel (Perna perna) in Brazil: past and present bioinvasions  ap. 59-72.  aShipping has facilitated dispersion of exotic marine species, the genetic diversity of which may allow determination of their geographic origins. The economically important African brown mussel (Perna perna) is widely distributed along the southeastern and southern Brazilian coasts, and for which information on genetic diversity and origins is scarce. Five populations, along 2,500 km of Brazilian coast, were genetically characterized to test for homogeneity, verify haplotype and nucleotide diversity levels, and infer relationships among Brazilian and African P. perna. Mitochondrial COI gene sequences of 488 bp were obtained from 158 Brazilian P. perna, and from GenBank for other locations. The nuclear fragment rRNA18S-ITS1 was used as a species-specific marker. The five Brazilian locations were homogeneous, being composed of two mitochondrial haplogroups: haplogroup 1, with low genetic diversity, was linked to Tunisia, Morocco, and Mauritania, and haplogroup 2, with high genetic diversity, shared haplotypes with Brazil, Venezuela, western South Africa, Namibia and Angola. Haplotypes from southeastern Africa and from Oman were not found in Brazil. Patterns in genetic structure, diversity, and haplotype relationships of haplogroup 2 appear related to past trade routes between former African colonies and Brazil, whereas the low diversity of haplogroup 1 suggests more recent invasions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerna perna 3acoasts 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondria 3amussels 3anucleotide sequences 3aprovenance 3ashipping 3aAngola 3aBrazil 3aMauritania 3aMorocco 3aNamibia 3aOman 3aSouth Africa 3aTunisia 3aVenezuela1 aBeasley, Colin Robert1 aBarros, Neidson Giliard Vasconcelos1 ado Socorro Marques-Silva, Nelane1 aSimone, Luiz Ricardo Lopes de,1 aLima, Elvis Silva1 aTagliaro, Claudia Helena0 tHydrobiologia.g2017 June, v. 794, no. 1 p.59-72dSpringer International Publishingx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-3082-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015500170520099200325592002801317650002501345650001701370650001301387650002101400650001701421650001501438650000701453650001101460650001301471650001501484650001001499650000901509700002501518700002301543700002301566700002501589700006301614773011101677856008601788852000901874655001201883IND60781483220221120141437.0220906e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078148322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2022.1054422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKheroufi, Afaf10aWhey protein-derived peptides: The impact of chicken pepsin hydrolysis upon whey proteins concentrate on their biological and technological properties  aWhey proteins concentrate (WPC) was hydrolysed by chicken pepsin extract (CPE) compared with commercial porcine pepsin (PP), and the impact on biological (antioxidant) and technological properties (solubility, emulsifying activity index (EAI) and foaming activity (FA)) was studied.

The obtained results with CPE are very promising and suggest that they could be suitable for application in functional food as natural ingredients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achickens 3afunctional foods 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3apH 3apepsin 3apeptides 3asolubility 3aswine 3awhey1 aBrassesco, María E.1 aCampos, Débora A.1 aMouzai, Abdelghani1 aBoughellouta, Halima1 aPintado, Manuela E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0760-31840 tInternational dairy journal.g2022 Nov., v. 134 p.105442-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2022.1054423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100002200192245010800214500001900322506007600341520105800417592002801475506003701503650002201540650001201562650001201574650001101586650001301597650001401610653001801624653001701642700002501659700002101684773009201705856008601797852000901883655001201892IND60690887420221207132803.0201230e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069088742DNAL7 a311934002pmid7 aPMC65297622pmcid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e017562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPustake, Sneha O.10aStatistical media optimization for the production of clinical uricase from Bacillus subtilis strain SP6  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, a potent uricase producing organism was isolated by a thorough screening and identified as Bacillus subtilis strain SP6 by using 16s rDNA sequencing. Response surface methodological optimization was employed for the enhanced production of uricase from newly isolated Bacillus subtilis strain SP6. In media optimization studies, Plackett Burman (PB) design was used for the selection of the critical media components; which were further optimized using central composite design (CCD). Lactose, soya peptone, uric acid and FeSO₄.7H₂O were found to be the critical factors influencing the enzyme production. Optimum uricase production with these factors was deduced using central composite design. Significant level of the factors were 12.2 g/L of lactose, 12.79 g/L of soya peptone, 2.55 g/L of uric acid and 0.00325 g/L FeSO₄.7H₂O. Use of statistical optimization upsurges uricase yield from 1.2 U/ml to 15.87 U/ml enhancing the overall production by 13.23 fold; which confirms that the model is effective for process optimization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aenzymes 3alactose 3amodels 3apeptones 3auric acid 0aBiotechnology 0aMicrobiology1 aBhagwat, Prashant K.1 aDandge, Padma B.0 tHeliyon.g2019 May, v. 5, no. 5 p.e01756-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e017563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03954naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245014000206300001600346506007600362520173800438592002802176506003702204650002202241650004002263650001902303650001302322650001402335650001902349650001402368650001802382650001802400650001602418650001502434650001402449650001302463650001402476650001702490650001502507653002002522653002102542700001602563700001602579700001602595700001402611700001602625700001602641700001502657700001502672700001702687700001702704700001802721700001802739700001302757700001702770700001502787700001802802700001902820700001902839700001602858700003202874700002602906700001702932773017102949856007903120852000903199655001203208IND60178669620221207080756.0150604e20140114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017866962DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13217481112doi7 aPMC38962012pmcid7 a243671042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhongfang10aEarly hypercytokinemia is associated with interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 dysfunction and predictive of fatal H7N9 infection  ap. 769-774.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA unique avian-origin A/H7N9 influenza virus has so far caused 134 cases with 44 deaths. Probing the host factors contributing to disease severity, we found that lower levels of plasma inflammatory cytokines on hospital admission correlated with faster recovery in 18 patients with A/H7N9 influenza virus, whereas high concentrations of (in particular) IL-6, IL-8, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β were predictive of a less favorable or fatal outcome. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage samples showed up to 1,000-fold greater cytokine/chemokine levels relative to plasma. Furthermore, patients with the rs12252-C/C IFN-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) genotype had more rapid disease progression and were less likely to survive. Compared with patients with the rs12252-T/T or rs12252-T/C genotype of IFITM3, patients with the C/C genotype had a shorter time from disease onset to the time point when they sought medical aid (hospital admission or antiviral therapy) and a shorter interval to development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome stage (reflected by shorter intervals between clinical onset and methylprednisolone treatments and higher rates of mechanical ventilator use), as well as experiencing elevated/prolonged lung virus titers and cytokine production and higher mortality. The present analysis provides reported data on the H7N9 influenza-induced “cytokine storm” at the site of infection in humans and identifies the rs12252-C genotype that compromises IFITM3 function as a primary genetic correlate of severe H7N9 pneumonia. Together with rs12252 sequencing, early monitoring of plasma cytokines is thus of prognostic value for the treatment and management of severe influenza pneumonia.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3aacute respiratory distress syndrome 3adisease course 3agenotype 3ahospitals 3ahuman diseases 3ainfluenza 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3amacrophages 3amonitoring 3amortality 3apatients 3apneumonia 3atherapeutics 3aviral load 0aavian influenza 0aclinical outcome1 aZhang, Anli1 aWan, Yanmin1 aLiu, Xinian1 aQiu, Chao1 aXi, Xiuhong1 aRen, Yanqin1 aWang, Jing1 aDong, Yuan1 aBao, Meijuan1 aLi, Liangzhu1 aZhou, Mingzhe1 aYuan, Songhua1 aSun, Jun1 aZhu, Zhaoqin1 aMa, Yukun,1 aLi, Qingsheng1 aZhang, Zhiyong1 aZhang, Xiaoyan1 aLu, Shuihua1 aDoherty, P.

Gypsum and organic amendments (OAs) have shown the potential to improve soil structure and fertility and may address constraints associated with these dispersive soils. However, the mechanistic linkages between the quality of OAs, and the dynamics of soil structural stability (i.e., soil aggregates), particularly under the interactive impacts of gypsum and exogenous nutrients, remain elusive. We quantified aggregate stability (i.e., wet mean weight diameter, WMWD) and the accumulation of OA-carbon (C) in different aggregate-classes in a dispersive clay subsoil (δ¹³C −24.5‰) with or without the application of OAs (δ¹³C −12.8 to −14.3‰), gypsum and/or exogenous nutrients (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) over the 270 days incubation period. The OAs include sorghum stubble and sugarcane bagasse that were low C quality (e.g., C:N:P ratio of 328:6.2:1 and 850:17.3:1, respectively) and less decomposed (e.g., low alkyl-C/o-alkyl-C ratio), and sugarcane mill mud that was high C quality (C:N:P ratio of 17:1.4:1) and more decomposed status. The results suggest that the quality of OAs is likely to control the dominant mechanisms of soil aggregation: (i) a quick top-down formation of aggregate hierarchy (~31 days) in the low C quality and less decomposed OAs; and (ii) a slow bottom-up formation of aggregate hierarchy (≥90 days) in the high C-quality and more decomposed OA. Over time, lowering the C-nutrient stoichiometric ratio of OAs (via exogenous nutrients) decreased aggregate stability by 30%, owing to accelerated breakdown/loss of OAs (i.e., by 16%). The exchangeable Ca²⁺ (from gypsum) was positively correlated to WMWD and water stable aggregates (>0.05 mm), which were not influenced by OAs or nutrients. In this dispersive clay subsoil, a long-term positive effect on soil aggregation occurred when improving either biochemical properties (e.g., microbial biomass and soil organic C) or chemical properties (e.g., soil dispersion, exchangeable sodium percentage, and pH), and an additive effect appeared when both properties were changed. This study provides critical information on the effects of OAs with variable C qualities, gypsum, and nutrients on structural stability with insights into strategies of sodic subsoil amelioration and soil C storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3aaggregate stability 3aagricultural productivity 3acalcium 3acarbon sequestration 3aclay 3aexchangeable sodium 3agypsum 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3asoil aggregation 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil structure 3astoichiometry 3astubble 3asubsoil 3asugarcane 3asugarcane bagasse 0aGypsum 0aIsotope 0aAmelioration 0aSoil constraints 0aAlkaline soil 0aSolonetz1 aSingh, Bhupinder Pal1 aZwieten, Lukas van,1 aCollins, D.q(Damian),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6919-07411 aPitt, Wayne1 aArmstrong, Roger1 aTavakkoli, Ehsan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2676-60180 tGeoderma.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 404 p.115281-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1152813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01442naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007200170300001800242520033200260592002800592650001100620650001700631650002200648650004400670653002900714653002900743653002300772700002100795700002400816700003200840700002100872773010500893856008500998852000901083655001201092IND60524198820221122220317.0160705e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052419882DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.11159972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Amjad10aNew adduct of abietane-type diterpene from Salvia leriifolia Benth.  ap. 1511-1516.  aA new adduct of abietane-type diterpene, salvialeriicone (1), was isolated from Salvia leriifolia Benth., along with a new chemical entity nor -abietane diterpene, 2-isopropyl-8,8-dimethyl-7,8-dihydrophenanthrene-1,4,5(6 H)-trione (2).

Thirty-six recombinant inbred lines along with grain mold resistant (B58586) and susceptible (296B) parents were evaluated in replicated field trials for resistance to Fusarium grain mold using artificial inoculation. A high degree of variability was observed among the RILs for all the characters (seed rot, plant height and panicle structure, glume color and glume cover) examined. Seed rot varied from 13 to 93% among the RILs. Correlation studies showed that Fusarium induced seed rot had strong negative relationship with glume color (p<0.01) and positive relationship with panicle compactness (p<0.01). Seven RILs (RIL004, RIL166, RIL092, RIL118, RIL161, RIL172 and RIL030) had seed rot resistance at par with resistant B58586 but with less coverage of grain with glume and high panicle compactness. It was summarized that seed rot, glume color and panicle structure are important characters that can play significant role in precise evaluation of grain mold resistance on artificial inoculation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3afield experimentation 3agermination 3ainbred lines 3apanicles 3aparents 3aplant height 3aseed rot 3aviability 0aFusarium grain mold 0aresistance 0acorrelation1 aAnnapurna, A1 aPatil, J.

While research on Arctic streams and rivers has accelerated in recent years, long‐term records are relatively rare compared to temperate and tropical regions. We began monitoring the upper Kuparuk River in 1983 as part of a long‐term, low‐level, whole‐season phosphorus enrichment of a 4–6 km experimental reach, which was subsequently incorporated into the Arctic Long‐Term Ecological Research (Arctic LTER) programme. The phosphorus enrichment phase of the Upper Kuparuk River Experiment (UKRE) ran continuously for 34 seasons, fundamentally altering the community structure and function of the Fertilized reach. The objectives of this paper are to (a) update observations of the environmental conditions in the Kuparuk River region as revealed by long‐term, catchment‐level monitoring, (b) compare long‐term trends in biogeochemical characteristics of phosphorus‐enriched and reference reaches of the Kuparuk River, and (c) report results from a new ‘ReFertilization’ experiment. During the UKRE, temperature and discharge did not change significantly, though precipitation increased slightly. However, the UKRE revealed unexpected community state changes attributable to phosphorus enrichment (e.g., appearance of colonizing bryophytes) and long‐term legacy effects of these state changes after cessation of the phosphorus enrichment. The UKRE also revealed important biogeochemical trends (e.g., increased nitrate flux and benthic C:N, decreased DOP flux). The decrease in DOP is particularly notable in that this may be a pan‐Arctic trend related to permafrost thaw and exposure to new sources of iron that reduce phosphorus mobility to streams and rivers. The trends revealed by the UKRE would have been difficult or impossible to identify without long‐term, catchment level research and may have important influences on connections between Arctic headwater catchments and downstream receiving waters, including the Arctic Ocean.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB/LTER 1637459cDivision of Environmental Biology  cNSF Office of Polar Programs  cNational Science Foundation 3acommunity structure 3airon 3anitrates 3apermafrost 3aphosphorus 3arivers 3atemperature 3avegetation 3awater 3awatersheds 3aArctic Ocean 3aArctic region1 aBeneš, Joshua1 aMedvedeff, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4567-66721 aBowden, William Breckenridge,d1951-1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0150-53560 tHydrological processes.g2021 Mar., v. 35, no. 3 p.e14075-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.140753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001700162245009100179300001600270500001900286500000900305520163400314592002801948650001601976650001501992650001302007650002002020650001602040650001402056650001102070650002302081650001202104650001802116650001802134650001702152651000902169700001802178773012102196856009702317852000902414655001202423IND60663774120221120073511.0191122e197905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066377412DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1979.00021962007100030015x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEavis, B.

Merr. ‘Corsoy’] were grown in 100 or 162 liter containers located in a field environment near Ames, Iowa, in order to determine the effects on transpiration rates and leaf water potentials of varying the root length (RL) to leaf area (LA) ratios during a water extraction cycle. The RL/LA ratios were varied by combining two fertility levels with two watering history treatments using Clarion clay loam topsoil (Typic Hapludoll). Two container sizes provided two different quantities of water storage at the start of the drying cycle. The containers were sealed around the plant stems to prevent evaporation during the drying cycle. Transpiration rates were determined from differences in total container weights at known times. Leaf areas were estimated on several days from length-width measurements on all terminal leaflets of a plant. Leaf water potentials were estimated by the pressure chamber technique. Root lengths were determined at harvest. Total transpiration (cm³/day) from the container increased linearly with leaf area. Transpiration rate (cm³/cm²/day) decreased linearly as soil water content deceasedbut at any particular soil water content, root length had no significant (P = 0.95) effect on transpiration rate. When a particular treatment increased the RL/LA ratio, water uptake rate per m of root decreased proportionately. This inverse relationship between total root length on the plant and uptake rate per m of roots enabled the plants to maintain equal leaf water potentials (regardless of the RL/LA ratios) when the roots were located in soils of equal water contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aHapludolls 3aagronomy 3aclay loam soils 3aevaporation 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3asoil water content 3atopsoil 3atranspiration 3awater storage 3awater uptake 3aIowa1 aTaylor, H.

Increasing land use intensity poses a threat to AM fungal communities, yet little is known of the impact of agricultural land use on AM fungal communities in many regions and cultivation types. The last few decades have witnessed increased cultivation of soybean worldwide with Argentina becoming one of the major producers. We compared the diversity and taxon composition of AM fungal communities in soybean fields in central Argentina with that in a natural Espinal forest under similar environmental conditions. We sequenced AM fungal DNA from root and soil samples collected from pairs of soybean fields and pristine forest ecosystems. We found that although AM fungal diversity tended to be lower in samples collected from the soybean field, the total number of AM fungal taxa was similar in both agricultural and forest ecosystems. Roots of soybean plants were colonized by diverse communities of AM fungi. AM fungal community composition in roots was primarily driven by host plant identity, but land use type (soybean field versus Espinal forest) was also an important determinant of community composition. The intensity of anthropogenic land use correlated with the proportion of easily-cultured AM fungal taxa, probably due to their efficient colonization strategies and better ability to recover from disturbance. Thus, soybean cultivation has affected AM fungal communities in terms of both diversity and functional attributes, although the diverse AM fungal communities are still present, probably due to the relatively low level of fertilizer application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aagricultural land 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental factors 3afertilizer rates 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3afungal communities 3ahost plants 3aland use 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aroots 3asoil sampling 3asoybeans 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aArgentina 0aAnthropogenic disturbance 0aEspinal forest 0aHost plant effect 0aAM fungal ruderal taxon 0aSoil chemistry1 aCantero, Juan José,1 aMoora, Mari1 aÖpik, Maarja,1 aDavison, John1 aVasar, Martti1 aJairus, Teele1 aZobel, M.,0 tApplied soil ecology.g2018 Mar., v. 124 p.289-297dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009900175520121300274592002801487650001401515650002501529650000901554650002901563650001401592650001901606650001101625650001101636650003001647650002201677650001501699650001401714650002101728700002301749700001701772700002101789700002101810700002301831773012701854856008501981852000902066655001202075IND60742635920221120102050.0210624e20210609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074263592DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90612522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDéjean, Guillaume 10aIdentifying a Novel Bile Salt Hydrolase from the Keystone Gut Bacterium Christensenella minuta  aChristensenella minuta are human gut dwelling bacteria that have been proposed as key members of the gut microbiome, regulating energy balance and adiposity of their host. We formerly identified that a novel strain of C. minuta (strain DSM33407) boosted microbiota diversity and stimulated deconjugation of the primary bile acid taurocholic acid in human samples. However, there is no description of a bile salt hydrolase (BSH) protein carried in the genome of C. minuta. Here, we identified and cloned a protein from C. minuta’s genome that carries a potent BSH activity, which preferentially deconjugates glycine-conjugated bile acids. We then retrieved 14,319 putative BSH sequences from the NCBI database and filtered them using the UHGP database to collect a total of 6701 sequences that were used to build the most comprehensive phylogenetic tree of BSH-related enzymes identified in the human microbiome so far. This phylogenetic tree revealed that C. minuta’s BSH amino acid sequence clusters away from others with a threshold of 70% identity. This is therefore the first description of C. minuta’s BSH protein, which may be involved in its unique role within the human gut microbial ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3aamino acid sequences 3abile 3acholoylglycine hydrolase 3adatabases 3aenergy balance 3agenome 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amicrobial ecology 3amicrobiome 3aphylogeny 3ataurocholic acid1 aTudela, Héloïse 1 aBruno, Lisa 1 aKissi, Déborah 1 aRawadi, Georges 1 aClaus, Sandrine P.0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 June 09, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90612523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100005100186245011200237300001700349500001500366506007600381520118200457592002801639506003701667650001601704650001301720650001201733650002301745650001401768650002201782650002301804650001401827650002501841650001101866650002101877650001101898650001601909650002301925653001101948700005201959773013202011856007902143852000902222655001202231IND60627168920221207144028.0190128e20181213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062716892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b028932doi7 aPMC64677752pmcid7 a305437522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9212-077610aDirect Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated γ-Amino Esters/Lactones via Umpolung Strategy  ap. 994-1005.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnabled by the discovery of new cinchonium salts and coadditives, a direct and efficient asymmetric access to trifluoromethylated γ-amino esters/lactones has been realized through the enantioselective and diastereoselective umpolung reaction of trifluoromethyl imines with acrylates or α,β-unsaturated lactones as carbon electrophiles. At 0.5–5.0 mol % catalyst loadings, the newly developed catalytic system activates a variety of imine substrates as unconventional nucleophiles to mediate highly chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective C–C bond forming reactions. The developed synthetic protocol represents an excellent strategy to target a series of versatile and enantiomerically enriched γ-amino esters/lactones in good to excellent yields from the readily available starting materials. Additionally, we found that the epi-vinyl catalysts based on cinchonidine and quinine promote a similarly high enantioselective reaction generating the opposite configuration of chiral products in a highly efficient manner, which allows convenient access to either the R- or S-enantiomer of the chiral amine products in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLewis bases 3alactones 3aquinine 3achemical reactions 3aacrylates 3aorganic chemistry 3aenantioselectivity 3acatalysts 3adiastereoselectivity 3acarbon 3achemical bonding 3aimines 3aLewis acids 3achemical structure 0aesters1 aDeng, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2233-02220 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2018 Dec. 13, v. 84, no. 2 p.994-1005dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.8b028933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245007800172300001600250520147200266592002801738650001601766650001301782650000901795650001401804650001001818650002201828650001601850650001401866650002901880650001201909653001301921653001701934653001601951653002501967700001901992700001702011700001502028700001802043700001702061773011502078856009002193852000902283655001202292IND50068321920221120205927.0190405e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006832192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2013.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorner, R.A.12aA comparison of the reproductive performance of ewe lambs and mature ewes  ap. 126-133.  aThis work compared the reproductive performance of ewe lambs and mature ewes and the growth of their lambs from birth to weaning under conditions in which they had been managed as a single group. Two studies were conducted; the first study, conducted in 2007, included 307 multiparous mature ewes and 297 primiparous ewe lambs and the second study, conducted in 2009, included 399 multiparous mature ewes and 400 primiparous ewe lambs. Physical measures of ewes and lambs were recorded as was their behaviour within 12h of birth in study one. Ewe lambs were lighter (P<0.05) than mature ewes throughout pregnancy and lactation. However, the total live weight gained during pregnancy was similar (P>0.05). Lambs born to ewe lambs were smaller (P<0.05) and lighter (P<0.05) than their birth rank contemporaries born to mature ewes. However, single lambs born to ewe lambs and twin lambs born to mature ewes had similar birth weights and growth to weaning. Lamb survival rates were lowest (P<0.05) for lambs born to ewe lambs although in study two, singleton lambs born to ewe lambs had similar survival rates to both singleton and twin lambs born to mature ewes. This study identified that the limitations to ewe lamb breeding were that they produced smaller, lighter lambs with lower survival rates to weaning and maternal behaviour indicating a lack of experience compared to mature ewes. Therefore future research should be directed at alleviating these constraints.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3abreeding 3aewes 3alactation 3alambs 3amaternal behavior 3aparturition 3apregnancy 3areproductive performance 3aweaning 0aEwe lamb 0aReproduction 0aLamb growth 0aBody condition score1 aMulvaney, F.J.1 aMorris, S.T.1 aWest, D.M.1 aMorel, P.C.H.1 aKenyon, P.R.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2013 Aug., v. 114, no. 1 p.126-133dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2013.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245010700177500002200284520156300306592002801869650003201897650003101929650002801960650003101988650002502019650001102044650001702055650002502072650002102097650003102118650000902149650001202158650001202170650001902182650001802201653003102219653001902250653002202269653003602291653005602327653001002383700001502393700002002408700001802428773009702446856008502543852000902628655001202637IND60647376020221119095250.0190830e20190615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064737602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2019.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavoudi, Cedric-Farhad10aIdentification of Surf1 as an assembly factor of the cytochrome bc1-aa3 supercomplex of Actinobacteria  aPre-press version  aRespiration in aerobic Actinobacteria involves a cytochrome bc1-aa3 supercomplex with a diheme cytochrome c1, first isolated from Corynebacterium glutamicum. Synthesis of a functional cytochrome c oxidase requires incorporation of CuA, CuB, heme a, and heme a3. In contrast to eukaryotes and α-proteobacteria, this process is poorly understood in Actinobacteria. Here, we analyzed the role of a Surf1 homolog of C. glutamicum in the formation of a functional bc1-aa3 supercomplex. Deletion of the surf1 gene (cg2460) in C. glutamicum caused a growth defect and cytochrome spectra revealed reduced levels of cytochrome c and a and an increased level of cytochrome d. Membranes of the Δsurf1 strain had lost the ability to oxidize the artificial electron donor N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, suggesting that Surf1 is essential for the formation of a functional cytochrome aa3 oxidase. In contrast to the wild type, a bc1-aa3 supercomplex could not be purified from solubilized membranes of the Δsurf1 mutant. A transcriptome comparison revealed that the genes of the SigC regulon including those for cytochrome bd oxidase were upregulated in the Δsurf1 strain as well as the copper deprivation-inducible gene ctiP. Complementation studies showed that the Surf1 homologs of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis could at least partially abolish the growth defect of the C. glutamicum Δsurf1 mutant, suggesting that Surf1 is a conserved assembly factor for actinobacterial cytochrome aa3 oxidase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium diphtheriae 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aMycobacterium smegmatis 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3acopper 3acytochrome c 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression regulation 3aheme 3amutants 3aregulon 3asolubilization 3atranscriptome 0aCorynebacterium glutamicum 0aActinobacteria 0aRespiratory chain 0aCytochrome bc1-aa3 supercomplex 0aBiogenesis/assembly of respiratory enzyme complexes 0aSurf11 aRamp, Paul1 aBaumgart, Meike1 aBott, Michael0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 June 15, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2019.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245014200168300001600310520131700326592002801643650003001671650001301701650001801714650002901732650002601761653001701787653001401804653001801818700002201836700002401858700002201882700002401904700002101928773013901949856007902088852000902167655001202176IND60720266320221119192059.0210822e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026632DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2013-00792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWojtaszczyk, Paweł10aForkhead transcription factor complex with special focus on Foxp3, Foxn1, and Foxj1 genes determining immunological parameters - a review  ap. 455-459.  aThe Forkhead genes (transcription complex Fox) play many important roles in the maintenance and determination of biological processes underlying carbon-based life. The expression of Fox genes occurring as a result of reciprocal interactions at the transcriptional level influences the correct function of the immune system as regards the context of general activity of immunological parameters, as well as exposure to aetiological agents. In the case of model organisms and species, in which the knowledge about genomic sequences is incomplete, understanding the above-mentioned transcriptional complex is still insufficient, despite the existence of numerous scientific publications. It is worth noting that Fox genes exist in amphioxus Branchiostoma lanceolatum and in the majority of species they were not characterised. Among many coding sequences included in the transcriptional complex Forkhead, Foxp3, Foxn1, and Foxj1 genes are of a great importance from immunological point of view, being partially jointly responsible for determining features related to productivity. The paper provides general characterisation of selected Fox genes and is an introduction to the presentation of new data, which can be applied at the level of biological differentiation of the populations of domestic and wild animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBranchiostoma lanceolatum 3agenomics 3aimmune system 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aForkhead box 0aFox genes 0aimmune system1 aKostro, Krzysztof1 aNiemczuk, Krzysztof1 aLisiecka, Urszula1 aStojecki, Krzysztof1 aŻmuda, Andrzej,0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 57, no. 4 p.455-459dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2013-00793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245010300161300001600264520108600280592002801366650000901394650001801403650000901421650001001430650001001440650001501450650001101465650004801476650001401524650001701538650001001555650001701565650001501582651001201597651001601609653004801625653000901673653003301682700001901715700001601734700001701750700002101767700001901788700002201807700002301829773012301852856007801975852000902053655001202062IND60774674420221121061827.0220422e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467442DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.2011.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabrun, Boris14aThe presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus on large pig breeding farms in Croatia  ap. 419-425.  aMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have emerged worldwide and have become resistant to a variety of antibiotics. MRSA colonisation in pigs was first reported from the Netherlands in 2005, where pigs were implicated as a source of human MRSA infections (Voss et al., 2005). This paper presents the first report on the presence of MRSA on large pig breeding farms in Croatia, together with the determination of the mecA gene, the results of spa typing and susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobials. Dust samples (7–11 per farm) were collected from eight large pig farms in Croatia. Of the total 68 swabs, the mecA gene was detected in 24 isolates growing on the MRSA agar. All isolates were resistant to oxacillin, tetracycline and streptomycin, and susceptible only to vancomycin, while 92% of the strains were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Genotyping of the MRSA strains was performed by spa typing, and revealed t011 (n = 17), t034 (n = 5) and t1451 (n = 2). The results presented here predict that MRSA is present on a large number of pig farms in Croatia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3aciprofloxacin 3adust 3afarms 3agenes 3agenotyping 3ahumans 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3aoxacillin 3astreptomycin 3aswine 3atetracycline 3avancomycin 3aCroatia 3aNetherlands 0aMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 0apigs 0aantimicrobial susceptibility1 aRačić, Ivana1 aBeck, Relja1 aBudimir, Ana1 aBenić, Miroslav1 aKompes, Gordan1 aŠpičić, Silvio1 aCvetnić, Željko,0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 59, no. 4 p.419-425dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.2011.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245014900201300002000350520150200370592002801872650002201900650002101922650001901943650002001962650001701982650001001999650001602009650002502025650002902050650001402079650001102093650001802104650000702122650001502129650002402144653002402168653002702192653001802219653002802237700001202265700001402277700001502291700001802306700001502324700001702339700005702356700005202413773014202465856007802607852000902685655001202694IND60689670020221118055458.0200422e20200330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068967002DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c003552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Shaoping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7198-184410aReduction/Oxidation-Responsive Hierarchical Nanoparticles with Self-Driven Degradability for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Precise Chemotherapy  ap. 18273-18291.  aDeep tumor penetration, long blood circulation, rapid drug release, and sufficient stability are the most concerning dilemmas of nano-drug-delivery systems for efficient chemotherapy. Herein, we develop reduction/oxidation-responsive hierarchical nanoparticles co-encapsulating paclitaxel (PTX) and pH-stimulated hyaluronidase (pSH) to surmount the sequential biological barriers for precise cancer therapy. Poly(ethylene glycol) diamine (PEG-dia) is applied to collaboratively cross-link the shell of nanoparticles self-assembled by a hyaluronic acid–stearic acid conjugate linked via a disulfide bond (HA–SS–SA, HSS) to fabricate the hierarchical nanoparticles (PHSS). The PTX and pSH coloaded hierarchical nanoparticles (PTX/pSH-PHSS) enhance the stability in normal physiological conditions and accelerate drug release at tumorous pH, and highly reductive or oxidative environments. Functionalized with PEG and HA, the hierarchical nanoparticles preferentially prolong the circulation time, accumulate at the tumor site, and enter MDA-MB-231 cells via CD44-mediated endocytosis. Within the acidic tumor micro-environment, pSH would be partially reactivated to decompose the dense tumor extracellular matrix for deep tumor penetration. Interestingly, PTX/pSH-PHSS could be degraded apace by the completely activated pSH within endo/lysosomes and the intracellular redox micro-environment to facilitate drug release to produce the highest tumor inhibition (93.71%) in breast cancer models.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood circulation 3abreast neoplasms 3acancer therapy 3adisulfide bonds 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aendocytosis 3aextracellular matrix 3ahyaluronoglucosaminidase 3alysosomes 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apaclitaxel 3apolyethylene glycol 0adual redox-response 0adeep tumor penetration 0ahyaluronidase 0atumor micro-environment1 aGao, Yi1 aZhang, Yu1 aXu, Jianan1 aZhu, Jianping1 aZhou, Fang1 aGu, Xiaochen1 aWang, Guangji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8297-19211 aLi, Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4627-88980 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Mar. 30, v. 12, no. 16 p.18273-18291dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c003553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010200168300001600270520156800286592002801854650001901882650001701901650001401918650003201932650001501964650001901979650001901998650001802017650001302035653002502048653001102073653001302084653001402097700001502111700001802126773011602144856008602260852000902346655001202355IND60551900320221116161136.0161019e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055190032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.03.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Peipei10aEffect of the physicochemical properties of binary ionic liquids on lipase activity and stability  ap. 243-249.  aIn the present study, the lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl butyrate is used as a model reaction to determine the activity and stability of Candida rugosa lipase in binary ionic liquids (ILs). The binary ILs consist of hydrophobic 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6) and a small amount of hydrophilic 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate ([Bmim]NO3) or 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([Bmim]CF3SO3) or 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim]BF4). The activity and the stability of lipase are first correlated with the physicochemical properties of the binary ILs. In the three binary IL systems, both the hydrophilicity and the polarity of the systems increase with the increase of the content of hydrophilic ILs (HILs). At a fixed concentration of HIL, they vary in a descending order of [Bmim]PF6/[Bmim]NO3>[Bmim]PF6/[Bmim]CF3SO3>[Bmim]PF6/[Bmim]BF4. This order is in contrast with the order of the lipase conformation stability, i.e., the higher the polarity of ILs, the more unstable the lipase conformation. However, both the activity and the stability of lipase depend on the type and the content of the HIL in binary ILs, showing a complex dependency. Analysis shows that the catalytic performance of lipase in the binary ILs is affected not only by the direct influence of the ILs on lipase conformation, but also through their indirect influence on the physicochemical properties of water. The present study helps to explore binary IL mixtures suitable for lipase-based biocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida rugosa 3abiocatalysis 3abutyrates 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic liquids 3anitrates 0aBinary ionic liquids 0aLipase 0aActivity 0aStability1 aYu, Xinxin1 aHuang, Xirong0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 June, v. 77 p.243-249dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.03.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03784naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015400163300002000317520198000337592002802317596007402345596006402419596005902483596005902542596006502601650001602666650001502682650001702697650000902714650001502723650001402738650001902752650001402771650002002785650001302805650000902818650001102827650002202838650002302860650001802883650001502901651001002916651001802926700005802944700001703002773015503019856008303174852000903257655001203266IND60791812420221119162619.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079181242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-20253-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Meiyan10aSpatial and temporal distribution and affecting factors of iron and manganese in the groundwater in the middle area of the Yangtze River Basin, China  ap. 61204-61221.  aIron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are heavy metals ubiquitous in groundwater. High levels of Fe and Mn in groundwater can compromise water quality and pose a risk to human health if the groundwater is used for drinking or irrigation. In the middle region of the Yangtze River Basin, groundwater has been extensively used for domestic and agricultural purposes. However, little is known about the distribution of Fe and Mn in the groundwater in this area. It was found that the 74.4% and 48.9% of the groundwater exceed the China national guideline for Fe (i.e., 0.3 mg/L) and Mn (i.e., 0.1 mg/L), respectively. And 6.38% and 2.13% of the wells had Fe and Mn health risks, respectively. Spatial heterogeneity of Fe and Mn was observed. Notably, the concentrations of Fe and Mn in a plain region located between two major rivers (i.e., the Yangtze River and the Han River) were significantly higher than those in other regions. Modeling using PHREEQC revealed that the Fe-bearing minerals in the plain region were more saturated compared to those in the other regions. Besides, temporal change of Fe and Mn was observed in the plain region, significantly affected by rainfalls and groundwater levels. In addition, the distribution of Fe and Mn was significantly affected by various physicochemical factors. Particularly, Fe was more sensitive to redox potential compared to Mn. Under a reducing condition, organic matter concentration and water residence time also affect the release of Fe from Fe-bearing minerals. Overall, a comprehensive understanding of distribution characteristics of Fe and Mn and affecting factors in the middle area of the Yangtze River Basin can provide guidance for the distribution of industrial water, agricultural water, and drinking water in different regions of the study area. Especially in the plain area between the Yangtze River and the Han River, direct drinking of groundwater shall be reduced since the higher health risk value of Fe and Mn.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 2007AA06Z418cNational High-tech Research and Development Program  aNos. 20577036cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a20777058cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a20977070cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 2015CFA137cNatural Science Foundation of Hubei Province 3agroundwater 3aguidelines 3ahuman health 3airon 3airrigation 3amanganese 3aorganic matter 3apollution 3aredox potential 3aresearch 3arisk 3arivers 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aZhou, Peijiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8025-71291 aChen, Chaoqi0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 40 p.61204-61221dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20253-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01436naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245006200161300002000223520053400243592002800777650001300805650001400818650001800832650002100850650001100871650002200882700001900904773012100923856008101044852000901125655001201134IND60550485720221119141736.0160911e20151106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055048572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b021752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBose, Anima10aCross Redox Coupling of Aryl-Aldehydes and p-Benzoquinone  ap. 11219-11225.  aHerein, we report an unprecedented Cross Redox Coupling (CRC) reaction catalyzed by Cu(OAc)₂·H₂O.

Structural analysis of the surface of the particles was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), showing that the obtained microparticles have an average diameter smaller than 3.5μm and in general a regular shape. The activity of the enzyme was studied by spectrophotometric methods using the substrate O-nitrophenyl-β,d-galactopyranoside (ONPG). The parameters of Michaelis–Menten were calculated. The value of Km decreases with the decrease of the pH, which can be associated to an increase of the affinity between the enzyme and substrate to smaller pH's. The highest value of the parameter Vmax, representing the maximum reaction rate at a given enzyme concentration, was obtained at pH 6.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-galactosidase 3achitosan 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme substrates 3amicroencapsulation 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspray drying 0aMicroencapsulation 0aModified chitosan 0aβ-Galactosidase 0aSpray-drying1 aRamos, Irena1 aRocha, Fernando0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 July, v. 78 p.238-242dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.03.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245013700165300001600302520163100318592002801949650002201977650001601999650001102015650001402026650001102040650002102051650001402072650001402086650001702100650001702117650001702134650002702151650001102178650002202189650002602211650000902237651001302246700002202259700002002281773011102301856008402412852000902496655001202505IND4478962020221117031345.0141112e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447896202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2012.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbas, Naeem10aFitness cost, cross resistance and realized heritability of resistance to imidacloprid in Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 181-188.  aImidacloprid has been used as a key insecticide for controlling sucking insect pests of cotton, whereas Spodoptera litura also has been indirectly exposed to this insecticide in Pakistan. To evaluate the risk of resistance evolution and to develop a better resistance management strategy, a field collected population was selected with imidacloprid in the laboratory. Thereafter, fitness cost, realized heritability and cross resistance of imidacloprid resistance in S. litura were investigated. After 14 generations of selection with imidacloprid, S. litura developed a 137.48-fold resistance to the insecticide. Bioassay revealed that this strain showed cross-resistance to acetamiprid (RR 8.52) and a little to lamdacyhalothrin (1.92) but negative cross-resistance was found to methomyl (−0.19). The resistant strain had a relative fitness of 0.38, with substantially lower rates of larval survival, larval duration, male pupal duration, development time, emergence rate of healthy adults, fecundity, hatchability, and prolonged larval and pupal duration. Mean relative growth rate of the larvae, intrinsic rate of population increase, and biotic potential was lower for the selected populations. The estimated realized heritability (h²) of imidacloprid resistance was 0.15 in the resistant strain of S. litura. Development of the resistance may cost significant fitness for the resistant population. This study provided valuable information for further understanding the impact of imidacloprid resistance on physiological parameters of S. litura and for facilitating the development of resistance management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera litura 3aacetamiprid 3aadults 3abioassays 3acotton 3across resistance 3aevolution 3afecundity 3aheritability 3aimidacloprid 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticide resistance 3alarvae 3apopulation growth 3aresistance management 3arisk 3aPakistan1 aShad, Sarfraz Ali1 aRazaq, Muhammad0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2012 July, v. 103, no. 3 p.181-188dElsevier Inc.x0048-35757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2012.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03591naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245012700213300001800340506007600358520184400434592002802278596006902306506003702375650002002412650002002432650001902452650001702471650001402488650001702502650001402519650002302533650001802556650001202574650000902586650001402595700001902609700002902628700002402657700002202681700003102703700002602734700002002760700006502780773013802845856008102983852000903064655001203073IND60604935420221207101536.0180718e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060493542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-018-3112-82doi7 aPMC60611472pmcid7 a298024492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiesbers, Anne K.

The commonplace observation that plants are immune to most potential pathogens is known as nonhost resistance (NHR). The genetic basis of NHR is poorly understood. Inheritance studies of NHR require crosses of nonhost species with a host, but these crosses are usually unsuccessful. The plant-pathosystem of lettuce and downy mildew, Bremia lactucae, provides a rare opportunity to study the inheritance of NHR, because the nonhost wild lettuce species Lactuca saligna is sufficiently cross-compatible with the cultivated host Lactuca sativa. Our previous studies on NHR in one L. saligna accession led to the hypothesis that multi-locus epistatic interactions might explain NHR. Here, we studied NHR at the species level in nine accessions. Besides the commonly used approach of studying a target trait from a wild donor species in a cultivar genetic background, we also explored the opposite, complementary approach of cultivar introgression in a wild species background. This bidirectional approach encompassed (1) nonhost into host introgression: identification of L. saligna derived chromosome regions that were overrepresented in highly resistant BC1 plants (F1 × L. sativa), (2) host into nonhost introgression: identification of L. sativa derived chromosome regions that were overrepresented in BC1 inbred lines (F1 × L. saligna) with relatively high infection levels. We demonstrated that NHR is based on resistance factors from L. saligna and the genetic dose for NHR differs between accessions. NHR seemed explained by combinations of epistatic genes on three or four chromosome segments, of which one chromosome segment was validated by the host into nonhost approach.  aPublisher supplied data  aTTW12683cNetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBremia lactucae 3aLactuca saligna 3aLactuca sativa 3abackcrossing 3acultivars 3adowny mildew 3aepistasis 3agenetic background 3aintrogression 3alettuce 3aloci 3apathogens1 aBoer, Erik den1 aBraspenning, David N.

The biggest challenge that remains unsolved with regard to coated paper is its recyclability. Herein, we report a unique approach that relies on 100% biobased and biodegradable food-safe materials for water- and oil-resistant papers. A 35-liner paper was coated with an oil-resistant chitosan solution and subsequently by a hydrophobic zein solution. The resultant chitosan–zein-coated paper showed remarkable water resistance (Cobb 60 value of 4.88 g/m²) and oil repellency (kit rating 12/12). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was used to determine the changes in the surface texture of the paper before and after coating treatment. The excellent mechanical properties of the coated paper were retained after the coating treatment. In addition, the pulp was recycled from the chitosan–zein-coated paper to validate the recyclability of this novel approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3achitosan 3acoatings 3ahydrophobicity 3amechanical properties 3aoils 3apaper 3apulp 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atexture 3azein 0aplastic free 0abiobased 0awater resistant 0aoil resistant 0aporous cellulosic substrates 0afluorine free1 aHamdani, Syeda Shamila1 aPing, Ruoqi1 aSirinakbumrung, Nopphachai1 aRabnawaz, Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4576-18100 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Apr. 13, v. 8, no. 17 p.6887-6897dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c022163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01376naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245022100161300001600382520032000398592002800718650001800746650001900764650001100783650001800794650001200812650001700824650001500841700001500856773010700871856007500978852000901053655001201062IND60637651320221120235917.0190422e20150623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063765132DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1972.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZderkiewicz, T.10aDynamika gromadzenia się kwasu L-askorbinoiuego i olejku eterycznego w różnych fazach wegetacji pietruszki [Dynamics of the accumulation of ascorbic acid and volatile oil in different stages of parsley vegetation]  ap. 179-184.  aEvident differences were found in the ascorbic acid and the volatile oil content in various stages of parsley growth.

Antibiotics are ubiquitous in surface water of these countries with concentrations ranging from <1 ng/L to hundreds μg/L and median values from 10 to 100 ng/L. Wider ranges and higher maximum concentrations of certain antibiotics were found in surface water of the East Asian countries like China and South Korea than in the Southeast Asian nations. Environmental behavior and fate of antibiotics in surface water is discussed. The reviewed occurrence of antibiotics in their sources suggests that effluent from wastewater treatment plants, wastewater from aquaculture and livestock production activities, and untreated urban sewage are principal sources of antibiotics in surface water. Ecological risks associated with antibiotic residues were estimated for aquatic organisms and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic-resistant bacteria were reviewed. Such findings underline the need for synergistic efforts from scientists, engineers, policy makers, government managers, entrepreneurs, and communities to manage and reduce the burden of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance in water bodies of East and Southeast Asian countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aaquaculture 3aenvironment 3aissues and policy 3alivestock production 3apollution 3asewage 3asurface water 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aChina 3aSouth East Asia 3aSouth Korea 0aPollution sources 0aRisk 0aAsian countries1 aLe, Thi Phuong Quynh1 aDa Le, Nhu1 aLu, Xi Xi1 aDuong, Thi Thuy1 aGarnier, Josette1 aRochelle-Newall, Emma1 aZhang, Shurong1 aOh, Neung-Hwan1 aOeurng, Chantha1 aEkkawatpanit, Chaiwat1 aNguyễn, Tiến Đạt,1 aNguyễn, Quang Trung,1 aNguyen, Tran Dung1 aNguyẽ̂n, Trọng Nghĩa,1 aTran, Thi Lieu1 aKunisue, Tatsuya1 aTanoue, Rumi1 aTakahashi, Shin1 aMinh, Tu Binh1 aLe, Huu Tuyen1 aPham, Thi Ngoc Mai1 aNguyen, Thi Anh Huong0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Apr. 10, v. 764 p.142865-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1428653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245014000177300001600317520182000333592002802153650001502181650001602196650001302212650003302225650001402258650001602272650001902288650002202307650001302329651001802342653002102360653001702381653002002398700001902418700002302437773013302460856008802593852000902681655001202690IND60646032220221120042219.0190605e20190530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064603222DNAL7 a10.1600/036364419X155620522520452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaleeiro, Paulo C.10aMolecular Phylogeny of the Utricularia amethystina Complex (Utricularia sect. Foliosa) Assessed Using Plastid and Nuclear Sequence Data  ap. 398-404.  aUncovering phylogenetic diversity is important, but not simple. A species complex is defined by different taxa with close evolutionary relationships harbouring limited morphological and/or genetic gaps. One such example exists within neotropical Utricularia sect. Foliosa, which is a taxonomically problematic assemblage composed of three currently recognized species: Utricularia amethystina. U. tricolor, and U. tridentata. The section type, Utricularia amethystina, contains 27 synonymized names. Morphological variation across the three species and associated synonyms suggests that previous taxonomic studies had underestimated taxonomic diversity. To examine taxonomic limits we sampled multiple accessions representing the three currently recognized species and many of the synonymized taxa classified under U. amethystina. We reconstructed a molecular phylogeny using three plastid regions (rps16, trnL-F, trnD-T) and nuclear ribosomal ITS. The three plastid markers produced similar phylogenetic topologies, and the combined plastid and nuclear phylogenies were congruent. The combined analysis provided strong support for most taxa previously identified through morphological analysis, also containing distinct groupings that likely represent both putative new species, and synonyms that are not monophyletic under the type accessions to which they had previously been relegated. The current analysis also shows a sister relationship between U. amethystina s. s. and U. tricolor, with U. tridentata found to be nested within the sister clade. Our results uncovered previously underestimated phylogenetic diversity within Utricularia sect. Foliosa, possibly driven by isolation factors such as specific phytophysiognomy across the varied habitats of the broad distribution across Central and South America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3aUtricularia 3ahabitats 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amonophyly 3anew species 3aplant taxonomy 3aspecies diversity 3atopology 3aSouth America 0aLentibulariaceae 0aPsyllosperma 0aspecies complex1 aSano, Paulo T.1 aJobson, Richard W.0 tSystematic botany.g2019 May 30, v. 44, no. 2 p.398-404dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364419X155620522520453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01744naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245005500168300001800223520065300241592002800894650000800922650002300930650002000953650001700973650002300990650001301013650001401026700003101040700002201071700002001093700006001113773012801173856008401301852000901385655001201394IND60631172620190314000000.0190219e20190204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063117262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b055002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiedmer, Lars12aA Reader-Based Assay for m⁶A Writers and Erasers  ap. 3078-3084.  aWe have developed a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF)-based enzyme assay to measure the catalytic activity of N⁶-methyladenosine (m⁶A) methyltransferases and demethylases.

This work presents an innovative and cost-effective approach to fabricate lignocellulose-based biodegradable porous matrices capable of slow and sustained release of the loaded molecules for effective crop protection. The matrix exhibits tunable physicochemical properties which, when coupled with our unique “wrap-and-plant” concept, help to utilize it as a defense against soil-borne pests while providing controlled release of crop protection moieties. The tailored matrix is produced by mechanical treatment of the lignocellulosic fibers obtained from banana plants. The effect of different extents of mechanical treatments of the lignocellulosic fibers on the protective properties of the developed matrices is systematically investigated. While variation in mechanical treatment affects the morphology, strength, and porosity of the matrices, the specific composition and structure of the fibers are also capable of influencing their release profile. To corroborate this hypothesis, the effect of morphology and lignin content changes on the release of rhodamine B and abamectin as model cargos is investigated. These results, compared with those of the matrices developed from non-banana fibrous sources, reveal a unique release profile of the matrices developed from banana fibers, thereby making them strong candidates for crop protection applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMusa 3aabamectin 3aagrochemicals 3abananas 3abiodegradability 3acost effectiveness 3aenvironmental degradation 3alignin content 3alignocellulose 3amechanical methods 3amodels 3amoieties 3apests 3aplant protection 3aporosity 3arhodamines 0aBanana paper 0aSustainable agriculture 0aPulp refining 0aWrap and plant1 aMathew, Reny1 aGuenther, Richard H.1 aSit, Tim L.1 aOpperman, Charles H.1 aPal, Lokendra1 aKhan, Saad A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1530-82490 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Mar. 19, v. 8, no. 17 p.6590-6600dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b056703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245006000172300001600232520109100248592002801339650000901367650002201376650001501398650001901413650001801432650001601450650001001466650002701476650002201503650001101525651001401536653001601550653002201566653001401588653002001602653002201622700003101644700002101675773010101696856008201797852000901879655001201888IND50063667020221116205227.0180621e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006366702DNAL7 a10.2478/s11535-013-0154-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaltrūnaitė, Laima14aThe genetic structure of the Lithuanian wolf population  ap. 440-447.  aLithuanian wolves form part of the larger Baltic population, the distribution of which is continuous across the region. In this paper, we evaluate the genetic diversity of the Lithuanian wolf population using mitochondrial DNA analysis and 29 autosomal microsatellite loci. Analysis of the mtDNA control region (647 bp) revealed 5 haplotypes distributed among 29 individuals and high haplotype diversity (0.658). Two haplotypes were distributed across the country, whilst the others were restricted to eastern Lithuania. Analysis of microsatellites revealed high heterozygosity (HE=0.709) and no evidence for a recent bottleneck. Using detection of first generation migrants, four individuals appeared to assign better with populations genetically differentiated from those resident in Lithuania. These immigrants were males carrying rare mitochondrial haplotypes and were encountered in the eastern part of the country, this indicates that Lithuania is subject to immigration from differentiated populations. Additionally, we did not detect any signs of recent hybridisation with dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aheterozygosity 3ahybridization 3aimmigration 3amales 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3awolves 3aLithuania 0aCanis lupus 0aGenetic structure 0aLithuania 0aMicrosatellites 0aMitochondrial DNA1 aBalčiauskas, L.q(Linas),1 aÅkesson, Mikael0 tOpen life sciences.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 8, no. 5 p.440-447dVersitawJournal:23145x2391-54127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11535-013-0154-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245005100169300001600220500001500236520136600251592002801617650001701645650002201662650001701684650002501701650001701726650002401743650002301767650001901790650001301809650001101822653002201833653001801855653001801873653002301891700002101914700001901935773010001954856008102054852000902135655001202144IND4378974820221119195639.0151024e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437897482DNAL7 a10.1007/s00497-005-0008-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernando, Danilo D.10aGrowth and development of conifer pollen tubes  ap. 149-162.  a2019-12-06  aConifer pollen tubes are an important but underused experimental system in plant biology. They represent a major evolutionary step in male gametophyte development as an intermediate form between the haustorial pollen tubes of cycads and Ginkgo and the structurally reduced and faster growing pollen tubes of flowering plants. Conifer pollen grains are available in large quantities, most can be stored for several years, and they grow very well in culture. The study of pollen tube growth and development furthers our understanding of conifer reproduction and contributes towards our ability to improve on their productivity. This review covers taxonomy and morphology to cell, developmental, and molecular biology. It explores recent advances in research on conifer pollen and pollen tubes in vivo, focusing on pollen wall structure, male gametophyte development within the pollen wall, pollination mechanisms, pollen tube growth and development, and programmed cell death. It also explores recent research in vitro, including the cellular mechanisms underlying pollen tube elongation, in vitro fertilization, genetic transformation and gene expression, and pine pollen tube proteomics. With the ongoing sequencing of the Pinus taeda genome in several labs, we expect the use of conifer pollen tubes as an experimental system to increase in the next decade.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant growth 3amicrosporogenesis 3aforest trees 3adevelopmental stages 3apollen tubes 3asexual reproduction 3aplant reproduction 3aultrastructure 3aconifers 3apollen 0aplant development 0aplant anatomy 0agametogenesis 0apollen germination1 aLazzaro, Mark D.1 aOwens, John N.0 tSexual plant reproduction.g2005 Dec., v. 18, no. 4 p.149-162dSpringer-Verlagx0934-08827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-005-0008-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245010500156520123100261592002801492650002101520650001201541650001101553650001701564650001401581650001701595650001801612650001101630650002901641650001901670650002401689650002101713650001601734651001101750700001501761700002201776700001801798700001501816700002401831700002401855700001601879773011901895856007202014852000902086655001202095IND60648695220190812000000.0190701e20170408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064869522DNAL7 a10.3390/f80401142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jongyeol10aEstimating Carbon Dynamics in an Intact Lowland Mixed Dipterocarp Forest Using a Forest Carbon Model  aIntact dipterocarp forests in Asia act as crucial carbon (C) reservoirs, and it is therefore important to investigate the C dynamics in these forests. We estimated C dynamics, together with net ecosystem production (NEP), in an intact tropical dipterocarp forest of Brunei Darussalam. Fifty-four simulation units (plots; 20 m × 20 m) were established and initial C stocks were determined via direct field measurement. The C dynamics were annually simulated with a regression model and the Forest Biomass and Dead organic matter Carbon (FBDC) model. The initial C stock (Mg C·ha−1) of biomass, litter, dead wood and mineral soil were 213.1 ± 104.8, 2.0 ± 0.8, 31.3 ± 38.8, and 80.7 ± 15.5, respectively. Their annual changes (Mg C·ha−1·year−1) were 3.2 ± 1.1, 0.2 ± 0.2, −3.7 ± 6.1, and −0.3 ± 1.1, respectively. NEP was −0.6 ± 6.1 Mg C·ha−1·year−1, showing large heterogeneity among the plots. The initial C stocks of biomass and dead wood, biomass turnover rates and dead wood decay rates were elucidated as dominant factors determining NEP in a sensitivity analysis. Accordingly, investigation on those input data can constrain an uncertainty in determining NEP in the intact tropical forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDipterocarpaceae 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3adead wood 3adecayed wood 3amineral soils 3amodels 3anet ecosystem production 3aorganic matter 3aregression analysis 3atropical forests 3auncertainty 3aBrunei1 aLee, Sohye1 aHan, Sŏng-hyŏn,1 aKim, Seongjun1 aRoh, Yujin1 aSalim, Kamariah Abu1 aPietsch, Stephan A.1 aSon, Yowhan0 tForests.g2017 Apr. 08, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f80401143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03640naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245011700172500001900289520189900308592002802207650002402235650002302259650001102282650001502293650002102308650001602329650000902345650001802354650001902372650001602391650001502407650002202422650002602444650001402470650001102484650002302495650001702518650001602535650001802551650001802569650001502587651001302602653002902615653003702644653002902681653005002710700001902760700001902779700002002798700002802818773011902846856008802965852000903053655001203062IND60713241720221119002436.0210423e20210410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071324172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1428692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, R.M.B.10aSeasonal effect of land use management on gill histopathology of Barbel and Douro Nase in a Portuguese watershed  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Vilariça River (located in the northeast of Portugal) is inserted in an agricultural basin and it was chosen to replace the spawning grounds for fish, that was lost due to the construction of dams in the Sabor River. Thus, it is essential to study the effect of agricultural practices on water quality and in the health status of fish. The barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) and Douro nase (Pseudochondrostoma duriense) were the selected species and the work was developed in two seasons (Summer 2016 and Winter 2017). For that, the histopathological changes of fish gill were used as biomarkers, through a semi-quantitative approach that considers the injuries severity. And the water quality assessment criteria followed the methodologies proposed for classifying the status of surface water bodies from Portugal. The current study showed severe histopathological changes in both species and both seasons, and the water was classified as polluted and extremely polluted in Summer and Winter respectively. The pollution in Summer was due to high temperatures, low dissolved oxygen and major concentration of As and Mn, and in Winter is due to the high concentration of Total Suspended Solids, nitrites and Cd. The increase of values of physico-chemical parameters on the water was caused by the less streamflow and excessive agricultural fertilization in Summer which arrive the river by irrigation, and by the erosion of soil particles with heavy metals associated in Winter. Also, the canonical analysis showed that physico-chemical parameters concentrations in Summer justify the major prevalence of aneurism in barbel and exudate in nase and Winter the major prevalence of hypertrophy in barbel. In conclusion, the study showed that the gill injuries of barbel and Douro nase was correlated with the water quality and it is influenced by seasonal agricultural practices and the flow regime.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLuciobarbus bocagei 3aPseudochondrostoma 3abasins 3abiomarkers 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironment 3afish 3ahealth status 3ahistopathology 3ahypertrophy 3airrigation 3aland use planning 3amultivariate analysis 3apollution 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3asoil erosion 3astream flow 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aPortugal 0aFish gill histopathology 0aCrops and agricultural practices 0aWater quality assessment 0aPotamodromous cyprinid, barbel and Douro nase1 aMonteiro, S.M.1 aCortes, R.M.V.1 aPacheco, F.A.L.1 aFernandes, L.F.

Plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.) is a perennial herb containing bioactive components with free radical scavenging activities. An isotope dilution technique using [U-¹³C]glucose was conducted to determine the effect of plantain on the responses of plasma glucose metabolism to exogenous insulin infusion in sheep. Six crossbred sheep (three wethers and three ewes; mean initial BW=40±2 kg) were fed either a mixed hay of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) and reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea) (MH-diet) or mixed hay and fresh plantain (1 : 1 ratio, dry matter basis, PL-diet) and exposed to a thermoneutral (TN, 20°C; 70% relative humidity (RH)) environment or a heat exposure (HE, 30°C; 70% RH) for 5 days using a crossover design for two 23-day periods. The isotope dilution was conducted on days 18 and 23 of the experimental period during TN and HE, respectively. Plasma concentration of α-tocopherol was greater (P<0.0001) for the PL-diet than the MH-diet and remained comparable between environmental treatments. Plasma glucose concentration before isotope dilution technique was reduced for sheep (P=0.05) during HE compared with TN and remained comparable between diets. Plasma glucose turnover rate during the preinfusion period of insulin did not differ (P=0.10) between dietary treatments and between environments (P=0.65). The response of plasma glucose utilization to exogenous insulin administration was lower (P=0.04) for the PL-diet than the MH-diet. Under present experimental conditions, the plantain group was found to be resistant to the effects of insulin infusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDactylis glomerata 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3aPlantago lanceolata 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3ablood glucose 3across-over studies 3acrossbreds 3adiet 3aewes 3aforage 3afree radical scavengers 3aglucose 3ahay 3aheat 3ainsulin 3aisotope dilution technique 3ametabolism 3arelative humidity 3atraditional medicine 3awethers 0aglucose metabolism 0aplantain 0aheat stress 0asheep1 aShibuya, K.1 aKajita, M.1 aTamura, Y.1 aSano, H.0 tAnimal.g2017 Aug., v. 11, no. 8 p.1287-1294dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311160028463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245014700163300001600310520131200326592002801638650001501666650000901681650001801690650001201708650001301720650001201733650001001745650001701755650002201772650002101794653002201815653001301837653000901850653001501859653002701874653002201901773012301923856007702046852000902123655001202132IND60558078920221123010148.0161107e20161006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055807892DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2016-01082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, Clint D.10aEffect of nutritional stress and sex on melanotic encapsulation rate in the sexually size dimorphic Cook Strait giant weta (Deinacrida rugosa)  ap. 787-792.  aNutritional condition and sex are known to influence efficacy and investment in immune function. A poor diet is costly to immune function because it limits the resources (e.g., protein) available to effector systems (e.g., melanotic encapsulation), whereas males and females are expected to differ in how they allocate resources to fitness-related traits. Males are expected to invest less in immunity, and more in mating, than females, but this pattern could be reversed if fitness is more condition-dependent in males than in females. I tested the effects of nutritional condition and sex on melanotic encapsulation rate in the Cook Strait giant weta (Deinacrida rugosa Buller, 1871), an orthopteran insect exhibiting strong female-biased sexual size dimorphism that is, at least in part, the result of strong sexual selection for small male size. I found that male D. rugosa have a stronger encapsulation response than females, while nutritional condition has only a small positive effect on this particular effector system in both sexes. Whether the observed sex difference in encapsulation ability is due to a physiological constraint in females or whether males allocate more resources to this effector system because their fitness is more condition-dependent than female’s remains to be determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthoptera 3adiet 3aencapsulation 3afemales 3aimmunity 3ainsects 3amales 3amalnutrition 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual selection 0asexual dimorphism 0aimmunity 0adiet 0aOrthoptera 0aCook Strait giant weta 0aDeinacrida rugosa0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2016 Oct. 6, v. 94, no. 11 p.787-792dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x0008-43017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-01083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02124naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011500157300001600272500002000288520091100308592002801219650001101247650001001258650001701268650001001285650001401295650004301309650002601352650002101378700001701399700001901416700001901435700002101454700001701475700001901492773013301511856007301644852000901717655001201726IND60585206620221121054433.0171106e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058520662DNAL7 a10.1111/jvp.124102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, K.

This phenotype correlates with increased proliferation, compromised wound healing and an enhanced capacity to undergo epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). The transcription factor β-catenin plays a vital role in epithelial cell differentiation and regeneration, depending on the co-factor recruited. Transcriptional programs driven by the β-catenin/CBP axis are critical for maintaining an undifferentiated and proliferative state, whereas the β-catenin/p300 axis is associated with cell differentiation. We hypothesized that disrupting the β-catenin/CBP signaling axis would promote epithelial differentiation and inhibit EMT. We treated monolayer cultures of human airway epithelial cells with TGFβ1 in the presence or absence of the selective small molecule ICG-001 to inhibit β-catenin/CBP signaling. We used western blots to assess expression of an EMT signature, CBP, p300, β-catenin, fibronectin and ITGβ1 and scratch wound assays to assess epithelial cell migration. Snai-1 and -2 expressions were determined using q-PCR. Exposure to TGFβ1 induced EMT, characterized by reduced E-cadherin expression with increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin and EDA-fibronectin. Either co-treatment or therapeutic administration of ICG-001 completely inhibited TGFβ1-induced EMT. ICG-001 also reduced the expression of ck-5 and -19 independent of TGFβ1. Exposure to ICG-001 significantly inhibited epithelial cell proliferation and migration, coincident with a down regulation of ITGβ1 and fibronectin expression. These data support our hypothesis that modulating the β-catenin/CBP signaling axis plays a key role in epithelial plasticity and function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aactin 3acadherins 3acell differentiation 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3afibronectins 3ahumans 3amuscles 3aphenotype 3atissue repair 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aAirway epithelium 0aβ-Catenin/CBP 0aICG-001 0aEpithelial–mesenchymal transition 0aWound repair1 aRoth, Hollis M.1 aCross, Jennifer1 aReid, Andrew T.1 aShaheen, Furquan1 aWarner, Stephanie M.1 aHirota, Jeremy A.1 aKicic, Anthony1 aHallstrand, Teal S.1 aKahn, Michael1 aStick, Stephen M.1 aHansbro, Philip M.1 aHackett, Tillie-Louise1 aKnight, Darryl A.0 tInternational Journal of Biochemistry and Cell Biology.g2015 Nov., v. 68 p.59-69dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2015.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01848naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245009100173300001600264500002000280520067800300592002800978650001701006650002101023650001601044650002201060650002501082650002001107650002801127650001701155650002501172650002101197700002701218773014301245852000901388856008901397655001201486IND4382159120221116171037.0200107e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438215912DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8276.2006.00881.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVukina, Tomislav10aOligopsony Power, Asset Specificity, and Hold‐Up: Evidence from the Broiler Industry  ap. 589-605.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this article we look for empirical evidence of hold‐up in broiler industry production contracts by using the cross‐sectional national survey of broiler growers. First, we focus on the problem of under‐investment and hypothesize that the degree of agent's (grower's) under‐investment systematically depends on the principal's (integrator's) market power and the level of asset specificity. Second, we provide an indirect test of hold‐up by looking at the grower contract payoffs as a function of the frequency of the housing facilities upgrade requests and the principal's market power. The results show moderate empirical support for the presence of hold‐up.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarm surveys 3abroiler chickens 3agame theory 3aeconomic analysis 3avertical integration 3apoultry housing 3abargaining cooperatives 3amarket power 3aproduction economics 3apoultry industry1 aLeegomonchai, Porametr0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2006 Aug., v. 88, no. 3 p.589-605dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8276.2006.00881.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02906naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002500149245015900174300001400333520166600347592002802013650002002041650002902061650001302090650001202103650001902115650001102134650001302145650001502158650001602173650002402189650001602213650001702229650002002246650001002266651001002276700002402286773009202310856008502402852000902487655001202496IND4467049420221118143928.0141110e20120821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446704942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenkataraman, Kartik10aModeling simultaneous exceedance of drinking-water standards of arsenic and nitrate in the Southern Ogallala aquifer using multinomial logistic regression  ap. 16-27.  aThe occurrence of elevated levels of arsenic and nitrate in aquifers impacted by agricultural activities is common and can result in adverse health effects in rural areas. Numerous wells located in the Ogallala aquifer in the Southern High Plains of Texas have tested positive for both arsenic and nitrate MCL exceedance. To model the simultaneous exceedance of both chemicals, two types of Logistic Regression (LR) models were developed by (a) treating arsenic and nitrate independently and combining the marginal probabilities of their exceedance, and (b) treating the two exceedances together by using a multinomial model. Influencing variables representative of both soil and aquifer properties and data for which was readily available were identified. The predictive capacities of the two models were evaluated using Received Operating Characteristics (ROCs) and spatial trends in predictions were studied. The LR model constructed from the marginal probabilities had lower overall accuracy (59% correct classifications) and was extremely conservative by over-predicting outcomes. In contrast, the multinomial model showed good overall accuracy (79% correct classifications), made the correct predictions 90% of the time when both arsenic and nitrate MCL exceedances were observed, and was a good fit for wells located in agricultural areas. The results of the multinomial model also confirm previous studies that attributed shallow subsurface arsenic to anthropogenic activities. Based on the insights provided by the model it is recommended that where agricultural areas are concerned, the occurrence of arsenic and nitrate are better evaluated together.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquifers 3aarsenic 3adrinking water 3amodels 3anitrates 3aprediction 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3arural areas 3arural health 3asoil properties 3awells 3aTexas1 aUddameri, Venkatesh0 tJournal of hydrology.g2012 Aug. 21, v. 458-459 p.16-27dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002900152245012300181300001600304520160000320592002801920650001501948650001801963650001801981650001101999650001902010650001502029650001102044650000702055650001902062650001302081700002802094700002202122700001902144700002502163700002102188700002202209773010402231856005502335852000902390655001202399IND4478316120221118143935.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447831612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1529-8817.2011.01085.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornwall, Christopher E.10aCarbon‐use strategies in macroalgae: differential responses to lowered ph and implications for ocean acidification1   ap. 137-144.  aOcean acidification (OA) is a reduction in oceanic pH due to increased absorption of anthropogenically produced CO2. This change alters the seawater concentrations of inorganic carbon species that are utilized by macroalgae for photosynthesis and calcification: CO2 and HCO3 − increase; CO3 2− decreases. Two common methods of experimentally reducing seawater pH differentially alter other aspects of carbonate chemistry: the addition of CO2 gas mimics changes predicted due to OA, while the addition of HCl results in a comparatively lower [HCO3 −]. We measured the short‐term photosynthetic responses of five macroalgal species with various carbon‐use strategies in one of three seawater pH treatments: pH 7.5 lowered by bubbling CO2 gas, pH 7.5 lowered by HCl, and ambient pH 7.9. There was no difference in photosynthetic rates between the CO2, HCl, or pH 7.9 treatments for any of the species examined. However, the ability of macroalgae to raise the pH of the surrounding seawater through carbon uptake was greatest in the pH 7.5 treatments. Modeling of pH change due to carbon assimilation indicated that macroalgal species that could utilize HCO3 − increased their use of CO2 in the pH 7.5 treatments compared to pH 7.9 treatments. Species only capable of using CO2 did so exclusively in all treatments. Although CO2 is not likely to be limiting for photosynthesis for the macroalgal species examined, the diffusive uptake of CO2 is less energetically expensive than active HCO3 − uptake, and so HCO3 −‐using macroalgae may benefit in future seawater with elevated CO2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacidification 3acalcification 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3amacroalgae 3amodels 3apH 3aphotosynthesis 3aseawater1 aHepburn, Christopher D.1 aPritchard, Daniel1 aCurrie, Kim I.1 aMcGraw, Christina M.1 aHunter, Keith A.1 aHurd, Catriona L.0 tJournal of phycology.g2012 Feb., v. 48, no. 1 p.137-144dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2011.01085.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02079naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245010000161520111200261592002801373650002901401650002601430650002201456650001201478650001401490650003501504650001701539700002101556773011901577856007201696852000901768655001201777IND60648695620221121230213.0190701e20170410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064869562DNAL7 a10.3390/f80401162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcosta, Montserrat10aMulticriteria Decision Analysis and Participatory Decision Support Systems in Forest Management  aGrowing concern about issues such as environmental quality or the sustainability of natural resources has led to the use of the Decision Support System (DSS), which originated in the business field, and is now part of environmental decision-making processes. The presence of environmental, social, or economic dimensions has helped decision support systems to evolve to be able to tackle investigations that can contemplate all these variables, such as in the case of multicriteria decision analyses. In addition, new lifestyles, in which society recognizes more and more the contribution of forests to its welfare, have led to the need to involve stakeholders in decision-making processes. This article presents a review of different Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and participatory decision support systems applied to forest environments. This last point is presented from the perspective of stakeholder participation in the processes and from the point of view of procedures or tools used. To do this, some of the research performed in forest environments within this current century is reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision support systems 3aenvironmental quality 3aforest management 3aforests 3alifestyle 3amulti-criteria decision making 3astakeholders1 aCorral, Serafín0 tForests.g2017 Apr. 10, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f80401163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100005500191245017900246300001800425506007600443520128100519592002801800506003701828650002101865650001101886650002801897650001701925650002001942650002201962650001201984650002201996650001102018650001302029650003602042650002002078650002302098700001802121700001602139700002502155700002002180700002002200773012802220856008402348852000902432655001202441IND60631173120221207101755.0190219e20190118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063117312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b056882doi7 aPMC67568482pmcid7 a306576882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Junfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5183-542510aO-GlcNAc Site Mapping by Using a Combination of Chemoenzymatic Labeling, Copper-Free Click Chemistry, Reductive Cleavage, and Electron-Transfer Dissociation Mass Spectrometry  ap. 2620-2625.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs a dynamic post-translational modification, O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification (i.e., O-GlcNAcylation) of proteins regulates many biological processes involving cellular metabolism and signaling. However, O-GlcNAc site mapping, a prerequisite for site-specific functional characterization, has been a challenge since its discovery. Herein we present a novel method for O-GlcNAc enrichment and site mapping. In this method, the O-GlcNAc moiety on peptides was labeled with UDP–GalNAz followed by copper-free azide–alkyne cycloaddition with a multifunctional reagent bearing a terminal cyclooctyne, a disulfide bridge, and a biotin handle. The tagged peptides were then released from NeutrAvidin beads upon reductant treatment, alkylated with (3-acrylamidopropyl)trimethylammonium chloride, and subjected to electron-transfer dissociation mass spectrometry analysis. After validation by using standard synthetic peptide gCTD and model protein α-crystallin, such an approach was applied to the site mapping of overexpressed TGF-β-activated kinase 1/MAP3K7 binding protein 2 (TAB2), with four O-GlcNAc sites unambiguously identified. Our method provides a promising tool for the site-specific characterization of O-GlcNAcylation of important proteins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding proteins 3abiotin 3acycloaddition reactions 3adissociation 3adisulfide bonds 3aelectron transfer 3aenzymes 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3amoieties 3apost-translational modification 3areducing agents 3asynthetic peptides1 aWang, Weihan,1 aLi, Zengxia1 aShabanowitz, Jeffrey1 aHunt, Donald F.1 aHart, Gerald W.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Jan. 18, v. 91, no. 4 p.2620-2625dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b056883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012600170520170600296592002802002650002302030650000802053650001302061650001602074650001402090650001102104650000902115650001902124653003602143653003402179653002102213653002402234653002702258700001302285700001402298700001502312773011902327856008802446852000902534655001202543IND60774045620221118022119.0221004e20220810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077404562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1551732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Sheng10aContaminant removal and contaminant dispersion of air distribution for overall and local airborne infection risk controls  aProper air distribution is crucial for airborne infection risk control of infectious respiratory diseases like COVID-19. Existing studies evaluate and compare the performances of different air distributions for airborne infection risk control, but the mechanisms of air distribution for airborne infection risk control remain unclear. This study investigates the mechanisms of air distribution for both overall and local airborne infection risk controls. The experimentally validated CFD models simulate the contaminant concentration fields in a hospital ward based on which the airborne infection risks of COVID-19 are evaluated with the dilution-based expansion of the Wells-Riley model. Different air distributions, i.e., stratum ventilation, displacement ventilation, and mixing ventilation, with various supply airflow rates are tested. The results show that the variations of the overall and local airborne infection risks under different air distributions and different supply airflow rates are complicated and non-linear. The contaminant removal and the contaminant dispersion are proposed as the mechanisms for the overall and local airborne infection risk controls, respectively, regardless of airflow distributions and supply airflow rates. A large contaminant removal ability benefits the overall airborne infection risk control, with the coefficient of determination of 0.96 between the contaminant removal index and the reciprocal of the overall airborne infection risk. A large contaminant dispersion ability benefits the local airborne infection risk control, with the coefficient of determination of 0.99 between the contaminant dispersion index and the local airborne infection risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aair 3aair flow 3aenvironment 3ahospitals 3amodels 3arisk 3arisk reduction 0aOverall airborne infection risk 0aLocal airborne infection risk 0aAir distribution 0aContaminant removal 0aContaminant dispersion1 aNiu, Dun1 aLu, Yalin1 aLin, Zhang0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Aug. 10, v. 833 p.155173-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1551733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03596naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245011100201300001800312506007600330520182900406592002802235506003702263650002502300650001602325650001802341650001202359650002102371650001702392650001802409650001502427650002302442650003102465650001702496650001202513650001602525650002402541700002102565700002002586700001902606700002102625700001902646700002802665700001302693700001902706700002202725700003102747700002202778700002302800773011102823856007502934852000903009655001203018IND60529663120221207113206.0160717e20140805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052966312DNAL7 a10.1021/ac501722r2doi7 aPMC41447512pmcid7 a250100122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemeler, Borries10aCharacterization of Size, Anisotropy, and Density Heterogeneity of Nanoparticles by Sedimentation Velocity  ap. 7688-7695.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA critical problem in materials science is the accurate characterization of the size dependent properties of colloidal inorganic nanocrystals. Due to the intrinsic polydispersity present during synthesis, dispersions of such materials exhibit simultaneous heterogeneity in density ρ, molar mass M, and particle diameter d. The density increments ∂ρ/∂d and ∂ρ/∂M of these nanoparticles, if known, can then provide important information about crystal growth and particle size distributions. For most classes of nanocrystals, a mixture of surfactants is added during synthesis to control their shape, size, and optical properties. However, it remains a challenge to accurately determine the amount of passivating ligand bound to the particle surface post synthesis. The presence of the ligand shell hampers an accurate determination of the nanocrystal diameter. Using CdSe and PbS semiconductor nanocrystals, and the ultrastable silver nanoparticle (M₄Ag₄₄(p-MBA)₃₀), as model systems, we describe a Custom Grid method implemented in UltraScan-III for the characterization of nanoparticles and macromolecules using sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation. We show that multiple parametrizations are possible, and that the Custom Grid method can be generalized to provide high resolution composition information for mixtures of solutes that are heterogeneous in two out of three parameters. For such cases, our method can simultaneously resolve arbitrary two-dimensional distributions of hydrodynamic parameters when a third property can be held constant. For example, this method extracts partial specific volume and molar mass from sedimentation velocity data for cases where the anisotropy can be held constant, or provides anisotropy and partial specific volume if the molar mass is known.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acolloidal properties 3adispersions 3ahydrodynamics 3aligands 3amolecular weight 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aoptical properties 3aparticle size distribution 3aquantum dots 3asolutes 3asurfactants 3aultracentrifugation1 aNguyen, Tich-Lam1 aGorbet, Gary E.1 aSchirf, Virgil1 aBrookes, Emre H.1 aMulvaney, Paul1 aEl-Ballouli, Ala’a

HIC1 is also essential for DSBs repair but in a SUMOylation-independent manner. Here, we show that repairable DSBs induced by a 1 h Etoposide treatment results in three specific posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of HIC1. Two of these PTMs, phosphorylation of Serine 694 and Acetylation of Lysine 623 are located in the conserved HIC1 C-terminal region located downstream of the Zinc Finger DNA-binding domain. By contrast, phosphorylation of Serine 285 found in the poorly conserved central region is unique to the human protein. We showed that Ser694 phosphorylation is mediated mainly by the PIKK kinase ATM and is essential for the DNA repair activity of HIC1 as demonstrated by the lack of efficiency of the S694A point mutant in Comet assays.Thus, our results provide the first evidence for a functional role of the conserved HIC1 C-terminal region as a novel ATM substrate that plays an essential role in the cellular HIC1-mediated cellular response to repairable DSBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aacetylation 3aapoptosis 3aetoposide 3ahumans 3alysine 3amutants 3aphosphorylation 3arepressor proteins 3aresearch 3aserine 3asumoylation 3atranscription (genetics) 3atumor suppressor genes 3azinc finger motif 0aHIC1 0aDNA-Damage response 0aATM 0aP531 aDubuissez, Marion1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3217-26891 aPage, Adeline1 aDehennaut, Vanessa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6421-07931 aLoison, Ingrid1 aSpruyt, Nathalie1 aLeprince, Dominique0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 May 14, v. 553 p.51-57dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245017000159300001800329520098300347592002801330650002201358650001501380650001001395650001601405650002001421650000901441650002201450650001501472650002201487650001701509650002601526650001901552650001401571650001401585650001501599650003701614700001701651700001301668700001601681700001901697700001601716700001901732700001201751700001201763773014201775856007401917852000901991655001202000IND60668863220221118134527.0190920e20130319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066886322DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta01255g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Congliang10aFabrication of an inorganic–organic hybrid based on an iron-substituted polyoxotungstate as a peroxidase for colorimetric immunoassays of H₂O₂ and cancer cells  ap. 4699-4705.  aFabrication of a folate and iron-substituted polyoxometalate [(FeOH₂)₂SiW₁₀O₃₆] has been achieved through self-assembly of folate and polyoxometalate molecules, which was characterized by IR spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This inorganic–organic hybrid has been proven to possess intrinsic peroxidase-like activity in the oxidation of dyes, which can catalyze oxidation of the peroxidase substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by H₂O₂ to form a blue color in aqueous solution. The TMB/POM/H₂O₂ system provides a new approach to detect H₂O₂ with good sensitivity, wide linear range (from 1.34 × 10⁻⁷ to 6.7 × 10⁻⁵ mol L⁻¹), low detection limit (1 × 10⁻⁷ mol L⁻¹) and fast response towards H₂O₂ instead of an enzyme biosensor. In addition, this unique hybrid FA–Fe₂SiW₁₀ is inexpensive, easily prepared, and very efficient in the colorimetric multiplexed immunoassay of cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abiosensors 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3adyes 3aenzyme substrates 3afolic acid 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmunoassays 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aChen, Xiaoli1 aXu, Jian1 aWei, Meijie1 aWang, Jingjing1 aMi, Xuguang1 aWang, Xiaohong1 aWu, Yin1 aLiu, Yu0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Mar. 19, v. 1, no. 15 p.4699-4705dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta01255g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02007naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245020900162300001600371520093500387592002801322650002201350650001101372650001501383650001101398650001101409650001201420700002501432700002701457773012201484856007801606852000901684655001201693IND60132558520221121055519.0150505e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013255852DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2014001742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarré, Marta13aAn Integrative Breakage Model of genome architecture, reshuffling and evolution: The Integrative Breakage Model of genome evolution, a novel multidisciplinary hypothesis for the study of genome plasticity  ap. 479-488.  aOur understanding of genomic reorganization, the mechanics of genomic transmission to offspring during germ line formation, and how these structural changes contribute to the speciation process, and genetic disease is far from complete. Earlier attempts to understand the mechanism(s) and constraints that govern genome remodeling suffered from being too narrowly focused, and failed to provide a unified and encompassing view of how genomes are organized and regulated inside cells. Here, we propose a new multidisciplinary Integrative Breakage Model for the study of genome evolution. The analysis of the high‐level structural organization of genomes (nucleome), together with the functional constrains that accompany genome reshuffling, provide insights into the origin and plasticity of genome organization that may assist with the detection and isolation of therapeutic targets for the treatment of complex human disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenetic disorders 3agenome 3agerm cells 3ahumans 3amodels 3aprogeny1 aRobinson, Terence J.1 aRuiz‐Herrera, Aurora0 tBioEssays.g2015 May, v. 37, no. 5 p.479-488dPublished for ICSU Press by Cambridge University Pressx0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2014001743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04382naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245018500171520204000356592002802396650001802424650001802442650001202460650001602472650002202488650002902510650002102539650001502560650002502575650001302600650002702613650001202640653001802652653002402670653002302694653001702717653003102734653002702765700002302792700002202815700002002837700001802857700002202875700002002897700001902917700001902936700002102955700001902976700002102995700001803016700002103034700001703055700003903072700002003111700001903131700002203150700002203172700002503194700001703219700002003236700002103256700001903277700002203296700001703318700002103335700001703356700002303373773011903396856008803515852000903603655001203612IND60774045820221118022227.0220606e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077404582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1551752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalmaso, Nico10aDNA sequence and taxonomic gap analyses to quantify the coverage of aquatic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae in reference databases: Results of a survey in the Alpine region  aThe taxonomic identification of organisms based on the amplification of specific genetic markers (metabarcoding) implicitly requires adequate discriminatory information and taxonomic coverage of environmental DNA sequences in taxonomic databases. These requirements were quantitatively examined by comparing the determination of cyanobacteria and microalgae obtained by metabarcoding and light microscopy. We used planktic and biofilm samples collected in 37 lakes and 22 rivers across the Alpine region. We focused on two of the most used and best represented genetic markers in the reference databases, namely the 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes. A sequence gap analysis using blastn showed that, in the identity range of 99–100%, approximately 30% (plankton) and 60% (biofilm) of the sequences did not find any close counterpart in the reference databases (NCBI GenBank). Similarly, a taxonomic gap analysis showed that approximately 50% of the cyanobacterial and eukaryotic microalgal species identified by light microscopy were not represented in the reference databases. In both cases, the magnitude of the gaps differed between the major taxonomic groups. Even considering the species determined under the microscope and represented in the reference databases, 22% and 26% were still not included in the results obtained by the blastn at percentage levels of identity ≥95% and ≥97%, respectively. The main causes were the absence of matching sequences due to amplification and/or sequencing failure and potential misidentification in the microscopy step. Our results quantitatively demonstrated that in metabarcoding the main obstacles in the classification of 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA sequences and interpretation of high-throughput sequencing biomonitoring data were due to the existence of important gaps in the taxonomic completeness of the reference databases and the short length of reads. The study focused on the Alpine region, but the extent of the gaps could be much greater in other less investigated geographic areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aDNA barcoding 3abiofilm 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental DNA 3aenvironmental monitoring 3alight microscopy 3amicroalgae 3anucleotide sequences 3aplankton 3aspecies identification 3asurveys 0aMetabarcoding 0aTaxonomic databases 0aTaxonomic coverage 0aGap analysis 0aAmplicon sequence variants 0aInterreg Eco-AlpsWater1 aVasselon, Valentin1 aRimet, Frédéric1 aVautier, Marine1 aElersek, Tina1 aBoscaini, Adriano1 aDonati, Claudio1 aMoretto, Marco1 aPindo, Massimo1 aRiccioni, Giulia1 aStefani, Erika1 aCapelli, Camilla1 aLepori, Fabio1 aKurmayer, Rainer1 aMischke, Ute1 aKrivograd Klemenčič, Aleksandra,1 aNovak, Katarina1 aGreco, Claudia1 aFranzini, Giorgio1 aFusato, Giampaolo1 aGiacomazzi, Federica1 aLea, Alessia1 aMenegon, Silvia1 aZampieri, Chiara1 aMacor, Arianna1 aVirgilio, Damiano1 aZanut, Elisa1 aZorza, Raffaella1 aBuzzi, Fabio1 aDomaizon, Isabelle0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 834 p.155175-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1551753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015200156300001800308520086600326592002801192650001101220650001101231650001801242650001301260650002101273650002101294650001801315650001201333650002201345650001601367650001301383650001901396650001801415650001701433650001201450700001701462700002201479773014201501856007401643852000901717655001201726IND60668863320221118134445.0190920e20130416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066886332DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta01272g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Juchen10aMesoporous silicon@carbon composites via nanoparticle-seeded dispersion polymerization and their application as lithium-ion battery anode materials  ap. 5709-5714.  aSignificant efforts have been devoted to synthesis and characterization of engineered silicon nanostructures able to withstand the large stresses and strains produced by lithium alloying/dealloying reactions during electrochemical cycling.

It was shown that L-proline, L-lysine, L-isoleucine, and L-threonine could promote the production of ε-PL. Moreover, the overexpression of the dihydrodipicolinate synthase gene (dapA) helped improve the fermentation performance of S. diastatochromogenes. The maximum ε-PL yield of the overexpressing strain (S. diastatochromogenes 12#-2) increased by 17.5% compared with the original strain in 500 mL shake flask. When the fermentation was conducted in a 5-L fermenter, the fermentation duration was extended by 48 h, and ε-PL yield reached 30.54 g/L, which was a 19.8% increase compared to the original strain. The results of this study offered a promising approach to augment the production of ε-PL from Streptomyces, thus paving the way to reduce the cost of product ε-PL and enhance the fermentation efficiency of ε-PL production.  aPublisher supplied data  aNO. 2018YFD0400205cNational Key R and D Program of China  aNO. 31771952cNational Natural Fund General Program of China  aNo. SKLFNS-KF-201911cOpen Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety 3aStreptomyces diastatochromogenes 3aculture flasks 3afermentation 3afermenters 3agenes 3alysine 3amicrobiology 3aproline 3athreonine1 aLv, Junge1 aDong, Tianyu1 aLi, Xinying1 aLi, Xiaona1 aTan, Zhilei1 aJia, Shiru0 tCurrent microbiology.g2021 July, v. 78, no. 7 p.2640-2647dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-021-02510-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245015200162300001800314520120800332592002801540596008001568596007901648596005901727596010201786650002501888650002301913650001601936650002301952650001201975650001301987650001202000650001302012650002402025700001802049700001302067773014502080856008202225852000902307655001202316IND60683383820221118060418.0200209e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068338382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-020-10356-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Feng10aSignificant improvement of the enantioselectivity of a halohydrin dehalogenase for asymmetric epoxide ring opening reactions by protein engineering  ap. 2067-2077.  aHalohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) have attracted much attention due to their ability to synthesize enantiomerically enriched epoxides and β-haloalcohols. However, most of the HHDHs exhibit low enantioselectivity. Here, a HHDH from the alphaproteobacteria isolate 46_93_T64 (AbHHDH), which shows only poor enantioselectivity in the catalytic resolution of rac-PGE (E = 9.9), has been subjected to protein engineering to enhance its enantioselectivity. Eight mutants (R89K, R89Y, V137I, P178A, N179Q, N179L, F187L, F187A) showed better enantioselectivity than the wild type. The best single mutant N179L (E = 93.0) showed a remarkable 9.4-fold increase in the enantioselectivity. Then, the single mutations were combined to produce the double, triple, quadruple, and quintuple mutants. Among the combinational mutants, the best variant (R89Y/N179L) showed an increased E value of up to 48. The E values of the variants N179L and R89Y/N179L for other epoxides 2–7 were 12.2 to > 200, which showed great improvement compared to 1.2 to 10.5 for the wild type. Using the variant N179L, enantiopure (R)-PGE with > 99% ee could be readily prepared, affording a high yield and a high concentration.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 21606192 and No. 21878154cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 2018YFC1604101cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aNo. 2016M601795cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  aNo. 16KJB180029cNatural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3acatalytic activity 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3aenzymes 3aepoxides 3amutants 3amutation 3aprotein engineering1 aZhang, Li-Hui1 aXu, Qing0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Mar., v. 104, no. 5 p.2067-2077dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10356-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002100163245006100184300001600245520151200261592002801773650001301801650001501814650001601829650001201845650002001857650001401877650002001891650001901911650001601930650001001946650001101956650001101967650002601978650005602004650004002060650003602100650005702136650002902193700002502222700002402247700002302271700002002294700002502314700001902339700002302358773010202381856004702483852000902530655001202539IND4481108920221122031648.0120502e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448110892DNAL7 a225263422pmid7 a10.1177/08903344114354142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeddes, Donna T.10aBlood Flow Characteristics of the Human Lactating Breast  ap. 145-152.  aBACKGROUND: Despite the increased metabolic activity of the lactating breast, no studies have been carried out to determine mammary blood flow (MBF) parameters or the relationship between MBF and milk production in women. The aim of this study was to measure the MBF in the internal mammary artery (IMA) and lateral thoracic artery (LTA) of lactating women and determine if these were related to milk production. METHODS: Blood flow in the IMA and LTA was measured with color Doppler ultrasound in 55 lactating women. Twenty-four-hour milk production was determined with the test-weigh method. RESULTS: IMA contributed the greater proportion of blood flow to the lactating breast (70%). MBF was highly variable between women but consistent between the left (126 L/24 h; interquartile range, 76-169) and right (110 L/24 h) breasts. No relationship between MBF and milk production was demonstrated. For 3 women, MBF was markedly reduced in 1 breast that was synthesizing almost no milk compared to the other that was producing a normal volume of milk. DISCUSSION: Although no relationship between MBF and milk production was found, the substantial reduction in blood flow in the breasts of lactating women producing almost no milk suggests a threshold below which milk production is compromised. CONCLUSION: Doppler ultrasound did not demonstrate a relationship between MBF and milk production in lactating women. Further investigation is required to fully understand the role of blood flow in milk synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarteries 3ablood flow 3abreast milk 3abreasts 3alactating women 3alactation 3amilk production 3amilk synthesis 3aultrasonics 2aAdult 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMammary Arteriesxphysiopathologyxultrasonography. 2aMammary Glands, Humanxblood supply 2aRegional Blood Flowxphysiology 2aThoracic Arteriesxphysiopathologyxultrasonography. 2aUltrasonography, Doppler1 aAljazaf, Khalidah M.1 aKent, Jacqueline C.1 aPrime, Danielle K.1 aSpatz, Diane L.1 aGarbin, Catherine P.1 aLai, Ching Tat1 aHartmann, Peter E.0 tJournal of human lactation.g2012 May, v. 28, no. 2 p.145-152dSAGE Publicationsx0890-33447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0890334411435414  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001700159245007000176300001600246500000900262520127600271592002801547650001601575650001501591650001301606650002401619650002101643650002001664650002401684650001701708650001301725650002501738650002001763650001701783650001301800700002101813700002001834773020701854856009402061852000902155655001202164IND60665981420221117232251.0191028e198310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066598142DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1983.00472425001200040023x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, M.

One such potential soil amendment is clinoptilolite, which is a natural zeolite with ion exchange properties and an affinity for the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The objectives of this study were to quantify the adsorption of ammonium (NH₄) by a clinoptilolite in a shaking study (static system) and to measure how effective this zeolite was in increasing NH₄ retention in soil leaching columns (dynamic system). A batch equilibrium shaking test showed that this zeolite adsorbed 4.3 times more NH₄ than the Nunn clay loam (Aridic Argiustoll) soil. When mixed together with the soil and placed in 6.35 cm (i.d.) by 30 cm long columns (dynamic system), the zeolite significantly reduced the leaching of NH₄⁺ only at a relatively high application rate (135 Mg ha⁻¹). comparison of the two zeolite application methods at the highest zeolite rate (135 Mg ha⁻¹) showed that banded treatments significantly reduced the leaching of NH₄⁺, compared with treatments where zeolite was homogenously mixed with the entire soil volume. Indications are, however, that large quantities of clinoptilolite would be required to reduce NH₄⁺ leaching in fine-textured soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgiustolls 3aadsorption 3aammonium 3aapplication methods 3aapplication rate 3aclay loam soils 3afine-textured soils 3aion exchange 3aleaching 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asoil amendments 3asoil texture 3azeolites1 aBarbarick, K.

Vertebrate neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a potent stimulator of appetitive behavior. Recently, Drosophila neuropeptide F (dNPF) and short NPF (sNPF), the Drosophila homologs of the vertebrate NPY, were identified to characterize the functions of NPFs in the feeding behaviors of this insect. Dm-NPFR1 and NPFR76F are the receptors for dNPF and sNPF, respectively; both receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Another GPCR (CG5811; NepYR) was indentified in Drosophila as a neuropeptide Y-like receptor. Here, we identified 2 ligands of CG5811, dRYamide-1 and dRYamide-2. Both peptides are derived from the same precursor (CG40733) and have no significant structural similarities to known bioactive peptides. The C-terminal sequence RYamide of dRYamides is identical to that of NPY family peptides; on the other hand, dNPF and sNPF have C-terminal RFamide. When administered to blowflies, dRYamide-1 suppressed feeding motivation. We propose that dRYamides are related to the NPY family in vertebrates, similar to dNPF and sNPF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalliphoridae 3aDrosophila 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3abioactive properties 3afeeding behavior 3afood consumption 3ainsect behavior 3amotivation 3aneuropeptide Y 3avertebrates1 aTakahashi, Tomoko1 aTominaga, Hatsumi1 aSato, Takahiro1 aKume, Kazuhiko1 aOzaki, Mamiko1 aHiraguchi, Tetsutaro1 aMaeda, Toru1 aShiotani, Hajime1 aTerajima, Saki1 aSano, Hiroko1 aMori, Kenji1 aYoshida, Morikatsu1 aMiyazato, Mikiya1 aKato, Johji1 aMurakami, Noboru1 aKangawa, Kenji1 aKojima, Masayasu0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 July 15, v. 410, no. 4 p.872-877dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.06.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03984naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009600165300001600261520218400277592002802461650002402489650001802513650002602531650001902557650000902576650001102585650002102596650001102617650002202628650001502650650001002665650002702675650002602702650001302728650000902741650000902750650001402759650002402773650001302797650001902810650001502829650002002844650001302864650000902877650001602886650001502902650001102917650001002928650000902938651001302947700001802960700002202978700001903000700001703019700002603036700001303062700002003075700002103095773010403116856008103220852000903301655001203310IND60548077420221120055754.0160903e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054807742DNAL7 a10.3103/S10683674160300222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Irshad10aOrganic and inorganic fertilization influenced on yield and quality of sugar beet genotypes  ap. 218-223.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of organic and inorganic fertilizers on yield and quality of sugar beet genotypes (Beta vulgaris L.). Therefore a field trial was carried out at New Developmental Farm of The University Agriculture, Peshawar, Pakistan during winter 2012–13. The field experiment was layout in randomized complete block design with split plot arrangement having three replications. Fertilizers treatments (control, higo organic plus (composted manure, it contains N 2%, P 3%, K 3%, organic matter 40%, organic carbon 11%, Zn 145 mg kg–¹, Cu 56 mg kg–¹, Fe 380 mg kg–¹ and Mg 228 mg kg–¹), maxicrop sea gold (extract of sea weeds i.e., Sargasssum, Laminara Polysaccharide and Ascophyllum Nodosum), farm yard manure, NP (90: 60 kg ha–¹), NP (120: 90 kg ha–¹) and NP (150: 120 kg ha–¹) were allotted to main plots while genotypes (Sandrina, Serenada and Kawe Terma) to the sub plots. Farm yard manure (10 t ha–¹) and higo organic Plus (5 t ha–¹) was incorporated in the soil before seed bed preparation. Maxicrop sea gold (5 lit ha–¹) was sprayed after the emergence of the crop. All phosphorus was applied @ of 60, 90 and 120 kg ha–¹ at the time of sowing while nitrogen @ of 90, 120 and 150 kg ha–¹ in two splits/3 of the dose was applied at the time of sowing while the remaing 1/3 of the dose was applied before earthen up. Plots treated with application of NP ratio 120: 90 kg ha–¹ produced maximum beet yield (76.4 t ha–¹), sugar yield (11.1 t ha–¹), Pol (polarizable sugar) percentage (14.67%) and more economic return (Rs.234 Thousand ha–¹) as compared to control plots. Sugar beet genotype Serenada had significantly produced maximum beet yield (55.5 t ha–¹), sugar yield (7.9 t ha–¹), pol (polarizable sugar) percentage (14.60%), brix percentage (14.60%) and more economic return (158) as compared to other genotypes.

In this study, the design parameters of rain gardens were optimized through combining the DRAINMOD model and the response surface methodology. On the basis of the monitoring data of a rain garden in the Xi’an University of Technology campus in China from 2016 to 2017, the parameter sensitivities in the DRAINMOD-H and DRAINMOD-N modules were analyzed, and the DRAINMOD model was calibrated and validated. The determination and Nash efficiency coefficients were approximately 0.8 and above 0.6, respectively, confirming that the water volume and nitrogen regulation effects of rain gardens can be simulated with DRAINMOD. Different scenarios were set up to simulate and analyze the reduction effects of rain gardens on water volume and nitrogen load. The influences of various factors, including the influent nitrogen concentration, the confluence ratio, the thickness of the filler layer, and the depth of submerged zone on the regulation effects of rain gardens were discussed. According to simulation results, these factors were optimized by using the response surface methodology to obtain the design values under different targets. The optimized minimum thickness of the filler layer is 37 cm and the maximum is 80 cm. The optimized depth of the submerged zone is at least 22 cm and the maximum is 45 cm. The treatment effects of the rain gardens are better after parameter optimization. Results can provide a scientific basis for the construction of rain garden facilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDRAINMOD model 3abioretention areas 3agardens 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apollution load 3arain 3aresponse surface methodology 3arunoff 3aChina 0aRain garden 0aSimulation 0aOptimization 0aDRAINMOD 0aResponse surface1 aLiu, Fang1 aLi, Yajiao0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 June, v. 585 p.124788-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1247883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245018500171300001800356520092300374592002801297650002101325650001601346650002201362650001201384650001801396650001801414650002201432650001901454650002101473650002001494650001001514650001901524650002001543650001501563650001001578650001101588653000701599653000801606653000801614653000901622653000801631653000901639653000701648653000801655653000801663653000801671653000901679653000801688653000701696653000801703653000801711653000801719653000801727653001401735653001801749653002801767653001801795653001401813700001901827700002101846700002101867700002301888700001701911773010201928856008702030852000902117655001202126IND60559788320221118033921.0190402e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055978832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.11.1512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenga, Valeria10aGluten-free pasta incorporating chia (Salvia hispanica L.) as thickening agent: An approach to naturally improve the nutritional profile and the in vitro carbohydrate digestibility  ap. 1954-1961.  aA gluten-free pasta was prepared adding chia at rice flour for testing the thickening and nutritional properties of this specie. Chemical analysis showed chia is a source of protein (19.52% and 15.81%, seeds and mucilage respectively), insoluble/soluble dietary fiber ratio (4.3 and 1.79 seeds and mucilage respectively), fat and ash content. The total phenolic acids content ranged from 734.5μg/g to 923.9μg/g for seeds and mucilage respectively.Chia was a good thickening agent and, improved the nutritional profile of enriched samples compared to CGF. After cooking TPAs increased in all samples, ranging from 5.3% in DW to 52.8% in CM5. The addition of chia seeds also increased the slowly digestible starch fraction of rice flour, commonly known to have a high glycemic index. Results suggest that chia should be added as thickening agent in the formulation of GF pasta for conferring healthier characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvia hispanica 3aash content 3achemical analysis 3acooking 3adietary fiber 3adigestibility 3agluten-free foods 3aglycemic index 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3apasta 3aphenolic acids 3aprotein sources 3arice flour 3aseeds 3astarch 0aDW 0aCGF 0aCS5 0aCS10 0aCM5 0aCM10 0aPC 0aIDF 0aSDF 0aTPC 0aTPAs 0aNRS 0aTS 0aRAG 0aSAG 0aRDS 0aSDS 0aChia seed 0aChia mucilage 0aGluten-free fresh pasta 0aPhenolic acid 0aFlavonoid1 aAmato, Mariana1 aPhillips, Tim D.1 aAngelino, Donato1 aMorreale, Federico1 aFares, Clara0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 221 p.1954-1961dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.11.1513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03900naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005100139245012000190300001600310500002000326520246700346592002802813596003602841650002102877650002402898650001102922650001202933650002102945650001502966650001602981650002002997650001303017650002303030650002303053650001403076650001203090651001503102700001803117700001903135700002003154700006203174773012303236856007403359852000903433655001203442IND60765573920221120083740.0220130e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076557392DNAL7 a10.1111/sum.126662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Nan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9410-018110aComparison of a digital soil map and conventional soil map for management of topsoil exchangeable sodium percentage  ap. 121-134.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe soil in the sugarcane growing area of far north Queensland is often sodic (exchangeable sodium percentage—ESP > 6%). Gypsum therefore needs to be applied to reduce potential for land degradation. To accurately map ESP, a digital soil map (DSM) approach can be used. In this paper, we compare and contrast various aspects of DSM for mapping topsoil (0–0.3 m) ESP, including a suitable model (i.e. linear mixed model (LMM), Cubist and regression kriging (Cubist‐RK)), usefulness of digital data (in combination or alone) and how many calibration data (i.e. n = 20, 30,…120) are required. We compare these with ordinary kriging (OK) of soil data and using prediction agreement (i.e. Lin's concordance—Lin's) and accuracy (root mean squared error—RMSE). We compare all of these results with a DSM derived from numerical clustering (fuzzy K‐mean—FKM) of digital data to identify management zones (k = 2, 3, 4 and 5) and a conventional Soil Order map (k = 5 Orders). We do this by calculating mean squared prediction error (MSPE). Prediction of topsoil ESP by OK using 120 samples gave moderate agreement (Lin's = 0.72) with accuracy satisfactory given RMSE (3.69) was less than half standard deviation of measured ESP (½SD = 3.75). Moreover, a minimum number of 100 samples would be required for OK. However, when digital data were used to value add to soil data in models, the results were equivocal, given Cubist (Lin's = 0.74) and Cubist‐RK (0.79) outperformed OK, while LMM (0.65) was inferior to OK. In addition, a smaller sample size (i.e. 70 and 60, respectively) was enough for Cubist and Cubist‐RK to permit the development of accurate predictions of ESP given the RMSE was less than ½SD of measured ESP. Prediction of ESP (considering 120 samples) using only the γ‐ray data (Lin's = 0.77) was superior to ECₐ (0.72), however, using both in combination was best (0.79). The MSPE (n = 120) indicated creating DSM from clustering of digital data was best for k = 4 zones (MSPE = 27.60); however, Cubist‐RK (13.40), Cubist (14.75), OK (15.56) and LMM (15.76) were able to provide better prediction of ESP. Nevertheless, all DSM generated smaller MSPE than a conventional Soil Order map (32.33). We recommend using Cubist‐RK and both digital data, is the optimal approach to develop a DSM for application of gypsum to enable implementation of Six‐Easy‐Steps soil management guidelines for Proserpine.  aPublisher supplied data  aRE087cSugar Research Australia 3adigital database 3aexchangeable sodium 3agypsum 3akriging 3aland degradation 3aprediction 3asample size 3asoil management 3asoil map 3astandard deviation 3astatistical models 3asugarcane 3atopsoil 3aQueensland1 aZhao, Dongxue1 aArshad, Maryem1 aSefton, Michael1 aTriantafilis, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1561-02420 tSoil use and management.g2022 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.121-134dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl36284x0266-00327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.126663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01194naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245009000162300001600252520028600268592002800554650001200582650001100594650002500605650001900630650000900649650001000658700001400668773011900682856008200801852000900883655001200892IND60618467120221117204755.0181029e198408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061846712DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517584054008022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZurek, W.12aA Probabilistic Model of Fiber Distribution in Yarn Surface as a Criterion of Quality  ap. 504-515.  aA probabilistic model of component fiber distribution in the surface of a blend yam is presented and experimental results for the yarn surface are compared with the model.

However, identifying the nitrogen and spatial-temporal variation and nitrogen pollution sources among surface water, sediments and groundwater at the watershed scale is still of insufficient understanding. In this study, multi-methods (dual isotopes, hydraulic, hydrogeochemical methods) have been used and 400 samplings (40 sediments, 20 shallow groundwater and 40 surface waters in four periods in dry and wet seasons) were collected from 2018 to 2020. The results showed that the concentration of NO₃⁻-N, NH₄⁺-N, NO₂⁻-N and total nitrogen (TN) had variable spatial and temporal changes in whole watershed. The concentration of TN, NO₃⁻-N, NH₄⁺-N and NO₂⁻-N in downstream was higher than midstream and upstream both in dry and wet seasons. The concentration of TN, NO₃⁻-N, NH₄⁺-N and NO₂⁻-N of the whole watershed in wet season was higher than dry season. The dual isotope values indicate that nitrogen sources were mainly derived from manure and sewage waste input (MSI), agriculture chemical fertilizers (ACFI) and sediments nitrogen input (SNI). Those nitrogen sources have different proportion in downstream, midstream and upstream in dry and wet seasons (the largest proportion: MSI 95.24% in downstream and ACFI 86.26% in upstream both in dry season, SNI 31.75% in midstream in wet season). Water exchange has positive correlation with the nitrogen concentration. High level of nitrogen in river also can be a diver in different location and seasons. Those results can be useful for developing regional management strategies and plans for water pollution control and treatment at watershed-scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry season 3aenvironment 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3ahydrogeochemistry 3aisotopes 3anitrogen 3apollution control 3arivers 3asewage 3asurface water 3atotal nitrogen 3awater pollution 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aChina 0aNitrogen transport and source tracing 0aWatershed-scale 0aGroundwater 0aSediments and surface water 0aDual isotopes 0aYiluo River1 aXu, Y.

Quantifying the effects of soil water on plant processes, especially leaf expansion and transpiration, could be useful for crop modeling. In order to quantify the leaf expansion and transpiration in response to soil water deficit in three millet species, common (Panicum miliaceum L.), pearl (Pennisetum glaucum L.) and foxtail (Setaria italica L.) millets, a pot experiment was performed at the Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Gorgan, Iran. The soil water status was characterized by the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW). Leaf area and transpiration were measured daily. Relative leaf area expansion (RL) and relative transpiration (RT) data were plotted against FTSW. Finally the FTSW thresholds for RL and RT were calculated using linear–plateau and logistic models. The results showed that the thresholds for RL and RT were 0.68 and 0.62, respectively, based on all measured data of the three millet species using the linear–plateau model, indicating that RL and RT were constant when FTSW decreased from 1 to the threshold point. Thereafter, until FTSW = 0, RL and RT declined linearly with a slope of 1.48 and 1.43, respectively. Although millet is cultivated as a resistant crop in arid, semiarid and marginal lands, it showed an early response to soil water deficit at high FTSW thresholds. As leaf expansion and transpiration can be considered morphological and physiological variables, respectively, the results in this study indicate that millet has strong morphological flexibility when faced with soil water deficit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum miliaceum 3aPennisetum glaucum 3aSetaria italica 3aagricultural colleges 3acrop models 3aleaf area 3aleaf development 3alogit analysis 3amillets 3anatural resources 3asoil transport processes 3asoil water 3asoil water deficit 3astomatal conductance 3awater stress 3aIran 0alinear–plateau model 0alogistic model 0amorphological flexibility 0aplant process 0aresistant crop 0asoil water content 0athreshold1 aKAMKAR, Behnam1 aGALESHI, Serollah1 aGHADERI–FAR, Farshid1 aTEIXEIRA DA SILVA, Jaime A.0 tPedosphere.g2015 Dec., v. 25, no. 6 p.834-843dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(15)30064-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015600170506011700326506007600443520112900519592002801648506003701676650001301713650001501726650001601741650002201757650001501779650001901794650001601813650002401829650002501853650002801878650001101906650001501917650001801932650001901950651001201969653002201981653002502003653002402028653002302052653002502075700005702100700002402157700002402181700002102205700002102226700001902247700001602266700002302282773012002305856008202425852000902507655001202516IND60787569320221207111118.0220906e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078756932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2022.1008182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Yousfi, Yassine10aHydrogeochemical and statistical approach to characterize groundwater salinity in the Ghiss-Nekkor coastal aquifers in the Al Hoceima province, Morocco  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSeawater intrusion is one of the most severe problems confronting coastal aquifers. These aquifers are often considered significant freshwater sources, particularly in arid regions. The water resources mobilized at the Al Hoceima (Northeastern Morocco) come from the Ghiss-Nekkor aquifer and the Abdelkarim El Khattabi dam. The degradation of groundwater quality of the aquifer and the probability of marine intrusion has become a severe concern for the communities. The current study provides multidisciplinary research using hydrogeochemical and statistical approaches to evaluate groundwater quality and determine the origin of salinity in this aquifer. Depending on the direction of the water flow, he results indicate that most wells have a total salinity exceeding 2 g/L. The dominant chemical facies encountered are Na–Cl–Na–SO₄ resulting from rock-water interaction, meaning that the breakdown of halite was the predominant source of groundwater mineralization. However, septic waste, water irrigation inflows, and locally seawater intrusion seem to substantially influence groundwater quality in this area.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquifers 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3ahydrogeochemistry 3airrigation 3amineralization 3aprobability 3asaltwater intrusion 3astatistical analysis 3asustainable development 3awastes 3awater flow 3awater quality 3awater salinity 3aMorocco 0aHydrogeochemistry 0aStatistical analysis 0aGroundwater quality 0aSeawater intrusion 0aGhiss-Nekkor aquifer1 aHimi, Mahjoub1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1419-66761 aEl Ouarghi, Hossain1 aElgettafi, Mohammed1 aBenyoussef, Said1 aGueddari, Hicham1 aAqnouy, Mourad1 aSalhi, Adil1 aAlitane, Abdennabi0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2022 Nov., v. 19 p.100818-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2022.1008183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245009800210300001800308520150800326592002801834596005001862650002901912650002501941650001201966650001201978650001201990650002302002650001402025650001402039650001402053650001402067650001402081650001802095650001102113700001902124700002102143773011102164856008302275961001302358852000902371655001202380IND60741947120221118052317.0220327e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074194712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-021-02507-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvenhuis, Jason P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6008-894310aGrowth of Flavobacterium columnare Genomovars in the Presence or Lack of Supplemental Cations  ap. 2474-2480.  aFlavobacterium columnare is a problematic pathogen for the aquaculture industry where isolates are classified by genomovars. Suspended growth in a low nutrient media, like tryptone yeast extract salts, is a common method used for laboratory study. The presence of calcium and magnesium is the factor contributing to growth, virulence, and biofilm formation for F. columnare. Exponential growth occurs within 24 h for F. columnare when grown in complete tryptone yeast extract salts medium at 30 ºC. Withholding CaCl₂ and MgSO₄ components from a complete TYES formulation reduced or completely inhibited growth of genomovar I isolates but not the growth of genomovar II, IIB, or III isolates. Only 3 of 20 genomovar I isolates, MS-FC-4, FC-CSF-53, and 023-08-3, could achieve O.D. 540 readings ≥ 0.3 but only after 48-h incubation in cation-restricted TYES. Independently adding CaCl₂ or MgSO₄ to tryptone and yeast extracts did not result in a genomovar-specific growth phenotype, but generally demonstrated increased clumping with individual isolates presenting abnormal growth. Clumping formed filamentous strings that migrated to the top of the culture tube when isolates were grown in TYE+CaCl₂. Several of the F. columnare isolates from all the genomovars exhibited delayed growth when a single cation source was provided. This study demonstrates phenotypic differences between and within genomovars of a single bacterial species when grown under different TYES media conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  a1930-32000-006cAgricultural Research Service 3aFlavobacterium columnare 3aaquaculture industry 3abiofilm 3acalcium 3acations 3agrowth retardation 3amagnesium 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3atryptones 3avirulence 3ayeast extract 3ayeasts1 aLipscomb, Ryan1 aBirkett, Clayton0 tCurrent microbiology.g2021 July, v. 78, no. 7 p.2474-2480dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-021-02507-83Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010100169300001600270520170600286592002801992650002002020650001802040650001402058650001702072650001202089650002502101650001102126650001802137650001002155650002602165650001502191650001402206650001502220650001902235650001902254650001802273651001002291653001102301653002102312653002302333653002002356653001002376653001802386700001702404700001802421773013302439856008602572852000902658655001202667IND60543343120221120043402.0190410e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054334312DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(15)30065-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHONG, Shuang10aResponses of Soil Nematode Abundance and Diversity to Long-Term Crop Rotations in Tropical China  ap. 844-852.  aA field experiment was carried out from 2003 to 2013 in the Wanzhong Farm of the Hainan Island, China, to determine the effects of two long–term banana rotations on the abundance and trophic groups of soil nematode communities in the island. The experiment was set out as a randomized complete block design with three replications of three treatments: banana–pineapple rotation (AB), banana–papaya rotation (BB) and banana monoculture (CK) in a conventional tillage system. Soil samples were taken at depths of 0–10, 10–20 and 20–30 cm, and nematodes were extracted by a modified cotton–wool filter method and identified to the genus level. Nematode ecological indices of Shannon–Weaver diversity (H′), dominance index (λ), maturity index (MI), plant parasite index (PPI), structure index (SI), enrichment index (EI), and channel index (CI) were calculated. A total of 28 nematode genera with relative abundance over 0.1% were identified, among which Tylenchus and Paratylenchus in the AB, Thonus in the BB, Tylenchus and Helicotylenchus in the CK were the dominant genera. The rotation soils favored bacterivores, fungivores and omnivores–predators with high colonizer–persister (c–p) values. Soil food web in the rotation systems was highly structured, mature and enriched as indicated by SI, MI and EI values, respectively. Higher abundance of bacterivores and lower values of CI suggested that the soil food web was dominated by a bacterial decomposition pathway in rotation soils. Nematode diversity was much higher after a decade of rotation. Soil depth had significant effects on the abundance of soil nematodes, but only on two nematode ecological indices (λ and MI).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicotylenchus 3aParatylenchus 3aTylenchus 3abacterivores 3abananas 3aconventional tillage 3acotton 3acrop rotation 3afarms 3afield experimentation 3afungivores 3aparasites 3asoil depth 3asoil food webs 3asoil nematodes 3asoil sampling 3aChina 0abanana 0aecological index 0anematode community 0arotation system 0ataxon 0atrophic group1 aZENG, Huicai1 aJIN, Zhiqiang0 tPedosphere.g2015 Dec., v. 25, no. 6 p.844-852dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(15)30065-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010000158300001600258520125400274592002801528650004401556650002101600650001801621650001301639650001301652650002201665700001401687773016901701856007301870852000901943655001201952IND60132559220221121044547.0150505e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013255922DNAL7 a10.1111/sum.121452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErdogan, H.

In areas designated as ‘Less Favoured Areas’ (LFA) agricultural production is hampered by natural handicaps, for example difficult climatic conditions, steep slopes in mountain areas or poor soil productivity. To delineate LFAs, a set of factsheets were provided by the EC Joint Research Center for mapping the proposed common soil, climate and terrain criteria. The present study was performed to determine the suitability of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources, 2006 (WRB) soil classification system in terms of estimating LFA thresholds. It was concluded that the WRB soil categories are directly applicable for delineating areas affected by the LFA criteria for soil constraints Organic Soil and Vertic Properties. The WRB categories correctly defined areas constrained by Salinity and Sodicity, but since they are stricter, than the LFA criteria, further analysis is needed to delineate the larger areas corresponding to LFA criteria. The climate and terrain criteria of LFA are only broadly indicated by WRB categories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Reference Base for Soil Resources 3aclimatic factors 3aorganic soils 3asalinity 3asodicity 3asoil productivity1 aTóth, T.0 tSoil use and management.g2014 Dec., v. 30, no. 4 p.560-568dPublished for the British Society of Soil Science by Blackwell Scientific Publicationsx0266-00327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.121453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001700182245010300199300001600302506007600318520114200394592002801536506003701564650001501601650002201616650001401638650001001652650001901662650002401681650001501705650001501720650003201735650003301767650002101800650003501821650002101856650002201877650001301899650004301912650002401955650001301979700001301992700001902005700001402024700001702038700001402055773009502069856008102164852000902245655001202254IND4486410920221207125549.0120501e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448641092DNAL7 a219037232pmid7 aPMC32230762pmcid7 a10.1093/dnares/dsr0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jia-Feng13aAn Integrative Method for Identifying the Over-Annotated Protein-Coding Genes in Microbial Genomes  ap. 435-449.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe falsely annotated protein-coding genes have been deemed one of the major causes accounting for the annotating errors in public databases. Although many filtering approaches have been designed for the over-annotated protein-coding genes, some are questionable due to the resultant increase in false negative. Furthermore, there is no webserver or software specifically devised for the problem of over-annotation. In this study, we propose an integrative algorithm for detecting the over-annotated protein-coding genes in microorganisms. Overall, an average accuracy of 99.94% is achieved over 61 microbial genomes. The extremely high accuracy indicates that the presented algorithm is efficient to differentiate the protein-coding genes from the non-coding open reading frames. Abundant analyses show that the predicting results are reliable and the integrative algorithm is robust and convenient. Our analysis also indicates that the over-annotated protein-coding genes can cause the false positive of horizontal gene transfers detection.

However, the scope of the proteins amenable to the analysis by top-down HDX MS still remains limited, with the protein size and the presence of disulfide bonds being the two most important limiting factors. While the limitations imposed by the physical size of the proteins gradually become more relaxed as the sensitivity, resolution and dynamic range of modern MS instrumentation continue to improve at an ever accelerating pace, the presence of the disulfide linkages remains a much less forgiving limitation even for the proteins of relatively modest size. To circumvent this problem, we introduce an online chemical reduction step following completion and quenching of the HDX reactions and prior to the top-down MS measurements of deuterium occupancy of individual backbone amides. Application of the new methodology to the top-down HDX MS characterization of a small (99 residue long) disulfide-containing protein β₂-microglobulin allowed the backbone amide protection to be probed with nearly a single-residue resolution across the entire sequence. The high-resolution backbone protection pattern deduced from the top-down HDX MS measurements carried out under native conditions is in excellent agreement with the crystal structure of the protein and high-resolution NMR data, suggesting that introduction of the chemical reduction step to the top-down routine does not trigger hydrogen scrambling either during the electrospray ionization process or in the gas phase prior to the protein ion dissociation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamides 3achemical reduction 3acrystal structure 3adeuterium 3adissociation 3adisulfide bonds 3agases 3ainstrumentation 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotein structure 3aproteins1 aKaltashov, Igor A.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Aug. 05, v. 86, no. 15 p.7293-7298dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac501789e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012200166520170200288592002801990650004102018650001102059650001702070650001202087650002002099650001202119650001502131650001602146650002202162650001802184650002802202650002002230650001502250651001002265651001702275653002502292653002702317653001602344653001102360653002802371653003402399700005902433700001602492700005802508700001602566700001502582700001802597700001402615773010502629856008602734852000902820655001202829IND60685566320221119220159.0200522e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068556632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1247942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yunyun10aHydrological drought evolution with a nonlinear joint index in regions with significant changes in underlying surface  aIt is critical important to accurately evaluate hydrological drought evolutions based on a composite index for the sustainable development of water resources. In this study, a Nonlinear Joint Hydrological Drought Index (NJHDI) is constructed by combining surface water and groundwater to better reflect the multivariate phenomenon in characterizing hydrological drought. The bi-dimensional copula function is applied to describe the complicated and nonlinear relationship between surface water and groundwater due to its dependence structure and flexibility. To reflect the changes in underlying surface, the time-varying parameters are applied in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate the surface water and groundwater more accurately. Based on the NJHDI, the spatio-temporal hydrological drought evolutions as well as their potential influencing factors are analyzed in a case study of the Yellow River Basin (YRB). Results indicate that: 1) compared to the single hydrological index, the NJHDI is more sensitive and effective to capture historically droughts; 2) hydrological droughts became increasingly serious during the last few decades, especially in parts of the basin located in the Loess Plateau areas where the ecosystem is extremely fragile; 3) climate and LULC changes have both contributed to the changes in hydrological droughts but their contributions vary significantly spatially. In general, the NJHDI-based hydrological drought evolution can provide more reliable information in hydrological drought decision-making owing to considering changes in underlying land surface, and combining the surface water and groundwater with nonlinear combination method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3abasins 3acase studies 3aclimate 3adecision making 3adrought 3aecosystems 3agroundwater 3asimulation models 3asurface water 3asustainable development 3awater resources 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aHydrological drought 0aNon-linear joint index 0aGroundwater 0aCopula 0aTime-varying parameters 0aPotential influencing factors1 aChang, Jianxia,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4267-26441 aLuo, Lifeng1 aChang, Jianxia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4267-26441 aWang, Yimin1 aGuo, Aijun1 aFan, Jingjing1 aLiu, Quan0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 June, v. 585 p.124794-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1247943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013000158300001600288520132500304592002801629650002401657650001701681650000901698650001501707650002501722650000901747650001001756650002201766650001001788650002401798650001701822650002401839650001701863650001801880650001501898651001301913700001901926700001901945700001601964700001701980700001801997700001702015700002002032700001302052773016902065856007302234852000902307655001202316IND60132559420221121044657.0150505e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013255942DNAL7 a10.1111/sum.121492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyamangara, J.10aInfluence of basin‐based conservation agriculture on selected soil quality parameters under smallholder farming in Zimbabwe  ap. 550-559.  aThe research was carried out to determine the effect of basin‐based conservation agriculture (CA) on selected soil quality parameters. Paired plots (0.01 ha) of CA and conventional tillage based on the animal‐drawn mouldboard plough (CONV) were established between 2004 and 2007 on farm fields on soils with either low (12–18% – sandy loams and sandy clay loams) or high clay levels (>18–46% – sandy clays and clays) as part of an ongoing project promoting CA in six districts in the smallholder farming areas of Zimbabwe. We hypothesized that CA would improve soil organic carbon (SOC), bulk density, aggregate stability, soil moisture retention and infiltration rate. Soil samples for SOC and aggregate stability were taken from 0 to 15 cm depth and for bulk density and soil moisture retention from 0 to 5, 5 to 10 and 10 to 15 cm depths in 2011 from maize plots. Larger SOC contents, SOC stocks and improved aggregate stability, decreased bulk density, increased pore volume and moisture retention were observed in CA treatments. Results were consistent with the hypothesis, and we conclude that CA improves soil quality under smallholder farming. Benefits were, however, greater in high clay soils, which is relevant to the targeting of practices on smallholder farming areas of sub‐Saharan Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregate stability 3abulk density 3aclay 3aclay soils 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3afarms 3ainfiltration rate 3aplows 3asmall-scale farming 3asoil density 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3asoil water 3aZimbabwe1 aMarondedze, A.1 aMasvaya, E.

Regression models are applicable to interpolate water quality data associated with streamflow data and have come to be extensively used, requiring relatively small amounts of data. There is a need to evaluate how well the regression models represent pollutant loads from intermittent water quality data sets. Both the specific regression model and water quality data frequency are important factors in pollutant load estimation. In this study, nine regression models from the Load Estimator (LOADEST) and one regression model from the Web-based Load Interpolation Tool (LOADIN) were evaluated with subsampled water quality data sets from daily measured water quality data sets for N, P, and sediment. Each water quality parameter had different correlations with streamflow, and the subsampled water quality data sets had various proportions of storm samples. The behaviors of the regression models differed not only by water quality parameter but also by proportion of storm samples. The regression models from LOADEST provided accurate and precise annual sediment and P load estimates using the water quality data of 20 to 40% storm samples. LOADIN provided more accurate and precise annual N load estimates than LOADEST. In addition, the results indicate that avoidance of water quality data extrapolation and availability of water quality data from storm events were crucial in annual pollutant load estimation using pollutant regression models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3adata collection 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3apollution load 3aregression analysis 3asediments 3astorms 3astream flow 3awater quality1 aEngel, Bernie A.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2015 Nov., v. 44, no. 6 p.1843-1851dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2015.03.01373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002800142245008400170300001600254506002800270520152800298592002801826506003701854650001501891650001601906650001401922650001401936650002201950650002201972650001901994650000902013650001602022650001002038651001202048700002202060700001502082700001702097700002502114700002202139700001902161773013502180856007702315852000902392655001202401IND60785705020221207114521.0091202e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078570502DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha37232502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCURTU, Alexandru Lucian10aAllozyme Variation of Coniferous Tree Species from Maramures Mountains, Romania  ap. 245-251.  aResource is Open Access  aTwo coniferous tree species, Norway spruce [Picea abies L. (Karst)] and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), from Maramures Mountains Nature Park, in northern Romania, were examined by means off allozyme markers. For Norway spruce, the genetic structure was observed at 19 enzyme coding loci in two populations situated at different elevations above the see level. Moderate levels of genetic variation within populations (on average, the number of alleles per locus was 2.14, the expected heterozygosity was 0.144) and an extremely low variation (FST=0.003) between the two populations was found. The genetic diversity was slightly higher in the low elevated population as compared to the high elevated spruce population. The estimated values for genetic multiplicity and diversity were comparable with those reported for a series of populations from the nearby Ukrainian Carpathians. For silver fir, the genetic variation was estimated at five enzyme coding loci from two enzyme systems, peroxidases and esterases, in five populations distributed throughout Maramures Mountains. Only three out of five loci were polymorphic in at least one population. The genetic diversity within populations was low (on average, expected heterozygosity was 0.093) and genetic differentiation among populations was relatively high (FST=0.106) which is consistent with their geographical position in the region. The results may contribute to a better understanding of the genetic structure in two of the most important tree species from Romania.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAbies alba 3aPicea abies 3aallozymes 3aesterases 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3aperoxidases 3atrees 3aRomania1 aSOFLETEA, Nicolae1 aRADU, Raul1 aBACEA, Anton1 aABRUDAN, Ioan Vasile1 aBUTIUC-KEUL, Anca1 aFARCAS, Sorina0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2009 Nov., v. 37, no. 2 p.245-251dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha37232503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012300156300001800279520107400297592002801371650002301399650001701422650002301439650001201462650001301474650001701487650002001504700002001524700001801544700002101562700002101583700001701604773011101621856007501732852000901807655001201816IND60529664020170410000000.0160717e20140805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052966402DNAL7 a10.1021/ac501801m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWyss, Romain10aMolecular and Dimensional Profiling of Highly Purified Extracellular Vesicles by Fluorescence Fluctuation Spectroscopy  ap. 7229-7233.  aCells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) into their microenvironment that act as mediators of intercellular communication under physiological conditions and in this context also actively participate in spreading various diseases. Large efforts are currently made to produce reliable EV samples and to develop, improve, and standardize techniques allowing their biophysical characterization. Here, we used ultrafiltration and size-exclusion chromatography for the isolation and a model-free fluorescence fluctuation analysis for the investigation of the physical and biological properties of EVs secreted by mammalian cells. Our purification strategy produced enriched samples of morphologically intact EVs free of extravesicular proteins and allowed labeling of marker molecules on the vesicle surface for single-vesicle analysis with single-molecule sensitivity. This novel approach provides information on the distribution profile of both EV size and relative expression level of a specific exosomal marker, deciphering the overall heterogeneity of EV preparations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell communication 3afluorescence 3agel chromatography 3amammals 3aproteins 3aspectroscopy 3aultrafiltration1 aGrasso, Luigino1 aWolf, Camille1 aGrosse, Wolfgang1 aDemurtas, Davide1 aVogel, Horst0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Aug. 05, v. 86, no. 15 p.7229-7233dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac501801m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03722naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012000168300001400288520153700302592002801839650001601867650002201883650002101905650001401926650001901940650001101959650001301970650002101983650001902004650001302023650002402036650001302060650001802073650001302091650001102104653002302115653003402138653001302172653002702185653002502212653000802237653000802245653000802253653000802261653000902269653000902278653001502287653002102302653001102323653000902334653000702343653000702350653000902357653000802366653000802374653001102382653000902393653000802402653000902410653000802419653000802427653000802435653000802443653000802451653000902459653000802468653000702476700001902483700001902502700002102521700006402542700001502606700001902621773013602640856008302776852000902859655001202868IND60732663520221118034419.0210428e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073266352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoide, Hiroyuki10aEnhancement of target toxin neutralization effect in vivo by PEGylation of multifunctionalized lipid nanoparticles  ap. 32-39.  aProtein–protein (e.g., antibody–antigen) interactions comprise multiple weak interactions. We have previously reported that lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) bind to and neutralize target toxic peptides after multifunctionalization of the LNP surface (MF-LNPs) with amino acid derivatives that induce weak interactions; however, the MF-LNPs aggregated after target capture and showed short blood circulation times. Here we optimized polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified MF-LNPs (PEG-MF-LNPs) to inhibit the aggregation and increase the blood circulation time. Melittin was used as a target toxin, and MF-LNPs were prepared with negatively charged, hydrophobic, and neutral amino-acid-derivative-conjugated functional lipids. In this study, MF-LNPs modified with only PEG5k (PEG5k-MF-LNPs) and with both PEG5k and PEG2k (PEGmix-MF-LNPs) were prepared, where PEG5k and PEG2k represent PEG with a molecular weight of 5000 and 2000, respectively. PEGylation of the MF-LNPs did not decrease the melittin neutralization ability of nonPEGylated MF-LNPs, as tested by hemolysis assay. The PEGmix-MF-LNPs showed better blood circulation characteristics than the PEG5k-MF-LNPs. Although the nonPEGylated MF-LNPs immediately aggregated when mixed with melittin, the PEGmix-MF-LNPs did not aggregate. The PEGmix-MF-LNPs dramatically increased the survival rate of melittin-treated mice, whereas the nonPEGylated MF-LNPs increased slightly. These results provide a fundamental strategy to improve the in vivo toxin neutralization ability of MF-LNPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3ablood circulation 3achemical bonding 3ahemolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3alipids 3amelittin 3amolecular weight 3aneutralization 3apeptides 3apolyethylene glycol 3aresearch 3asurvival rate 3atoxicity 3atoxins 0aLipid nanoparticle 0aProtein–protein interaction 0aMelittin 0aMultifunctionalization 0aToxin neutralization 0aBCA 0aCho 0aCy5 0aDDS 0aDMSO 0aDPPC 0aDPPE–NHS 0aDSPE-PEG2k or 5k 0aDiOC18 0aEDTA 0aEm 0aEx 0aFALT 0aFBS 0aLNP 0aMF-LNP 0aMeOH 0aMel 0amPEG 0aNHS 0aPBS 0aPDI 0aPEG 0aRES 0aRBCs 0aTEA 0aUV1 aSuzuki, Hikaru1 aOchiai, Hiroki1 aEgami, Hiromichi1 aHamashima, Yoshitaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6509-89561 aOku, Naoto1 aAsai, Tomohiro0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 May 28, v. 555 p.32-39dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04552naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245009800185300001600283520180700299592002802106650001102134650002402145650001702169650003102186650002502217650002902242650002202271650001502293650001702308650001502325650001102340650001802351650001602369650001302385650001902398650001302417650001402430650002902444650001302473650001202486650008802498650009102586650008702677650005002764650001402814650003702828650004702865650002202912650001102934650003902945650003002984650006103014650003803075650004303113650002603156650003203182650003203214650002903246650008103275650002203356650001703378651001103395700002403406700002503430700002203455700003003477700001903507700001803526773011203544856008103656852000903737655001203746IND4468287020221117164047.0141111e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446828702DNAL7 a215863192pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2011.04.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolivar, Paulina10aAntimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antiparasitic, and cytotoxic activities of Galium mexicanum  ap. 141-147.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: To study the potential benefit of the traditional Mexican medicinal plant Galium mexicanum Kunth (Rubiaceae). Hexane, chloroform, and methanol extracts as well as various fractions from these extracts were tested to determine antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic or anti-inflammatory activities in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aerial parts of the plant were extracted with various solvents and fractionated accordingly. Their antibacterial and antifungal activities were assessed on nine bacterial and four fungal strains. Leishmania donovani was used as a protozoan strain for antiparasitic activity. The anti-inflammatory activity of the compounds was investigated by measuring the secretion of interleukin-6 when macrophages were exposed to lipopolysaccharide. RESULTS: Various extracts and fractions obtained from this plant exhibit antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Of special interest was the hexane fraction HE 14b, which show antibacterial (ranging between 67 and 666μg/ml) and antifungal (at concentrations of 333μg/ml) activities. Also the hexane fraction HE 5 exhibited antiparasitic activity (at concentrations of 260μg/ml), whereas the methanol fraction ME 13–15 showed a potent anti-inflammatory activity when compared to dexamethasone. Chemical analyses of the chloroform extract show the presence of triterpenes, saponins, flavonoids, sesquiterpene lactones, and glucosides, but no tannins were detected in the assayed extract. CONCLUSIONS: The benefit of Galium mexicanum as a traditional medicinal plant was confirmed using antibacterial and antifungal assays in vitro. We also report for the first time, and to the best of our knowledge, antiparasitic and anti-inflammatory activities of this plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGalium 3aLeishmania donovani 3aaerial parts 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantibacterial plants 3aantibacterial properties 3achemical analysis 3achloroform 3acytotoxicity 3aflavonoids 3ahexane 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3amethanol 3aplant extracts 3asaponins 3asecretion 3asesquiterpenoid lactones 3asolvents 3atannins 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aAntiparasitic Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aCell Line 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFungixdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aGaliumxchemistry 2aHumans 2aInflammation Mediatorsxmetabolism 2aInterleukin-6xmetabolism 2aLeishmania donovanixdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aMacrophagesxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aMedicine, Traditional 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aParasitic Sensitivity Tests 2aPlant Components, Aerial 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aTime Factors 0aMexico1 aCruz-Paredes, Carla1 aHernández, Luis R.,1 aJuárez, Zaida N.1 aSánchez-Arreola, Eugenio1 aAv-Gay, Yossef1 aBach, Horacio0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 137, no. 1 p.141-147dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2011.04.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008400165300001600249520124600265592002801511650001101539650001601550650001101566650000901577650001901586650001001605650001501615650001601630650000901646650001001655650001401665650000901679650002501688650000901713653002201722653001201744653004101756653001501797700002601812700002301838700001901861700001901880700001901899700001601918700002101934773010301955856008302058852000902141655001202150IND60479516120221120044619.0160122e20061201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047951612DNAL7 a10.1556/ABiol.57.2006.4.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRapavi, Erika10aEffects of citrus flavonoids on redox homeostasis of toxin-injured liver in rat  ap. 415-422.  aIn order to evaluate the effect of diosmin-hesperidin containing drug on redox balance and Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn concentrations of toxin-injured liver, Wistar albino rats were subjected to thioacetamide administration (500 mg TAA/l in their drinking water) with and without drug (425 mg/kg body weight/day). Animals were treated for 30 days. No significant change in the concentration of Zn, Cu, Mn and Fe in the liver was measured in TAA-treated animals compared to control. Diosmin-hesperidin mixture treatment increased levels of Fe and Zn and decreased concentration of Cu of the liver in TAA-treated animals. These alterations were not significant. Decrease of both the total scavenger capacity (TSC) and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver homogenates were observed in TAA-treated rats. The diosmin-hesperidin-supplemented diet also significantly decreased the TSC and activity of SOD in liver of both the control and toxin-treated animals. On the basis of results it seems that high dosage of the diosmin-hesperidin mixture induces slight changes in the Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe content of the liver, however it may decrease the scavenger capacity and the activity of SOD when applied either alone or together with thioacetamide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3abody weight 3acopper 3adiet 3adrinking water 3adrugs 3aflavonoids 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3aliver 3amanganese 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase 3azinc 0aredox homeostasis 0aDiosmin 0athioacetamide-induced hepatotoxicity 0ahesperidin1 aSzentmihályi, Klára1 aFehér, Erzsébet,1 aLugasi, Andrea1 aSzékely, Edit1 aKurucz, Tímea1 aPallai, Zs.1 aBlázovics, Anna0 tActa biologica Hungarica.g2006 Dec. 1, v. 57, no. 4 p.415-422dAkadémiai Kiadóx0236-53837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FABiol.57.2006.4.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013600161300001800297520126500315592002801580650001301608650001201621650001601633650001101649650001801660650001501678650001701693650001401710650002101724650002401745650001701769650001601786700001601802700002101818700001801839700001801857773014201875856007402017852000902091655001202100IND60668864420221118134442.0190920e20130226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066886442DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta01330h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiang Ying12aA general conversion of polyacrylate–metal complexes into porous carbons especially evinced in the case of magnesium polyacrylate  ap. 4017-4025.  aAs a generalized synthetic protocol, porous carbons have been for the first time prepared by a direct carbonization of polyacrylate–metal complexes. The case of magnesium polyacrylate was emphatically studied. It reveals that the carbonization temperature can play a crucial role in the determination of surface areas, pore structures, surface functionalities of porous carbons as well as the correlative capacitive performances. The carbon-Mg-900 sample exhibits a high surface area of 942 m² g⁻¹ and a large total pore volume of 1.90 cm³ g⁻¹, with a high specific capacitance of 262.4 F g⁻¹ at 0.5 A g⁻¹ in 6.0 mol L⁻¹ aqueous KOH electrolyte. Moreover, it displays high capacitance retention even of 33.5% at 100 A g⁻¹, and long-term cycling ability (∼91.3% retention after 5000 cycles). More importantly, the present synthetic strategy can be extended to prepare other polyacrylate–metal complexes, such as calcium polyacrylate and aluminum polyacrylate. The carbon-Al-900 sample can exhibit a high surface area of 1556 m² g⁻¹ and a large total pore volume of 0.97 cm³ g⁻¹. To sum up, the carbon samples derived from magnesium polyacrylate possess the highest capacitive performances as supercapacitor electrode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3amagnesium 3apolyacrylic acid 3apotassium hydroxide 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aChen, Chong1 aZhang, Zhong Jie1 aXie, Dong Hua1 aLiu, Jian Wei0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Feb. 26, v. 1, no. 12 p.4017-4025dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta01330h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245007700161300001600238500000900254520167700263592002801940650001201968650001301980650001401993650001602007650001602023650002502039650002202064650002502086650002202111650002102133650002102154650001302175650001402188650001102202650001302213650001602226650001102242650000902253650002002262650002302282650001202305650001802317650002302335650001802358651001202376700002002388700001602408773019202424856007702616852000902693655001202702IND60665982220221117232246.0191028e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066598222DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2004.47602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodvang, S. J.10aChanges in Ground Water Quality in an Irrigated Area of Southern Alberta  ap. 476-487.  aepub  aFew studies have documented spatial and temporal variations in ground water quality in areas with high densities of animal farming operations (AFOs), or the long-term effects on surface-water quality. Changes in ground water quality were characterized in an irrigated area with a high density of AFOs in southern Alberta, Canada to evaluate the effect on ground water quality of manure application to fields. Fifty-five piezometers in the oxidized zone were sampled once or twice annually from 1995 to 2001, and temporal changes were analyzed using mixed model analysis. Average NO₃ ⁻–N increased significantly from 12.5 to 17.4 mg L⁻¹ and average Cl⁻ increased significantly from 19.4 to 34.4 mg L⁻¹ in piezometers installed in an unconfined sand aquifer at locations receiving fertilizer and manure. Compared with these manured locations, nitrate and chloride concentrations were significantly lower in shallow aquifer water in areas of pasture or native range, and concentrations did not change significantly with time. Nitrate and chloride concentrations in shallow ground water in fine-textured manured locations did not change significantly. Ground water below about 6 m in till and fine lacustrine sediments contains ¹⁸O signatures indicative of recharge under pre-irrigation or glacially influenced conditions, suggesting this ground water has a low vulnerability to agricultural contamination. Evaluations suggest that shallow ground water discharge will cause NO₃ ⁻–N and Cl⁻ in the Oldman River to increase by factors of at least 4.3 and 1.3, respectively, with more significant effects in smaller streams and under low-flow conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aaquifers 3achlorides 3afertilizers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3airrigated farming 3alacustrine sediments 3along term effects 3amanure spreading 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apastures 3apiezometers 3arivers 3asand 3astable isotopes 3astatistical models 3astreams 3asurface water 3atemporal variation 3awater quality 3aAlberta1 aMikalson, D.

Grain Yield at the Climate of Ardabil Region (Northwest Iran)  ap. 194-198.  aResource is Open Access  aIn order to study correlation between some traits and yield components of corn and to determine the most effective factors on its yield, an experiment was conducted at the agricultural research farm of university of Mohaghegh Ardabili in 2007. The experiment was conducted as a split plot in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Main plots were allocated at three levels to different planting dates (10, 20 May and 30 June) and subplots were allocated at the different levels of nitrogen fertilizer (0, 75, 150, 225 Kg N ha-1). The utilized corn seed was SC 404 hybrid. Sequential path analysis was used for evaluation of relationships between yield and yield attributes and to eliminate less important variables by using SPSS. Results showed that kernel per ear has the most correlation (r = 0.53) with grain yield. The grain yield and kernel per ear indicated negative and significant correlation with grain thickness (r = -0.33 and r = -0.52 respectively). The correlation between grain protein and thickness was negative and significant, too (r = -0.52). Results obtained from path analysis revealed that kernel per ear has more importance for selecting corn cultivars with high yield among different traits. Kernel per row and grain length had an effect on grain yield. Thus, these two traits can be attend in breeding programs and also be effective as a potential traits in improving desired corn cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3aagricultural research 3aclimate 3acorn 3acultivars 3afarms 3agrain protein 3agrain yield 3ahybrids 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apath analysis 3aseeds 3aIran1 aSEDGHI, Mohammad1 aSHARIFI, Rauf Seyed1 aSEIEDI, Mir Naser0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2009 June, v. 37, no. 1 p.194-198dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha37131203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024004000135040001800175100001900193245013500212300001600347506007600363520100400439592002801443506003701471650003201508650001701540650001201557650001201569650002301581650001701604650001101621650001001632650002101642650001601663650004301679650003001722650002801752650002601780650004101806650002401847650001701871650001501888650001001903650002601913650002901939653000801968653000901976653000801985653005701993653002302050653001602073653001402089653001702103700002502120700002102145700002002166700002202186773010602208856008702314852000902401655001202410IND50064882120221207115938.0190409e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006488212DNAL7 a235005682pmid7 aPMC36295572pmcid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.01.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElliston, Adam10aHigh concentrations of cellulosic ethanol achieved by fed batch semi simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of waste-paper  ap. 117-126.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA fundamental goal of second generation ethanol production is to increase the ethanol concentration to 10% (v/v) or more to optimise distillation costs. Semi simultaneous saccharification and fermentations (SSSF) were conducted at small pilot scale (5L) utilising fed-batch additions of solid shredded copier paper substrate. Early addition of Accellerase® 1500 at 16FPU/g substrate and 30U/g β-glucosidase followed by substrate only batch addition allowed low final equivalent enzyme concentrations to be achieved (3.7FPU/g substrate) whilst maintaining digestion. Batch addition resulted in a cumulative substrate concentration equivalent to 65% (w/v). This in turn resulted in the production of high concentrations of ethanol (11.6% v/v). The success of this strategy relied on the capacity of the bioreactor to perform high shear mixing as required. Further research into the timing and number of substrate additions could lead to further improvement in overall yields from the 65.5% attained.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconcentration of production 3adistillation 3aenzymes 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3amixing 3apaper 3asaccharification 3awaste paper 2aBatch Cell Culture Techniquesxmethods 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aHydrolysis 2aPaper 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aWaste Productsxanalysis 0aSSF 0aSSSF 0aβG 0aSimultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) 0aCellulosic ethanol 0aWaste paper 0aCellulase 0aFermentation1 aCollins, Samuel R.A.1 aWilson, David R.1 aRoberts, Ian N.1 aWaldron, Keith W.0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Apr., v. 134 p.117-126dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.01.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245011800153300001800271520118300289592002801472650002101500650001101521650002001532650001701552650001501569650003001584650001801614650002301632700001401655700001401669700001801683773011101701856007501812852000901887655001201896IND60529664220221120134030.0160717e20140805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052966422DNAL7 a10.1021/ac501814u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jian10aHighly Sensitive Real-Time Assay of Inorganic Pyrophosphatase Activity Based on the Fluorescent Gold Nanoclusters  ap. 7883-7889.  aOn the basis of the competition assay approach and fluorescent 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid-capped AuNCs (AuNCs@11-MUA) with unique optical properties, a convenient, reliable and highly sensitive real-time assay of pyrophosphatase (PPase) activity is established and developed for the first time. Pyrophosphate (PPi) could recover the Cu²⁺-quenched AuNCs@11-MUA fluorescence selectively owing to the higher binding affinity between PPi and Cu²⁺ than that between 11-MUA and Cu²⁺. Whereas PPase could catalyze the hydrolysis of PPi, thus released Cu²⁺, leading to fluorescence requenching of the AuNCs@11-MUA. In the assay, a good linearity between the fluorescence response and PPase activity within a range from 1 to 20 mU is found, with a detection limit of less than 1 mU, which is better than other PPase assays using PPi as the substrate. Additionally, we demonstrate that our AuNCs@11-MUA-based fluorescent assay can be applied to assay the PPase activity in real biological samples such as the cell lysate. This strategy paves a new avenue for exploring the sensing applications of fluorescence AuNCs and improving the development of competition assay approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3acopper 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3ahydrolysis 3ainorganic pyrophosphatase 3ananoparticles 3aoptical properties1 aYang, Fan1 aZhao, Dan1 aYang, Xiurong0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Aug. 05, v. 86, no. 15 p.7883-7889dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac501814u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03420naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011800170300001600288520186500304592002802169650002302197650001102220650001502231650002302246650002202269650001402291650002302305650002102328650002102349650002602370650001602396650002802412650002302440650002002463650002502483651001002508653002502518653002302543653002402566653002702590653003102617700001302648700001402661700001102675773013302686856008602819852000902905655001202914IND60543343720221120043441.0190410e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054334372DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(15)30071-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYANG, Chuanjie10aEffect of Deficit Irrigation on the Growth, Water Use Characteristics and Yield of Cotton in Arid Northwest China  ap. 910-924.  aWater shortage is a key constraint to sustainable agricultural production in Xinjiang, Northwest China. To enhance the use efficiency of valuable irrigation water resources, a 2–year experiment (2010–2011) was conducted to quantify the response of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) growth and yield to different degrees of deficit irrigation (DI) regimes; to determine the effects of DI on the characteristics of water use for cotton, seasonal water use, available soil water in the root zone, soil water depletion, evapotranspiration (ET)–based water use efficiency and irrigation–based water use efficiency, and to determine the best DI regime for optimal water–saving and yield output. The plots were irrigated at 100% (100ET), 85% (85ET), 70% (70ET), 55% (55ET) and 45% (45ET) of the regional ET of cotton in northern Xinjiang. The effect of DI irrigation on water use characteristics was evaluated by analyzing available soil water and soil water depletion in the root zone along with water use efficiencies of cotton. The study showed that the growth, water use characteristics and yield of cotton varied with irrigation regime. Seasonal ET and seed cotton yield were linearly correlated with irrigation amount. The second–order polynomial equation best approximated water–yield relationship of cotton in the study area. Cotton yield response factor was 0.65, suggesting limited water conditions were suitable for cotton cultivation. Economic evaluation of DI treatments confirmed that the yield loss was less than 10% under 70ET and 85ET, which was acceptable for greater sustainability. The results suggested that proper DI schemes were necessary for sustainable cotton production in the region. While irrigation at 85ET was safe for high cotton yield, irrigation at 70ET was a viable alternative under limited irrigation water availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3acrop yield 3adeficit irrigation 3aeconomic analysis 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3aplant available water 3arhizosphere 3asustainable agriculture 3awater conservation 3awater shortages 3awater use efficiency 3aChina 0aavailable soil water 0aevapotranspiration 0asoil water dynamics 0awater use efficiencies 0awater–yield relationship1 aLuo, Yi,1 aSun, Lin,1 aWU, Na0 tPedosphere.g2015 Dec., v. 25, no. 6 p.910-924dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(15)30071-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012200167300001600289520135000305592002801655650002801683650002101711650000901732650001001741650001501751650001701766700002601783700002101809700002301830700002001853773012801873856008202001852000902083655001202092IND60089425020221121052340.0141102e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008942502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.06.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez, Gina10aPreconditioning tachycardia decreases the activity of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the dog heart  ap. 916-921.  aCardioprotection by preconditioning is a central issue of current research on heart function. Several reports indicate that preventing the assembly and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) protects the heart against ischemia–reperfusion injury. We have previously reported that brief episodes of tachycardia decrease the infarct size produced by subsequent prolonged occlusion of a coronary artery, indicating that controlled tachycardia is an effective preconditioning manoeuvre. The effects of preconditioning tachycardia on mPTP activity have not been reported. Therefore, in this work we investigated if preconditioning tachycardia protects against calcium-induced mitochondrial swelling, a measure of mPTP activity. We found that tachycardia decreased by 2.5-fold the rate of mitochondrial calcium-induced swelling, a factor that presumably contributes to the cardioprotective effects of tachycardia. The oxidative status of the cell increased after tachycardia, as evidenced by the decrease in the cellular and mitochondrial GSH/GSSG ratio. We also observed increased S-glutathionylation of cyclophilin-D, an essential mPTP component, after tachycardia. This reversible redox modification of cyclophilin-D may account, al least in part, for the decreased mPTP activity produced by preconditioning tachycardia.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardioprotective effect 3acoronary vessels 3adogs 3aheart 3ainfarction 3apermeability1 aFernández, Carolina,1 aMontecinos, Luis1 aDomenech, Raúl J.1 aDonoso, Paulina0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 July 15, v. 410, no. 4 p.916-921dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.06.0953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245003200158300001800190520170300208592002801911650001501939650001801954650001901972650001001991650001302001650001302014650001202027650001402039700001602053700001602069700002702085700002702112700003302139700001902172700001802191773014202209856007402351852000902425655001202434IND60668864720221118132536.0190920e20130423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066886472DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta01345f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 akumar, Nitesh10aBorocarbonitrides, BₓCyNz  ap. 5806-5821.  aVarious forms of carbon, especially the nanocarbons, have received considerable attention in recent years. There has also been some effort to investigate borocarbonitrides, BₓCyNz, comprising besides carbon, the two elements on either side. Although uniformly homogeneous compositions of borocarbonitrides may be difficult to generate, there have been attempts to prepare them by solid state as well as gas phase reactions. Some of the products so obtained show evidence for the presence of BCN networks. Then, there are composites (G–BN) containing hexagonal BN (h-BN) and graphene (G) domains, G₁₋ₓ(BN)ₓ, in varying proportions. Nanotubes of BₓCyNz have been reported by several workers. The borocarbonitrides exhibit some interesting electronic and gas adsorption properties. Thus, some of the preparations show selective CO₂ adsorption. They also exhibit excellent characteristics for supercapacitor applications. In order to understand the nature of these understudied materials, it is necessary to examine the results from first-principles calculations. These calculations throw light on the variation in the band gap of G–BN with the concentration of h-BN, for different geometries of the domains and their boundaries. The possibility of formation of Stone–Wales (SW) defects at the interfaces of graphene and h-BN has been studied and the estimates of the formation energies of SW defects at the interfaces are ∼4 to 6 eV. The presence of such defects at the interfaces influences the electronic structure near the band gap and the associated properties.

After a control period, the scrotum of seven normospermic adult beagle dogs was insulated with a self‐made suspensory for 48 h. Nine weeks later, two animals were castrated, while in five animals, scrotal hyperthermia was repeated. Dogs were castrated either 10 or 40 days thereafter. In each phase of scrotal insulation, average scrotal surface temperature increased by 3.0°C. Semen was collected twice weekly throughout the experiment. Total sperm count did not change after the first hyperthermia, but it slightly decreased after the second (p < 0.05). Profiles of sperm morphology and velocity parameters (CASA) rather indicated subtle physiological variations in sperm quality than effects of a local heat stress. Chromatin stability of ejaculated spermatozoa as indicated by SCSA remained constant throughout the experiment. Perfusion characteristics of the gonads, that is, systolic peak velocity, pulsatility and resistance index at the marginal location of the testicular artery, did not change due to hyperthermia (p > 0.05). Histological examination of excised testes and epididymides for apoptotic (TUNEL and activated caspase‐3) and proliferating cells (Ki‐67 antigen) indicated only marginal effects of scrotal insulation on tissue morphology. In conclusion, a mild short‐term scrotal hyperthermia in dogs does not cause substantial changes in sperm quantity and quality. In contrast to other species, canine testes and epididymides may have a higher competence to compensate such thermal stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3aantigens 3ablood flow 3achromatin 3adogs 3afever 3aheat stress 3ahistology 3ainsulating materials 3ascrotum 3asemen 3aspermatozoa 3asurface temperature 3atestes 2aAcrosomexultrastructure 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aBody Temperaturexphysiology 2aCell Proliferation 2aChromatinxultrastructure 2aDogsxphysiology 2aEpididymisxcytology 2aHot Temperature 2aMale 2aOrchiectomyxveterinary 2aRegional Blood Flow 2aScrotumxphysiology 2aSemen Analysisxveterinary 2aSperm Count 2aSpermatozoaxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aTestisxblood supplyxcytologyxultrasonography.1 aMasal, C1 aHerr, A1 aWolf, K.,1 aUrhausen, C1 aBeineke, A1 aBeyerbach, M1 aKramer, S.,1 aGünzel‐Apel, A‐R0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2014 Feb., v. 49, no. 1 p.145-157dP.

The mean concentrations of total ClPAHs and BrPAHs were 0.54 and 0.25 ng/m³ in the urban site and 0.16 and 0.02 ng/m³ in the suburban site during the campaign, respectively. The variations in total Cl‐/BrPAH concentrations showed a similar trend between the urban and suburban sites, whereas the composition profiles varied in each air sample. The relationships between the concentrations among individual compounds in the urban site suggest that dominant sources of Cl‐/BrPAHs could be common to PAHs but not in the suburban site. Principal component analysis using the data set of certain compounds showed that Cl‐/BrPAH concentrations in urban and suburban sites are occasionally driven by specific sources of either coal combustion or traffic emissions. In contrast, most air samples during the campaign could be attributed to a mix of those sources.

A comparison of profiles from the morphologically contrasted parental individuals and F<sub>2</sub> offspring has been assessed using five AFLP primer combinations.

However, the effects of these transgenic lines on Sesamia inferens (Walker), an important lepidopterous rice pest, are currently unknown. Because different insect species have varying susceptibility to Bt insecticidal proteins that may affect population dynamics, research into the effects of these transgenic rice lines on the population dynamics of S. inferens was conducted in Fuzhou, southern China, in 2005 and 2006. The results of laboratory, field cage, and field plot experiments show that S. inferens has comparatively high susceptibility to the transgenic line during the early growing season, with significant differences observed in larval density and infestation levels between transgenic and control lines. Because of a decrease in Cry1Ac levels in the plant as it ages, the transgenic line provided only a low potential for population suppression late in the growing season. There is a correlation between the changing expression of Cry1Ac and the impact of transgenic rice on the population dynamics of S. inferens during the season. These results indicate that S. inferens may become a major pest in fields of prospective commercially released transgenic rice, and more attention should be paid to developing an effective alternative management strategy. 3amoths 3atrypsin inhibitors 3agenes 3apopulation dynamics 3aplant pests 3aSesamia inferens 3agene expression 3ainsect control 3adefense mechanisms 3atemporal variation 3aplant growth 3aZea mays 3ainsect pests 3aplant-insect relations 3acorn 3abiological control 3atransgenic plants 3agenetic variation 3aChina 0aresistance mechanisms 0abiological resistance1 aLiu, Peilei1 aWu, Kongming1 aPeng, Yufa1 aWang, Feng0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2008 Oct., v. 37, no. 5 p.1361-1370dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X(2008)37[1361:PDOSIO]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20090225b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/02/14  aOther US 7aarticle01953naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011400166300001800280520079700298592002801095650001401123650001401137650002301151650002301174653001401197653002501211653001701236653001501253653002101268653001901289700005801308700005401366773008101420856008101501852000901582655001201591IND60551485420221121224712.0161018e20150610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055148542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2015.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagnus, Philip10aNew strategy for the synthesis of proaporphine and homoproaporphine-type alkaloids from a common intermediate  ap. 3872-3877.  aStarting with 3-bromo-4,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde 14, it was coupled with the boronic anhydride 15 using standard Suzuki reaction conditions to give 16 (91%).

Populations  ap. 5139-5152.  aJournal Article  aOrganic growers face unique challenges when raising sweet corn, and benefit from varieties that maintain high eating quality, germinate consistently, deter insect pests, and resist diseases. Genotype by environment rank changes can occur in the performance of cultivars grown on conventional and organic farms, yet few varieties have been bred specifically for organic systems. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the changes made to open-pollinated sweet corn populations using recurrent selection and a participatory plant breeding (PPB) methodology. From 2008 to 2011, four cycles of two open-pollinated (OP) sweet corn populations were selected on a certified organic farm in Minnesota using a modified ear-to-row recurrent selection scheme. Selections were made in collaboration with an organic farmer, with selection criteria based on traits identified by the farmer. In 2012 and 2013, the population cycles were evaluated in a randomized complete block design in two certified organic locations in Wisconsin, with multiple replications in each environment. Significant linear trends were found among cycles of selection for quantitative and qualitative traits, suggesting the changes were due to recurrent selection and PPB methodology for these populations. However, further improvement is necessary to satisfy the requirements for a useful cultivar for organic growers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acultivars 3afarms 3afood quality 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrowers 3ainsect pests 3aopen pollination 3aplant breeding 3arecurrent selection 3aselection criteria 3asweetcorn 3aMinnesota 3aWisconsin1 aTracy, William F.0 tSustainability.g2015 Apr. 27, v. 7, no. 5 p.5139-5152dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su70551393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001900150245010800169300001800277520100600295592002801301650003001329650002101359650002201380650001401402650001601416650001601432650001501448650001001463650001801473650001801491650001501509650001301524650000901537650003601546700001401582700001701596773009401613856008601707852000901793655001201802IND4459014520221117214020.0141110e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445901452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Xiaodong14aThe mRNA abundance of pepc2 gene is negatively correlated with oil content in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ap. 1811-1817.  aMany microalgae accumulate oils, especially under stress conditions, thus have attracted more and more attention as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. However, little information is available for molecular mechanisms that control oil accumulation in microalgae. In this study, we investigated the accumulation of oils during nitrogen (N) deprivation in the model green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our results indicated that oil content significantly increased after N deficiency in C. reinhardtii, which was accompanied by a drastic decrease (63–91%) in the transcript level of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 2 (PEPC2), an enzyme that converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to oxaloacetate (OAA), which conjugates with acetyl-CoA to generate citric acid. Furthermore, down regulation of pepc2 gene by RNAi silencing in C. reinhardtii led to 14–28% increase in oil content. These results revealed a negative correlation between pepc2 mRNA abundance and oil content in C. reinhardtii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aRNA interference 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3abiodiesel 3acitric acid 3acorrelation 3afeedstocks 3agenes 3alipid content 3amessenger RNA 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aoils 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase1 aLi, Yajun1 aFei, Xiaowen0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2011 May, v. 35, no. 5 p.1811-1817dElsevier Ltdx0961-95347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245008800186300001800274520235300292592002802645650001902673650002102692650001402713650001802727650002202745650001402767650001602781650001202797650002002809650000902829650001702838650001202855650001602867653002202883653002202905653001402927653002102941700001502962700001802977700002102995773011403016856008103130852000903211655001203220IND60652431820221119090450.0190712e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065243182DNAL7 a279177412pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311160025732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Calwant,14aThe behaviour and welfare of sows and piglets in farrowing crates or lactation pens  ap. 1210-1221.  aTemporary confinement during parturition and early postpartum may provide an intermediary step preceding loose housing that offers improvement in sow and piglet welfare. Three experiments were conducted to investigate the implications of replacing farrowing crates (FCs) with an alternative housing system from 3 days postpartum until weaning. In each experiment sows farrowed in FCs and were randomly allocated at day 3 of lactation to either a FC or a pen with increased floor space (lactation pen (LP)) until weaning. In experiment 1, piglet growth and sow and piglet skin injuries were recorded for 32 sows and 128 focal piglets in these litters. Behaviour around nursing and piglet behavioural time budgets were also recorded for 24 of these litters (96 focal piglets for time budgets). In experiment 2, measures of skin injury and behavioural time budgets were conducted on 28 sows and 112 focal piglets. The behavioural response of sows to piglet vocalisation (maternal responsiveness test (MRT)) was also assessed. In experiment 3, piglet mortality from day 3 of lactation until weaning was recorded in 672 litters over 12 months. While housing did not affect piglet weight gain in experiment 1, or piglet skin injuries in experiments 1 or 2, sows in both experiments sustained more injuries in LP than FC (experiment 1, 2.9 v. 1.4; experiment 2, 2.5 v. 0.8 lesions/sow; P<0.05). Sow–piglet interactions were more frequent in LP than FC at days 11 and 18 postpartum in both experiment 1 (day 11, 1.4% v. 1.2%; day 18, 1.7% v. 1.0% of observations; P=0.05) and 2 (day 11, 1.0% v. 0.3%; and at day 18 were 1.0% v. 0.6% of observations; P<0.01), and LP sows were more responsive in the MRT in experiment 2 (2 v. 0 median number of tests in which sows react, P<0.01). In experiment 1 piglets played more (0.7% v. 0.3% of observations, P=0.05) and manipulated others less (0.3% v. 0.7% of observations, P=0.04) in LP, but more piglets missed nursing bouts (0.2 v. 0.1 piglets/bout, P<0.01) compared with FC. There was no effect of housing on piglet mortality from day 3 of lactation until weaning in experiment 3 (0.63 and 0.64 deaths/litter for LP and FC, respectively, P>0.05). Thus, housing sows and litters in LP from day 3 of lactation minimises piglet mortality while improving maternal behaviour in sows and social behaviour in piglets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3afarrowing crates 3alactation 3aloose housing 3amaternal behavior 3amortality 3aparturition 3apiglets 3asocial behavior 3asows 3avocalization 3aweaning 3aweight gain 0alactation housing 0aloose-housed sows 0abehaviour 0apiglet mortality1 aVerdon, M.1 aCronin, G.

On the organelle level, active small molecules also play an important role in the maintenance of organelle functions and roles. To investigate the relationship of biomolecules in subcellular, it is necessary and critical to develop molecular tools that can track two kinds of associated biomolecules within organelles with multiple fluorescence signals. However, this is still an unmet challenge up to date. Herein, we present the first single-fluorescent probe (Lyso-HA-HS) that can detect oxidative (HOCl) and reductive (H₂S) substances within an organelle (lysosomes) with multiresponse signals. The reactions of the new probe with H₂S and HOCl simultaneously result in the blue and red channels emissions, respectively, providing different signal responses to the oxidative and reductive substances in the cellular lysosomes. Using a single fluorescent probe, we first achieved dual-channel imaging of the endogenous hypochlorous acid and hydrogen sulfide, respectively, in the lysosomes in the living cells. Moreover, the highly desirable attributes of the probe Lyso-HA-HS (such as high selectivity, good membrane-permeability, and lysosome enrichment ability) may enable it to be used in revealing the relationship of HOCl and H₂S in lysosomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical compounds 3aemissions 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aimage analysis 3alysosomes 3amembrane permeability1 aLi, Zihong1 aDeng, Beibei1 aWang, Li1 aLin, Weiying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8080-41020 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Jan. 17, v. 91, no. 4 p.2932-2938dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b051163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245023400160300001600394520044900410592002800859650002200887650002300909650001600932650001500948650001300963650001300976650001100989650001301000650001301013650002001026700001901046700001601065773010701081856007501188852000901263655001201272IND60637648320221122063028.0190422e20150623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063764832DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1973.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHausbrandt, L.10aPoszukiwanie samorzutnych mutantów woskowych wśród ziaren pyłku u kilku gatunków i linii 24-chromosomowych ziemniaków [The searching for the spontaneous waxy mutation in pollen grains of some diploid forms of wild potatoes]  ap. 293-302.  aOnly in one of 12 investigated species i.e. in Solanum chacoense (gibberulosum) which became pollen staining red when treated with I+KI was been found.

STEC virulence is considered to correlate with the amount of Shiga toxins (Stx) produced, especially Stx2, whose subtype Stx2a is most frequently associated with high virulence. Stx are encoded in prophages, which play an important role in STEC pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate stx₂ₐ expression levels and Stx2a phage production using qPCR and the double‐agar‐layer method in 29 STEC strains, corresponding to serotypes O26:H11 (6), O91:H21 (1), O145:H‐ (11) and O157:H7 (11), isolated from cattle and humans. Results were then tested for possible associations with serotype, origin or some genetic features. We observed heterogeneous levels of stx₂ₐ expression and Stx2a phage production. However, statistical comparisons identified a higher stx₂ₐ expression in response to mitomycin C in strains isolated from cattle than in those from humans. At the same time, compared to stx₂ₐ/stx₂c strains, stx₂ₐ strains showed a higher increase in phage production under induced conditions. Notably, most of the strains studied, regardless of serotype and origin, carried inducible Stx2a phages and evidenced expression of stx₂ₐ that increased along with phage production levels under induced conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT‐2015‐2666cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica  a03/H285cSecretaría de Ciencia, Arte y Tecnología, Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (SECAT‐UNICEN)  aPIP 0662 and PUE‐CIVETANcConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas 3aShiga toxin 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3acattle 3adiarrhea 3adisease severity 3ahumans 3amitomycin 3apathogenesis 3aphages 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aserotypes 3avirulence1 aKrüger, Alejandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1826-21431 aLucchesi, Paula M.

Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent that can react directly, or via production of reactive oxygen species, with proteins, DNA and double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The aim of the present study was to investigate the mode of action in ozone toxicity using the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), as a relevant model. Transcription of focal genes thought to be involved in protection against ozone, and repair of cellular damage caused by ozone exposure, was studied together with the composition of storage lipid fatty acids and membrane phospholipid fatty acids in order to detect lipid peroxidation. Contrary to expectations, transcription of focal genes (Cu/Zn-Superoxide Dismutase, Catalase, Glutathione Peroxidase, Glutathione S-Transferase, Δ-9 Desaturase 1, Δ-12 Desaturase, DNA Ligase IV, Heat Shock Proteins 60, 70, 83) was either decreased or unchanged in larvae and adults exposed to 40 ppm ozone for 6 or 24 h, respectively, as compared to parallel control samples. No, or only little, peroxidation of lipid fractions occurred during exposure to 40 ppm ozone, although it was demonstrated that this concentration is sufficient to kill both larvae and adults of the red flour beetle. Possible explanations for these observations may be that the time-scale of the experimentation was such that any up-regulatory change may have been missed, or that ozone had caused a general depression of metabolism (including transcription of reactive oxygen species detoxifying genes) as the insects had been oxygen-deprived due to longer than normal closure of the spiracles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aTribolium castaneum 3aadults 3acatalase 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3agrains 3aheat shock proteins 3ainsect control 3ainsect pests 3alarvae 3alipid peroxidation 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aozone 3aphospholipids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3areactive oxygen species 3aspiracles 3atoxicity1 aSørensen, Jesper Givskov1 aHeckmann, Lars-Henrik1 aSlotsbo, Stine1 aHansen, Peer1 aHansen, Lise Stengaard0 tJournal of stored products research.g2011 Oct., v. 47, no. 4 p.378-384dElsevier Ltdx0022-474X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2011.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245015500172300001600327520144100343592002801784650002201812650003701834650001501871650001501886650002201901650002101923650002201944650002601966650003701992650001402029650001902043650000902062650001902071650002002090650000702110650003402117650002302151650001702174650002102191653001502212653002902227653002302256653002402279700005902303700001802362700001602380700001602396700001502412700001402427700001402441700001302455700001902468700001202487700001202499773011902511856008802630852000902718655001202727IND60632914220221118232218.0201111e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063291422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.01.2492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Weiping10aAdsorption of tetracycline antibiotics from aqueous solutions on nanocomposite multi-walled carbon nanotube functionalized MIL-53(Fe) as new adsorbent  ap. 235-244.  aAdsorption of tetracycline antibiotics from aqueous solutions by a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) loaded iron metal-organic framework (MIL-53(Fe)) composite was studied. The adsorbent was characterized by environmental scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, brunauer-emmett-teller, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectrum, and X-ray photoelectron spectrum. The adsorption kinetics of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCN), oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC), and chlortetracycline hydrochloride (CTC) were all well fitted to the pseudo-second-order equation as well as the adsorption isotherms could be well delineated via Langmuir equations. The main influencing factors such as pH and ionic strength were studied in detail. At initial pH of 7.0, maximum adsorption capacity of TCN, OTC and CTC on MWCNT/MIL-53(Fe) was 364.37, 325.59, 180.68 mg·g⁻¹ at 25 °C, which was 1.25, 8.28 and 3.34 times than that of single MWCNT, respectively. The adsorption capacity of TCS for this adsorbent was in the order: TCN > OTC > CTC, which was determined by the adsorbate molecule magnitude. In addition, π-π adsorbate-adsorbent interactions played an important role during the adsorption process. The excellent reusability and great water stability indicated the potential application of this novel composite in the removal of TCS from aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon nanotubes 3achlortetracycline 3acoordination polymers 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aequations 3aionic strength 3airon 3ananocomposites 3aoxytetracycline 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asorption isotherms 3atetracycline 3athermogravimetry 0aAdsorption 0aTetracycline antibiotics 0aπ-π interactions 0aMWCNT nanocomposite1 aZeng, Guangming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4230-76471 aYang, Zhaohui1 aZhou, Yaoyu1 aZhang, Chen1 aCheng, Min1 aLiu, Yang1 aHu, Liang1 aWan, Jia1 aZhou, Chengyun1 aXu, Rui1 aLi, Xin0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 June 15, v. 627 p.235-244dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.01.2493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245008800158520147100246592002801717650001801745650001501763650001201778650002201790650002801812650002201840650001301862650001501875650001901890650001401909650001501923650000901938650002701947650001501974650001301989650001202002651001602014651001202030651001002042651001102052700002202063700002302085700001902108700002102127700002002148700002702168700002402195700002202219700002302241773011902264856007202383852000902455655001202464IND60648692420221120225711.0190701e20170316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064869242DNAL7 a10.3390/f80300812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVischi, Massimo10aGenetic Diversity of Walnut (<em>Juglans Regia</em> L.) in the Eastern Italian Alps  aJuglans regia L. is distributed primarily across temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere. During the last glaciation, the species survived in refugial areas that in Europe included the Balkans and the Italian peninsula, two areas joined by a corridor represented by the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, where two germplasm reservoirs met and likely intercrossed during re-colonization after the last glaciation. In this work, two hundred and fifteen wild accessions native to the area were sampled, georeferenced, and genotyped with 20 microsatellite loci selected from the literature. The local accessions of this study displayed moderate genetic diversity with 80 alleles identified. The number of alleles/loci was 4.0 (4.7 alleles for the genomic SSRs (Simple Sequence Repeats) and 2.7 alleles per EST (Expressed Sequence Tag)-derived SSR, on average). An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that most of the molecular diversity was between individuals (nearly 98% of variation explained). The model-based clustering algorithms implemented either in STRUCTURE and GENELAND software revealed two clusters: The first one encompassed most of the samples and showed a great genetic admixture throughout the five sampling areas defined on the base of orographic characteristics of the region. The second cluster represented a small island with three samples traced back to an introduction from Russia at the beginning of the 20th century.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuglans regia 3aalgorithms 3aalleles 3acomputer software 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3ageoreferencing 3agermplasm 3aglaciation 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asubtropics 3avariance 3awalnuts 3aAlps region 3aBalkans 3aItaly 3aRussia1 aChiabà, Cristina1 aRaranciuc, Steluta1 aPoggetti, Luca1 aMessina, Rachele1 aErmacora, Paolo1 aCipriani, G.q(Guido),1 aPaffetti, Donatella1 aVettori, Cristina1 aTestolin, Raffaele0 tForests.g2017 Mar. 16, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f80300813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245005100160300001800211500002000229520097800249592002801227650001901255650002501274650002501299650002401324650002201348650002201370650001701392650001501409651001701424700002401441773013801465856007301603852000901676655001201685IND60651715020221120022820.0190712e20150427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065171502DNAL7 a10.3390/su70551532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelloumi, Mounir10aSustainable Energy Development in Saudi Arabia  ap. 5153-5170.  aJournal Article  aThe main objective of this research is to study the role of energy consumption in economic growth in Saudi Arabia over the period of 1971–2012 using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) cointegration procedure, and based on neoclassical growth, endogenous growth, and ecological-economics viewpoints. Our empirical results show the existence of a cointegrating relationship between the different variables investigated. In addition, all the inputs (conventional and non-conventional) Granger cause economic growth in both the short and long runs. Our findings confirm the energy-led growth hypothesis in the case of Saudi Arabia. Hence, energy conservation policies may deteriorate economic growth in Saudi Arabia if they are not followed by measures that improve energy efficiency, energy saving technologies and encourage the investment and use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energies that can participate in the attenuation of climate changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aecological economics 3aeconomic development 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3aissues and policy 3asolar energy 3awind power 3aSaudi Arabia1 aAlshehry, Atef Saad0 tSustainability.g2015 Apr. 27, v. 7, no. 5 p.5153-5170dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su70551533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012400170500001900294520095600313592002801269650001201297650001601309650002001325650001601345650002601361650001301387650001301400650001301413653004001426653003701466653001801503653003401521700001501555700001801570700001601588700001601604700001501620773011901635856008801754852000901842655001201851IND60713239020221119160738.0210423e20210410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071323902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1428372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Haichao,10aDenitrification performance and bacterial flora analysis of immobilized denitrification filler in industrial wastewater  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe study aimed at evaluating the nitrogen removal performance of the immobilized denitrification filler, and the influence of shock loading on the high-rate denitrification process. A pilot scale reactor was operated for treatment of aniline production wastewater. The nitrogen removal activity significantly increased in the continuous feed experiments, reaching 5.23 kg N m⁻³ day⁻¹ on day 31 (30 °C) at Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) = 10 h. In the impact experiment, the denitrification filler was inhibited by Free Nitrite Acid (FNA) when the shock load flowed 1.5 times into the bioreactor and recovered after the load was restored for 20 h. The high-throughput results demonstrated that the dominant position of the denitrifying bacteria further enhanced in a micro toxic and high-salinity environment, providing a basis for the dominance of the composite denitrifying bacteria and the efficacy of the immobilization technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaniline 3abioreactors 3adenitrification 3aenvironment 3aindustrial wastewater 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3atoxicity 0aHigh concentration nitrate nitrogen 0aHigh salinity aniline wastewater 0aShock loading 0aMicrobial community structure1 aYang, Hong1 aLiu, Zongyue,1 aZhou, YaKun1 aLi, Hongli,1 aLi, ShiLei0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Apr. 10, v. 764 p.142837-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1428373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010300170300001800273520083200291592002801123650002101151650001401172650001301186650002201199650002201221650001701243653002601260653002401286653001001310653001801320700001301338700005701351700002101408700001501429700001901444700001801463700001601481700001201497700001601509773014401525856008501669852000901754655001201763IND60693085820221120041537.0200504e20200409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069308582DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c001062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, You-Xiao10aHighly Efficient Orange Emissive Graphene Quantum Dots Prepared by Acid-Free Method for White LEDs  ap. 6657-6666.  aGraphene quantum dots (GQDs) have wide prospective applications for optoelectronic fields owing to their unique characteristics, such as tunable bandgaps, high chemical and optical stability, as well as good biocompatibility.

In this study, Arctic sea ice DOM was characterized for its optical (fluorescence) properties as well as the molecular sizes and composition via size exclusion chromatography and Fourier transformation ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). Ice cores were collected along with the underlying seawater samples in Cambridge Bay, an Arctic area experiencing seasonal ice formation. The ice core samples revealed a marked enrichment of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compared to the seawater counterparts (up to 6.2 times greater). The accumulation can be attributed to in situ production by the autotrophic and heterotrophic communities. Fluorescence excitation emission matrices (EEMs) elaborated with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) evidenced the prevalence of protein-like substances in the ice cores, which likely results from in situ production followed by accumulation in the ice. Size exclusion chromatography further revealed the in situ production of all DOM size fractions, with the exception of the humic substance fraction. The majority of DOM in both the ice and seawater consists of low molecular weight compounds (<350 Da) probably derived by the microbial degradation/transformation of freshly produced DOM. Molecular characterization also supported the in situ production of DOM and highlighted the marked difference in molecular composition between sea ice and seawater. This study provides new insights into the possible role of sea ice DOM in the Arctic carbon cycle under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate change 3adissolved organic carbon 3afactor analysis 3afluorescence 3agel chromatography 3ahumic substances 3aice 3amass spectrometry 3amelting 3amolecular weight 3aseawater 3aArctic region 3aCanada 0aDOM 0aSea ice 0aArctic 0aEEM-PARAFAC 0aSEC-OCD 0aFT-ICR-MS1 aHa, Sun-yong,1 aKim, Kwanwoo1 aDerrien, Morgane1 aLee, Yun Kyung1 aHur, Jin0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 June 15, v. 627 p.802-811dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.01.2513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245018000168300001800348520188200366592002802248650002302276650001502299650001302314650001502327650001602342650002102358650002002379650002602399650001402425650001302439650001702452650002002469650001402489650001102503650001802514650001702532700001702549700001902566700001902585700001902604700005602623700001602679773012802695856008402823852000902907655001202916IND60631170520221118032901.0190219e20190128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063117052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b051532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Xiang-Ru10aAccurate Clinical Diagnosis of Liver Cancer Based on Simultaneous Detection of Ternary Specific Antigens by Magnetic Induced Mixing Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Emissions  ap. 2955-2963.  aEstablishing an accurate, simple, and rapid serodiagnosis method aiming for specific cancer antigens is critically important for the clinical diagnosis, therapy, and prognostication of cancer. Currently, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) readout techniques challenge fluorescent-based detection methods in terms of both optical stability and more importantly multiple detection capability, which become more desirable for clinical diagnostics. We thus started using an interference-free mixing SERS emission (m-SERS) readout to simultaneously indicate, for the first time, three specific liver cancer antigens, including α-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and ferritin (FER), even in one clinical serum sample. Here, three triple bonds (C≡N and C≡C) coded SERS tags contribute separate SERS emissions located at 2105, 2159, and 2227 cm–¹, respectively; must have one-to-one correspondence from AFP, to FER, to CEA, In the process of detection, the mature double antibody sandwich allows the formation of microscale core–satellite assembly structure between a magnetic bead (MB) and single SERS tags, and therefore a pure and single SERS emission can be observed under the routine excitation laser spot. Because of the action of magnetic force, the uniform 3D packing of SERS tags absorbed MBs will in contrast generate a so-called m-SERS signals. With the help of enrichment and separation by MBs, the proposed m-SERS immunoassay provides an extremely rapid, sensitive, and accurate solution for multiplex detection of antigens or other biomarkers. Herein, the limit of detection (LOD) for simultaneous m-SERS detection of AFP, CEA, and FER was 0.15, 20, and 4 pg/mL, respectively. As expected for 39 clinical serum samples, simultaneous detection of ternary specific antigens can significantly improve the accuracy of liver cancer diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3achemical bonding 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3aemissions 3aferritin 3aimmunoassays 3aliver neoplasms 3amagnetism 3amixing 3aserodiagnosis 3atherapeutics1 aWang, Li-Hua1 aRen, Jia-Qiang1 aBai, Xiang-Wei1 aZeng, Ling-Wen1 aShen, Ai-Guo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3762-17031 aHu, Ji-Ming0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Jan. 28, v. 91, no. 4 p.2955-2963dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b051533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011900162300001800281500002000299520139200319592002801711650001301739650001701752650002301769650001101792650001301803650001501816650001601831650002901847650001201876650002801888651001601916700001801932700002201950700002101972700002501993773013802018856007302156852000902229655001202238IND60651715220221117171247.0190712e20150423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065171522DNAL7 a10.3390/su70548062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Waal, Renée M.10aIncorporating Renewable Energy Science in Regional Landscape Design: Results from a Competition in The Netherlands  ap. 4806-4828.  aJournal Article  aEnergy transition is expected to make an important contribution to sustainable development. Although it is argued that landscape design could foster energy transition, there is scant empirical research on how practitioners approach this new challenge. The research question central to this study is: To what extent and how is renewable energy science incorporated in regional landscape design? To address this knowledge gap, a case study of a regional landscape design competition in the Netherlands, held from 2010–2012, is presented. Its focus was on integral, strategic landscape transformation with energy transition as a major theme. Content analysis of the 36 competition entries was supplemented and triangulated with a survey among the entrants, observation of the process and a study of the competition documents and website. Results indicated insufficient use of key-strategies elaborated by renewable energy science. If landscape design wants to adopt a supportive role towards energy transition, a well-informed and evidence-based approach is highly recommended. Nevertheless, promising strategies for addressing the complex process of ensuring sustainable energy transition also emerged. They include the careful cultivation of public support by developing inclusive and bottom-up processes, and balancing energy-conscious interventions with other land uses and interests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acase studies 3aempirical research 3aenergy 3aland use 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3arenewable energy sources 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3aNetherlands1 aStremke, Sven1 aHoorn, Anton van,1 aDuchhart, Ingrid1 aBrink, Adri van den,0 tSustainability.g2015 Apr. 23, v. 7, no. 5 p.4806-4828dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su70548063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01588naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001300141245022700154300001300381520052300394592002800917650001700945650001100962650001900973650001200992650001701004650001201021650001701033650001101050700001301061773010401074856007501178852000901253655001201262IND60637648720221122054712.0190422e20150623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063764872DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1973.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuta, E.10aBadanie wpływu naturalnych ekstraktów roślinnych na izolowane wierzchołki wzrostów pedów w hodowli in vitro [Investigation of the influence of natural plant extracts on isolated generative apices cultivated in vitro]  ap. 5-15.  aThe aim of the present paper Was to test the value of various plant extracts (yeast barm, mature walnut embryos, coconut meal, young spinach leaves and tomato juice) used as the complementary elements of White's mineral nutrient for the culture in vitro of generative apices of winter wheat, rape and wetch.

The conventional approach to biomass estimation heavily relies on the tree species and site-specific allometric equations, which are based on destructive methods. This paper introduces a non-destructive, laser-based approach (terrestrial laser scanner) for individual tree aboveground biomass estimation in the Royal Belum forest reserve, Perak, Malaysia. The study area is in the state park, and it is believed to be one of the oldest rainforests in the world. The point clouds generated for 35 forest plots, using the terrestrial laser scanner, were geo-rectified and cleaned to produce separate point clouds for individual trees. The volumes of tree trunks were estimated based on a cylinder model fitted to the point clouds. The biomasses of tree trunks were calculated by multiplying the volume and the species wood density. The biomasses of branches and leaves were also estimated based on the estimated volume and density values. Branch and leaf volumes were estimated based on the fitted point clouds using an alpha-shape approach. The estimated individual biomass and the total above ground biomass were compared with the aboveground biomass (AGB) value estimated using existing allometric equations and individual tree census data collected in the field. The results show that the combination of a simple single-tree stem reconstruction and wood density can be used to estimate stem biomass comparable to the results usually obtained through existing allometric equations. However, there are several issues associated with the data and method used for branch and leaf biomass estimations, which need further improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aallometry 3abranches 3acarbon sinks 3acensus data 3acleaning 3adata collection 3aequations 3aforest reserves 3aleaves 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3ascanners 3astate parks 3atree trunk 3atrees 3atropical rain forests 3awood density 3aMalaysia1 aAbu Bakar, Md Afif1 aRazak, Khamarrul Azahari1 aRasib, Abd Wahid1 aKanniah, Kasturi Devi1 aWan Kadir, Wan Hazli1 aOmar, Hamdan1 aFaidi, Azahari1 aKassim, Abd Rahman1 aAbd Latif, Zulkiflee0 tForests.g2017 Mar. 17, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f80300863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003700139245009100176300001800267500002000285520151700305592002801822650002301850650001201873650001101885700003001896700002201926700002701948773013801975856007302113852000902186655001202195IND60651715320221117171228.0190712e20150428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065171532DNAL7 a10.3390/su70551822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndújar-Montoya, María Dolores12aA Construction Management Framework for Mass Customisation in Traditional Construction  ap. 5182-5210.  aJournal Article  aA Mass Customisation model is discussed as a competitive positioning strategy in the marketplace adding value to the customer’s end-use. It includes the user as part of the construction process responding to the customer’s demands and wishes. To the present day, almost all proposals for Mass Customisation have been focused on the design phase and single family houses. The reality is that the processes carried out in the work execution are so inefficient that the costs of the Mass Customisation models are assumed by the customer and they do not offer solutions that support the change management. Furthermore, this inefficiency often makes Mass Customisation unfeasible in terms of deadlines and site management. Therefore, the present proposal focuses on achieving the paradigm of Mass Customisation in the traditional residential construction complementary to the existing proposals in the design phase. All this through the proposal of a framework for the integral management in the work execution, which will address change management introduced by the users offering an efficient and productive model that reduces costs in the process. This model will focus on the synergy between different strategies, techniques and technologies currently used in the construction management (such as Lean Construction or Six Sigma), together with, other strategies and technologies that have proven to be valid solutions in other fields (such as Business Process Management, Service Oriented Architecture, etc.).  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3amarkets 3amodels1 aGilart-Iglesias, Virgilio1 aMontoyo, Andrés,1 aMarcos-Jorquera, Diego0 tSustainability.g2015 Apr. 28, v. 7, no. 5 p.5182-5210dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su70551823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003200144245012100176500002000297520135000317592002801667650001301695650002001708650001501728650001901743650002001762650001601782650002001798650001801818650001101836650003801847650001801885650000901903650001701912700003301929700003401962700002901996700003202025700002102057700002002078700003302098773010802131856007802239852000902317655001202326IND60585200820221120160403.0171105e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058520082DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2016009932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColmán‐Martínez, Mariel10atrans‐Lycopene from tomato juice attenuates inflammatory biomarkers in human plasma samples: An intervention trial  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSCOPE: The effect of carotenoids from tomato juice (TJ) on inflammatory biomarkers was evaluated by performing a 4‐week dose‐response nutritional trial in a population at high cardiovascular risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: An open, prospective, randomized, cross‐over, and controlled clinical trial was carried out with 28 volunteers (mean age 69.7 ± 3.1 years; mean BMI 31.5 ± 3.6 kg/m²) at high cardiovascular risk, which were assigned to consume daily for 4 weeks in random order: 200 mL (LD) or 400 mL (HD) of TJ, or water as a control (C), with a 21‐day wash‐out period between each intervention. Blood samples were collected at baseline (B) and after each intervention. Endpoints included significant changes in plasmatic carotenoids, and adhesion molecules ICAM‐1, and VCAM‐1, as well as a tendency to decrease the chemokine IL‐8. Compared to C, concentration of ICAM‐1, and VCAM‐1 were significantly lower (p ˂ 0.001), after each TJ intervention. Decreases were correlated remarkably with the trans‐lycopene, while the other carotenoids present in TJ have presented a minor association or no association with changes in these molecules. CONCLUSION: trans‐Lycopene from TJ may attenuate the risk of cardiovascular disease by reducing the concentration of important inflammatory molecules related to atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aatherosclerosis 3abiomarkers 3ablood sampling 3abody mass index 3acarotenoids 3aclinical trials 3adose response 3ahumans 3aintercellular adhesion molecule-1 3ainterleukin-8 3arisk 3atomato juice1 aMartínez‐Huélamo, Miriam1 aValderas‐Martínez, Palmira1 aArranz‐Martínez, Sara1 aAlmanza‐Aguilera, Enrique1 aCorella, Dolores1 aEstruch, Ramón1 aLamuela‐Raventós, Rosa M.0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2017 Nov., v. 61, no. 11dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2016009933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02106naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011600156300002000272520083600292592002801128650004401156650001501200650001601215650001401231650002101245650001101266650002201277650001701299650001101316650003301327650001001360650001601370650001901386650001601405700001901421700001701440700002001457773012401477856007401601852000901675655001201684IND60669117720221116200209.0190920e20150714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066911772DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra12266j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Pialee10aAdsorption behaviour of gluten hydrolysate on mild steel in 1 M HCl and its role as a green corrosion inhibitor  ap. 61170-61178.  aThe search for commercially available and low cost green corrosion inhibitors in combating metal corrosion has incited the investigation of the adsorption behavior and inhibition potentiality of gluten hydrolysate towards mild steel in 1 M HCl employing both electrochemical and weight loss techniques. Acting as a mixed-type inhibitor, gluten hydrolysate forms an inhibitive layer on the metal enhancing the polarization resistance. The thermodynamic and activation parameters for adsorption are explained following competitive physical and chemical adsorption models depending on concentration as well as temperature. FTIR data indicates the involvement of amide groups, as well as the side chains of amino acid residues during adsorption, while confirmatory evidence of enhanced corrosion resistance is obtained from SEM images.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aamino acids 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3agluten 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrolysates 3amodels 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asteel 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3aweight loss1 aMaji, Tarunesh1 aDey, Sukalpa1 aSukul, Dipankar0 tRSC advances.g2015 July 14, v. 5, no. 75 p.61170-61178dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra12266j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245014200164300001800306520139600324592002801720650002501748650001301773650001801786650001501804650003801819650001701857650003501874650002101909650001301930650001101943700001301954700001901967700001601986700005302002700005702055773012802112856008402240852000902324655001202333IND60631170820221118032800.0190219e20190128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063117082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b052032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Dan10aFluorescence Immunoassay Based on the Alkaline Phosphatase Triggered in Situ Fluorogenic Reaction of o-Phenylenediamine and Ascorbic Acid  ap. 2978-2984.  aInspired by the special reducing capability of ascorbic acid (AA), ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AA2P) has been extensively utilized as a substrate in current alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assays owing to the ALP-triggered transformation of AA2P into AA. However, such assays usually require AA-related complicated and laborious synthesis and/or signal generation procedures. Herein, we report an interesting in situ fluorogenic interaction between o-phenylenediamine (OPD) and AA, which inspires us to put forward a novel and simple AA2P/OPD-participated fluorescence turn-on ALP activity assay for the first time, and then the corresponding ALP-based fluorescence enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has also been developed by means of the conventional ELISA platforms. According to the convenient and facile detection process with clear response mechanism, our fluorogenic reaction-based assay exhibits good sensitivity, selectivity, and excellent sensing performance, which ensures fluorescence ELISA to potentially be applied in clinical diagnosis by employing a well-studied biomarker of hepatocellular carcinoma, α-fetoprotein (AFP) as the model analyte. Such original ELISA via in situ formation of fluorophore from scratch gives a new sight to develop other potential immunoassay platforms in early clinical diagnosis by controlling the target antigens in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantigens 3aascorbic acid 3abiomarkers 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorescence 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afluorescent dyes 3ahepatoma 3amodels1 aLi, Juan1 aPeng, Chuanyun1 aZhu, Shuyun1 aSun, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8964-62271 aYang, Xiurong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0021-51350 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Jan. 28, v. 91, no. 4 p.2978-2984dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b052033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03681naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245018800197300001400385500002000399520180400419592002802223650001502251650002102266650001502287650001202302650002002314650001602334650001502350650001502365650001302380650001102393650002002404650001702424650001902441650001202460650001402472700002402486700002402510700002002534700001902554700003002573700001802603700002202621700003202643700002202675700002002697700002002717700002302737700001802760700002102778700002002799700001702819700002502836773012402861856007302985852000903058655001203067IND60681955120221120125041.0200122e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068195512DNAL7 a10.1111/zph.126502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRacicot, Manon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5003-590110aIdentification and selection of food safety‐related risk factors to be included in the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s Establishment‐based Risk Assessment model for Hatcheries  ap. 14-24.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTowards the continuous improvement of its inspection system, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is developing an Establishment‐based Risk Assessment model for Hatcheries to allocate inspection resources based on the food safety risk associated with the Canadian hatcheries falling under its jurisdiction. The objectives of the current study were to identify and select critical food safety‐related risk factors that would be included in this model, with a main focus on Salmonella. A literature review was used to develop a comprehensive list of risk factors that could potentially contribute to the food safety risk attributed to Canadian hatcheries operating in all production streams (breeders, layers, broilers, turkeys, waterfowl and game birds). The development of this list used a selection process that was conducted according to the availability of data sources, the clarity of definition and the measurability of the selected risk factors. A panel of experts reviewed and adjusted the identified risk factors. A final list of 29 risk factors was generated; 20 originated from the scientific literature and nine from the expert panel. Risk factors were grouped in three clusters according to whether they pertained to the inherent risk (nine factors identified), risk mitigation (nine factors identified) or compliance of a hatchery with its preventive control plan and regulatory requirements (11 factors identified). Criteria for assessing each risk factor were defined based on common practices used in the Canadian hatchery industry. This comprehensive list of risk factors and criteria represents useful information to support the design and implementation of a Canadian risk assessment model for hatcheries, but could also be used by like‐minded food safety authorities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3abroiler chickens 3acompliance 3aexperts 3afood inspection 3afood safety 3agame birds 3ahatcheries 3aindustry 3amodels 3arisk assessment 3arisk factors 3arisk reduction 3aturkeys 3awaterfowl1 aComeau, Geneviève,1 aTremblay, Alexandre1 aQuessy, Sylvain1 aCereno, Teresa1 aCharron‐Langlois, Maude1 aVenne, Daniel1 aHébert, Ghislain1 aVaillancourt, Jean‐Pierre1 aFravalo, Philippe1 aOuckama, Rachel1 aMitevski, Darko1 aGuerin, Michele T.1 aAgunos, Agnes1 aDeWinter, Leanne1 aCatford, Angela1 aMackay, Anna1 aGaucher, Marie‐Lou0 tZoonoses and public health.g2020 Feb., v. 67, no. 1 p.14-24dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58703x1863-19597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zph.126503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011400168300001800282520151000300592002801810650004401838650002201882650002201904650003701926650002701963650002301990650001102013650001302024650001802037650001302055650001902068650002202087650001702109650003302126650002002159650002302179650002102202650001102223650003702234653002402271653001602295653001202311653002102323653001802344700001702362700001802379700005702397700005702454773014402511856008502655852000902740655001202749IND60693086220221120181541.0200504e20200408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069308622DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c003402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOu, Xianfeng10aSuperamphiphobic Surfaces with Self-Cleaning and Antifouling Properties by Functionalized Chitin Nanocrystals  ap. 6690-6699.  aSuperamphiphobic coating has significant applications in self-cleaning and antifouling materials. Herein, chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs) with a needlelike morphology as building blocks were modified by thiol groups and highly fluorinated long chains to reduce the surface free energy. For the prepared superamphiphobic ChNC particles, a series of morphological and physicochemical characterizations, such as transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, were performed. The superamphiphobic ChNC particles feature high contact angles and low sliding angles for various liquids, including n-decane with a low surface tension (23.3 mN/m). Different liquid droplets can retain a perfectly quasispherical shape on the coating surface. Most interestingly, liquid marbles wrapped up by this superamphiphobic powder can “stand” on various substrates without any collapse. The coating shows a good repellency for liquids after the mechanical damage tests and thermal treatments. In addition, the superamphiphobic ChNC particles could be applied onto various substrates, exhibiting a good resistance and substrate-independent performance. In sum, the fluorinated ChNC coatings with superior superamphiphobicity, substrate independence, and stable mechanical and thermal properties show promising applications of water/oil-proof, self-cleaning, and antifouling coatings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGibbs free energy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantifouling activities 3aantifouling agents 3achitin 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3adroplets 3aheat treatment 3amechanical damage 3ananocrystals 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface tension 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3athiols 3atransmission electron microscopy 0achitin nanocrystals 0afluorinated 0acoating 0asuperamphiphobic 0aself-cleaning1 aCai, Jiabing1 aTian, Jinhuan1 aLuo, Binghong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8689-41961 aLiu, Mingxian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5466-30240 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Apr. 08, v. 8, no. 17 p.6690-6699dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c003403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012500167300001800292520173800310592002802048650001502076650002502091650001602116650001602132650002502148650001302173650001202186650001802198650002002216650001802236650004302254650001902297650002102316650001502337650002202352650001202374700001602386700001402402700001402416700005402430700005802484700005702542773012802599856008402727852000902811655001202820IND60631170920221118032811.0190219e20190123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063117092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b052152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Luwei10aFacile Fabrication of Biomimetic Chitosan Membrane with Honeycomb-Like Structure for Enrichment of Glycosylated Peptides  ap. 2985-2993.  aIn the study of glycoproteomics with mass spectrometry, certain pretreatments of samples are required for eliminating the interference of nonglycopeptides and improving the efficiency of glycopeptides detection. Although hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) has been developed for enrichment of glycosylated peptides, a plethora of hydrophilic materials always suffered from large steric hindrance, great cost, and difficulty with modifications of high-density hydrophilic groups. In this work, a 1 mm thick biomimetic honeycomb chitosan membrane (BHCM) with honeycomb-like accessible macropores was directly prepared by the freeze-casting method as an adsorbent for HILIC. The N-glycopeptides from trypsin digests of immunoglobulin G (IgG), mixture of IgG and bovine serum albumin (BSA), and serum proteins were enriched using this material and compared with a commercial material ZIC-HILIC. The biomimetic membrane could identify as many as 32 N-glycopeptides from the IgG digest, exhibiting high sensitivity (about 50 fmol) and a wide scope for glycopeptide enrichment. A molar ratio of IgG trypsin digest to bovine serum albumin trypsin digest as low as 1/500 verified the outstanding specificity and efficiency for glycopeptide enrichment. In addition, 270 unique N-glycosylation sites of 400 unique glycopeptides from 146 glycosylated proteins were identified from the triplicate analysis of 2 μL human serum. Furthermore, 48 unique O-glycosylation sites of 278 unique O-glycopeptides were identified from the triplicate analysis of 30 μg deglycosylated fetuin digest. These results indicated that the chitosan-based membrane prepared in this work had great potential for pretreatment of samples in glycoproteomics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aartificial membranes 3abiomimetics 3ablood serum 3abovine serum albumin 3achitosan 3afetuins 3aglycopeptides 3aglycoproteomics 3aglycosylation 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amacropores 3amass spectrometry 3atrypsin1 aMa, Shujuan1 aChen, Yao1 aWang, Yan1 aOu, Junjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1672-61191 aUyama, Hiroshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8587-25071 aYe, Mingliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5872-93260 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Jan. 23, v. 91, no. 4 p.2985-2993dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b052153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04072naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245015500191300001400346500001500360520161300375592002801988650001702016650001302033650001402046650001702060650002802077650001602105650001402121650001602135650000902151650001402160650002002174650001702194650001402211650001302225650002102238650001202259650001402271650002602285650002602311650002602337650002502363650001102388650003602399650003602435650003202471650002702503650002602530650004102556650001702597650003602614650004502650650004002695653001702735653001602752653001302768653001502781653002202796653001502818653001402833653001202847700002202859700001802881700001702899700002102916700001702937700002802954700002402982700001903006773013503025856008503160852000903245655001203254IND50064484420221117213421.0190318e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006448442DNAL7 a235105592pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemeyere, Kristel10aEscherichia coli induces bovine neutrophil cell death independent from caspase-3/-7/-1, but with phosphatidylserine exposure prior to membrane rupture  ap. 45-56.  a2019-12-06  aNeutrophils are essential for the innate immune response against bacterial pathogens and play a key role during the early phases of infection, including mastitis and endometritis in cows. When directly challenged with bacteria, neutrophils undergo phagocytosis induced cell death (PICD). The molecular mechanisms of this cell death modality are poorly understood, especially for bovine neutrophils. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the mechanisms and hallmarks of PICD in bovine neutrophils after in vitro challenge with Escherichia coli (E. coli). Our data show that various apoptotic hallmarks such as blebbing, chromatin condensation and executioner caspase (C)-3/-7 activity are only observed during constitutive bovine neutrophil apoptosis. In contrast, bovine neutrophil PICD is characterized by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), pro-inflammatory C-1 activation, nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation, and interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 secretion. Nevertheless, under both conditions these phagocytes undergo cell death with the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS). Although PS exposure is generally attributed to the anti-inflammatory features of executioner caspase-dependent apoptosis, it surprisingly preceded plasma membrane rupture during bovine neutrophil PICD. Moreover, C-1 inhibition strongly affected IL-1β production but not the PICD kinetics. This indicates that the secretion of the latter pro-inflammatory cytokine is a bystander effect rather than a regulator of PICD in bovine neutrophils, in marked contrast to the IL-1β-dependent pyroptosis reported for macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendometritis 3amastitis 3asecretion 3ainterleukins 3areactive oxygen species 3amacrophages 3apathogens 3aneutrophils 3acows 3achromatin 3aplasma membrane 3aphagocytosis 3aapoptosis 3abacteria 3aEscherichia coli 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aCaspase 1xphysiology 2aCaspase 3xphysiology 2aCaspase 7xphysiology 2aCaspasesxphysiology 2aCattle 2aEscherichia colixpathogenicity 2aInterleukin-1betaxbiosynthesis 2aInterleukin-6xbiosynthesis 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aNeutrophil Activation 2aNeutrophilsximmunologyxphysiology. 2aPhagocytosis 2aPhosphatidylserinesxphysiology 2aPoly(ADP-ribose) Polymerasesxmetabolism 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 0aPhagocytosis 0aNecroptosis 0aimmunity 0aPyroptosis 0aBovine neutrophil 0aCell death 0aApoptosis 0aNETosis1 aRemijsen, Quinten1 aDemon, Dieter1 aBreyne, Koen1 aNotebaert, Sofie1 aBoyen, Filip1 aGuérin, Christopher J.1 aVandenabeele, Peter1 aMeyer, Evelyne0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2013 May 15, v. 153, no. 1-2 p.45-56dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245013300179520143900312592002801751650001801779650001501797650001201812650002201824650001101846650001501857650002001872650000901892650001101901650001401912650001401926650002001940650001401960650001301974650001501987650001502002650001302017650001402030650001502044650002402059650000902083651000902092653002002101653002802121653001302149653002202162653003002184700002802214700003002242700003302272700002102305773012402326856008502450852000902535655001202544IND60686872620221119234732.0200712e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068687262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2020.1053522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPourmohammadali, Behrooz10aStudying the relationships between nutrients in pistachio leaves and its yield using hybrid GA-ANN model-based feature selection  aSustainable and reliable management requires special attention to factors affecting crop yield. In the present study, a hybrid model of genetic algorithm and artificial neural network (GA-ANN) was employed to recognize the importance of nutrients in pistachio yield. One hundred seventy-five points in different pistachio orchards of Rafsanjan and Anar regions, Kerman province, the southeast of Iran, were identified and selected for leaf sampling and yield measurement. The concentration of phosphorus (P), potassium (K), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) was determined. The hybrid GA-ANN model was implemented in MATLAB software, after statistical analysis and multivariate regression modeling. The results showed that the correlation and linear multiple regression analysis could not justify the variations of pistachio yield in relation to leaves' nutrients concentration. The lowest error of the hybrid GA-ANN model was observed by five features including concentrations of K, Mg, Fe, Zn and Cu. Sensitivity analysis of ANN indicated that the highest relative importance for predicting pistachio yield was related to Cu (34.6%), K (28.2%) and Fe (26.1%). The GA-ANN model was able to solve complex and multi-dimensional problems. The accurate and careful interpretation of the results, obtained from this approach can provide a good insight for optimum farm management planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPistacia vera 3aalgorithms 3acalcium 3acomputer software 3acopper 3acrop yield 3afarm management 3airon 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aneural networks 3anutrients 3aorchards 3aphosphorus 3apistachios 3aplanning 3apotassium 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3azinc 3aIran 0aPlant nutrition 0aOptimum farm management 0aModeling 0aGenetic algorithm 0aArtificial neural network1 aSalehi, Mohammad Hassan1 aHosseinifard, Seyed Javad1 aEsfandiarpour Boroujeni, Isa1 aShirani, Hossein0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2020 May, v. 172 p.105352-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2020.1053523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04299naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014800172300001800320520166700338592002802005650003402033650002402067650002202091650002602113650001702139650002502156650001702181650001102198650001402209650001702223650002102240650002502261650002302286650002002309650001702329650001902346650001802365650001702383650001402400650001002414650002802424650003202452650002602484650003502510650001402545650001102559650002002570650002202590650001302612650001702625650001602642653002002658653002202678653001602700653003002716653003202746653002002778653002102798653001702819700002702836700002602863700002102889700002302910700001602933700005702949700002303006700006103029700002703090700005903117700006603176773014403242856008603386852000903472655001203481IND60693086320210220000000.0210220e20200413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069308632DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c003562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoccia, Federica10aPecan (Carya illinoinensis (Wagenh.) K.

Chemical degradation of PNSE demonstrated the presence of condensed tannins as the main phenolic components. PNSE showed remarkable antioxidant properties in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay (EC₅₀ = 0.004 mg/mL). PNSE was initially tested as an inhibitor of mushroom tyrosinase, exhibiting a quite low IC₅₀ value (0.055 mg/mL) against the enzyme diphenolase activity, suggesting its use in enzymatic browning inhibition. The anthocyanin stabilization properties were evaluated under accelerated aging conditions of both pure pigments and commercial fruit juices, and PNSE was found to be effective at concentrations (0.05 mg/mL) at which well-known stabilizers such as chlorogenic and ferulic acids proved to fail. PNSE also performed well in the stabilization of spray-dried anthocyanins for use as a food colorant, increasing the half-life of blackberry anthocyanins up to 20%. In order to explore the possibility of using PNSE as a functional additive for active packaging, polylactic acid (PLA) films containing PNSE were prepared by solvent casting, and no substantial alteration of the mechanical properties was found on addition of the extract up to 10% w/w. The films showed remarkable antioxidant properties (DDPH reduction >60% with a 3% w/w loading, at a dose of 1 mg/mL in the DPPH solution) and delayed the onset of browning of apple smoothies (ca. 30% inhibition with a 10% w/w loading). These results highlight the exploitation of PNS as a low-cost polyphenol source for food industry applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aCarya illinoinensis 3aaccelerated aging 3aactive food packaging 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapples 3abeverages 3ablackberries 3acatechol oxidase 3achemical degradation 3aenzymatic browning 3aenzyme activity 3aferulic acid 3afood colorants 3afood industry 3afruit juices 3ahalf life 3ahulls 3aindustrial applications 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amechanical properties 3amedian effective concentration 3amushrooms 3apecans 3apolylactic acid 3aproanthocyanidins 3asolvents 3aspray drying 3astabilizers 0aPecan nut shell 0aCondensed tannins 0aAntioxidant 0aFruit browning inhibition 0aFood colorant stabilization 0aPolylactic acid 0aActive packaging 0aAnthocyanins1 aAgustin-Salazar, Sarai1 aBjörling, Anna-Lisa,1 aSetaro, Brunella1 aMicillo, Raffaella1 aPizzo, Elio1 aWeber, Fabian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0830-64611 aGamez-Meza, Nohemi1 aSchieber, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1082-95471 aCerruti, Pierfrancesco1 aPanzella, Lucia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2662-82051 aNapolitano, Alessandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0507-53700 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Apr. 13, v. 8, no. 17 p.6700-6712dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c003563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01441naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010500159300001800264520047400282592002800756650001100784650001400795650002300809650001100832700001700843700001900860700001600879700001600895773013300911856007401044852000901118655001201127IND60639053120221120113324.0190501e20170207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063905312DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc09378g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Peng-Fei10aNovel P2-type Na₂/₃Ni₁/₆Mg₁/₆Ti₂/₃O₂ as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries  ap. 1957-1960.  aA novel P2-type Na₂/₃Ni₁/₆Mg₁/₆Ti₂/₃O₂ material is explored as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) for the first time.

Here we tested if riparian deforestation of tropical streams influenced beta diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages, by comparing indices that weighted differentially rare and dominant taxa, and testing if nestedness in community composition increased in deforested streams. Within-stream beta diversity was higher in deforested than forested streams, mainly due to taxon loss and higher dominance. In disturbed streams, higher sedimentation in pool mesohabitats resulted in larger differences in community composition, whereas mesohabitats in forested streams were more stable.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3adeforestation 3amacroinvertebrates 3amicrohabitats 3anestedness 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 0amesohabitats 0asedimentation 0anestedness 0aturnover 0abiomonitoring1 aTanaka, Marcel Okamoto0 tStudies on neotropical fauna and environment.g2016 Sept. 1, v. 51, no. 3 p.206-214dTaylor & Francisx1744-51407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650521.2016.12378013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011500174500001900289520188100308592002802189650002602217650000902243650001502252650001602267650001502283650001902298650002002317650001402337650002002351650000902371650001302380651001102393651002202404653001602426653001102442653001302453653001302466653001602479653002202495700001702517700002002534700002502554700002202579773011902601856008802720852000902808655001202817IND60713239620221119160646.0210423e20210410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071323962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1428432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalantzi, Ioanna10aFish farming, metals and antibiotics in the eastern Mediterranean Sea: Is there a threat to sediment wildlife?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChemical residues released from aquaculture farms may persist in the environment and may pose adverse ecological effects. The aim of this study was to assess the pollution status of marine sediments underneath or close to aquaculture farms in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, the factors that affect the elemental distribution, and the exceedance of environmental quality standards and factors. To this end, surface sediment samples were collected (underneath fish cages, at 25 m distance and from a reference station) from 48 fish farms in Greece with variable environmental and geochemical characteristics. The content of 29 metals and major and trace elements, and three antibiotics (oxytetracycline, florfenicol, and flumequine), was determined in the sediment samples. Most of the elements found in the sediments originated from geological sources and their concentrations were close to Earth's Crust content. Below and close to fish farm cages, the sediment was enriched with P, Cu, Zn, Mo, and Cd mainly due to the aquaculture biosolid deposition, and changes in environmental conditions (increased organic matter, low redox potential). Cr and As were found to exceed twice the upper threshold limit of the available sediment quality guidelines in 13.5% and 7.3% of sampling stations, respectively. The potential ecological risk of V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As and Pb was found to be low in the sediment close to fish cages except for Cd, which may pose a moderate to considerable risk in 12.5% of sampled fish farms. However, the estimated risks for this metal may be influenced by the high background levels found in the investigated areas. This study also shows that the occurrence of antibiotics in sediments below fish farms in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea is very sparse (i.e., only flumequine was found in two farms) and concentration levels are relatively low.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental quality 3afish 3afish farms 3aflorfenicol 3aflumequine 3aorganic matter 3aoxytetracycline 3apollution 3aredox potential 3arisk 3awildlife 3aGreece 3aMediterranean Sea 0aAntibiotics 0aMetals 0aElements 0aSediment 0aAquaculture 0aSediment toxicity1 aRico, Andreu1 aMylona, Kyriaki1 aPergantis, Spiros A.1 aTsapakis, Manolis0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Apr. 10, v. 764 p.142843-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1428433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245010900167300001800276520165400294592002801948650000801976650000801984650001201992650001702004650001502021650001902036650001602055650002002071650001102091650001202102650000902114650000902123650001202132650002902144650001702173700002402190700002002214700001902234700003102253700002102284773009402305856007702399852000902476655001202485IND60438753920221120183544.0151023e199911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043875392DNAL7 a10.1007/s0033599011632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouchard, Guylaine 10aHigh-resolution maps of the murine Chromosome 2 region containing the cholesterol gallstone locus, Lith1  ap. 1070-1074.  aThe Lith1 region on Chromosome (Chr) 2 contains a gene that markedly affects the prevalence of cholesterol gallstones in inbred mice. We report the high-resolution genetic and radiation hybrid maps of the chromosomal region surrounding Lith1, using three resources: a DNA panel from 188 progeny from two reciprocal backcrosses between C57BL/6 and Mus spretus inbred strains; 423 progeny of an N4 generation from backcrossing the susceptible C57L/J alleles at Lith1 into the resistant AKR/J strain; and the newly developed hamster–mouse T31 radiation hybrid panel. We mapped 17 microsatellite markers in the D2Mit182 to D2Mit14 region and two candidate genes for Lith1, the canalicular bile salt export pump (Bsep) also known as sister of P-glycoprotein (Spgp) and the low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related gene megalin (Gp330). Both genetic maps were in agreement and ordered the microsatellite markers into a 10.4 ± 1.5 cM region. The high-resolution physical map revealed ordering of microsatellite markers and relative distances between markers in almost complete agreement with the genetic maps. Mapping of Bsep revealed its location on Chr 2, homologous to the human chromosomal position (Nature Genet 20, 233–238, 1998). The radiation hybrid results also provided the highest resolution of the area containing the two candidate genes, which both mapped in the Lith1 region with close linkage, being separated by a distance of only 15 cR₃₀₀₀. The total radiation hybrid map length of the region between D2Mit182 and D2Mit14 was 326 cR₃₀₀₀, suggesting that 31 cR₃₀₀₀ is equivalent to 1 cM in this region of Chr 2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMus 3aalleles 3abackcrossing 3abile salts 3acholelithiasis 3acholesterol 3agenetic markers 3ahumans 3ahybrids 3aloci 3amice 3aprogeny 3aradiation hybrid mapping 3atransporters1 aNelson, Heather M. 1 aLammert, Frank 1 aRowe, Lucy B. 1 aCarey, M.

Comprehensively analyzing TGs is helpful to understand the TGs functions in these diseases. However, due to the existence of a large number of isomers TGs and the lack of commercial standards, precise analysis of individual triacylglycerol (TG) with specific fatty acid chain composition is full of challenge. In this work, ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) were employed for comprehensive qualification and quantification of TGs with specific fatty acid chain composition in horse adipose tissue, human plasma and liver tissues including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and para-carcinoma tissues. Multiple MS detection modes from QTRAP MS and FT-ICR MS were utilized, and hundreds of TG species (including many oxidized TG species) with their specific fatty acid chain compositions have been qualified and quantified. The isomer TGs interference, the isobaric interference, and oxidized TG species interference were firstly indicated. Several isomer TGs, for example, 18:1/20:1/18:2 TG and 20:3/18:1/18:0 TG, which were all 56:4 TG, demonstrated different trends in HCC tissue compared with para-carcinoma tissue, which showed the importance of analysis of TG with specific fatty acid chain composition. In addition, 10 TGs with the degree of unsaturation beyond three were significantly decreased, while 16:0/17:0/18:0 TG, no double bond, was significantly increased in the HCC tissue, which firstly revealed aberrant specific TG metabolism in HCC. This is a systematic report about comprehensive analysis of TGs by UPLC-ESI-MS, which is of significance for accurate analysis of these lipids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3acardiovascular diseases 3afatty acids 3ahepatoma 3ahorses 3ahumans 3aionization 3aisomers 3aliver 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3atriacylglycerols 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aUPLC-ESI-MS 0aIsomer TGs 0aIsobaric interference 0aOxidized TGs 0aHCC1 aDai, Dongsheng1 aLi, Lin1 aWei, Jinchao1 aYang, Hui1 aLi, Shilei1 aZhang, Yangyang1 aLin, Yu1 aXiong, Shaoxiang1 aZhao, Zhenwen0 tTalanta.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 172 p.206-214dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2017.05.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03988naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245015500176300001600331520240600347592002802753650002102781650002402802650001402826650001702840650001702857650001702874650001702891650001202908650001002920650001102930650001702941650001102958650001302969650001502982650002002997650001303017650001303030650001903043650002003062650002203082650001903104650002803123650002403151650002303175651001103198700002803209700002803237773008703265856008503352852000903437655001203446IND60084482220221122195309.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008448222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlorin, Madeleine J.10aSelecting the sharpest tools to explore the food-feed-fuel debate: Sustainability assessment of family farmers producing food, feed and fuel in Brazil  ap. 108-120.  aContinuing interest in sustainable biofuel production is linked with sustainable farming and begs for insights from farming systems research on sustainability assessment and the role of family farms. The aims of this work were two-fold. First, to present a tools and methods selection framework supporting indicator-based sustainability assessment. Second, to apply the framework to the case of castor beans (Ricinus communis L.), family farmers and the biodiesel industry in the southeast of Brazil. The framework synthesizes existing work on sustainability assessment within the agricultural domain. Transparent selection of tools and methods is supported by sequentially accounting for the context of sustainability, dealing with space, classifying the ‘nature of research’ and the degree of integration of different facets of sustainability. The framework is demonstrated with an exploratory assessment of the potential for castor bean cultivation within the current farm type of extensive pasture and fodder crops for dairy cattle. The study accounted for the range of productivity levels within the current farm type and for different management decisions when including castor beans. Assessment was made against economic development, livelihood stability and soil fertility criteria. Selected tools and methods included farm surveys, alternative farming system design and input–output calculations. The results demonstrate the greatest opportunity for castor bean cultivation by currently low productive farms. There is a trade-off of income derived from milk production that is supported by fodder production, and income from castor beans. Decisions regarding areal extent of castor beans and supplementing animal feed, are shown to be farm-specific, and depend upon the interactions between current farm productivity and prioritisation of sustainability criteria. However, generally it is shown that castor bean cultivation should be linked to animal production so that current risk management and income levels can be supported and improved. Further, to maintain soil fertility, castor bean cultivation with nitrogen inputs is necessary. The cyclic nature of the framework supports the next contextualisation of the sustainability question. For our application, constructive future work in a next cycle could include extending to regional level and accounting for temporal variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRicinus communis 3aalternative farming 3abiodiesel 3acastor beans 3adairy cattle 3afamily farms 3afarm surveys 3afarmers 3afeeds 3aforage 3aforage crops 3aincome 3aindustry 3alivelihood 3amilk production 3anitrogen 3apastures 3aprioritization 3arisk management 3aselection methods 3asoil fertility 3asustainable agriculture 3asystems engineering 3atemporal variation 3aBrazil1 avan Ittersum, Martin K.1 avan de Ven, Gerrie W.J.0 tEcological indicators.g2012 Sept., v. 20 p.108-120dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01729naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002600180245010300206300001800309506007600327520052500403592002800928506003700956650001600993650002501009650002301034650002301057650002201080650001101102650001701113650001501130700002101145773010501166856007501271852000901346655001201355IND60578653520221207112615.0170813e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057865352DNAL7 a10.1021/ol400054m2doi7 aPMC36857222pmcid7 a234101112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTopczewski, Joseph J.10aKinetic Assessment of N-Methyl-2-methoxypyridinium Species as Phosphonate Anion Methylating Agents  ap. 1084-1087.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOrganophosphate nerve agents and pesticides are potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE).

New geomorphological mapping and maximum-limiting radiocarbon ages indicate that the northwest LIS inundated western Banks Island after ~31¹⁴CkaBP and reached a terminal ice margin west of the present coastline. The onset of deglaciation and the age of the marine limit (22–40m asl) are unresolved. Ice sheet retreat across western Banks Island was characterized by the withdrawal of a thin, cold-based ice margin that reached the central interior of the island by ~14calkaBP. The elevation of the marine limit is greater than previously recognized and consistent with greater glacioisostatic crustal unloading by a more expansive LIS. These results complement emerging bathymetric observations from the Arctic Ocean, which indicate glacial erosion during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to depths of up to 450m.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aglaciation 3aice 3asea level 3aArctic region1 aEngland, John H.0 tQuaternary research.g2013 July, v. 80, no. 1 p.99-112dElsevier Inc.x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2013.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245007800167300001400245520221100259592002802470650001502498650002002513650001602533650000902549650001302558650001502571650001802586650001302604650001702617650001902634651002002653653001602673653001302689653001202702653001702714653001202731653001602743700001902759773013002778856008402908852000902992655001203001IND60539629220221119222306.0190318e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053962922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2014.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChapman, M.G.10aSea urchins provide habitat for rare chitons in intertidal boulder-fields  ap. 31-37.  aSea urchins provide habitat for many other invertebrates and fish which live in association with the spines or tests of the urchins. In boulder-fields in New South Wales, Australia, there is a large suite of chitons of the genus Ischnochiton, most of which show very overdispersed patterns of abundance among boulders, with many individuals aggregated onto few boulders. Most species are too sparse to manipulate experimentally to test hypotheses about their strong patterns of association with particular boulders, but the most common species, Ischnochiton australis, is strongly associated with the urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma, at two spatial scales. The two species occurred together on boulders more than expected by chance and, on boulders occupied by both species, abundances were positively correlated. In addition, I. australis were predominantly found under the spines and tests of the urchins. These patterns were general in time and space. Despite the relative rarity of the chiton, experiments were done to test hypotheses about the presence of each species influencing dispersal among boulders of the other species. Sample size was necessarily small because the chitons are not widespread among the boulders and not all experimental treatments and procedural controls could be included due to limited habitat containing chitons and urchins. Nevertheless, replicate small experiments showed that chitons decreased in abundance under boulders from which urchins had been removed, more than under boulders with chitons, although not all tests were significant. Urchins, in contrast, showed no effects of removal of chitons. Thus, it is likely that urchins provide habitat for chitons, rather than the reverse. Therefore, removal of urchins from these habitats by harvesting could have large negative effects on abundances of this relatively rare intertidal chiton, which appears to be a habitat-specialist. These experiments should offer insight into responses to habitat-needs for other rare molluscs and provide guidance on the value of experimental tests of habitat-specificity for rare species, even when rarity itself reduces the scope of the experimental treatments that can be used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinoidea 3aadverse effects 3acorrelation 3afish 3ahabitats 3aharvesting 3alittoral zone 3amolluscs 3arare species 3aspace and time 3aNew South Wales 0aAssociation 0aBoulders 0aChitons 0aExperimental 0aHabitat 0aSea urchins1 aSmoothey, A.F.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2014 Oct., v. 459 p.31-37dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2014.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245005300168300001600221520087200237592002801109650002101137650002301158650001201181650001701193650001201210650002201222650001301244650001901257653003501276653002201311653001401333653001701347653001401364653002101378700001801399773011401417856008401531852000901615655001201624IND60125824120221118044546.0150428e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012582412DNAL7 a10.1080/21606544.2014.9808522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Daowei10aValue and valuation of forest ecosystem services  ap. 129-140.  aIn this paper, we first present a total forest economic value framework from an anthropocentric instrumental value perspective and differentiate gross value, economic value, market value, and valuation of forest ecosystem services. We then argue that some of the demand-side-based non-market valuation approaches only provide an estimate of gross value, not economic value. Thus, strictly speaking, they are not market valuation per se as the supply side is ignored, and as many non-marketable and non-extractive forest ecosystem services are concerned, it is often the supply side – the opportunity costs of resources used to produce them that determine the economic values of these services. Finally, we identify the role of economic valuation of forest ecosystem services in the political market that often allocates resources directly to produce these services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological value 3aecosystem services 3aforests 3amarket value 3amarkets 3aopportunity costs 3apolitics 3asupply balance 0atotal economic value framework 0aforest ecosystems 0avaluation 0amarket value 0ause value 0apolitical market1 aStenger, Anne0 tJournal of Environmental Economics and Policy.g2015 May 4, v. 4, no. 2 p.129-140dRoutledgex2160-65527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21606544.2014.9808523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011600162300001800278500001900296520199900315592002802314650001502342650001802357650001402375650001302389650002102402650001002423650001502433650002102448650001202469650001202481650001302493650000902506650001202515700001902527700002202546700002102568700002002589700002302609700002302632773013402655856007402789852000902863655001202872IND60727998020221119211352.0210216e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072799802DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cs00886a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzunerits, Sabine14aThe impact of chemical engineering and technological advances on managing diabetes: present and future concepts  ap. 2102-2146.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMonitoring blood glucose levels for diabetic patients is critical to achieve tight glycaemic control. As none of the current antidiabetic treatments restore lost functional β-cell mass in diabetic patients, insulin injections and the use of insulin pumps are most widely used in the management of glycaemia. The use of advanced and intelligent chemical engineering, together with the incorporation of micro- and nanotechnological-based processes have lately revolutionized diabetic management. The start of this concept goes back to 1974 with the description of an electrode that repeatedly measures the level of blood glucose and triggers insulin release from an infusion pump to enter the blood stream from a small reservoir upon need. Next to the insulin pumps, other drug delivery routes, including nasal, transdermal and buccal, are currently investigated. These processes necessitate competences from chemists, engineers-alike and innovative views of pharmacologists and diabetologists. Engineered micro and nanostructures hold a unique potential when it comes to drug delivery applications required for the treatment of diabetic patients. As the technical aspects of chemistry, biology and informatics on medicine are expanding fast, time has come to step back and to evaluate the impact of technology-driven chemistry on diabetics and how the bridges from research laboratories to market products are established. In this review, the large variety of therapeutic approaches proposed in the last five years for diabetic patients are discussed in an applied context. A survey of the state of the art of closed-loop insulin delivery strategies in response to blood glucose level fluctuation is provided together with insights into the emerging key technologies for diagnosis and drug development. Chemical engineering strategies centered on preserving and regenerating functional pancreatic β-cell mass are evoked in addition as they represent a permanent solution for diabetic patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood flow 3ablood glucose 3achemistry 3adiabetes 3adrug development 3adrugs 3aelectrodes 3aglycemic control 3ainsulin 3amarkets 3amedicine 3anose 3asurveys1 aMelinte, Sorin1 aBarras, Alexandre1 aPagneux, Quentin1 aMatasova, Anna,1 aAbderrahmani, Amar1 aBoukherroub, Rabah0 tChemical Society reviews.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 50, no. 3 p.2102-2146dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cs00886a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01467naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005300171300001600224520053200240592002800772650001800800650001300818653000800831653000800839653000800847653002700855653001600882700001800898700003300916773009800949856008501047852000901132655001201141IND60609988820221123033856.0180824e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060998882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2017.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnchugina, Nina10aHyperbolic discounting of the far-distant future  ap. 140-143.  aWe prove an analogue of Weitzman’s (1998) famous result that an exponential discounter who is uncertain of the appropriate exponential discount rate should discount the far-distant future using the lowest (i.e., most patient) of the possible discount rates.

The gene appears equivalent to that for membrane glycoprotein MG160 encoded in the human by the locus for Golgi apparatus protein 1 (GLG1). ESL-1 is also highly homologous to the chicken cysteine-rich fibroblast growth factor receptor (CFR). We describe the genomic structure and chromosomal localization of the Selel locus. The gene is encoded by 27 exons and extends over approximately 75 kb. It maps to murine Chromosome (Chr) 8 in a region homologous to human Chr 16q where the GLG1 locus maps, further indicating that Selel and GLG1 are mouse and human equivalents of the same gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickens 3aloci 3ahumans 3amembrane glycoproteins 3amice 3afibroblast growth factor receptors 3achromosome mapping 3aexons 3aglycoproteins 3aGolgi apparatus 0agenes1 aBeaudet, Arthur L. 0 tMammalian genome.g1999 Nov., v. 10, no. 11 p.1085-1088dSpringer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0033599011663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245014400165300001600309500002000325520178400345592002802129596006402157650002502221650002002246650002102266650002602287650002902313650001302342650001402355650001802369650001002387650002102397700002302418700002602441700002102467700005702488773010602545856007502651852000902726655001202735IND60787216420221118143812.0220808e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078721642DNAL7 a10.1002/lipd.122992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalinger, Rebecca S.10aProduction of C6–C14 Medium‐Chain Fatty Acids in Seeds and Leaves via Overexpression of Single Hotdog‐Fold Acyl‐Lipid Thioesterases  ap. 327-344.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aACYL‐LIPID THIOESTERASES (ALT) are a type of plant acyl–acyl carrier protein thioesterase that generate a wide range of medium‐chain fatty acids and methylketone (MK) precursors when expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli. While this makes ALT‐type thioesterases attractive as metabolic engineering targets to increase production of high‐value medium‐chain fatty acids and MKs in plant systems, the behavior of ALT enzymes in planta was not well understood before this study. To profile the substrate specificities of ALT‐type thioesterases in different plant tissue types, AtALT1‐4 from Arabidopsis thaliana, which have widely varied chain length and oxidation state preferences in E. coli, were overexpressed in Arabidopsis seeds, Camelina sativa seeds, and Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Seed‐specific overexpression of ALT enzymes led to medium‐chain fatty acid accumulation in Arabidopsis and Camelina seed triacylglycerols, and transient overexpression in N. benthamiana demonstrated that the substrate preferences of ALT‐type thioesterases in planta generally agree with those previously determined in E. coli. AtALT1 and AtALT4 overexpression in leaves and seeds resulted in the accumulation of 12–14 carbon‐length fatty acids and 6–8 carbon‐length fatty acids, respectively. While it was difficult to completely profile the products of ALT‐type thioesterases that generate MK precursors (i.e. β‐keto fatty acids), our results nonetheless demonstrate that ALT enzymes are catalytically diverse in planta. The knowledge gained from this study is a significant step towards being able to use ALT‐type thioesterases as metabolic engineering tools to modify the fatty acid profiles of oilseed crops, other plants, and microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCamelina sativa 3aEscherichia coli 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3amedium chain fatty acids 3aoilseeds 3aoxidation 3aplant tissues 3aseeds 3atriacylglycerols1 aWilliams, Danielle1 aAhmadi Pirshahid, Ali1 aPulsifer, Ian P.1 aRowland, Owen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2752-25840 tLipids.g2021 May, v. 56, no. 3 p.327-344dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl46279x0024-42017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lipd.122993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245018400152300001800336520125200354592002801606650003501634650001701669650001801686650002101704650001101725650001301736650001501749650001401764650002201778700001301800700001801813700001601831773012801847856007401975852000902049655001202058IND60631572520221120143355.0190311e20190228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063157252DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ay02755b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ke10aRapid classification of plastics by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) coupled with partial least squares discrimination analysis based on variable importance (VI-PLS-DA)  ap. 1174-1179.  aWith the extensive use of plastic products, the recycling and reuse of plastics raise more concerns. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and chemometric methods have been applied to classify plastics. However, the methods are prone to fall into over-fitting when predicting unknown samples. Variable importance is the impact of input variables to classification results. Selecting input variables by variable importance can be used to avoid over-fitting, which has been used for improving model performance based on random forest (RF). However, the progress of optimizing the parameters of RF model is complex. Partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA), most widely used in spectral data, is a simple and stable method in multivariate analysis. To avoid over-fitting phenomenon and acquire stable results, this paper presents an extension of PLS-DA that uses variable importance to select input variables, namely VI-PLS-DA. In order to validate the classification ability of VI-PLS-DA for plastics, VI-PLS-DA was compared with PLS-DA, RF, and VI-RF. VI-PLS-DA has the highest classification accuracy (99.55%) and shortest classification time (0.096 ms), which indicated a good classification performance for plastics analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3achemometrics 3aleast squares 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aplastics 3aprediction 3arecycling 3aspectral analysis1 aTian, Di1 aWang, Hongxia1 aYang, Guang0 tAnalytical methods.g2019 Feb. 28, v. 11, no. 9 p.1174-1179dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ay02755b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002400169245009100193300001600284520112600300592002801426653002701454653002101481653000801502653002201510653002601532653001201558700002101570700002601591700002301617773010901640856011701749852000901866655001201875IND60127301120221120234352.0151110e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012730112DNAL7 a10.1653/0015-4040(2004)087[0145:MDOTFS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzalanski, Allen L.10aMolecular diagnostics of the formosan subterranean termite (isoptera: rhinotermitidae)  ap. 145-151.  aFormosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shriaki, is a serious pest of structures in portions of United States. A 467-bp region of the mtDNA 16S rRNA gene was subjected to DNA sequencing from 12 Coptotermes species, including 64 populations of C. formosanus. Genetic diversity among species ranged from 1.8%% to 7.0%%, with C. formosanus at least 3.0%% divergent to the other Coptotermes taxa. No genetic variation was detected among the C. formosanus populations for this marker making it ideal for diagnostics. Comparison of nucleotide sequence of mitochondrial rRNA 16S was used to design polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers specific for C. formosanus. The diagnostic assay consists of two independent PCR runs of the 16S primer pair along with the C. formosanus primer set. PCR product from samples that are not C. formosanus can be subjected to DNA sequencing and compared with the database of termite 16S sequences on GenBank for identification. This technique provides a non-morphological method to identify field collected termites and may facilitate future quarantine programs for C. formosanus.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCoptotermes formosanus 0ainvasive species 0aPCR 0agenetic variation 0amolecular diagnostics 0atermite1 aAustin, James W.1 aScheffrahn, Rudolf H.1 aMessenger, Matt T.0 tFlorida entomologist.g2004 June, v. 87, no. 2 p.145-151dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653%2F0015-4040%282004%29087%5B0145%3AMDOTFS%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245005900170300001600229500001500245520117100260592002801431650001401459650001201473650002101485650001401506650002101520650000901541650001201550650001401562650002101576650001501597650001101612650002501623650002201648650002201670650001001692650001201702650001301714650001501727650001801742650001801760651001201778653002201790653002301812653001201835653002201847700001701869700001801886773013101904856009002035852000902125655001202134IND60541126620221121024147.0190318e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054112662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrog, J.S.10aEnteric porcine viruses in farmed shellfish in Denmark  ap. 105-109.  a2019-12-06  aBivalve shellfish are at constant risk of being exposed to pathogens as a consequence of contamination of the shellfish beds with human or animal waste originating from sewage treatment plants or slurry fertilized fields. Consumption of contaminated oysters and mussels are frequently reported as causes of disease outbreaks caused by norovirus or hepatitis A virus. Other zoonotic pathogens such as hepatitis E virus (HEV), rotavirus (RV) and Salmonella from livestock may also be transmitted to shellfish via this route. In this study, 29 pooled samples from commercial Danish blue mussels were tested for porcine pathogens and indicator bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli). All samples tested negative for HEV, RV and Salmonella, whereas E. coli and the highly stable porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) were detected in eight and 12 samples, respectively. This is the first study to report the detection of PCV2 in commercial mussels. Based on the detection of PCV2 in clean areas with low prevalence of the normally applied fecal indicator E. coli, testing for PCV2 may be a more sensitive and robust specific porcine waste indicator in shellfish harvesting areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus 3amussels 3asewage treatment 3ashellfish 3aOrthohepevirus A 3arisk 3aviruses 3apathogens 3aEscherichia coli 3aharvesting 3ahumans 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3aindicator species 3adisease outbreaks 3aswine 3aoysters 3aslurries 3aSalmonella 3aHepatovirus A 3aanimal wastes 3aDenmark 0aHepatitis A virus 0aPorcine circovirus 0aMussels 0aHepatitis E virus1 aLarsen, L.E.1 aSchultz, A.C.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 186 p.105-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014800170300001600318520170400334592002802038650001802066650002102084650002402105650001802129650001202147650001202159650001702171650001402188650002702202650001502229650001702244650001502261650001302276650002502289650002402314650001302338650001902351650001002370650002302380650001702403700002002420700002202440700002002462700002702482773014102509856008702650852000902737655001202746IND60608878720221119115104.0200511e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060887872DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2012.115128382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKramer, Maike10aEffects of cultivation conditions and cold storage on the polyacetylene contents of carrot (Daucus carota L.) and parsnip (Pastinaca sativa L.)  ap. 101-106.  aPolyacetylenes are a class of highly bioactive compounds which may negatively affect the sensory properties of Apiaceous plants such as carrots and parsnips. In the present study, the effects of organic nitrogen fertilisation, water supply, and cold storage on the contents of falcarinol (FaOH), falcarindiol (FaDOH), and falcarindiol-3-acetate (FaDOAc) were investigated in four carrot (Daucus carota L.) and two parsnip (Pastinaca sativa L.) cultivars. Relatively high contents of polyacetylenes were observed at an early developmental stage of the roots of both carrot and parsnip, decreasing to a transient minimum approx. 1 month prior to harvest maturity.The supply of super-optimal levels of nitrogen (50 or 100 kg N ha–¹) using organic fertiliser did not significantly affect the polyacetylene contents of carrot or parsnip at harvest (except FaDOH contents in ‘Rodelika’ carrot). Different levels of water supply to potgrown carrots in climate chambers induced complex, cultivar-dependent, and apparently development-dependent patterns of change in polyacetylene contents and profiles. Cold storage of field-grown ‘Bolero F₁’ and ‘Rodelika’ carrot significantly increased the levels of individual polyacetylenes in both cultivars. However, carrots previously supplied with super-optimal amounts of nitrogen fertiliser (50 or 100 kg N ha–¹) either showed a transient increase (‘Bolero F₁’) or a transient decline (‘Rodelika’) in polyacetylene contents during cold storage. The results suggest active pre- and post-harvest synthesis and metabolism of polyacetylenes in carrot and parsnip. This may affect the sensory and bio-functional properties of these crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaucus carota 3aPastinaca sativa 3abioactive compounds 3abiotechnology 3acarrots 3aclimate 3acold storage 3acultivars 3afertilizer application 3aharvesting 3ahorticulture 3ametabolism 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aorganic fertilizers 3aparsnips 3apolyacetylenes 3aroots 3asensory properties 3awater supply1 aBufler, Gebhard1 aNothnagel, Thomas1 aCarle, Reinhold1 aKammerer, Dietmar Rolf0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 87, no. 2 p.101-106dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2012.115128383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245009800192300001600290520125000306592002801556650002401584650001601608650002201624650001601646653001701662653001601679653002201695653001801717653001601735700002401751700002001775700002201795773010601817856008201923852000902005655001202014IND60517670020221121014226.0190801e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051767002DNAL7 a222517452pmid7 a10.1017/S09671994110006822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValdebenito, Iván I.10aMorphometric characterization of the first blastomeres of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  ap. 327-331.  aIn the following investigation the morphometric characteristics of the first two blastomeres of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were determined. Embryos were incubated at 9°C and then fixed in a Stockard solution every 30 min starting from 8.5 to 12.5 h of incubation post fertilization. Embryonic discs were extracted and microphotographs were taken with Q Capture Pro 5.0 software using a stereomicroscope Olympus SZX7. The average size of the blastodiscs was 941.22 ± 160.42 μm. The first cleavage finished after approximately 12 h of incubation. The first two blastomeres were regularly symmetrical in their morphology. Blastomere 1 had an average length (L) of 942.68 ± 105.56 μm and width (W) of 467.34 ± 64.33 μm. Blastomere 2 had an average length of 887.60 ± 101.65 and width of 454.49 ± 47.25 μm (n = 91). Significant differences were found between the length and width of blastomeres 1 and 2. The proportion between the length of blastomeres 1 and 2 was 0.94 ± 0.07 (n = 91); between the width of blastomeres 1 and 2 it was 0.88 ± 0.11 (n = 91); and the width/length ratio was 0.51 ± 0.09 (n = 182). It was concluded that rainbow trout blastomeres tend to be asymmetrical in length with a higher dispersion of widths.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3ablastomeres 3acomputer software 3amorphometry 0aAsymmetrical 0aEarly stage 0aFirst blastomeres 0aRainbow trout 0aSymmetrical1 aSánchez, Rubén R.1 aEffer, Brian R.1 aUbilla, Andrea M.0 tZygote.g2012 Nov., v. 20, no. 4 p.327-331dCambridge University PresswJournal:6292x1469-87307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09671994110006823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245008600207300001600293520205400309592002802363650000802391650002302399650001802422650001702440650001502457650001802472650000902490653003502499653002002534653002702554653003202581700001802613700005502631773011802686856008602804852000902890655001202899IND60611915220221118073605.0200712e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061191522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvan, Lucian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2109-258412aA MCREXS modelling approach for the simulation of a radiological dispersal device  ap. 551-564.  aAssessing the risks of radioactive dose in a radiological dispersal device (RDD) attack requires knowledge of how the radiological materials will be spread through the air surrounding the site of the detonation. Two essential parts of the accurate prediction of the behaviour of this dispersion are a characterization of the initial cloud size, directly after the blast, and detailed modelling of the behaviour of different size particulates. Capturing the transport of contaminants from the initial blast wave is integral to achieving accurate predictions, especially for regions where the blast dynamics dominates, but performing such calculations over a wide range of particle sizes and spatial scales is computationally challenging. Formulation of efficient computational techniques for such advanced models is required to provide predictive tools useful to first responders and emergency planners. In this work, a Multi-Cloud Radiological EXplosive Source (MCREXS) modelling approach for RDD is investigated. This approach combines a stochastic, particle-based, mechanistic model with a standard atmospheric dispersion model. The former is used to characterize the distribution of radioactive material near the source of the explosion, where the blast wind effects are important, while the latter is used to model the transport of the contaminant in the environment over large areas. The particle transport in the near-field of the explosion site is computed based on a Lagrangian description of the particle phase and a reconstructed-Eulerian field for the carrier phase. The information inferred from this physics-based model is then used as a starting point for a subsequent standard Gaussian puff model to calculate the dispersion of the radioactive contaminant. The predictive capabilities of the MCREXS model are assessed against the 2012 DRDC Suffield full-scale RDD experiments. The results demonstrate improved predictions relative to those performed using only a Gaussian puff calculation from an empirical initial cloud distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3amechanistic models 3aparticle size 3aparticulates 3aprediction 3aradioactivity 3awind 0aRadiological dispersion device 0aBlast-wave flow 0aAtmospheric dispersion 0aContaminant plume transport1 aHummel, David1 aLebel, Luke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2323-66870 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2018 Dec., v. 192 p.551-564dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013300168300001600301520150300317592002801820650001001848650001701858650001501875650001601890650001001906650001901916650001001935650001801945650001901963650001501982650002301997651002102020653003202041653002202073653001502095653001602110700001302126700001402139700001502153700001602168700001602184700001902200700001302219700001402232773009902246856008102345852000902426655001202435IND60545052320221119194921.0160901e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054505232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2014.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Changchun10aSatellite observation of hourly dynamic characteristics of algae with Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data in Lake Taihu  ap. 278-287.  aPhytoplankton bloom in a shallow inland eutrophic lake (Taihu Lake) is characterized by significant spatial and temporal variation and a high concentration of chlorophyll-a (Cchl-a). The observation of the rapidly changing dynamic characteristics of algae is limited by the insufficient temporal resolution of satellite data. The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), launched by Korea, can provide high temporal resolution satellite data to observe the hourly dynamics of algae. In this study, a simple regional NIR-red two-band empirical algorithm of Cchl-a for GOCI is proposed for Taihu Lake. Study results show that the GOCI-derived Cchl-a matches the in situ measured values well. Based on this validated algorithm of Cchl-a, we obtained the hourly maps of Cchl-a from GOCI level-1b data during the period August 6 to August 9, 2013. The spatial variation of GOCI-derived Cchl-a also matches synchronous in situ measured values well, and the temporal variation of GOCI-derived Cchl-a coincides with buoy-measured Cchl-a. The northwestern area of the lake and Meiliang Bay are worst hit by phytoplankton bloom. GOCI-derived Cchl-a revealed a clear evidence of hourly spatial and temporal variations of Cchl-a in Taihu Lake. The vertical current plays an important role in the hourly scale of spatial and temporal variations in phytoplankton. The horizontal current is important to the distribution of phytoplankton over the long term, but spatially and temporally limited in the short term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aalgal blooms 3aalgorithms 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3aeutrophication 3alakes 3aphytoplankton 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3atemporal variation 3aKorean Peninsula 0aChlorophyll-a concentration 0aNIR-red algorithm 0aTaihu Lake 0aAlgal bloom1 aShi, Kun1 aYang, Hao1 aLi, Yunmei1 aZhu, A-xing1 aSun, Deyong1 aXu, Liangjiang1 aZou, Jun1 aChen, Xia0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 159 p.278-287dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245006300178300001400241520118400255592002801439650002101467650002901488650001101517650001001528650002201538650001601560650002101576650001101597650000701608650001101615653000701626653002501633653001901658653003201677653002401709700002001733700005801753700002401811773012901835856009001964852000902054655001202063IND60541126820221121020251.0190318e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054112682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDantigny, Philippe12aA model for the effect of pH on the growth of chalk yeasts  ap. 49-54.  aHyphopichia burtonii, Pichia anomala, and Saccharomycopsis fibuligera were isolated from spoiled packaged sliced bread. These chalk yeasts were characterized by a wide range of pH for which growth was almost optimum. Thus, the curve growth vs pH exhibited plateau and sharp profiles close to the minimum and the maximum pH. This study described a chalk yeast model (CYM) for the effect of pH derived from a new germination model for fungi (Dantigny, P., Nanguy, S., P.-M., Judet-Correia, D., and Bensoussan, M. 2011, International Journal of Food Microbiology, 146, 176–181). The CYM is asymmetric, versatile, based on parameters with biological significance, and compatible with the gamma concept. The CYM was compared to the cardinal pH model (CPM) which is widely used to describe the effect of pH on microbial growth. The CYM exhibited RMSE values two fold less than those obtained with the CPM for H. burtonii, and S. fibuligera for which plateaus were clearly observed. For P. anomala, the plateau was less obvious, but the RMSE value obtained with the CYM was similar to that found with the CPM. The CYM could extend its use to represent the effect of pH on mold growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomycopsis 3aWickerhamomyces anomalus 3abreads 3achalk 3afood microbiology 3agermination 3amicrobial growth 3amodels 3apH 3ayeasts 0apH 0aHyphopichia burtonii 0aPichia anomala 0aSaccharomycopsis fibuligera 0aPredictive mycology1 aBurgain, Anaïs1 aDeniel, Franck1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0342-674X1 aBensoussan, Maurice0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 186 p.49-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245013300160300001600293520092700309592002801236650001501264650001301279650001701292650002501309650002101334650002601355650003201381650001101413650001501424650001901439650001701458653002801475653001201503653001101515653002201526700005901548700005401607700001401661700001501675700001901690700001701709700005301726773014501779856008001924852000902004655001202013IND60680933320221122142423.0200110e20191205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068093332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b064182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Rui10aFormation and Identification of Two Hydroxmethylfurfural–Glycine Adducts and Their Cytotoxicity and Absorption in Caco-2 Cells  ap. 384-389.  aOur previous research showed that thioacetal and Schiff base formed between 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and cysteine or lysine considerably decreased the cytotoxicity of HMF. In this study, two adol condensation adducts, named 2β-amino-3α-hydroxy-3-(5-(hydroxymethyl)furan-2-yl)propanoic acid (HGA) and 2α-amino-3β-hydroxy-3-(5-(hydroxymethyl)furan-2-yl)propanoic acid (HGB), were prepared from the reaction products of glycine and HMF, and their cytotoxicities were investigated in Caco-2 cells. Compared with HMF, HGA and HGB displayed lower cytotoxicities against Caco-2 cells with IC₅₀ values of 36.50 and 43.47 mM, respectively, versus 16.11 mM (HMF). In contrast to our findings in thioacetal and Schiff base products, HGA and HGB underwent a very high metabolism rate (99%) in Caco-2 cells. HGA and HGB may degrade to other products instead of HMF since no extracellular or intracellular HMF was detected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acysteine 3acytotoxicity 3aglycine (amino acid) 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alysine 3ametabolism 3apropionic acid 3aschiff bases 0a5-hydroxymethylfurfural 0aglycine 0aadduct 0aadol condensation1 aZhang, Guangwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2257-151X1 aZheng, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9755-55951 aZhou, Hua1 aWang, Ying1 aHuang, Caihuan1 aHu, Wenzhong1 aOu, Shiyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6779-08580 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Dec. 05, v. 68, no. 1 p.384-389dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b064183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245016700180300001400347520123500361592002801596650002801624650002401652650003001676650001701706650001901723650002501742650002401767650003001791650004501821650001801866650001301884650002101897650002101918653002201939653002501961653000801986653005201994700002002046700002702066700002602093700003102119700002302150700001602173773012902189856009002318852000902408655001202417IND60541126920221121020400.0190318e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054112692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWanangkarn, Amornrat10aLactic acid bacterial population dynamics during fermentation and storage of Thai fermented sausage according to restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis  ap. 61-67.  aThis study applied restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis to identify the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from “mum” Thai fermented sausages during fermentation and storage. A total of 630 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from the sausages prepared using 2 methods. In Method 1, after stuffing, the sausages were stored at 30°C for 14days. In Method 2, after stuffing and storage at 30°C for 3days, the sausages were vacuum-packed and stored at 4°C until Day 28. The sausages were sampled on Days 0, 3, 14, and 28 for analyses. The 16S rDNA was amplified and digested using restriction enzymes. Of the restriction enzymes evaluated, Dde I displayed the highest discrimination capacity. The LAB were classified and 7 species were identified For Methods 1 and 2, during fermentation, the Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus plantarum species were dominant. For Method 2, the proportion of Leuconostoc mesenteroides markedly increased during storage, until L. sakei and Ln. mesenteroides represented the dominant species. The identification of LAB in the sausage samples could facilitate the selection of appropriate microorganisms for candidate starter cultures for future controlled mum production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLactobacillus sakei 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3afermentation 3afermented meat 3alactic acid bacteria 3apopulation dynamics 3arestriction endonucleases 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal DNA 3asausages 3astarter cultures 3avacuum packaging 0aFermented sausage 0aLactic acid bacteria 0aMum 0aRestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)1 aLiu, Deng-Cheng1 aSwetwiwathana, Adisorn1 aJindaprasert, Aphacha1 aPhraephaisarn, Chirapiphat1 aChumnqoen, Wanwisa1 aTan, Fa-Jui0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 186 p.61-67dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245009000205300002000295520107900315592002801394650001901422650001301441650004901454650002001503650002301523650000901546650001301555650001601568650002301584650001501607650001601622700002501638773013801663856008001801852000901881655001201890IND60661471420221122232223.0190829e20190805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066147142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b059352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaVerne, Jay A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8383-747610aH Atom Production and Reaction in the Gamma Radiolysis of Thermally Modified Boehmite  ap. 21005-21010.  aThe correlation between the formation of H atoms and H₂ was observed in the radiolysis of thermally modified boehmite (γ-AlOOH). Boehmite was pretreated by heating to 300, 400, and 550 °C, loaded with adsorbed water, and irradiated with γ-rays. Long-lived H atoms trapped in the interstitial matrix were observed by electron paramagnetic resonance techniques, and the amount of gaseous H₂ was detected by gas chromatography. Heating the boehmite to 400 °C before radiolysis results in the collapse of the matrix with loss of trapped H atoms and a substantial increase in the production of H₂. Samples without added water postheating showed no production of H₂, suggesting that it is formed by the diffusion of H atoms to the surface followed by an abstraction reaction with water. Boehmite heated to 550 °C has completely converted to alumina, and the radiolytic responses of each are similar. Post-irradiation heating of boehmite to 300 °C results in a doubling of the H₂ yield at pretreated temperatures below 300 °C due to the release of trapped H atoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aboehmite 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3agamma radiation 3agas chromatography 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3airradiation 3aphysical chemistry 3aradiolysis 3atemperature1 aHuestis, Patricia L.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Aug. 05, v. 123, no. 34 p.21005-21010dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b059353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245007900189300001600268520164600284592002801930650001801958650001101976650001101987650002501998650002102023650003902044650003702083650001402120653001802134653001102152653002102163653002402184700002502208700002202233700002302255700002802278700001902306700003502325700003402360700002302394700002302417773010602440856008202546852000902628655001202637IND60517670220221121014304.0190801e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051767022DNAL7 a224750702pmid7 a10.1017/S09671994120000562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrade, Evelyn R.10aEffects of ascorbic acid on in vitro culture of bovine preantral follicles  ap. 379-388.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of adding ascorbic acid to the media for in vitro culture of cattle ovarian fragments and to determine their effects on growth activation and viability of early-stage follicles. The ovarian cortex was divided into small fragments; one fragment was immediately fixed (control) and the other fragments were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented or not with various doses of ascorbic acid. Ovarian tissue was processed for histology, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunohistochemical demonstration of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Compared with control fragments, the percentage of primordial follicles was reduced (p < 0.05) and the percentage of growing follicles had increased (p < 0.05) in cultured cortical fragments, independent of the tested medium or incubation time. Furthermore, compared with control tissue, culture of ovarian cortex for 8 days reduced the percentages of healthy, viable follicles (p < 0.05), but not when cultures were supplemented with 25, 50 or 100 μg/ml of ascorbic acid. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analysis of 8 day cultured ovarian cortical fragments, however, showed the integrity and viability of follicles only when fragments were cultured in presence of 50 μg/ml of ascorbic acid. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that addition of ascorbic acid to MEM at a concentration of 50 μg/ml not only stimulates the activation of 8 day in vitro cultured cattle primordial follicles and subsequent growth of activated follicles, but also safeguards the viability of these early-stage follicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acattle 3acortex 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ain vitro culture 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aviability 0aAscorbic acid 0aCattle 0aIn vitro culture 0aPreantral follicles1 avan den Hurk, Robert1 aLisboa, Lívia A.1 aHertel, Mariana F.1 aMelo-Sterza, Fabiana A.1 aMoreno, Kleber1 aBracarense, Ana Paula F.

In recent years, this virus has become a major threat to public health in the Asia–Pacific region, while no effective antiviral therapies and vaccines are currently available. In this study, we constructed and characterized for the first time an infectious full-length EV71 cDNA clone derived from the SHZH98 strain, which was the first subgenotype C4 strain isolated in China. Our data demonstrate that the rescued EV71 viruses exhibited growth kinetics in vitro and morphologies similar to those of the BrCr-TR strain and reached a maximum titer of 10⁷.⁵TCID₅₀/ml. Although the rescued viruses were able to infect suckling mice, no typical symptoms of EV71 infection were observed for up to 18 days post-inoculation. Taken together our research provides an important tool to study the epidemic strains of EV71 in the Asia–Pacific region and promote the development of vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus 3acomplementary DNA 3ahand, foot and mouth disease 3amice 3apublic health 3avaccines 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEnterovirus A, Humanxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aGenotype 2aHand, Foot and Mouth Diseasexpathologyxvirology. 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aViral Load 2aVirus Cultivation 2aVirus Replication 3aChina 0aChina1 aWei, Tao1 aLi, Xiao-Yu1 aYin, Xiao1 aLi, Yu-Huan1 aDing, Ji-Wei1 aZhou, Jin-Ming1 aZhang, Guang-Zhou1 aJin, Qi1 aCen, Shan0 tVirus genes.g2013 Oct., v. 47, no. 2 p.235-243dSpringer-Verlagx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-013-0955-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245006900169300001600238520118800254592002801442650001201470650001101482650001801493650001901511650002901530650002101559653002001580653001901600653001601619700002801635700002101663700001801684700001801702700002701720773009901747856008101846852000901927655001201936IND60545052620221119195013.0160901e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054505262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2014.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMermoz, Stéphane10aDecrease of L-band SAR backscatter with biomass of dense forests  ap. 307-317.  aSynthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of the most promising remote sensors to map forest carbon. The unique spaceborne and long-wavelength SAR data currently available are L-band data, but their relationship with forest biomass is still controversial, particularly for high biomass values. While many studies assume a complete loss of sensitivity above a saturation point, typically around 100t.ha−1, others assume a continuous positive correlation between SAR backscatter and biomass. The objective of this paper is to revisit the relationship between L-band SAR backscatter and dense tropical forest biomass for a large range of biomass values using both theoretical and experimental approaches. Both approaches revealed that after reaching a maximum value, SAR backscatter correlates negatively with forest biomass. This phenomenon is interpreted as a signal attenuation from the forest canopy as the canopy becomes denser with increasing biomass. This result has strong implications for L-band vegetation mapping because it can lead to a greater-than-expected under-estimation of biomass. The consequences for L-band biomass mapping are illustrated, and solutions are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aforest canopy 3aremote sensing 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atropical forests 0aTropical forest 0aCarbon mapping 0aALOS PALSAR1 aRéjou-Méchain, Maxime1 aVillard, Ludovic1 aLe Toan, Thuy1 aRossi, Vivien1 aGourlet-Fleury, Sylvie0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 159 p.307-317dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245016400165300002000329520159200349592002801941650002001969650001401989650002302003650002102026650002502047650001102072650003002083650001702113650001802130650001302148650001402161650001802175700001402193700001802207700001502225700005602240700001602296700005302312773013802365856008002503852000902583655001202592IND60661471620221123004018.0190829e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066147162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b059632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Riguang10aSyngas Conversion to C₂ Oxygenates over the Cu/β-Mo₂C Catalyst: Probing into the Effect of the Interface between Cu and β-Mo₂C on Catalytic Performance  ap. 21022-21030.  aAiming at probing into the role of the interface between Cu and Mo₂C for syngas conversion to C₂ oxygenates over the Cu/β-Mo₂C catalyst, the formation mechanism of C₂ oxygenates from syngas over the Cu/β-Mo₂C catalyst has been systematically investigated using density functional theory calculations. The results show that the CH monomer is the most preferred CHₓ species formed via the route of CO direct dissociation into C, followed by C hydrogenation to CH; moreover, the Cu/β-Mo₂C(001) catalyst presents higher activity and selectivity toward CH formation instead of CH₃OH formation. For C₂ oxygenate formation, CHO insertion into CH to form the C₂ oxygenate CHCHO is the most preferred. Compared to the pure Cu(111) and β-Mo₂C(001), Cu/β-Mo₂C(001) exhibits better selectivity toward CH formation, and has the strong ability of C–C chain growth for C₂ oxygenate formation. On the other hand, the analysis of electronic and structural properties indicates that there is a strong charge transfer between Cu and Mo₂C to form a charge-rich region at the interface of the Cu/β-Mo₂C(001) catalyst, which promotes the C–O bond cleavage of CO and CHO to form the CH monomer adsorbed at the interface, and favors the subsequent CHO insertion into CH to form the C₂ oxygenate CHCHO at the interface. As a result, the synergistic effect including the electronic and geometric effect that occurred at the interface between Cu and β-Mo₂C(001) leads to high productivity toward C₂ oxygenates in syngas conversion over the Cu/β-Mo₂C(001) catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3acleavage (chemistry) 3acopper 3adensity functional theory 3adissociation 3ahydrogenation 3amethanol 3asynergism 3asynthesis gas1 aWei, Cong1 aGuo, Weisheng1 aLi, Zhiqin1 aWang, Baojun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9069-67201 aLing, Lixia1 aLi, Debao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6891-47870 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 123, no. 34 p.21022-21030dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b059633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011600169300002000285500001900305520139000324592002801714650002501742650002601767650002701793650001201820650001501832650001201847650001201859650001301871650001301884650002801897700001601925700001401941700001901955700005201974773013102026856008402157852000902241655001202250IND60710993520221117203108.0200915e20200814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071099352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c030992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Tianjia10aSelf-Sterilizing Polymeric Membrane Sensors Based on 6-Chloroindole Release for Prevention of Marine Biofouling  ap. 12132-12136.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA self-sterilizing strategy based on antimicrobial organic agent release is proposed for polymeric membrane sensors to prevent marine biofouling. A solid-contact polymeric membrane calcium ion-selective electrode (Ca²⁺-ISE) is selected as a model sensor. 6-Cholorindole (6-Cl indole) is utilized as the biocidal agent due to its potential antimicrobial activity and environmental friendliness. The plasticized polymeric membrane doped with 6-Cl indole shows a markedly improved antimicrobial activity against the bacterial cells collected from seawater and effectively prevents the formation of a biofilm on the sensor surface, while displaying response properties (i.e., linear range, selectivity, and response time) similar to those of the undoped membrane. Importantly, the present sensor can preserve an improved antimicrobial activity when kept in the artificial seawater for 45 days, indicating highly stable antibacterial properties of the membrane electrode. Additionally, the 6-Cl indole-doped Ca²⁺-ISE exhibits no significant loss of analytical performance after exposure to a rather concentrated bacterial suspension (∼10⁹ colony-forming units per mL (CFU mL–¹)) for 7 days. The proposed antimicrobial agent release methodology can be extended to develop polymeric membrane-based marine sensors with stable biofouling resistances against bacterial colonization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanti-infective agents 3abacterial colonization 3abiofilm 3abiofouling 3acalcium 3aindoles 3apolymers 3aseawater 3aspecific ion electrodes1 aQi, Longbin1 aHou, Chao1 aFang, Shengtao1 aQin, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9606-77300 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 14, v. 92, no. 18 p.12132-12136dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c030993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245007700200520135400277592002801631596007501659596007801734650001601812650000801828650001101836650001701847650001301864650001201877650002001889650004401909650001101953650002301964650001601987650001802003700005502021700001602076700005602092700001602148700001502164700001502179700005702194773009602251856007702347852000902424655001202433IND60771908120221121062828.0220329e20220317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077190812DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/32268922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Pengfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2975-252710aApplication of Artificial Neural Network in the Baking Process of Salmon  aThe global production of farmed Atlantic salmon amounts to over 2 million tons per year. Consumed all over the world, salmon is not only delicious but also nutritious. This paper deals with the relationship between moisture content, low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and sensory evaluation in the baking process of salmon. An artificial neural network (ANN) model has been established to simulate the change of moisture content and energy consumed in the baking process. Through the study of LF-NMR, SEM, and sensory evaluation, it was found that the change of sensory indexes was consistent with the results observed by LF-NMR and SEM. With the increase of temperature, muscle fibers contracted, the interstices increased, the rate of water loss increased, and the sensory score decreased. Initial moisture content, baking time, baking temperature, baking humidity, and baking air velocity were employed as the baking control parameters for the ANN. ANN can be used to determine the moisture content and energy consumed of baking salmon. The best network topology occurred with 5 input layer neurons, 17 hidden layer neurons, and 2 output layer neurons, and the MSE was 0.00153, and Rall was 0.99661. According to the experiment, it was demonstrated that the ANN is a reliable software-based method.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019YFD0902000cNational Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)  a2020JH1/10200001cKey Science and Technology Program of Liaoning Province 3aSalmo salar 3aair 3aenergy 3afood quality 3ahumidity 3amuscles 3aneural networks 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asalmon 3asensory evaluation 3atemperature 3awater content1 aZhu, Kaiyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3569-444X1 aShang, Shan1 aJin, Wengang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9838-39051 aYu, Wanying1 aLi, Shuang1 aWang, Shen1 aDong, Xiuping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5675-89320 tJournal of food quality.g2022 Mar. 17, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x1745-45577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/32268923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009900173300001600272520079400288592002801082650001501110650001101125650003001136650001701166650002501183650001101208650001701219650002801236650001801264650001101282650001001293650002201303650001101325651001001336653001401346653002201360653002501382653001801407653001601425653001501441700003201456773013001488856008401618852000901702655001201711IND60121720120221119185623.0150404e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012172012DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2011.5876152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Vasundhara13aAn Overview on Chemical Composition, Bioactivity and Processing of Leaves of Cinnamomum tamala  ap. 433-448.  aDried leaves of Cinnamomum tamala , also known as Indian bay leaves, are a lesser-known spice used in the Indian subcontinent.

The results from various estimation models consistently indicated that graduates with a higher ratio of insincere responses in student evaluations of teaching are less likely to be employed, or are hired for lower prestige jobs than other comparison groups. This means that unlike the current practice in which firms rely simply on specifications to hire employees, applicants’ invisible characteristics, such as personality, can also be screened by job interviewers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeducation 3aemployment 3ahiring 3alabor market 3amodels 3apersonality 3astudents1 aCho, Joonmo0 tSustainability.g2015 Dec. 03, v. 7, no. 12 p.16060-16075dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su712158083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100002200186245011800208300001100326506007600337520131900413592002801732506003701760650001301797650001501810650001901825650001101844650000901855650001101864650000801875650001201883650003801895650003901933650001001972650001801982650003302000650002202033650002002055650002002075650003202095700001902127700002402146700002302170700001802193773011902211856008002330852000902410655001202419IND50070250520221207101120.0190131e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007025052DNAL7 aPMC40165762pmcid7 a240535882pmid7 a10.1186/1751-0147-55-702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Kazuma14aThe presence of heat-labile factors interfering with binding analysis of fibrinogen with ferritin in horse plasma  ap. 70.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Horse fibrinogen has been identified as a plasma specific ferritin-binding protein. There are two ways in the binding of ferritin-binding protein with ferritin: one is direct binding and the other is indirect binding which is heme-mediated. The aim of this study was to analyze the binding between horse fibrinogen and ferritin. FINDINGS: Although fibrinogen in horse plasma did not show the binding to ferritin coated on the plate wells, after following heat-treatment (60°C, 30 min) of horse plasma, plasma fibrinogen as well as purified horse fibrinogen bound to plates coated with horse spleen ferritin, but not with its apoferritin which lost heme as well as iron after the treatment of reducing reagent. Binding of purified or plasma fibrinogen to ferritin was inhibited by hemin and Sn-protoporphyrin IX (Sn-PPIX), but not by PPIX or Zn-PPIX. CONCLUSIONS: Heat-treatment of horse plasma enabled plasma fibrinogen to bind to plate well coated with holo-ferritin. From the binding analysis of fibrinogen and ferritin, it is suggested that horse fibrinogen recognized iron or tin in complexed with the heme- or the hemin-ring, and also suggest that some fibrinogens circulate in the form of a complex with ferritin and/or heat-labile factors which inhibit the binding of fibrinogen with ferritin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aferritin 3afibrinogen 3aheat treatment 3ahorses 3airon 3aspleen 3atin 2aAnimals 2aFerritinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFibrinogenxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHemin 2aHorsesxblood 2aIronxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMetalloporphyrins 2aProtein Binding 2aProtoporphyrins 2aTinxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aKondo, Takashi1 aYoshikawa, Yasunaga1 aWatanabe, Kiyotaka1 aOrino, Koichi0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2013 Dec., v. 55, no. 1 p.70-70dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-55-703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03458naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245009600183300001600279520210200295592002802397650002702425650001502452650001802467650001302485650002402498650001502522650001402537650001602551650002302567650001602590653003102606653002402637653002102661653002702682653001802709653001302727700002802740700002602768773013102794856009002925852000903015655001203024IND60541127520221121024141.0190318e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054112752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTyrovouzis, Nikolaos A.10aBi-phasic growth of Listeria monocytogenes in chemically defined medium at low temperatures  ap. 110-119.  aThe present work reports a novel observation regarding the growth of L. monocytogenes in modified Welshimer's broth (MWB) at low temperatures. Specifically, the direct monitoring of the growth of L. monocytogenes Scott A using plate count data revealed that the pathogen displays a bi-phasic growth pattern in MWB at 7°C. This bi-phasic growth pattern is masked (not observed) when optical density (OD) measurements are used to monitor growth due to the inability of OD readings to detect L. monocytogenes population density increases up to 107CFU/mL. This bi-phasic growth phenomenon was further investigated as a function of growth temperature (4°C, 7°C, 10°C, 14°C and 18°C), medium composition (by altering the MWB composition by ten-fold increases in different sets of medium constituents), inoculum level (102, 103, 104, 105, 106, and 107CFU/mL) and L. monocytogenes strain (10 strains). The growth of L. monocytogenes Scott A in MWB at 7°C, 10°C and 14°C was consistently bi-phasic and independent of growth rate; at 18°C, growth was consistently mono-phasic (single-phase, typical sigmoid growth curves), whereas no growth was observed at 4°C. The tested modifications in the composition of MWB did not influence the bi-phasic nature of L. monocytogenes Scott A growth at 7°C, and, overall, we could not point out any strain-, or serotype-specific effects. On the other hand, the initial inoculum level appears to affect the form of the growth curve, as there was a shift towards mono-phasic growth in trials with increasing initial inocula. A mathematical model, based on a stepwise response and described through two sequential sigmoid curves, was used to describe bi-phasic growth and estimate the kinetic parameters of L. monocytogenes growth. An alternative hypothesis, based on the assumption of the existence of two subpopulations, possessing different growth kinetics, materialized under the stress imposed on L. monocytogenes cells due to the combined effect of three factors (defined medium, low temperature and low initial inoculum) was also proposed and formulated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aabsorbance 3agrowth models 3ainoculum 3amathematical models 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3aplate count 3apopulation density 3atemperature 0aModified Welshimer's broth 0aTemperature effects 0aStrain variation 0aInoculum level effects 0aRefrigeration 0aModeling1 aAngelidis, Apostolos S.1 aStoforos, Nikolaos G.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 186 p.110-119dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014300170300001600313520138800329592002801717650001601745650002201761650001601783650002601799650001501825650002501840650002201865650001701887650001701904650002201921650000901943650001701952650001701969651000901986651001101995653001502006653001302021653001702034653001502051653001002066653001102076700001902087700001702106773013002123856008402253852000902337655001202346IND60121720420221119185556.0150404e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012172042DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2011.5883492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewton, Richard10aPerspectives on the Utilization of Aquaculture Coproduct in Europe and Asia: Prospects for Value Addition and Improved Resource Efficiency  ap. 495-510.  aAquaculture has often been criticized for its environmental impacts, especially efficiencies concerning global fisheries resources for use in aquafeeds among others. However, little attention has been paid to the contribution of coproducts from aquaculture, which can vary between 40% and 70% of the production. These have often been underutilized and could be redirected to maximize the efficient use of resource inputs including reducing the burden on fisheries resources. In this review, we identify strategies to enhance the overall value of the harvested yield including noneffluent processing coproducts for three of the most important global aquaculture species, and discuss the current and prospective utilization of these resources for value addition and environmental impact reduction. The review concludes that in Europe coproducts are often underutilized because of logistical reasons such as the disconnected nature of the value chain, and perceived legislative barriers. However, in Asia, most coproducts are used, often innovatively but not to their full economic potential and sometimes with possible human health and biosecurity risks. These include possible spread of diseased material and low traceability in some circumstances. Full economic and environmental appraisal is long overdue for the current and potential strategies available for coproduct utilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture feeds 3abiosecurity 3abyproduct utilization 3acoproducts 3aenvironmental impact 3afishery resources 3afood science 3ahuman health 3anutrition science 3arisk 3asupply chain 3atraceability 3aAsia 3aEurope 0aProcessing 0afishmeal 0aomega-3 oils 0aregulation 0ahalal 0akosher1 aTelfer, Trevor1 aLittle, Dave0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2014 Jan. 1, v. 54, no. 4 p.495-510dTaylor & Francis Groupx1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2011.5883493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245012200206300001600328520129100344592002801635650001101663650001201674650001001686650001701696650001401713650002401727650001101751650001601762650002901778650002401807650001301831650001901844650003101863653002301894653001001917653002101927653001901948653001501967700001901982700001902001700001902020700005702039773014502096856008002241852000902321655001202330IND60680934020221121173204.0200110e20191206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068093402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b066602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuda, Takafumi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3185-719210aEffects of Hop Bitter Acids, Bitter Components in Beer, on Cognition in Healthy Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial  ap. 206-212.  aThe present study aimed to investigate the effects of matured hop bitter acids (MHBAs) on human cognition, mental fatigue, and mood state. In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, 60 healthy adults (age 45–64 years) with self-awareness of cognitive decline were randomly divided into 2 groups and received either orally administered MHBAs (35 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. Cognitive functions and mental states were assessed using neuropsychological tests or questionnaires at baseline and weeks 6 and 12 of the intervention. The change in verbal fluency score at week 6 compared with that at baseline was significantly higher in the MHBAs-treated group compared with that in the placebo group (P = 0.034), and Stroop test score at week 12 was significantly lower in the MHBAs-treated group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.019). Furthermore, subjective fatigue and anxiety at week 12 were significantly improved in the MHBAs-treated group (P = 0.008 and 0.043, respectively) compared with the placebo group. This is the first study to evaluate the effects of bitter ingredients in beer on cognition, subjective mood, and mental fatigue in a clinical trial. Our findings suggest that hop-derived bitter acids might be beneficial for cognition and mood state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanxiety 3abeers 3abitter acids 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3ahumans 3aingredients 3aneuropsychological tests 3aoral administration 3aplacebos 3aquestionnaires 3arandomized clinical trials 0acognitive function 0aherbs 0ahop bitter acids 0amental fatigue 0amood state1 aObara, Kuniaki1 aSaitō, Jirō,1 aUmeda, Satoshi1 aAno, Yasuhisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5957-87100 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Dec. 06, v. 68, no. 1 p.206-212dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b066603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245021300157300001800370520183700388592002802225650001102253650001302264650002002277650002602297650003702323650004302360650001102403650001702414650003702431650003302468650002102501650003202522650001302554650002102567700001702588700001502605700001702620700001602637773012802653856007402781852000902855655001202864IND60631573420221120152526.0190311e20190228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063157342DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ay00071b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Junliang10aMorphology, composition and selectivity of nickel/titanium oxide nanoflakes grown on a superelastic nickel/titanium alloy fiber substrate for highly efficient solid-phase microextraction of aromatic compounds  ap. 1237-1247.  aDirect in situ hydrothermal growth of nickel/titanium oxide nanoflakes (NiO/TiO₂NFs) was carried out on superelastic nickel/titanium alloy (NiTi) wires for solid-phase microextraction. The resulting fiber coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Control of the NaOH concentration was found to be an effective route to manipulate the morphology and composition of NiO-based nanoflakes grown on the NiTi fiber substrates via a hydrothermal reaction. At higher concentrations of NaOH, pristine NiO nanoflakes (NiONFs) were in situ grown on the NiTi fiber substrates for the first time. Their extraction performance was evaluated using typical aromatic compounds by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. The results clearly demonstrate that the extraction selectivity is subject to the surface elemental composition of the nanoflake coatings and the extraction capability greatly depends on their surface morphology. In view of the good extraction selectivity of the NiONF coating for the selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the key experimental parameters were optimized. Under the optimum conditions, the calibration curves were linear in the range of 0.05–100 μg L⁻¹ with correlation coefficients greater than 0.999. Limits of detection were 0.009–0.036 μg L⁻¹. Furthermore, the intra-day and inter-day repeatability of the proposed method with the single fiber varied from 3.7% to 5.3% and from 5.4% to 5.8%, respectively. The fiber-to-fiber reproducibility ranged from 5.8% to 8.6%. The proposed method was suitable for selective enrichment and determination of target PAHs from real water samples. Moreover, the fabricated fibers showed precisely controllable growth of NiONFs and a long-term recyclability of 150 cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acoatings 3adetection limit 3aelemental composition 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3anickel 3anickel oxide 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hydroxide 3asolid phase microextraction 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide1 aWang, Feifei1 aWang, Zhuo1 aWang, Xuemei1 aDu, Xinzhen0 tAnalytical methods.g2019 Feb. 28, v. 11, no. 9 p.1237-1247dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ay00071b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03651naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245010000160300001600260520161400276592002801890596008001918596008101998596009802079596006602177650002102243650001902264650001402283650001702297650001502314650003002329650003102359650001302390650001102403650003002414650001502444650001902459650002502478650002502503650001302528650002202541650001702563650001302580700001202593700001802605700001302623700001502636700001402651700001602665700001802681700001902699700001502718700001702733700001702750700001802767700001602785773012002801856008302921852000903004655001203013IND60775733420221116193005.0220427e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077573342DNAL7 a10.1007/s13258-022-01217-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Bin10aRhoGDI2 induced malignant phenotypes of pancreatic cancer cells via regulating Snail expression  ap. 561-569.  aBACKGROUND: Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI2) has been shown to contribute to the aggressive phenotypes of human cancers, such as tumor metastasis and chemoresistance. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effects of RhoGDI2 on tumor progression and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer cells. METHODS: The expression of RhoGDI2 in pancreatic cancer cells was detected by Western blot analysis. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches were done to examine the malignant phenotypes of the RhoGDI2-expressing or RhoGDI2-depleting cells. The correlation between RhoGDI2 and Snail was also analyzed. RESULTS: Differential expression of RhoGDI2 protein in pancreatic cancer cell lines was identified. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments showed that RhoGDI2 induced the malignant phenotypes of pancreatic cancer cells, including proliferation, migration, invasion, and gemcitabine (GEM) chemoresistance. The upregulation of RhoGDI2 stimulated the expression of Snail, resulting in the altered expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin and mesenchymal marker Vimentin, which were characteristics of the tumorigenic activity of epithelial–mesenchymal transition. The expression of RhoGDI2 and Snail was upregulated in clinical tumor samples, and higher expression of RhoGDI2 or Snail was significantly associated with poor patient survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that RhoGDI2 promoted GEM resistance and tumor progression in pancreatic cancer and that RhoGDI2 might be a potential therapeutic target in patients with PDAC.  aPublisher supplied data  aSYS201739cthe Project of Suzhou People's Livelihood Science and Technology  aSYS2020121cthe Project of Suzhou People's Livelihood Science and Technology  aZKS1819cthe Project of Zhangjiagang Science and Technology Support Plan (Social development)  aH2018056cthe Project of Medical Research of Jiangsu Province 3aWestern blotting 3aadenocarcinoma 3acadherins 3adissociation 3aepithelium 3again-of-function mutation 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3ahumans 3aloss-of-function mutation 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasm progression 3apancreatic neoplasms 3apatients 3aprotein synthesis 3atherapeutics 3avimentin1 aHu, You1 aZhu, Dongming1 aYao, Jun1 aZhou, Jian1 aZhang, Yi1 aHe, Zhilong1 aZhang, Lifeng1 aZhang, Zixiang1 aYang, Jian1 aTang, Yuchen1 aHuang, Yujie1 aLimusishiden,1 aLiu, Qiuhua0 tGenes & genomics.g2022 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.561-569dSpringer Nature SingaporewJournal:J000001676x1976-95717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-022-01217-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001700169245012000186300001600306520094300322592002801265653002601293653001301319653001501332653001101347653002301358700002101381700002201402700001901424773011001443856011701553852000901670655001201679IND60127302420221120204029.0151110e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012730242DNAL7 a10.1653/0015-4040(2004)087[0288:FATTOM]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalo, Edi A.10aFactors affecting the trapping of males of spodoptera frugiperda (lepidoptera: noctuidae) with pheromones in mexico  ap. 288-293.  aFour commercial sex pheromones and virgin females were tested as attractants for male fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda with Scentry Heliothis traps in sorghum fields in Chiapas, Mexico.

In another experiment performed in Michoacáán, Mexico, we found that Scentry Heliothis traps baited with Chemtica lures placed at 1.5 m above ground caught significantly more males than traps placed at a height of 2 m. In contrast, the capture of S. frugiperda males with bucket traps placed at 1 m height was not significantly different from that of traps placed at 1.5 and 2 m height. When baited with pheromone, Scentry Heliothis traps caught more non-target insects than bucket traps.

Here, we determined if prevention of adherence or dispersal of existing biofilms could occur if biofilm matrix components were disrupted enzymatically. Addition of DNase during biofilm formation reduced attachment (<50% of control) to polystyrene. Treatment of established 72h biofilms with 100μg/ml of DNase for 24h induced incomplete biofilm dispersal, with <25% biofilm remaining compared to control. In contrast, addition of proteinase K completely inhibited biofilm formation, and 72h biofilms—including those grown under stimulatory conditions—were completely dispersed with 100μg/ml proteinase K. Generally-regarded-as-safe proteases bromelain and papain were less effective dispersants than proteinase K. In a time course assay, complete dispersal of L. monocytogenes biofilms from both polystyrene and type 304H food-grade stainless steel occurred within 5min at proteinase K concentrations above 25μg/ml. These data confirm that both DNA and proteins are required for L. monocytogenes biofilm development and maintenance, and that these components of the biofilm matrix can be targeted for effective prevention and removal of biofilms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aListeria monocytogenes 3abiofilm 3abromelains 3adeoxyribonuclease I 3afood industry 3apapain 3apeptidase K 3apolystyrenes 3aproteins 3asanitation 3astainless steel 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aBiofilm 0aInhibition 0aDispersal 0aProtease 0aDNase1 aBurrows, Lori L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0838-50400 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Sept. 18, v. 187 p.26-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245014900175300001800324520142500342592002801767650001201795650002901807650002101836650001001857650001501867650001501882650002301897650001801920650002501938650002101963650001301984651001201997700002102009700001802030773009002048856008102138852000902219655001202228IND60466735420221123020531.0151128e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046673542DNAL7 a10.1007/s13157-015-0696-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDingle Robertson, Laura10aAssessing Land Cover Change and Anthropogenic Disturbance in Wetlands Using Vegetation Fractions Derived from Landsat 5 TM Imagery (1984–2010)  ap. 1077-1091.  aAnthropogenic disturbance of wetlands in Canada is extensive. In wetland monitoring programs disturbance assessment often relies on single date field and geo-spatial data, thereby rendering detection of the nature, timing and magnitude of disturbance events and trends difficult. The Landsat temporal archive provides potential for more comprehensive temporal change analysis. However, its 30 m pixel size may result in omission of small disturbances or lack of spatial precision near boundaries where change often occurs. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) is a subpixel technique that has been used to assess change in a variety of land cover types, but rarely for non-coastal wetlands. This research utilized SMA vegetation, bare, and moisture fractions derived from 26 Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes from 1984 to 2010 in two-date comparisons and time series analysis to assess disturbance in two wetland complexes in eastern Ontario. The 1984–2010 two-date analysis showed overall declines in vegetation and moisture fractions and increases in the bare fraction, while time series analysis over the 26 year period showed more variable inter-annual changes including years of sudden change, cyclic trends and more gradual trends. Anthropogenic disturbances that were identified included a lake created for recreational purposes, logged/cultivated areas, and wetland degradation due to encroaching development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aanthropogenic activities 3acultivation area 3alakes 3aland cover 3amonitoring 3atemporal variation 3athematic maps 3atime series analysis 3avegetation types 3awetlands 3aOntario1 aKing, Douglas J.1 aDavies, Chris0 tWetlands.g2015 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.1077-1091dSpringer Netherlandsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-015-0696-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010700169300001600276520140800292592002801700650001701728650002201745650002201767650001801789650001601807650002101823650001201844650002101856653001601877653001101893653001401904653002401918653002001942700002201962700002101984773010102005856008602106852000902192655001202201IND60611916320221118073600.0200509e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061191632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2018.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWandee, Yuree10aYield and structural composition of pomelo peel pectins extracted under acidic and alkaline conditions  ap. 237-244.  aExtraction of pectin from pomelo peel was performed using water, acid and alkaline solutions with a microwave power of 1100 W for 2 min, and yield and structural/chemical characteristics of the extracted pectins were investigated. Extraction of pectin with water gave the lowest yield (6.5%, dry weight basis). The water-extracted pectin contained the highest amount of neutral sugar (29.5%), while equivalent molecular weight (MWeq) and degree of methylation (DM) were 43 kDa and 29.7%, respectively. Extraction of pectin with HCl solutions at concentrations of 25, 50, 100 and 200 mM resulted in a significant increase of pectin yields (12.1–20.5%) and pectins with high amount of galacturonic acid (83.3–85.6%). The MWeq and DM of the acid-extracted pectins ranged from 171 to 368 kDa and 53.9–82.5%, respectively. Compared to the acid, extraction with NaOH solutions at the same concentrations provided higher yields (13.9–24.2%), smaller size (142–187 kDa) and lower DM (<1.7%) pectins, while amount of galacturonic acid was comparable. The highest yield of extraction was found at a concentration of 50 mM for both HCl and NaOH solutions. Extraction of pomelo peel with 50 mM NaOH solution by reduction of the microwave power to 550 W and extending the extraction time to 15 min resulted in an increase of pectin yield (29.2%) and pectin with smaller size (76 kDa).  aPublisher supplied data 3acitrus peels 3agalacturonic acid 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrocolloids 3amethylation 3amolecular weight 3apectins 3asodium hydroxide 0aPomelo peel 0aPectin 0aStructure 0aAlkaline extraction 0aAcid extraction1 aUttapap, Dudsadee1 aMischnick, Petra0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2019 Feb., v. 87 p.237-244dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2018.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010900159300001600268500002000284520162500304592002801929650002301957650001501980650002701995650001802022650002302040650001602063650002202079650001502101650001402116650001602130700002502146700001702171700002202188700001902210700002102229773010802250856007502358852000902433655001202442IND60787217820221118143648.0220808e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078721782DNAL7 a10.1002/lipd.123162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHelamieh, Mark10aGrowth and fatty acid composition of Acutodesmus obliquus under different light spectra and temperatures  ap. 485-498.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe combined impact of temperature and light spectra on the fatty acid (FA) composition in microalgae has been sparsely investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the interactions of light and temperature on the FA composition in Acutodesmus obliquus. For this purpose, A. obliquus was cultivated with different temperatures (20, 30, and 35°C), as well as broad light spectra (blue, green, and red light). Growth and FA composition were monitored daily. Microalgal FA were extracted, and a qualitative characterization was done by gas chromatography coupled with electron impact ionization mass spectrometry (GC‐EI/MS). Compared to red light, green and blue light caused a higher percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) 16:4, 18:3, and 18:4, at all temperatures. The highest total percentage of these PUFA were observed at the lowest cultivation temperature and blue and green light. These data imply that a combination of lower temperatures and blue‐green light (450–550 nm) positively influences the activity of specific FA‐desaturases in A. obliquus. Additionally, a lower 16:1 trans/cis ratio was observed upon green and blue light treatment and lower cultivation temperatures. Remarkably, green light treatment resulted in a comparably high growth under all tested conditions. Therefore, a higher content of green light, compared to blue light might additionally lead to a higher biomass concentration. Microalgae cultivation with low temperatures and green light might therefore result in a suitable FA composition for the food industry and a comparably high biomass production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3ablue light 3afatty acid composition 3afood industry 3agas chromatography 3agreen light 3amass spectrometry 3amicroalgae 3ared light 3atemperature1 aGebhardt, Annkathrin1 aReich, Marco1 aKuhn, Friedericke1 aKerner, Martin1 aKümmerer, Klaus0 tLipids.g2021 Sept., v. 56, no. 5 p.485-498dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl46279x0024-42017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lipd.123163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245012400175300001400299520152500313592002801838650002101866650001501887650002601902650001301928650001901941650001701960650001001977650001501987650001002002650001102012650001802023650001902041650001802060650001502078650000902093650001702102650002102119650001702140650001702157651001002174653002102184653003102205653003502236653001702271700001202288700001202300700001802312700001302330773012902343856009002472852000902562655001202571IND60541127920221121024102.0190318e20140918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054112792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Xiaobing10aDetection of qnr, aac(6′)-Ib-cr and qepA genes in Escherichia coli isolated from cooked meat products in Henan, China  ap. 22-25.  aAntimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli has increased in recent years in China. Antimicrobial resistant isolates and resistance genes of E. coli can be transferred to humans through the food chain and this presents a public health risk. However, few studies have investigated the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance-encoding genes in E. coli isolated from food samples in China. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of quinolone resistance genes (QRGs) and extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) in E. coli isolated from cooked meat products in Henan, China. A total of 75 E. coli isolates (12.1%) were detected from 620 samples. High rates of resistance to the following drugs were observed: tetracycline (56.0%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (41.3%), streptomycin (29.3%), ampicillin (26.7%) and nalidixic acid (14.7%). Of the 75 isolates, QRGs were present in 10 isolates (13.3%), with qnr and aac(6′)-Ib-cr detected alone or in combination in five (6.7%) and eight isolates (10.7%). The qnr genes detected in this study included qnrS (n=3) and qnrA (n=2). The qepA gene was absent among these isolates. Three types of β-lactamase genes were identified in the five ESBL-producing E. coli isolates: blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-9, and blaTEM-1. The qnrS gene was found to be co-transferred with blaCTX-M-1 and blaTEM-1 in one isolate. Our data suggest that cooked meat products may act as reservoirs for multi-resistant bacteria and facilitate the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abeta-lactamase 3acooked foods 3adrugs 3afood chain 3agenes 3ahumans 3ameat products 3analidixic acid 3apublic health 3aquinolones 3arisk 3astreptomycin 3asulfamethoxazole 3atetracycline 3atrimethoprim 3aChina 0aEscherichia coli 0aQuinolone resistance genes 0aExtended-spectrum β-lactamase 0aCooked meats1 aYu, Tao1 aWu, Nan1 aMeng, Hecheng1 aShi, Lei0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Sept. 18, v. 187 p.22-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005900149245010300208300001800311500001400329520166100343592002802004650001502032650001302047650001702060650001802077650002502095650001402120650001102134650002202145650002202167650002002189650001602209650001002225650001702235650001602252650001502268650002102283650002202304650002202326700002202348700007602370700002802446700005602474700006002530773011802590856008302708852000902791655001202800IND60710994120221117203135.0200915e20200820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071099412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.0c003122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTandrup, Tobias1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3448-701910aOligosaccharide Binding and Thermostability of Two Related AA9 Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases  ap. 3347-3358.  aNAL-light  aLytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper-dependent enzymes that cleave polysaccharide substrates oxidatively. First discovered because of their action on recalcitrant crystalline substrates (chitin and cellulose), a number of LPMOs are now reported to act on soluble substrates, including oligosaccharides. However, crystallographic complexes with oligosaccharides have been reported for only a single LPMO so far, an enzyme from the basidiomycete fungus Lentinus similis (LsAA9_A). Here we present a more detailed comparative study of LsAA9_A and an LPMO from the ascomycete fungus Collariella virescens (CvAA9_A) with which it shares 41.5% sequence identity. LsAA9_A is considerably more thermostable than CvAA9_A, and the structural basis for the difference has been investigated. We have compared the patterns of oligosaccharide cleavage and the patterns of binding in several new crystal structures explaining the basis for the product preferences of the two enzymes. Obtaining structural information about complexes of LPMOs with carbohydrates has proven to be very difficult in general judging from the structures reported in the literature thus far, and this can be attributed only partly to the low affinity for small substrates. We have thus evaluated the use of differential scanning fluorimetry as a guide to obtaining complex structures. Furthermore, an analysis of crystal packing of LPMOs and glycoside hydrolases corroborates the hypothesis that active site occlusion is a very significant problem for LPMO–substrate interaction analysis by crystallography, due to their relatively flat and extended substrate binding sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscomycota 3aLentinus 3aactive sites 3abinding sites 3acarbohydrate binding 3acellulose 3achitin 3acomparative study 3acrystal structure 3acrystallography 3afluorometry 3afungi 3aglycosidases 3ainformation 3aliterature 3aoligosaccharides 3asequence analysis 3athermal stability1 aTryfona, Theodora1 aFrandsen, Kristian Erik Høpfner1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7136-98201 aJohansen, Katja Salomon1 aDupree, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9270-62861 aLo Leggio, Leila1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5135-08820 tBiochemistry.g2020 Aug. 20, v. 59, no. 36 p.3347-3358dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c003123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01497naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012300157300001800280520038100298592002800679650001400707650002300721650001500744650002500759650001800784650001600802700001700818700001600835700001900851700001700870700001600887700001600903773013300919856007401052852000901126655001201135IND60644804820221122100011.0190522e20190521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064480482DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc02597a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Shu-Yi10aCrystallization-induced self-hollowing of molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles and their potential in sodium ion batteries  ap. 5894-5897.  aA self-hollowing process was demonstrated for the creation of hollow MoS₂ nanospheres starting from their amorphous solid precursor, which were spontaneously transformed into a hollow structure during the rearrangement of crystal lattices initiated by a high-temperature treatment, forming hollow-structured materials favorable for their application in sodium ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3achemical reactions 3amolybdenum 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananoparticles 3ananospheres1 aPiao, Jun-Yu1 aLin, Xi-Jie1 aSun, Yong-Gang1 aXu, Yan-Song1 aCao, An-Min1 aWan, Li-Jun0 tChemical communications.g2019 May 21, v. 55, no. 42 p.5894-5897dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc02597a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245009700191300001600288520162100304592002801925653002301953653002401976653001802000653002602018653001302044653002502057653001102082700002202093773011002115856011702225852000902342655001202351IND60127302820221120214118.0151110e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012730282DNAL7 a10.1653/0015-4040(2004)087[0324:MOAHFP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrinkman, Mark A.10aMortality of ant (hymenoptera: formicidae) pest species exposed to sodium hydrogen carbonate  ap. 324-329.  aLaboratory bioassays enabled us to determine the mortality of Argentine ant (Linepithema humile [[Mayr]]) workers, and red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) workers exposed to sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO₃, sodium bicarbonate). The median lethal concentration (LC₅₀) of NaHCO₃ for Argentine ants was 5.64 mg per cm² after 5 d exposure and 3.96 mg per cm² after 6 d. Cumulative mortality for Argentine ants exposed to 28 mg NaHCO₃ per cm² was 89.5%% on day 6. Workers of both species were exposed to concentrations of 9.92, 17.70, or 152.00 mg NaHCO₃ per cm² in separate tests. Mortality of Argentine ants was significantly higher than that of fire ants following exposure to 9.92 mg NaHCO₃ per cm², while mortality for the two species did not differ following exposure to the two higher concentrations. Mortality of both species treated with the highest concentration exceeded 99%% at 6 d. In tests with equivalent amounts of sodium in NaHCO₃ and NaCl treatments, mortality for fire ants exposed to NaHCO₃ was about 46%% after 6 d. Mortality for fire ants exposed to NaCl was about 15%% and was similar to that for untreated ants. Argentine ants were provided sugar water baits containing a range of NaHCO₃ concentrations. Argentine ant mortality after 6 d exposure to 5%% NaHCO₃-sugar water treatment was about 50%%. Mortality was not higher for workers exposed to higher concentrations of NaHCO₃ in sugar water baits. Enzymatic dysfunction caused by unfavorable increases in internal pH is the most likely explanation for worker mortality following exposure to NaHCO₃.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSodium bicarbonate 0abicarbonate of soda 0aArgentine ant 0ared imported fire ant 0apest ant 0alaboratory bioassays 0aGut pH1 aGardner, Wayne A.0 tFlorida entomologist.g2004 Sept., v. 87, no. 3 p.324-329dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653%2F0015-4040%282004%29087%5B0324%3AMOAHFP%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245011600192300001400308520153800322592002801860650001401888650001501902650001101917650001401928650002201942650002001964650001001984650001301994650002402007650001302031650002102044653001102065653002602076653003502102653002902137653001902166700002702185700002802212700004102240700002902281700002802310773010402338856008202442852000902524655001202533IND60517671320221121034625.0190801e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051767132DNAL7 a218675982pmid7 a10.1017/S09671994110005052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Clara Slade10aSupplementation with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A during in vitro culture of bovine embryos  ap. 59-63.  aTrichostatin A (TSA) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that induces histone hyperacetylation and increases gene expression levels. The aim of the present study was to establish a suitable condition for the use of TSA in in vitro cultures of bovine embryos, and to determine whether TSA would increase blastocyst rates by improvement of chromatin remodelling during embryonic genome activation and by increasing the expression of crucial genes during early development. To test this hypothesis, 8-cell embryos were exposed to four concentrations of TSA for different periods of time to establish adequate protocols. In a second experiment, three experimental groups were selected for the evaluation of embryo quality based on the following parameters: apoptosis, total cell number and blastocyst hatching. TSA promoted embryonic arrest and degeneration at concentrations of 15, 25 and 50 nM. All treated groups presented lower blastocyst rates. Exposure of embryos to 5 nM for 144 h and to 15 nM for 48 h decreased blastocyst hatching. However, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay (TUNEL) assay revealed similar apoptosis rates and total cell numbers in all groups studied. Although, in the present study, TSA treatment did not improve the parameters studied, the results provided background information on TSA supplementation during in vitro culture of bovine embryos and showed that embryo quality was apparently not affected, despite a decrease in blastocyst rate after exposure to TSA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3ablastocyst 3acattle 3achromatin 3aearly development 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahatching 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahistones 3ain vitro culture 0aCattle 0aEmbryonic development 0aHistone deacetylase inhibition 0aHistone hyperacetylation 0aTrichostatin A1 aSaraiva, Naiara Zoccal1 ade Souza, Marcela Maria1 ade Almeida Drummond Tetzner, Tatiane1 ade Lima, Marina Ragagnin1 aGarcia, Joaquim Mansano0 tZygote.g2013 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.59-63dCambridge University PresswJournal:6292x1469-87307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09671994110005053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245015500173300001600328500001500344520125000359592002801609650001601637650002201653650001401675650002301689650001901712650001701731650001401748650001201762651001201774653001401786700001901800773009201819856008301911852000901994655001202003IND60083037820221119120834.0141101e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008303782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2012.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell, Sara Gran10aEvolution of Scaphinotus petersi (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and the role of climate and geography in the Madrean sky islands of southeastern Arizona, USA  ap. 274-283.  a2019-12-06  aGeographically isolated environments such as the conifer forests atop the Madrean “sky islands” in southeastern Arizona provide natural laboratories for studying factors involved in speciation and origins of biodiversity. Using molecular and geospatial analyses, we examine beetle population phylogeny, regional climate records, and the Quaternary paleobiogeography of forests to evaluate four hypothetical scenarios regarding the current geographic and population genetic patterns of Scaphinotus petersi. Scaphinotus petersi is a large, flightless beetle that resides in the Madrean conifer forests above ~1900masl. Our results do not support the current hypothesis that S. petersi populations found on seven separate mountain ranges are genetically distinct and separated as temperatures warmed after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Rather, we show that only some of the ranges hold genetically distinct populations, and the timing of separation among the populations does not appear to coincide with specific climatic events such as warming trends. In addition, we show that predicted changes to the climate of the Madrean sky islands may result in the disappearance of S. petersi from some of the lower ranges by the end of this century.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3apaleobiogeography 3aphylogeny 3aconiferous forests 3aclimate change 3abiodiversity 3aCarabidae 3aclimate 3aArizona 0ageography1 aOber, Karen A.0 tQuaternary research.g2013 Mar., v. 79, no. 2 p.274-283dElsevier Inc.x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2012.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01586naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009500160300001600255520048100271592002800752650002000780650001400800650002300814650002300837650002300860650002100883650001200904650002700916650001400943650001300957650001100970700002100981700002301002773010301025856007501128852000901203655001201212IND60578650920221118221912.0170813e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057865092DNAL7 a10.1021/ol400138m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurhardt, Mia N.10aPd-Catalyzed Thiocarbonylation with Stoichiometric Carbon Monoxide: Scope and Applications  ap. 948-951.  aA general protocol for the Pd-catalyzed thiocarbonylation of aryl iodides with stoichiometric carbon monoxide has been established employing a catalytic system composed of Pd(OAc)₂ and DPEphos with low catalyst loading (1 mol %).

The effects of the amount of AC, adsorption time, and temperature on the purification of the UO were investigated using the apricot kernel shells due to the high apricot production of Turkey. The kinetic evaluation was also done. The percentage improvements (PIs) in total polar materials (TPM), free fatty acids (FFA), p‐anisidine value (p‐AV), conjugated diene content (CD), and color of UO were found as 100, 56, 92, 51, and 90% for the apricot kernel AC in the column treatment. The most effective other ACs in decreasing FFA, p‐AV, CD, and color were the horse chestnut (59%), chestnut (74%), chestnut (43%), and pistachio (72%), respectively. Consequently, these ACs can be used for the purification of UO. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Industrial wastes cause environmental pollution if they are ejected into river, sea, and soil. Therefore, they should be purified or treated for different purposes. In this study, the industrial wastes from the food and forest industries were used for the production of activated carbon to purify the used oil. The results showed that these activated carbons could be utilized for the regeneration of used oils. The most economical treatment is to blend the activated carbon with used frying oil for a certain time and remove it through centrifugation and filtration. The purified oil has the potential to be used in the biodiesel production.  aPublisher supplied data  a2010.09.01.338cAbant Izzet Baysal Üniversitesi 3aAesculus 3aCastanea 3aacorns 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aapricots 3abiodiesel 3acentrifugation 3acolor 3afiltration 3aforests 3ap-anisidine value 3apistachios 3arivers 3aseeds 3asoil 3atemperature 3awood1 aAkmil Başar, Canan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3574-07731 aOnal, Yunus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6342-68160 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.e16039-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.160393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245020100169300001400370520198900384592002802373650001902401650001702420650001802437650002002455650001302475650001102488650001802499650001302517650001502530650001402545650001702559650001802576651001302594700002102607700002002628700002702648700002202675773008402697856008502781852000902866655001202875IND60084478820221122053423.0141101e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008447882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2011.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGamito, Sofia14aThe importance of habitat-type for defining the reference conditions and the ecological quality status based on benthic invertebrates: The Ria Formosa coastal lagoon (Southern Portugal) case study  ap. 61-72.  aCoastal lagoons are complex systems, with considerable habitat heterogeneity and often subject to high temporal dynamics, which constitutes a great challenge for ecological assessment programs. For defining reference conditions for benthic invertebrates, under the EU Water Framework Directive objectives, historical data from the Ria Formosa leaky lagoon (wet surface area of about 105km²) located in Southern Portugal was used. The influence of habitat features, such as channel depth, sediment type and seagrass cover, on the expression of these biological communities, was inferred by analyzing subtidal data collected at stations with different environmental characteristics. Such heterogeneity effect was analyzed at the community compositional and structural levels, and also for three indices in the multimetric Benthic Assessment Tool (BAT). This tool for the assessment of ecological status includes the Margalef index, Shannon–Wiener diversity index, and AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI). Significant variations associated with environmental features were reflected on specific reference conditions at four habitats in the lagoon. After habitat calibration, the Benthic Assessment Tool (BAT) revealed that, in general and for the period of time covered by this historical data set, the status of the lagoon corresponded to a good ecological condition, which is mainly due to its high water renewal rate. Such classification is in accordance with the majority of studies at the lagoon. However, at punctual sites with human induced high water residence times, significantly lower BAT values were registered. Such community degradation can be associated with physical stress due to salinity increase and to a degradation of water quality, with occurrence of occasional dystrophic crisis, triggered by low water renewal. Habitat differentiation was a crucial step for a correct evaluation of the ecological condition of invertebrate communities across the lagoonal system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acase studies 3acoastal water 3adata collection 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ainvertebrates 3asalinity 3aseagrasses 3asediments 3asurface area 3awater quality 3aPortugal1 aPatrício, Joana1 aNeto, João M.,1 aMarques, João Carlos,1 aTeixeira, Heliana0 tEcological indicators.g2012 Aug., v. 19 p.61-72dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2011.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03695naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245018100165300001600346520165100362536031802013592002802331596001902359596003302378650002202411650002402433650001902457650002002476650002602496650001902522650002402541650002102565650000902586650001202595650002102607653002202628653002202650653001802672653001802690653003002708653002002738653003402758700001502792700001302807700001402820700002002834700001502854700001802869700001802887700001502905773011402920856008603034852000903120655001203129IND60733480320221117234704.0220827e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073348032DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2020.18187902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xin10aUHPLC-MS/MS method for pharmacokinetic and bioavailability determination of five bioactive components in raw and various processed products of Polygala tenuifolia in rat plasma  ap. 969-978.  aSibiricose A5 (A5), sibiricose A6 (A6), 3,6′-disinapoyl sucrose (DSS), tenuifoliside A (TFSA) and 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid (TMCA) are the main active components of Polygala tenuifolia Willd. (Polygalaceae) (PT) that are active against Alzheimer's disease. To compare the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of five active components in the roots of raw PT (RPT), liquorice-boiled PT (LPT) and honey-stir-baked PT (HPT). The median lethal dose (LD₅₀) was evaluated through acute toxicity test. The pharmacokinetics of five components after oral administration of extracts of RPT, LPT, HPT (all equivalent to 1.9 g/kg of RPT extract for one dose) and 0.5% CMC-Na solution (control group) were investigated, respectively, in Sprague-Dawley rats (four groups, n = 6) using UHPLC-MS/MS. In addition, the absolute bioavailability of A5, A6, DSS, TFSA and TMCA after oral administration (7.40, 11.60, 16.00, 50.00 and 3.11 mg/kg, respectively) and intravenous injection (1/10 of the corresponding oral dose) in rats (n = 6) was studied. The LD₅₀ of RPT, LPT and HPT was 7.79, 14.55 and 15.99 g/kg, respectively. AUC ₀₋ ₜ of RPT, LPT and HPT were as follows: A5 (433.18 ± 65.48, 680.40 ± 89.21, 552.02 ± 31.10 ng h/mL), A6 (314.55 ± 62.73, 545.76 ± 123.16, 570.06 ± 178.93 ng h/mL) and DSS (100.30 ± 62.44, 232.00 ± 66.08, 197.58 ± 57.37 ng h/mL). The absolute bioavailability of A5, A6, DSS, TFSA and TMCA was 3.25, 2.95, 2.36, 1.17 and 42.91%, respectively. The pharmacokinetic and bioavailability parameters of each compound can facilitate future clinical studies.  aThis work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [Grant No. 2018YFC1707204] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 81573606, No. 81973486, No. 81373968].

It does not, however, imply that all increases in the money supply are inflationary. This letter explores and illustrates this issue by comparing the inflationary consequences of the same base expansion in the US following the collapse of Lehman Brothers with Germany’s hyperinflation experience after WWI. A key factor explaining the vastly different inflation experiences between those two episodes is how the monetary expansion translated into demand. The Fed’s base expansion did not translate into demand for goods and services since most of it was absorbed by a huge increase in demand for liquidity by financial institutions. By contrast, the German monetary expansion was immediately translated into demand for goods and services since it was motivated by government’s hunger for seigniorage revenues.  aPublisher supplied data 3afinancial institutions 3aincome 3ainflation 3aissues and policy 3apublic services and goods 3aGermany 3aUnited States 0aE3 0aE4 0aE5 0aE6 0aInflation 0aMoney 0aUS deflation 0aGerman hyperinflation0 tEconomics letters.g2017 May, v. 154 p.109-112dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2017.02.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03695naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245012000200300001600320500002000336506007600356520180900432592002802241596008202269596005202351506003702403650002702440650001902467650001702486650002502503650001302528650002002541650002102561650001802582650001002600650001602610650003702626650001302663650001702676650001802693650001402711650002202725650001402747650001602761650002102777700002102798700002202819700001202841700005702853773012502910856007303035852000903108655001203117IND60685789020221207131321.0200307e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068578902DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.129072doi7 aPMC70601402pmcid7 a319975442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tu‐Hong12aA proper PiCAT2 level is critical for sporulation, sporangium function, and pathogenicity of Phytophthora infestans  ap. 460-474.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCatalase is present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and is important for the protective effects of the antioxidant system against free radicals. Many studies have confirmed that catalase is required for the growth, development, and pathogenesis of bacteria, plants, animals, and fungi. However, there has been relatively little research on the catalases in oomycetes, which form an important group of fungus‐like eukaryotes that produce zoosporangia. In this study, we detected two Phytophthora infestans genes encoding catalases, but only PiCAT2 exhibited catalase activity in the sporulation stage and was highly produced during asexual reproduction and in the late infection stage. Compared with the wild‐type strain, the PiCAT2‐silenced P. infestans transformants were more sensitive to abiotic stress, were less pathogenic, and had a lower colony expansion rate and lower PiMPK7, PiVPS1, and PiGPG1 expression levels. In contrast, the PiCAT2‐overexpressed transformants were slightly less sensitive to abiotic stress. Interestingly, increasing and decreasing PiCAT2 expression from the normal level inhibited sporulation, germination, and infectivity, and down‐regulated PiCdc14 expression, but up‐regulated PiSDA1 expression. These results suggest that PiCAT2 is required for P. infestans mycelial growth, asexual reproduction, abiotic stress tolerance, and pathogenicity. However, a proper PiCAT2 level is critical for the formation and normal function of sporangia. Furthermore, PiCAT2 affects P. infestans sporangial formation and function, pathogenicity, and abiotic stress tolerance by regulating the expression of cell cycle‐related genes (PiCdc14 and PiSDA1) and MAPK pathway genes. Our findings provide new insights into catalase functions in eukaryotic pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data  a201303018cSpecial Fund for Agro‐Scientific Research in the Public Interest  a2017ZB001cChinese Universities Scientific Fund0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aabiotic stress 3aantioxidants 3aasexual reproduction 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3aeukaryotic cells 3afree radicals 3agenes 3agermination 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amycelium 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aprotective effect 3asporangia 3asporulation 3astress tolerance1 aWang, Xiao‐Wen1 aZhu, Xiao‐Qiong1 aHe, Qun1 aGuo, Li‐Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1688-57260 tMolecular plant pathology.g2020 Apr., v. 21, no. 4 p.460-474dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60298x1464-67227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.129073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013400164300001600298520196800314592002802282650002502310650001102335650001902346650002902365650001302394650001502407650002202422650001302444650001302457650001702470651001002487653002202497653001002519653003002529773009102559856008402650852000902734655001202743IND60125821620221118044346.0150803e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012582162DNAL7 a10.1080/14693062.2014.9262632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Wei10aChinese business at the dawn of its domestic emissions trading scheme: incentives and barriers to participation in carbon trading  ap. 339-354.  aThis article explores the incentives and challenges for Chinese business companies in participating in carbon emissions trading schemes (ETSs). Based on extensive interviews with the business managers and government officers who are currently involved in the ongoing policy experiments of pilot ETS programmes across China, the article identifies factors that either motivate or discourage companies in participating in carbon trading activities. It argues that different business groups, i.e. capped enterprises, uncapped enterprises, and carbon intermediaries, are affected by these factors to significantly different extents in terms of formulating their specific carbon strategies. It also illustrates some factors, such as a lack of stakeholder pressure and fragmented political interests, which have a distinctive Chinese character and are believed will have a fundamental impact on the quality and efficiency of Chinese ETSs in the future. Policy relevance At the outset, the successful implementation of any ETS depends critically on the active involvement of business actors across various industries. Hence, having an understanding of the business incentives and obstacles in participating in carbon trading is crucial, as these factors will ultimately determine the size and quality of the carbon market, and the total volume and integrity of the GHG emissions to be traded. This article also illustrates the common factors that affect business appetite for carbon trading throughout the world, as well as the factors that are unique to the Chinese political and economic context to constrain business in the market. Finally, a presentation of the business attitude towards the ETS experiment indicates the most worrying aspects of the policy design regarding carbon trading in China. As the construction and implementation of the ETS is a long-term undertaking, such investigation deserves attention from both policy makers and business leaders alike.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aindustry 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3amanagers 3apolitics 3astakeholders 3aChina 0abusiness strategy 0aChina 0aemissions trading schemes0 tClimate Policy.g2015 May 4, v. 15, no. 3 p.339-354dTaylor & Francisx1752-74577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2014.9262633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014200158300001800300500001400318520087300332592002801205650003601233650001301269650001901282650002501301650002101326650001301347650003101360650001601391650003701407650004801444650001801492650003601510653003501546653003901581653001901620653003801639700002001677700002101697700001501718700002001733700002001753700002001773773018601793856007401979852000902053655001202062IND60692194820221122064254.0200502e20120923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069219482DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1203472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSASAI, Yosuke10aAdvanced Glycation Endproducts Stimulate Renal Epithelial Cells to Release Chemokines That Recruit Macrophages, Leading to Renal Fibrosis  ap. 1741-1745.  aNAL-light  aDiabetic nephropathy is a major complication of diabetes and tubulointerstitial fibrosis is one of its manifestations.

The AGE-exposed cells significantly increased gene expression of transforming growth factor beta, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and tissue transglutaminase, and a medium conditioned by them showed strong potential to recruit macrophages, partly through a chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Albumin denatured by maintenance at 37 °C for 120 d exhibited similar activities, but they were lower than those of the AGEs. Thus, AGEs generated in diabetic patients might exacerbate fibrosis in the kidneys directly through renal epithelial cell stimulation, and indirectly by recruitment of macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aalbumins 3achemokine CCL2 3adiabetic nephropathy 3aepithelial cells 3afibrosis 3agene expression regulation 3amacrophages 3aplasminogen activator inhibitors 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3arenal tubules 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aadvanced glycation endproducts 0amonocyte chemoattractant protein-1 0arenal fibrosis 0aplasminogen activator inhibitor-11 aIWAKAWA, Kousei1 aYANAGIDA, Kanako1 aShen, Yan,1 aHOSONO, Takashi1 aARIGA, Toyohiko1 aSEKI, Taiichiro0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2012 Sept. 23, v. 76, no. 9 p.1741-1745dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.1203473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015000157500002000307520178500327592002802112596002402140650001502164650000902179650001102188650002202199650002002221650001902241650001102260650001302271650001302284650001102297650001802308650001402326650001102340650002302351650002402374650001002398700005802408773014402466856007402610852000902684655001202693IND60759844720221120133408.0211214e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075984472DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.160342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ruiyan10aNumerical study of large particles flowing in non‐Newtonian fluids with nearly neutral buoyancy force [Erratum: August 2022, v.46(8), p.e16965]  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present work investigates the flow of sauce and food particles in food processing by adopting the Eulerian–Lagrangian approach. To account for the large size of the food particles, subroutines were developed to simulate the particle‐wall collision and calculate the pressure gradient force. It was found that the particle‐wall collision reduces the average and standard deviation of particle residence time. The standard deviation increases as the Stokes number increases. A critical Stokes number of around 2 is identified where the standard deviation increases dramatically. For a constant Stokes number, as the particle size increases, the standard deviation first increases and then decreases. Furthermore, it was found that the inclusion of the pressure gradient force reduces the average and standard deviation of particle residence time. The effects of this force increase as the particle size increases. These results reveal the nonlinear nature of the interactions between the flow and particles. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In food processing applications, a mixture of sauce and food particles is to be dispensed onto the meal tray. To ensure even reheating of the packaged food before serving, it is desired that the food particles should be uniformly distributed on the meal tray. Therefore, understanding the particle residence time distribution inside the dispenser is crucial to the design of the dispensing system. Through numerical investigation, the present work investigates the transport of food particles inside a sauce dispenser. The sauce is modeled as a non‐Newtonian fluid. The results reveal the nonlinear nature of the interactions between the flow and particles. Based on these findings, better design of the dispensing system can be achieved.  aPublisher supplied data  cConAgra Foods, Inc. 3adispensers 3aflow 3afluids 3afood preservation 3afood processing 3afood transport 3aforces 3ajournals 3amixtures 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aparticles 3asauces 3astandard deviation 3asystems engineering 3atrays1 aZhang, Zhaoyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9830-27060 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.e16034-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.160343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007600162300001800238500002000256520149200276592002801768596005401796650002301850650002001873650001101893650001501904650001801919650001401937650000901951650002301960650002501983650001302008650002402021700002402045700001702069700003502086700002602121700002902147773013202176856007502308852000902383655001202392IND60787155120221120101337.0220807e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078715512DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.216882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIhwagi, Festus W.10aPoaching lowers elephant path tortuosity: implications for conservation  ap. 1022-1031.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPoaching is the most immediate threat to African elephants (Loxodonta africana). Several continental‐wide surges in poaching have occurred since the latter half of the twentieth century, and the latest surge occurred from 2007 to 2012. The behavioral responses of elephants to poaching risk has not been studied widely because of a lack of high‐resolution movement data collected simultaneously with verified causes of mortality. We managed to collate 2 such datasets from 2004 to 2013. We studied the spatial‐temporal changes in movement behavior of 11 elephants in their core areas. Past studies have focused on elephant movement along corridors. We tested for the effect of poaching risk on their path straightness (i.e., tortuosity) while controlling for other environmental and human activities in the landscape using a set of generalized linear mixed models. To test for temporal variation of tortuosity, we used a time‐series linear model. Elephants turned less frequently while they were in poaching locations and at times with a high level of poaching activity, even though their speed did not change. The variation of tortuosity is a good indicator of differences in poaching risk as perceived by the elephants, which could complement patrol‐based anti‐poaching efforts by wildlife managers, especially in remote, inaccessible landscapes. © 2019 The Authors.

A clear insight into its extent and rate is, therefore, a crucial step for effective land use planning and decision making. The main objective of this study was to analyse the nature of LULC change and its impacts in north‐western highland Ethiopia over the last four decades, using the integrated approach of remote sensing and geographic information system in combination with field data. Multidate Landsat images were used for spatio‐temporal change detection through the help of ArcGIS 10.3 and ERDAS IMAGINE 2014 software. A pixel‐based statistical analysis was used to measure class‐to‐class changes and total losses and gains of each LULC class during the study period. The results show that a significant and widespread change of LULC has occurred in the study area during the period 1973–2016. The cropland, grassland, and shrubland were the dominant LULC types taking more than 95% in total over the entire study period. The cropland and built‐up land showed a significant increase from 1973 to 2016, whereas grassland and shrubland decreased gradually over the same time period. The LULC change in the study area has caused severe environmental degradation, which in turn has affected ecological sustainability, agricultural productivity, food security, and rural livelihoods. The results of this study are expected to provide local‐level current information on the extent, rate, and impacts of LULC change for decision makers seeking to ensure ecological, social, and economic sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data  cIndian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) 3aLandsat 3aagricultural productivity 3acomputer software 3acropland 3adecision making 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenvironmental degradation 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afood security 3ageographic information systems 3agrasslands 3aland use and land cover maps 3aland use planning 3alivelihood 3aremote sensing 3ashrublands 3astatistical analysis 3awatersheds 3aEthiopia1 aBhat, Hejamady Gangadhara0 tLand degradation & development.g2018 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.3317-3330dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.30913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245015300196500002000349520207600369592002802445596005302473650002502526650002702551650001302578650001702591650001002608650002002618650000902638650001102647650001302658650002802671650001102699650002102710650001902731650002502750650001302775650001002788650001202798700003502810700001702845700006602862700001802928700002802946773014402974856007503118852000903193655001203202IND60759844820221120123036.0211214e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075984482DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.159772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Jasim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6483-434410aEffect of high‐pressure treatment and refrigerated storage on the amino acid profile, color, and texture of hammour (Epinephelus coioides) fillets  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this study was to assess the quality parameters of hammour (Epinephelus coioides) fillets subjected to a high‐pressure (HP) treatment at 375 MPa for 20 min followed by refrigerated storage for 30 days. The optimum pressure/time was selected based on the complete inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes. Treated samples were analyzed by amino acid profile, visual color, microstructure, and texture profile analysis. Lysine and glycine were the predominating essential and non‐essential amino acids in hammour fillets. The total amino acids did not change by the HP‐treatment, whereas the free amino acids decreased markedly from 4.35 to 2.43 mmol/g. The color of fillets changed significantly with the pressurization and storage in particular, a* and b* values. Hardness, compressibility, and adhesiveness increased after the HP‐treatment. FTIR results indicated a shift in the amide II band after the HP‐treatment and storage due to high‐pressure‐assisted protein denaturation. A porous structure was identified in the HP‐treated microstructure of the fillet. The results indicated that HP‐treatment could be successfully applied to hammour fillets for reduction of microbial growth with minor changes in quality. INDUSTRIAL RELEVANCE: In recent days, the acceptability of high‐pressure (HP) processing in the seafood industries is growing significantly. Hammour has a huge demand in the Middle Eastern countries for its exotic flavor and taste. An optimum pressure/time combination could maintain the desired flavor and safety of the fish fillets. Storage of high‐pressure‐treated fillets, however, showed a decrease of the PUFA content significantly that needs to be further addressed. The obtained results could help the fish processing and service industries to boost the economy by providing pressurized hammour fillets. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: High‐pressure treatment retained the total amino acid contents and texture of hammour fish fillets. Retention of visual color/pigment remains the challenge of the process.  aPublisher supplied data  aFB117KcKuwait Institute for Scientific Research 3aEpinephelus coioides 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aadhesion 3acold storage 3acolor 3acompressibility 3afish 3aflavor 3ahardness 3ahigh pressure treatment 3alysine 3amicrobial growth 3amicrostructure 3aprotein denaturation 3aseafoods 3ataste 3atexture1 aHabeebullah, Sabeena Farvin K.1 aThomas, Linu1 aMulla, Mehrajfatema Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9009-04061 aJacob, Harsha1 aAlagarsamy, Surendraraj0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.e15977-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.159773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007300167300001600240520241300256592002802669650001902697650002902716650001502745650002202760650001102782651001702793653001502810653002402825653003202849653001502881653002102896653002302917653001802940700001802958773009102976856008403067852000903151655001203160IND60125821820221118044453.0150803e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012582182DNAL7 a10.1080/14693062.2014.9373822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTyler, Emily10aCombining price and quantity instruments: insights from South Africa  ap. 374-387.  aA carbon tax will form the central carbon pricing instrument in South Africa. The country, however, is also in the process of setting specific short-term emissions limits at a subnational level. Additional mitigation policy instruments will thus be required to meet these targets. Although it is possible to combine sector-level quantity targets with a broad-based carbon tax, this article finds that this greatly complicates mitigation policy design, increasing both the information requirements and the likelihood of unintended consequences. The trade-offs between economic efficiency (optimized by the use of a broad-based price set by a carbon tax) and environmental effectiveness (optimized by using instruments that ensure emissions reduction targets are met) are ever present. A clear understanding of subnational quantity targets and an appreciation of the characteristics of the instruments to achieve such targets (quantity-based instruments, QBIs), the framework through which the instruments are combined, and their possible interactions, are required for effective policy making. Three possible frameworks for combining instruments are identified in the article, and some specific implications of interaction between particular QBIs and a carbon tax are suggested. Policy relevance This article explores the interaction of a carbon tax with mitigation policy instruments to meet subnational emissions targets in the South African context (where both a carbon tax and subnational emissions targets are currently being developed). As international negotiations progress towards countries accepting binding GHG emissions restrictions, quantity-based mitigation policy approaches become more important. In countries where a broad-based emissions trading scheme (ETS) is not feasible in the short to medium term, combining a broad-based carbon tax with subnational emission targets provides an alternative mechanism for achieving the economic efficiency and emissions certainty benefits derived from an ETS. This paper considers the mechanisms through which such a combination of instruments can be achieved. Three possible frameworks for combining instruments are identified, some specific implications of interaction between particular QBIs and a carbon tax are suggested, and guidelines and concept tools are presented to assist policy-makers in designing efficient and coherent mitigation policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon markets 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aguidelines 3aissues and policy 3aprices 3aSouth Africa 0acarbon tax 0aeconomic efficiency 0aenvironmental effectiveness 0amitigation 0apolicy formation 0apolicy instruments 0aSouth African1 aCloete, Brent0 tClimate Policy.g2015 May 4, v. 15, no. 3 p.374-387dTaylor & Francisx1752-74577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2014.9373823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007600169300001600245520152800261536015401789592002801943596001201971596001301983650002101996650002002017650003102037650001502068650002402083650001002107650001702117650002002134650002102154650002802175650001702203653003002220653002302250653002802273653001402301700001302315700001602328700001602344700001802360700001502378700001702393700001702410700001302427773011402440856008602554852000902640655001202649IND60733480620221117234647.0220827e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073348062DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2020.18187932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhiqin10aPharmacology, toxicity and pharmacokinetics of acetylshikonin: a review  ap. 950-958.  aAcetylshikonin, a naphthoquinone derivative, is mainly extracted from some species of the family Boraginaceae, such as Lithospermum erythrorhizon Sieb. et Zucc., Arnebia euchroma (Royle) Johnst., and Arnebia guttata Bunge. As a bioactive compound, acetylshikonin has attracted much attention because of its broad pharmacological properties. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the pharmacology, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of acetylshikonin focussing on its mechanisms on the basis of currently available literature. The information of acetylshikonin from 1977 to 2020 was collected using major databases including Elsevier, Scholar, PubMed, Springer, Web of Science, and CNKI. Acetylshikonin, pharmacology, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and naphthoquinone derivative were used as key words. According to emerging evidence, acetylshikonin exerts a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, lipid-regulatory, antidiabetic, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidative, neuroprotective, and antiviral properties. However, only a few studies have reported the adverse effects of acetylshikonin, with respect to reproductive toxicity and genotoxicity. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate that acetylshikonin is associated with a wide distribution and poor absorption. Although experimental data supports the beneficial effects of this compound, acetylshikonin cannot be considered as a therapy drug without further investigations, especially, on the toxicity and pharmacokinetics.  aThis work was financially supported by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation [7194289], the National Natural Science Foundation of China [81703715].  aPublisher supplied data  a7194289  a81703715 3aArnebia euchroma 3aArnebia guttata 3aLithospermum erythrorhizon 3aabsorption 3abioactive compounds 3adrugs 3agenotoxicity 3anaphthoquinones 3apharmacokinetics 3areproductive toxicology 3atherapeutics 0aNaphthoquinone derivative 0abioactive compound 0apharmacological effects 0amechanism1 aBai, Jie1 aZeng, Yawen1 aCai, Mengru1 aLin, Wanjing,1 aWu, Huimin1 aYou, Longtai1 aDong, Xiaoxv1 aNi, Jian0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 58, no. 1 p.950-958dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2020.18187933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100007000146245010000216300002000316520119600336592002801532650001001560650003001570650000901600650001301609650001101622650001301633650001301646650001701659700006201676700001901738700002301757700006201780700002201842700006301864700001801927700005801945700006002003700006402063700006202127700006702189700006502256773013802321856008002459852000902539655001202548IND60606178320180918000000.0180724e20180619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060617832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b037482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarbonell-Sanromà, Eduard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4548-158710aElectronic Properties of Substitutionally Boron-Doped Graphene Nanoribbons on a Au(111) Surface  ap. 16092-16099.  aHigh-quality graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) grown by on-surface synthesis strategies with atomic precision can be controllably doped by inserting heteroatoms or chemical groups in the molecular precursors. Here, we study the electronic structure of armchair GNRs substitutionally doped with di-boron moieties at the center, through a combination of scanning tunneling spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoemission, and density functional theory simulations. Boron atoms appear with a small displacement toward the surface, signaling their stronger interactions with the metal. We find two boron-rich flat bands emerging as impurity states inside the GNR band gap, one of them particularly broadened after its hybridization with the gold surface states. In addition, the boron atoms shift the conduction and valence bands of the pristine GNR away from the gap edge and leave unaffected the bands above and below, which become the new frontier bands and have a negligible boron character. This is due to the selective mixing of boron states with GNR bands according to their symmetry. Our results depict that the GNR band structure can be tuned by modifying the separation between di-boron moieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3adensity functional theory 3agold 3agraphene 3amixing 3amoieties 3ananogold 3aspectroscopy1 aGarcia-Lekue, Aran1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5556-08981 aCorso, Martina1 aVasseur, Guillaume1 aBrandimarte, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8762-58761 aLobo-Checa, Jorge1 ade Oteyza, Dimas G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8060-68191 aLi, Jingcheng1 aKawai, Shigeki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2128-01201 aSaitō, Shōhei,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1863-99561 aYamaguchi, Shigehiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0072-89691 aOrtega, J.

Fish was considered a key-element in this context and several fish-based multi-metric indices have been proposed. In this study, we propose a multi-metric index, the Estuarine Fish Assessment Index (EFAI), developed for Portuguese estuaries, designed for the overall assessment of transitional waters, which could also be applied at the water body level within an estuary. The EFAI integrates seven metrics: species richness, percentage of marine migrants, number of species and abundance of estuarine resident species, number of species and abundance of piscivorous species, status of diadromous species, status of introduced species and status of disturbance sensitive species. Fish sampling surveys were conducted in 2006, 2009 and 2010, using beam trawl, in 13 estuarine systems along the Portuguese coast. Most of the metrics presented a high variability among the transitional systems surveyed. According to the EFAI values, Portuguese estuaries presented a “Good” water quality status (except the Douro in a particular year). The assessments in different years were generally concordant, with a few exceptions. The relationship between the EFAI and the Anthropogenic Pressure Index (API) was not significant, but a negative and significant correlation was registered between the EFAI and the expert judgement pressure index, at both estuary and water body level. The ordination analysis performed to evaluate similarities among North-East Atlantic Geographical Intercalibration Group (NEAGIG) fish-based indices put in evidence four main groups: the French index, since it is substantially different from all the other indices (uses only four metrics based on densities); indices from Ireland, United Kingdom and Spain (Astúrias and Cantábria); the Dutch and German indices; and the indices of Belgium, Portugal and Spain (Basque country). The need for detailed studies, including comparative approaches, on several aspects of these assessment tools, especially in what regards their response to anthropogenic pressures was stressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrackish water 3acoasts 3adiadromous fish 3aestuaries 3aestuarine fish 3aintroduced species 3aordination techniques 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3awater quality 3aBelgium 3aIreland 3aPortugal 3aSpain 3aUnited Kingdom1 aFonseca, V.F.1 aGamito, R.1 aGonçalves, C.I.1 aCosta, J.L.1 aErzini, K.1 aGonçalves, J.1 aMartins, J.1 aLeite, L.1 aAndrade, J.P.1 aRamos, S.1 aBordalo, A.1 aAmorim, E.1 aNeto, J.M.1 aMarques, J.C.1 aRebelo, J.E.1 aSilva, C.1 aCastro, N.1 aAlmeida, P.R.1 aDomingos, I.1 aGordo, L.S.1 aCosta, M.J.0 tEcological indicators.g2012 Aug., v. 19 p.144-153dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2011.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03920naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007400139245006400213300001600277500001900293500002000312520233300332592002802665596007302693596007402766596004702840650001702887650001902904650001202923650001502935650003002950650002302980650000903003650002303012651002203035651002503057700002503082700002503107700003003132700003003162700002703192700002203219773012703241856007303368852000903441655001203450IND60727995520221119213335.0210215e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072799552DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.132072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez‐Navarro, Maria Angeles1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5553-995X10aTemporal variability is key to modelling the climatic niche  ap. 473-484.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Niche‐based species distribution models (SDMs) have become a ubiquitous tool in ecology and biogeography. These models relate species occurrences with the environmental conditions found at these sites. Climatic variables are the most commonly used environmental data and are usually included in SDMs as averages of a reference period (30–50 years). In this study, we analyse the impact of including inter‐annual climatic variability on the estimation of species niches and predicted distributions when assessing plant demographic response to extreme climatic episodes. LOCATION: Mediterranean basin, SE Iberian Peninsula. METHODS: We first characterized species niches with inter‐annual and average climate in the same environmental space. We then compare the respective capacities of climatic suitability obtained from averaged climate‐based and from inter‐annual variability‐based niches to explain population demographic responses to extreme drought. Furthermore, we assessed the relative increase in niche size when including climatic variability for a set of Mediterranean species exhibiting a wide range of distribution areas. RESULTS: We found that climatic suitability obtained from inter‐annual variability‐based niches showed higher explanatory capacity than average climate‐based suitability, especially for populations living in climatically marginal conditions, although both niches quantifications significantly explained species demographic responses. In addition, species with restricted distribution ranges increased relatively more their niche space when considering climatic variability, probably because in widely distributed species spatial variability compensates for temporal variability. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The common use of climatic averages when characterizing species niches could lead to underestimations of species distribution and misunderstanding of demographic behaviour, with implications for conservation plans derived from SDMs, for example, overestimations of species extinction risk under climate change, or underestimations of alien species invasion’ risk. We highlight that including climatic variability in niche modelling can be particularly important when dealing with species with restricted distribution and populations at the margin of their species niche.  aPublisher supplied data  aCGL2015‐67419‐RcSpanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness  a2017 SGR 1001cAgència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca  aFPU14/03519cSpanish Ministry of Education 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aextinction 3ageographical distribution 3aintroduced species 3arisk 3atemporal variation 3aIberian Peninsula 3aMediterranean region1 aBroennimann, Olivier1 aEsteve, Miguel Angel1 aMoya‐Perez, Juan Miguel1 aCarreño, Maria Francisca1 aGuisan, A.q(Antoine),1 aLloret, Francisco0 tDiversity & distributions.g2021 Mar., v. 27, no. 3 p.473-484dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.132073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01793naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009400157300001600251500001100267520076200278592002801040596005801068596003201126650001501158650001301173650001401186650002001200700005101220773012501271856007401396852000901470655001201479IND60777143220221119052753.0220514e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077714322DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.131952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaoxiao10aMolecular insights into the biochemical functions and signalling mechanisms of plant NLRs  ap. 772-780.  aREVIEW  aPlant intracellular immune receptors known as NLR (nucleotide‐binding leucine‐rich repeat) proteins confer immunity and cause cell death. Plant NLR proteins that directly or indirectly recognize pathogen effector proteins to initiate immune signalling are regarded as sensor NLRs. Some NLR protein families function downstream of sensor NLRs to transduce immune signalling and are known as helper NLRs. Recent breakthrough studies on plant NLR protein structures and biochemical functions greatly advanced our understanding of NLR biology. Comprehensive and detailed knowledge on NLR biology requires future efforts to solve more NLR protein structures and investigate the signalling events between sensor and helper NLRs, and downstream of helper NLRs.  aPublisher supplied data  aE14CA81cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cChinese Academy of Sciences 3acell death 3aimmunity 3apathogens 3aplant pathology1 aWan, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0839-37480 tMolecular plant pathology.g2022 June, v. 23, no. 6 p.772-780dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60298x1464-67227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.131953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015600167300001600323520168700339592002802026650002902054650002602083650002502109650001402134650000902148650001602157650002402173650001102197650001402208650001502222650002202237650001802259700001802277700001402295700001502309700001802324700002102342700001702363700001602380773008602396856008502482852000902567655001202576IND60084479720221122061747.0141101e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008447972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2011.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, J.L.10aIs parasitism in fish a good metric to assess ecological water quality in transitional waters? What can be learned from two estuarine resident species?  ap. 154-160.  aFish-based indices are becoming important bioassessment tools for estuaries since the European Water Framework Directive included fish as a biological quality element to be monitored for the assessment of ecological status of those systems. In particular, data on species composition and abundance of the ichthyofauna must be used to evaluate the ecological status of European estuaries, but other factors like measures of fish health are also considered important metrics. These indicators of fish health include infections by parasites. The common goby, Pomastoschistus microps, and the Lusitanian toadfish, Halobatrachus didactylus, are fairly sedentary fish, very abundant in Portuguese estuaries, and were used to investigate if parasitism in fishes in transitional waters is a good metric to reflect anthropogenic impacts in the environment. No significant relationships were observed between the parasite levels in these two species and the intensity of human pressures, either at a large or small spatial scale. Results obtained also are contrary to the generalized idea that a higher proportion of parasitized fish necessarily reflects a decrease in their condition as a result of habitat degradation. A high degree of temporal and ontogenetic variability in the parasite levels of both P. microps and H. didactylus was detected, which make it difficult to establish the scores for this hypothetical metric even if significant relationships between parasite levels and human pressures are identified in the future. Therefore, the present work does not uphold the hypothesis that parasitism in fish is a good metric to assess ecological water quality in transitional waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiological assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aestuaries 3afish 3afish health 3ahabitat destruction 3ahumans 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3aspecies diversity 3awater quality1 aMarques, J.F.1 aAlves, J.1 aGamito, R.1 aFonseca, V.F.1 aGonçalves, C.I.1 aCabral, H.N.1 aCosta, M.J.0 tEcological indicators.g2012 Aug., v. 19 p.154-160dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2011.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01289naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245004700170300001400217520023700231592002800468650001400496650001600510653000800526653000800534653000800542653000800550653000800558653000800566653001600574653001800590653001700608653002600625653001700651700001800668700001500686773009600701856008500797852000900882655001200891IND60609986220221123023013.0180824e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060998622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2017.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIm, Hyun Joong10aUncertainty and the value of cash holdings  ap. 43-48.  aWe find that a firm facing higher uncertainty has a higher value of cash.

Here, we report that Cardinium and Wolbachia coinfection induced male‐killing and cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) when they coexisted in a cryptic species of whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Asia II7. Cardinium and Wolbachia symbionts were either singly or simultaneously localized in the bacteriocytes placed in the abdomen of B. tabaci nymphs and adults. Cardinium–Wolbachia coinfection induced male‐killing and resulted in a higher female sex ratio in the intraspecific amphigenetic progeny of Asia II7 ICWH and ICWL lines; interestingly, male‐killing induction was enhanced with increased Cardinium titer. Moreover, single infection of Wolbachia induced partial CI in the Asia II7 IW line and resulted in reduced fecundity, higher embryonic mortality, and lower female sex ratio. The uninfected Asia II7 IU line had significantly higher fecundity, lower embryonic and nymphal mortalities, and a lower level of CI than both the Wolbachia‐infected Asia II7 IW line and the Cardinium–Wolbachia‐coinfected Asia II7 ICWH line. Our findings indicate that Cardinium–Wolbachia coinfection induced male‐killing, which may have had antagonistic effects on Wolbachia‐induced CI in the Asia II7 whiteflies. For the first time, our study revealed that B. tabaci Asia II7 reproduction is co‐manipulated by Cardinium and Wolbachia endosymbionts.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018B020205003cKey‐Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province  a31672028cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aU1701231cNSFC‐Guangdong Joint Research Fund 3aBemisia tabaci 3aWolbachia 3aabdomen 3abacteriocytes 3acryptic species 3acytoplasmic incompatibility 3aembryonic mortality 3aendosymbionts 3afecundity 3afemales 3ainsects 3amixed infection 3aprogeny 3asex ratio 3aAsia1 aPeng, Jing1 aChen, Xin‐Yi1 aGuo, Chang‐Fei1 aSang, Wen1 aWang, Xing‐Min1 aAhmed, Muhammad Z.1 aXu, Yong‐Yu1 aQiu, Bao‐Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0735-013X0 tInsect science.g2021 Apr., v. 28, no. 2 p.330-346dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3869360x1672-96097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.127933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009400165300001600259520127900275592002801554650001401582650001001596650001001606650001701616650001201633650002901645650002101674650001301695650001801708650002001726650002301746650001701769651001201786653002401798653001701822653002001839653002301859653001801882700002101900700002001921700001901941773011001960856008602070852000902156655001202165IND60569025620221119170439.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056902562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Yuan10aGross N2O emission and gross N2O uptake in soils under temperate spruce and beech forests  ap. 228-236.  aSoils are not only a major source but also a potential sink of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas and the most important substance causing stratospheric ozone depletion. Net N2O flux at the soil surface is a result of two concurrent processes: gross N2O emission and gross N2O uptake. Little is known about these processes and their controlling factors because it is only in the last five years that the 15N2O pool dilution method was developed to measure these processes in the field. Here, we used this method to quantify gross N2O emission and gross N2O uptake in adjacent spruce and beech forests on a Cambisol soil in central Germany. Our results showed that the beech stand had higher soil gross and net N2O emissions (P < 0.01–0.04) than the spruce stand. Seasonal variations in gross N2O emission and gross N2O uptake were influenced mainly by soil NO3− concentration and soil extractable organic C, respectively. The strong correlation between gross N2O emission and net N2O fluxes suggests that gross N2O emission rather than gross N2O uptake drove the net N2O flux from the soil. Our study showed the underlying mechanisms and controls of gross N2O fluxes, which until now were not quantified in actual field conditions across seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambisols 3aFagus 3aPicea 3aforest soils 3aforests 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3anitrates 3anitrous oxide 3aozone depletion 3aseasonal variation 3astratosphere 3aGermany 0a15N2O pool dilution 0aBeech forest 0aDenitrification 0aSoil nitrous oxide 0aSpruce forest1 aCorre, Marife D.1 aSchrell, Wiebke1 aVeldkamp, Edzo0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2017 Sept., v. 112 p.228-236dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245016000209300001400369520167700383592002802060650001502088650002602103650002102129650001502150650002602165650001202191650002402203650000702227650001502234650001302249650001102262650002202273650002202295651002102317653002402338653001402362653002402376653001602400700002702416700002502443700002302468700002102491773013002512856008402642852000902726655001202735IND60539627320221119222353.0190219e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053962732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2014.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchram, Julie B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1556-648310aMultiple stressor effects of near-future elevated seawater temperature and decreased pH on righting and escape behaviors of two common Antarctic gastropods  ap. 90-96.  aWarming seawater temperatures and ocean acidification on the coastal western Antarctic Peninsula pose unique challenges to stenothermal marine invertebrates. The present study examines prospective sub-lethal effects of elevated temperature, pCO2, and resultant decrease in seawater pH, on righting behavior and maximal escape speeds for two common gastropods, the limpet Nacella concinna (Strebel) and mesogastropod snail Margarella antarctica (Lamy). Replicate individuals held in individual containers were exposed to four combinations of seawater temperature (1.5°C — current average, 3.5°C — projected average by 2100) and pH (pH8.0 — current average, pH7.8 — projected average by 2100 as a result of elevated pCO2 levels) for a period of 6weeks. Following this chronic exposure, righting behavior, determined for the limpets as proportion to right over 24h and for snails as time to right, as well as maximum escape speed following contact with a sea star predator were measured. We found no significant differences in proportions of limpets displaying the capacity to right among the four temperature–pH treatments. However, there was a significant temperature–pH interaction effect for mean righting times in snails, indicating that the effect of pH on the time to right is dependent on temperature. We found no significant effects of temperature or pH on mean maximal escape speed in limpets. Additionally, we observed a significant temperature–pH interaction effect for mean maximal escape speed in snails. These interactive effects make it difficult to make clear predictions about how these environmental factors may impact behavioral responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3aaquatic invertebrates 3achronic exposure 3acontainers 3aenvironmental factors 3alimpets 3aocean acidification 3apH 3aprediction 3aseawater 3asnails 3asublethal effects 3awater temperature 3aAntarctic region 0aBehavioral response 0aGastropod 0aOcean acidification 0aTemperature1 aSchoenrock, Kathryn M.1 aMcClintock, James B.1 aAmsler, Charles D.1 aAngus, Robert A.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2014 Aug., v. 457 p.90-96dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2014.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008300168300001600251520154000267592002801807650001601835650001001851650001201861650001401873650002201887650001301909650001201922650001001934650001001944651001101954700002101965773012301986856008102109852000902190655001202199IND60438752020221120152537.0151023e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043875202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00334-015-0520-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamsay, Jennifer10aGarden variety seeds? Botanical remains from the Petra Garden and Pool Complex  ap. 621-634.  aArchaeobotanical samples recovered during the 2004, 2005, 2009 and 2011 excavation seasons at the Petra Garden and Pool Complex (PGPC) in Jordan examined plants that were preserved during different phases of use of the site. The analysis of these remains attempts to determine what plants would have been grown in the garden in antiquity. Results indicated that the material recovered likely represented plants that had been preserved elsewhere in the area and then deposited in the garden to act as fertilizer. The remains were generally charred and were probably derived from fuel and/or waste deposits as it does not appear that the garden was catastrophically burned. Although it is difficult to ascertain garden variety plants under these preservation conditions, an analysis of the archaeobotanical data from the PGPC addresses the questions of what and how plants functioned in the local and regional economy, and how the role of the garden changed through time, in addition to providing insight into the general environmental or ecological conditions present in southern Jordan from the Late Hellenistic through Late Byzantine/Post-Classical periods. Although ornamental species represent a small fraction of materials collected, the presence of these taxa may indicate their occurrence in the garden. Even if garden plants are not readily identifiable, this study aids in addressing the larger issues of trade, economy and environment of this ancient city, as well as the feasibility of identifying garden plants in antiquity.  aPublisher supplied data 3afertilizers 3afuels 3agardens 3amaterials 3aornamental plants 3asampling 3aseasons 3aseeds 3atrade 3aJordan1 aBedal, Leigh-Ann0 tVegetation history and archaeobotany.g2015 Sept., v. 24, no. 5 p.621-634dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0939-63147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-015-0520-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245008600203300001800289500002000307520188500327592002802212596006102240596005502301650001602356650001602372650001102388650001102399650001002410650001202420650001502432650002302447650001402470650002502484650002402509650001102533651001402544700002502558700002502583700002102608773013202629856007502761852000902836655001202845IND60787155720221122042611.0220807e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078715572DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.216722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeverud, William J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0150-598610aSurvival and cause‐specific mortality of moose calves in Northeastern Minnesota  ap. 1131-1142.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUngulate reproductive success (calf production and survival) influences population performance. The moose (Alces alces) population in northeastern Minnesota, USA, has declined 65% from 2006 to 2018 but has begun to stabilize. Because causes of this decline were largely unknown, we investigated production, survival, and cause‐specific mortality of calves of the global positioning system (GPS)‐collared females in this population. In 2013 and 2014, we GPS‐collared 74 neonates and monitored them for survival. In 2015 and 2016, we monitored 50 and 35 calving females for signs of neonatal mortality using changes in adult female velocities and assessed seasonal calf survival by aerial surveys. In 2013 and 2014 (pooled), survival to 9 months was 0.34 (95% CI = 0.23–0.52) for collared calves, and in 2015 and 2016 (pooled) survival was 0.35 (95% CI = 0.26–0.48) for uncollared calves. Mortality in all 4 years was high during the first 50 days of life. In 2013 and 2014 (pooled), calving sites were relatively safe for collared neonates; predator‐kills occurred a median 17.0 days after departure and a median 1,142 m from calving sites. Predation was the leading cause of death of collared calves (84% of mortalities), with wolves (Canis lupus) accounting for 77% of these. Other forms of mortality for collared and uncollared calves included drowning, infection, vehicle collision, and natural abandonment. We documented higher wolf predation than other recent studies with similar predator communities. Identifying specific causes of calf mortality and understanding their relations to various landscape characteristics and other extrinsic factors should yield insight into mechanisms contributing to the declining moose population in northeastern Minnesota and serve as a basis for ecologically sound management responses. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinnesota Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund  cWildlife Restoration (Pittman‐Robertson) Program 3aAlces alces 3aCanis lupus 3aadults 3acalves 3adeath 3afemales 3alandscapes 3aneonatal mortality 3apredation 3areproductive success 3awildlife management 3awolves 3aMinnesota1 aObermoller, Tyler R.1 aDelgiudice, Glenn D.1 aFieberg, John R.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2019 July, v. 83, no. 5 p.1131-1142dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.216723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03852naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245017300170300001800343520174500361536036202106592002802468596001702496596005502513596001402568596001202582650001002594650002302604650001202627650001702639650001702656650001402673650001702687650001002704650001802714650002002732650002102752650002102773653004302794653003202837653003502869653003202904700001602936700001802952700002002970700001702990700001703007700001803024700001603042700001703058773011603075856008603191852000903277655001203286IND60733481220221117234633.0220827e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073348122DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2020.18310262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rui-Xing10aPreventive treatment with ginsenoside Rb1 ameliorates monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension in rats and involves store-operated calcium entry inhibition  ap. 1055-1063.  aGinsenoside Rb1, the main active ingredient of ginseng, exhibits ex vivo depression of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and related vasoconstriction in pulmonary arteries derived from pulmonary hypertension (PH) rats. However, the in vivo effects of ginsenoside Rb1 on PH remain unclear. This study explored the possibility of using ginsenoside Rb1 as an in vivo preventive medication for type I PH, i.e., pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and potential mechanisms involving SOCE. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (170–180 g) were randomly divided into Control, MCT, and MCT + Rb1 groups (n = 20). Control rats received only saline injection. Rats in the MCT + Rb1 and MCT groups were intraperitoneally administered single doses of 50 mg/kg monocrotaline (MCT) combined with 30 mg/kg/day ginsenoside Rb1 or equivalent volumes of saline for 21 consecutive days. Subsequently, comprehensive parameters related to SOCE, vascular tone, histological changes and hemodynamics were measured. Ginsenoside Rb1 reduced MCT-induced STIM1, TRPC1, and TRPC4 expression by 35.00, 31.96, and 32.24%, respectively, at the protein level. SOCE-related calcium entry and pulmonary artery contraction decreased by 162.6 nM and 71.72%. The mean pulmonary artery pressure, right ventricle systolic pressure, and right ventricular mass index decreased by 19.5 mmHg, 21.6 mmHg, and 39.50%. The wall thickness/radius ratios decreased by 14.67 and 17.65%, and the lumen area/total area ratios increased by 18.55 and 15.60% in intrapulmonary vessels with 51–100 and 101–150 μm o.d. Ginsenoside Rb1, a promising candidate for PH prevention, inhibited SOCE and related pulmonary vasoconstriction, and relieved MCT-induced PAH in rats.  aThis study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC81400236], Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2016J01153, 2017J01816, 2017J01528, and 2017J05134], Science and Technology Innovation Joint Foundation of Fujian Province [2016Y9038], and the Project of Education Department of Fujian Province [JA15212].  aPublisher supplied data  aNSFC81400236  a2016J01153, 2017J01816, 2017J01528, and 2017J05134  a2016Y9038  aJA15212 3aPanax 3aactive ingredients 3acalcium 3adrug therapy 3aginsenosides 3ahistology 3ahypertension 3amales 3amonocrotaline 3aprotein content 3apulmonary artery 3avasoconstriction 0aPulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells 0apulmonary arterial pressure 0apulmonary vascular remodelling 0aright ventricle hypertrophy1 aHe, Rui-Lan1 aJiao, Hai-Xia1 aZhang, Run-Tian1 aGuo, Jing-Yi1 aLiu, Xiao-Ru1 aGui, Long-Xin1 aLin, Mo-Jun1 aWu, Zhi-Juan0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 58, no. 1 p.1055-1063dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2020.18310263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01654naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010200156300001800258520053000276592002800806650002900834650002200863650002300885650002300908650002100931650002200952650002200974700001900996700001801015700001401033700001301047700001201060700001901072773010501091856007501196852000901271655001201280IND60578651920221118221720.0170813e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057865192DNAL7 a10.1021/ol30344662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ming-Li10aNardoaristolones A and B, Two Terpenoids with Unusual Skeletons from Nardostachys chinensis Batal  ap. 1000-1003.  aNardoaristolones A and B, two novel terpenoids derived from the aristolane-type sesquiterpenoid, were isolated from the underground parts of Nardostachys chinensis Batal.

Reference assemblages of organism groups will, in turn, vary, due to geological, hydrological, climatic, physicochemical and biological factors. Member States tackle this by establishing “types” which share common characteristics. However, for the purposes of ensuring consistent application, broad transboundary types were also established within five Geographical Intercalibration Groups (GIGs, referred to here as “regions”) as part of the EU's intercalibration exercise. In this paper, we evaluate these types using river diatom assemblages and also provide reference threshold values for two common metrics used in pan-European diatom assessments. A database was assembled, representing 14 EU Member States from Ireland and Portugal in the West, to Estonia and Cyprus in the East, in order to explore biogeographical patterns in assemblages unaffected by anthropogenic pressures. Multivariate analyses were used to examine this pattern and its relationship with geographic, typological and abiotic parameters. After taxonomic harmonisation, NMDS ordination of samples indicated weak differences in assemblage composition among regions. ANOSIM analyses, in turn, indicated that MS was the best factor to group similar samples whereas alkalinity, recognised as the primary environmental variable structuring diatom communities, although significant, explained less variability in the dataset. This, we believe, reflects the importance of methodological factors other than taxonomy (e.g. counting protocol, sample season) that may be constant within a MS but which vary between MSs. When two diatom metrics, the TI and IPS, were applied to the data, differences in the distribution of the metric scores between MS were generally not statistically significant even though some differences between regions were apparent. A trend of increasing values of TI (decreasing values of IPS) was observed in the sequence: Nordic<Alpine<Mediterranean<Central-Baltic<Eastern Continental regions. Additionally, some differences were observed among types within the Mediterranean and Nordic regions, though not for other regions. The data used in this exercise provides us with a region and, in some cases, a type specific benchmark dataset against which national reference data can be compared.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aalkalinity 3abiogeography 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aecological value 3ahydrology 3amultivariate analysis 3arivers 3ataxonomy 3aCyprus 3aEstonia 3aIreland 3aPortugal1 aGómez-Rodríguez, Carola1 aKahlert, Maria1 aAlmeida, Salomé F.P.1 aBennett, Cathy1 aBottin, Marius1 aDelmas, François,1 aDescy, Jean-Pierre1 aDörflinger, Gerald1 aKennedy, Bryan1 aMarvan, P.,1 aOpatrilova, Libuse1 aPardo, Isabel1 aPfister, Peter1 aRosebery, Juliette1 aSchneider, Susanne1 aVilbaste, Sirje0 tEcological indicators.g2012 Sept., v. 20 p.177-186dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03806naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007700157300001800234500002000252520204700272592002802319596003802347596010202385596000902487596002602496596003102522596002602553650003002579650003302609650003502642650002902677650001002706650001502716650001102731650001302742650001902755650001502774650001802789650001002807650001702817650002502834650001302859650002402872650000902896650001502905651001002920700002202930700001802952700002002970700002202990773013203012856007503144852000903219655001203228IND60787155820221122042542.0220807e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078715582DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.216732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProett, Matt10aColumbian sharp‐tailed grouse nesting ecology: wind energy and habitat  ap. 1214-1225.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe rapid pace of wind‐energy development has increased stakeholder concerns regarding the potential effects on wildlife. Locations targeted for wind‐energy development frequently overlap prairie grouse and greater sage‐grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitats. Research suggests that anthropogenic developments may have negative effects on these species. There is, however, no information published regarding the effect of wind‐energy development on Columbian sharp‐tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus), a subspecies that has twice been petitioned for Endangered Species Act protection. To address this need, from 2014 to 2015 we studied Columbian sharp‐tailed grouse nesting ecology across restored grasslands in eastern Idaho, USA, where a 215‐turbine wind‐energy complex had been developed. We monitored 147 nests from 135 females captured at leks 0.1–13.8 km from wind turbines. We used an information‐theoretic approach to evaluate the influence of wind‐energy infrastructure and habitat characteristics on nest‐site selection and daily nest survival. We did not detect any influence of wind‐energy infrastructure on nest‐site selection or nest survival. Nest‐site selection and daily nest survival were influenced by vegetation structure and composition measured at 2 spatial scales. Females selected nest sites with more restored grassland containing >30% forb cover within the nesting core‐use area (i.e., 60 ha around the nest) and exhibited a functional response to the availability of that land cover type. Daily nest survival was best predicted by visual obstruction at the nest site and the amount of restored grassland containing >30% forb cover within the nesting core‐use area. We recommend wildlife managers continue to implement management practices that will provide bunchgrass‐dominated grasslands with >30% forb cover in restored grasslands (e.g., Conservation Reserve Program fields) within Columbian sharp‐tailed grouse range. © The Wildlife Society, 2019  aPublisher supplied data  cIdaho Department of Fish and Game  aF13AF01005cUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service's Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program  cIDFG  cBureau of Reclamation  cJack H.

The quantification of mercury in hair sample was made by atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the period between 1994 and 2010. In São Luiz do Tapajós the mercury exposure varied, in log units, from the peak of 1.21 ± 0.03 μg/g in 1996 to 1.16 ± 0.07 μg/g in 2007. Mercury exposure in Barreiras varied, in log units, from 1.25 ± 0.04 μg/g in 1994 to 1 ± 0.03 μg/g in 2010, peaking in 1995 at 1.25 ± 0.06 μg/g. Total mercury concentration found in both communities had no statistical differences across the years (p > 0.05) and they were higher than non-mercury exposed communities in Brazil and in South America.

However, investigations of the influence of higher pollutant levels on birth weight change are limited. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether the air pollution of Ningbo is associated with birth weight, and which trimester could be a window period for maternal exposure to air pollution. A total of 170,008 live births were selected in the Ningbo city of Zhejiang, China, from 2015 to 2017. We estimated the association between the decreased birth weight and the increased air pollutant concentrations in the three trimesters and full gestation. The effects of interaction among pollutants were identified using a co-pollutant adjustment model. An interquartile range increases in PM2.5 (10.55 μg/m3), SO2(4.6 μg/m3), CO (125.59 μg/m3), and O3 (14.54 μg/m3) concentrations during the entire gestation were associated with 3.65 g (95% confidence interval: −6.02 g, −1.29 g), 5.02 g (−6.89 g, −3.14 g), 2.64 g (−4.65 g, −0.63 g) and 2.9 g (−4.8 g, 1 g) decreases, respectively, in birth weight. With each interquartile range increment in NO2 concentration was associated with an 8.05 g (6.24 g, 9.85 g) increase in birth weight. In the first trimester, only the PM2.5 exposure seemed to be associated with the greatest decline in birth weight. After adjustment for co-pollutant, both PM2.5 and SO2 were still associated with birth weight, except for CO for O3 adjustment, O3 for SO2 adjustment, and O3 for NO2 adjustment. Maternal exposure to air pollution may be associated with a decrease of birth weight, but the contribution of various pollutants is necessary to verify by future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3abirth weight 3acarbon monoxide 3aconfidence interval 3amaternal exposure 3amodels 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apregnancy 3asulfur dioxide 3aChina 0aAir pollution 0aParticulate matter 0aBirth weight 0aBirth outcome1 aYuan, Xiaoqi1 aFu, Jianfei1 aZhang, Lingyun1 aHong, Lixia1 aHu, Lingjie1 aLiu, Liya0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 June, v. 249 p.629-637dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.03.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02027naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245012300163300001600286520103000302592002801332650001501360650001401375650001901389651001001408700002201418700002401440700002001464700001401484700002001498773009101518856008301609852000901692655001201701IND60083039220221119120809.0141101e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008303922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2013.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jie10aCosmogenic nuclide constraints on late Quaternary glacial chronology on the Dalijia Shan, northeastern Tibetan Plateau  ap. 439-451.  aCosmogenic nuclide (CN) apparent exposure dating has become a widely used method for determining the age of glacial landforms on the Tibetan Plateau with >1200 published ages. We present the first ¹⁰Be exposure ages from the Dalijia Shan, the most northeastern formerly glaciated mountain range on the Tibetan Plateau. The moraine groups identified from field and remote sensing imagery mapping record four glacial events at 37.07±3.70 to 52.96±4.70ka (MIS 3), 20.17±1.79 to 26.99±2.47ka (MIS 2), 16.92±1.49 to 18.76±1.88ka (MIS 2), and 11.56±1.03 to 11.89±1.06ka (Younger Dryas). These ages indicate that glaciation in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau is much younger than previously thought. In addition, this record is consistent with many other regions on the Tibetan Plateau, with a local last glacial maximum during MIS 3 asynchronous with Northern Hemisphere last glacial maximum during MIS 2. The Dalijia Shan might also include an event of Younger Dryas age, but this needs to be tested in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglaciation 3alandforms 3aremote sensing 3aChina1 aKassab, Christine1 aHarbor, Jonathan M.1 aCaffee, Marc W.1 aCui, Hang1 aZhang, Guoliang0 tQuaternary research.g2013 May, v. 79, no. 3 p.439-451dElsevier Inc.x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2013.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01865naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006100167300001500228520070100243592002800944650002100972650001000993650001001003650001701013650001501030650001301045650001501058650001101073653001201084653001201096653002701108653001001135653000901145653000901154653003001163700001401193700002201207773012401229856008101353852000901434655001201443IND60689188820221119000539.0200420e20070101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068918882DNAL7 a10.1080/073885507013345192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParvinder Kaur,10aYeast Phytases: Present Scenario and Future Perspectives  ap. 93-109.  aPhytases hydrolyze phytates to liberate soluble and thus readily utilizable inorganic phosphate.

A total of ten cultivated plants and eight weed taxa were recognised and their changes in time recorded in detail. Two main phases of agricultural development were identified, A1 (9th–14th centuries AD) and A2 (16th–19th centuries AD). A1 coincided with the medieval climate anomaly and began after a widespread loss of woodland by fire, as manifested in a decline of arboreal pollen from ~60 to ~30 %, which affected mainly the pine woods (~40 to ~10 %). This phase was characterised by cultivation of the cereals Secale and Triticum/Avena, with Plantago as the main weed, alternating with pastures dominated by Artemisia, in a ca. 60 year land-use rotation scheme. A1 also coincided with a feudal socio-economic system that replaced the shifting cultivation practices of the earlier inhabitants with intensive agriculture. This type of land use was interrupted by the onset of the Little Ice Age, coinciding with a great social crisis with wars and plagues, leading to the depopulation of the zone and the recovery of woodlands. The onset of A2 coincided with the Spanish monarchy of the modern age and was characterised by Cannabis cultivation, which attained a maximum in the post-modern age, at the transition between feudalism and capitalism. Hemp was mainly used to supply fibre to the Spanish navy and the cultivation of this plant was mandatory until the disestablishment of this navy in AD 1834. After this date, a second socio-economic crisis took place as a consequence of massive emigration to large cities, promoted by the growing industrialisation. The combination of fossil and historical evidence significantly improves palaeoecological reconstructions in areas under heavy human impact, which is useful to enhance historical soundness, to understand how modern landscapes have been shaped and also to disentangle natural causes of ecological change from human ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aCannabis 3aPlantago 3aSecale 3aTriticum 3aanthropogenic activities 3acapitalism 3acities 3aclimate 3acrops 3afossils 3agrains 3ahemp 3ahumans 3aindustrialization 3aintensive farming 3alakes 3aland use 3alandscapes 3apaleoecology 3apalynology 3apastures 3apollen 3ashifting cultivation 3asocioeconomics 3awatersheds 3aweeds 3awoodlands1 aVegas-Vilarrúbia, Teresa0 tVegetation history and archaeobotany.g2015 Nov., v. 24, no. 6 p.699-710dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0939-63147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-015-0525-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013800169300001600307520148100323592002801804650002301832650001101855650001301866650001701879650001101896650001401907650001401921650001401935650001101949650001201960650001201972650001101984650001801995650001102013651002502024653001202049653001702061653002502078653002502103653002302128653002702151700002302178700002002201700002002221773013202241856008402373852000902457655001202466IND60539627720221119222433.0190318e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053962772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2014.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoumaza, Salima10aEffects of urban effluents on spatial structure, morphology and total phenols of Posidonia oceanica: Comparison with a reference site  ap. 113-119.  aIn the Mediterranean, the discharge of urban effluents in coastal areas adversely affects Posidonia oceanica, since it induces nutrient enrichment and a decrease of water clarity, but data from the southern Mediterranean are very sparse. In this paper we examine the differences in P. oceanica parameters from a disturbed site (Bou Ismaïl) and a reference site (Kouali), at meadow level (shoot density, meadow cover), at individual level (leaf biometry, A coefficient, epiphytic index) and at biochemical level (total phenols). The differences were examined at the upper limit (−5m) and the lower limit (−20m), during an annual cycle. Results indicated a significantly lower mean meadow cover at the upper limits of the disturbed site compared to the reference site. The leaf length and leaf area were also lower at the disturbed site, and this difference was recorded all year round at the upper limit. The epiphytic index and the A coefficient of adult leaves were higher only in July and October at the upper limits of the disturbed site. In contrast, total phenol concentration of the leaves did not show any response to disturbances related to urban effluents. However, the biosynthesis of phenolic substances at the two sites was significantly higher in the intermediate leaves, in winter, when growth slows down. The unexpected higher value of total phenol concentration recorded in the intermediate leaves and sheaths in spring at the reference site is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPosidonia oceanica 3aadults 3abiometry 3abiosynthesis 3acoasts 3aeffluents 3aepiphytes 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3ameadows 3aphenols 3aspring 3awater quality 3awinter 3aMediterranean region 0aAlgeria 0aBioindicator 0aBiometric parameters 0aPhenol concentration 0aPosidonia oceanica 0aSouthern Mediterranean1 aBoudefoua, Nassima1 aBoumaza, Rachid1 aSemroud, Rachid0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2014 Aug., v. 457 p.113-119dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2014.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010000157500002000257520149100277592002801768650001901796650001301815650001101828650001801839650001801857700002201875700005501897773014401952856007502096852000902171655001202180IND60759845720221120235710.0211214e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075984572DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.160212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasar, Dogan10aKinetic modeling of macroelement concentration of Malatya cheese produced by traditional method  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this investigation, the concentration kinetics of macroelements (Na, Ca, P, Mg, and K) for Malatya cheese due to salting in different ways (dry salted and brined) and storing at different temperatures (7 and 20°C) for 120 days, were studied. Changes in macroelement of Malatya cheese for modeling were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma‐Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP‐OES) at different storage times (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days). The zero‐order kinetic model with R² of 0.91–0.99 was determined to be the best model for Na, Ca, and P contents for brined and dry salted cheese samples. While Mg and K contents of the dry salted cheese fit the first‐order kinetic model, the second‐order model was applied to describe K content of the brined cheese samples. These models would be useful in designing the process for using different salting methods in traditional cheeses and related calculations for these samples. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The concentration kinetics of macroelements of Malatya cheese during ripening was obtained which could be used to determine the loss of macroelement. In addition, calculations of the reduction of the macroelements concentration depend on the different salting methods and storage temperatures, which led to reducing the economic losses and optimizing their storage management. Therefore, these models applied to cheese have been found to have a promising appearance in predicting quality changes in the dairy industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy industry 3akinetics 3amodels 3asalted cheese 3aspectrometers1 aErim Kose, Yagmur1 aKose, Senol1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0599-60300 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.e16021-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.160213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245015600160300001600316500001900332520130200351592002801653650000801681650002001689650002101709650001201730650002201742650002001764650001701784650001301801650002601814650001401840653001901854653002701873653002801900653002601928653001901954700001501973700001501988700001302003700001602016700001702032700001202049700001502061700001602076700009002092700001602182773014602198856008302344852000902427655001202436IND60672126120221118052531.0191031e20191203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067212612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hai10aLarge conformation shifts of Vibrio cholerae VqmA dimer in the absence of target DNA provide insight into DNA-binding mechanisms of LuxR-type receptors  ap. 399-405.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aQuorum sensing regulates the biofilm formation and expression of virulence factors in Vibrio cholerae, an obligate human pathogen that continues to imperil human health. Cytoplasmic transcription factor VqmA is a LuxR-type receptor ubiquitous in the Vibrio genus and one vibriophage VP882 and plays an important role in V. cholerae pathogenicity. Here we presented the X-ray crystal structure of V. cholerae VqmA–DPO complex and compared it with the previously determined VqmA–DPO–DNA complex. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the crystal structures of the same LuxR-type receptor with two conformations of binding to DNA and not binding to DNA. Based on the results of structural analysis and biochemical assays, we revealed the secondary structure of the linker region between two function domains changed significantly, and DNA binding domains were covalently linked by a disulfide bond formed by the highly conserved Cys134. Besides, the distance between two DBD monomers became longer than that in DNA-binding conformation, and two α8 helixes underwent a large conformation shift. The results of the structure-function analyses presented here improve our understanding of the complex mechanisms in the conformational changes of LuxR-type receptors caused by DNA binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aVibrio cholerae 3aanimal pathogens 3abiofilm 3acrystal structure 3adisulfide bonds 3ahuman health 3aresearch 3atranscription factors 3avirulence 0aQuorum sensing 0aTranscription promoter 0aProtein-DNA interaction 0aDNA-Binding mechanism 0aDisulfide bond1 aLi, Minjun1 aPeng, Chao1 aYin, Yue1 aGuo, Haojie1 aWang, Weiwei1 aXu, Qin1 aZhou, Huan1 aXu, Chunyan1 aYu, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9502-3277 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9502-32771 aHe, Jianhua0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Dec. 03, v. 520, no. 2 p.399-405dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001900144245009200163300001600255500001500271520203800286592002802324650002102352650002502373650001502398650001602413650002402429650001602453650002802469650002502497650002102522650001802543650002502561650001502586650002602601651001902627653002502646653001902671653002002690653001502710700002602725700002002751773011802771856008202889852000902971655001202980IND4432828120221123031748.0151126e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443282812DNAL7 a10.2111/REM-D-09-00009.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLipper, Leslie10aSupplying Carbon Sequestration From West African Rangelands: Opportunities and Barriers  ap. 155-166.  a2019-12-06  aThe emergence of markets for mitigation of climate change presents new opportunities for increasing economic and ecological returns to rangelands in developing countries. Improving rangeland management is a potentially significant source of mitigation from sequestration. It is appealing due to the likely links to sustainable agricultural development and poverty reduction. Many of the changes needed to sequester carbon are also associated with improved rangeland productivity and incomes. We provide an overview of the key issues that arise in determining the potential of carbon markets to support improved rangeland management focusing on West Africa, an area where pastoralism is a major economic activity with extensive rangelands that offer considerable potential for sequestering carbon. Estimates of the potential for increasing sequestration through improved rangeland management are summarized. Per hectare amounts are low, but aggregate potential is high. Carbon emission reductions are generated by reducing or avoiding land degradation, rehabilitating degraded lands, and increasing native carbon stocks by increasing aboveground and belowground biomass. Avoiding degradation and rehabilitating lightly degraded lands are the least costly and can generate significant carbon emission reductions. Carbon offsets from agricultural sources are currently limited under regulatory cap and trade regimes, and prices in voluntary markets are relatively low. Low returns to carbon offsets per hectare mean that significant co-benefits in the form of increased rangeland productivity and incomes would be necessary to induce participation. High transactions costs can be a problem in carbon markets and in adopting improved rangeland management practices, highlighting the need for institutions to provide effective coordination, monitoring, and enforcement. Evidence from Burkina Faso suggests the potential for existing local-level institutions to play an important role in future carbon payment programs, should they emerge.  aPublisher supplied data 3arange management 3aprimary productivity 3arangelands 3apastoralism 3ainnovation adoption 3afarm income 3adry matter accumulation 3acarbon sequestration 3aland restoration 3agas emissions 3aeconomic development 3agrasslands 3aenvironmental markets 3aWestern Africa 0arangeland management 0aclimate change 0aland management 0avegetation1 aDutilly-Diane, Celine1 aMcCarthy, Nancy0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2010 Jan., v. 63, no. 1 p.155-166dSociety for Range Managementx1551-50287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111%2FREM-D-09-00009.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245010100166300001800267500001900285520084500304592002801149650002201177650001601199650001801215650002001233650001001253650001201263650001801275650003001293650002201323650000901345650001501354650001801369650001601387653005201403653002501455653002601480653002001506653002101526700001901547700002401566700001801590700001901608700002101627773018601648856007401834852000901908655001201917IND60692196320221122064248.0200502e20120923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069219632DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1203792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKHALID, Ahmed Magzoub10aExpression of a Novel Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor Motif Protein Gene in Maturing Rat Testes  ap. 1769-1773.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe screened a novel sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor type 5 motif-containing gene, LOC290876, from maturing rat testes by differential display. Gene expression was testis-specific, increased at week 7, and continued for 15 weeks. PCR analysis clarified two gene transcript isoforms, which were expressed at the same level in all samples detected in Northern blot. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two isoforms revealed differences in carboxyl terminal sequences. Gene and protein expression in the testes was dominant in the spermatocytes, and protein expression was localized to the nucleus. Taken together, these findings suggest that the LOC290876-encoded gene product is not involved in sphingosine signaling, but has distinct roles in the nucleus during the processes of spermatocyte maturation and meiosis producing spermatids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorthern blotting 3aamino acids 3abiotechnology 3agene expression 3agenes 3ameiosis 3amessenger RNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3aspermatids 3aspermatocytes 3asphingosine 0asphingosine 1-phosphate receptor type 5 (EDG-8) 0aimmunohistochemistry 0ain situ hybridization 0aspermatogenesis 0asplicing variant1 aASANO, Atsushi1 aHOSAKA, Yoshinao Z.1 aOHYAMA, Kenji1 aOHTA, Masanori1 aYAMANO, Yoshiaki0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2012 Sept. 23, v. 76, no. 9 p.1769-1773dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.1203793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245014700170300001600317520147000333592002801803650001801831650001901849650002301868650002801891650002701919650001601946650001001962650000901972650002301981650001802004650001502022650001402037650001402051653003602065653001802101653002702119653001102146653001802157700002102175700002002196700002002216773013202236856008402368852000902452655001202461IND60539627920221119222356.0190318e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053962792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2014.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwan, Billy K.Y.10aHemolymph quality as indicator of health status in juvenile Chinese horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus (Xiphosura) under laboratory culture  ap. 135-142.  aThe growth performance and hemolymph quality of juvenile Chinese horseshoe crabs under four diet treatments: brine shrimp Artemia salina, short-neck clam Ruditapes philippinarum, sandworm Marphysa sanguinea and mixed clam and sandworm were evaluated in a 12-week experiment. The growth responses in terms of final body weight, specific growth rates and percentage of individuals molted under the clam diet were significantly higher than those fed with brine shrimp and sandworm, whereas the mixed clam and sandworm diet was not statistically different from the other three treatments. While the hemolymph properties among these diets were similar, significant declines in hemocyanin concentration, percentage of oxyhemocyanin, and ratio of granular–spherical to granular–flattened states of amebocytes were noted at the end of the study. Such a decrease in hemolymph quality indicated deleterious effects due to prolonged culture on the health status of the juveniles, which might be attributed to captivity-related issues, such as deficiencies of essential diet compositions, movement constraints and absence of tidal rhythms. This was further supported from the finding that the hemolymph quality of the experimental juveniles was significantly poor compared to that of the juveniles collected from the field. Changes of hemolymph constituents could thus be a useful indicator to reflect the health status of juvenile horseshoe crabs under laboratory culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlitta virens 3aArtemia salina 3aMarphysa sanguinea 3aRuditapes philippinarum 3aTachypleus tridentatus 3abody weight 3aclams 3adiet 3agrowth performance 3ahealth status 3ahemocyanin 3ahemolymph 3ajuveniles 0aJuvenile Tachypleus tridentatus 0aHealth status 0aHemolymph constituents 0aGrowth 0aNatural diets1 aChan, Alice K.Y.1 aCheung, Siu Gin1 aShin, Paul K.S.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2014 Aug., v. 457 p.135-142dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2014.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011800173506011700291506007600408520173100484592002802215506003702243650001702280650001902297650003302316650002102349650001202370650003402382650001302416650001702429651001202446653002902458653001202487653001302499653001802512653002102530700001602551773012302567856008502690852000902775655001202784IND60771905520221207065222.0220404s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077190552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crsust.2022.1001412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuttilainen, Hanna10aHeterogenising forestry value production – Drivers and barriers of entering the non-wood forest products sector  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlobal trends towards the bio-economy and a rapid change in value production caused by an awareness of climate change and the importance of forests and the environment overall, as well as of the demographical change in modern societies suggests a potential for increasing the role of non-wood forest products (NWFP) in future forest-based natural resources systems. The change of production-based societies to service-based societies has opened opportunities for the growing heterogenic group of forest owners as well. As new value production models have been identified, many forestry sector managers and owners are still in their infancy in seizing opportunities related to the service-based forest value production as well as in the need of conceptual clarity and understanding of the phenomena. This paper aims to study those factors influencing forest owners in diversifying value production into non-wood based products. The focus is on identifying those factors that attribute to the non-industrial private forest owner's decision to engage in NWFP production alongside traditional forestry. The results provide an overall picture of drivers and barriers which forest owners encounter while engaging and operating in the natural products sector. This study was based on in-depth interviews collected from twenty forest owners in Finland. The results revealed that drivers for engaging in NWFPs production are principally internal whereas barriers are mainly external. According to results increased knowledge, more effective communication, cooperation and networking between forest owners, forest professionals and NWFP suppliers are needed to support the supply chain, and consequently to develop the NWFPs production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioeconomics 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aforest ownership 3aforests 3anonindustrial private forests 3aresearch 3asupply chain 3aFinland 0aNon-wood forest products 0aDrivers 0aBarriers 0aForest owners 0aEntrepreneurship1 aVilko, Jyri0 tCurrent research in environmental sustainability.g2022, v. 4 p.100141-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27321x2666-04907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crsust.2022.1001413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245014400172300001100316520175000327592002802077650001702105650001502122650001202137650001202149650001502161650001602176650001902192650001902211650001902230650000902249700005902258700001802317700002102335700004502356773012902401856008302530852000902613655001202622IND60775730020221116202317.0220518e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077573002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-022-03400-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalīm, Muḥammad,10aAnatomical and physiological features modulate ion homeostasis and osmoregulation in aquatic halophyte Fimbristylis complanata (Retz.) link  ap. 59.  aFimbristylis complanata manifests several biochemical and anatomical modifications to mitigate salinity-induced ionic disturbance. Three populations from salt-affected aquatic habitats were evaluated to assess degree of salinity tolerance and ion homeostasis. The collection sites were HR-Rasool headworks, LR-Lillah-Khewra foothills and SH-Sahianwala with ECe 19.45, 31.36 and 47.49 dS m⁻¹, respectively. The populations were established in plastic containers and then three salt (NaCl) treatments (0, 200, 400 mM) were maintained. The experiment was laid in a completely randomized design (CRD) with three replicates. The SH population collected from hyper-saline habitat was the most salt tolerant mainly because of its capability to maintain root and shoot dry biomass accompanied by higher sequestration of Na⁺. Enhanced accumulation of Ca²⁺ and other key osmolytes in SH population played a key role in osmotic adjustments and maintenance of membrane integrity. The reduction in tissue K⁺ was observed in all populations due to the antagonistic effect of Na⁺. Anatomical traits like increased epidermal thickness and metaxylem area greatly contributed to ionic homeostasis in all three populations. The increase in anatomical traits was more pronounced in SH population. Increased leaf epidermal thickness in SH population was particularly helpful in tolerating low soil osmotic potentials by preventing water loss from the leaves. Increased aerenchyma in SH same population helped to store surplus water, salts and gases.

In this study we examine if additional information can be obtained on intra-seasonal short term scale by using the Shortwave Infrared Water Stress Index (SIWSI) as compared to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We perform a spatio-temporal evaluation of NDVI and SIWSI using geostationary remote sensing imagery from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). The indices and their seasonally detrended anomalies are evaluated using a gridded rainfall product (RFE2) and modeled actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for the Senegal River basin in 2008. Daily NDVI and SIWSI were found spatially highly correlated to ETa with r=0.73 for both indices, showing the importance of the north/south vegetation gradient in the river catchment. The hypothesis that short term evolution of index anomalies are related to canopy water status was tested by comparing 10-day averages of ETa with short term changes in daily NDVI and SIWSI anomalies, and moderate to strong coefficients of determination where found when anomaly variations where aggregated by Land Cover Classes (LCCs) with R2 values of 0.65 for savanna, 0.60 for grassland, 0.72 for shrubland, and 0.58 for barren or sparsely vegetated areas. This is higher than for the same method applied to NDVI anomalies, with R2 values of 0.57 for savanna, 0.50 for grassland, 0.32 for shrubland, and 0.57 for barren or sparsely vegetated areas. The approach of detrending NIR/SWIR based indices and spatially aggregating the anomalies do offer improved detection of intra-seasonal stress. However, quite coarse spatial aggregation is found necessary for a significant analysis outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3ashrublands 3aevapotranspiration 3acanopy 3arivers 3aSahel 3awater stress 3awatersheds 3arain 3asavannas 3aland cover 3aremote sensing 3agrasslands 3asatellites 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aSenegal 0aDrought 0aDrylands 0asemiarid zones 0aGeostationary 0aMSG 0aMIKESHE modeling1 aStisen, Simon1 aProud, Simon R.1 aFensholt, Rasmus0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 159 p.57-69dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.11.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245015700167300002000324520128500344592002801629650001501657650001501672650001101687650001501698650001301713650002201726650001701748650001401765650001901779650001201798650002301810650001301833650001801846650002301864700002301887700001801910700001901928700006501947773013802012856008002150852000902230655001202239IND60661469520221122131018.0190829e20190723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066146952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b052332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSepe, Elisabetta10aAnisotropic Fluorescence Emission and Photobleaching at the Surface of One-Dimensional Photonic Crystals Sustaining Bloch Surface Waves. II. Experiments  ap. 21176-21184.  aPhotonic crystal (PC)-enhanced fluorescence has been proposed as a novel tool for early disease detection in liquid biopsy. Photobleaching of the emitters has never been deeply investigated, although its cross section is expected to increase because of the large field intensity enhancement in PC. Herein, we report on the experimental investigation of the anisotropic effects arising when fluorescence excitation and emission are coupled to differently polarized modes of the same PC structure. In particular, we experimentally characterized the anisotropic photobleaching taking place during the operation of one-dimensional PC (1DPC) biosensors sustaining Bloch surface waves (BSW) at their truncation edge. The experimental results are compared to the description provided by our theoretical model reported in a twin article. We demonstrate experimentally that photobleaching affects the response of a cancer biomarkers’ detection assay and propose a procedure to compensate for it. Moreover, we describe the experimental use of BSW-coupled fluorescence and of the strong localization of the BSW at the 1DPC surface to selectively probe the rotational diffusion kinetics of proteins bound at the 1DPC surface with high spatial resolution and for different binding strengths.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3abiomarkers 3abiopsy 3abiosensors 3acrystals 3adisease detection 3afluorescence 3aneoplasms 3aphotobleaching 3aphotons 3aphysical chemistry 3aproteins 3asurface waves 3atheoretical models1 aSinibaldi, Alberto1 aDanz, Norbert1 aMunzert, Peter1 aMichelotti, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0285-60590 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 July 23, v. 123, no. 34 p.21176-21184dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b052333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245014100171300001400312520110400326592002801430650002601458650002701484650001301511650001301524650002301537650001301560650001801573650002801591650001901619650002201638650001101660650001601671650002201687650002401709650003301733650001301766653002301779653001701802653001901819653001801838653001801856700001401874700002601888700001701914700001901931700001701950700001701967700003001984700002502014700002002039700002802059700006002087773012802147856009002275852000902365655001202374IND60541125020221121020204.0190318e20140818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054112502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ming10aPreventing adhesion of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 on tomato surfaces via ultrathin polyethylene glycol film  ap. 73-81.  aThis work deals with adhesion of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 (S. Typhimurium LT2) on polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated tomato surfaces. PEG coating was characterized by water contact angle technique, scanning electron microscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. It was shown that PEG films could physisorb on the tomato surfaces after the oxygen plasma treatment, which made some outermost layers of the surfaces hydrophilic. Bacterial adhesion on PEG coated tomato surface was studied by standard plate count, fluorescence microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. Fully covered PEG film reduced the bacterial attachment 90% or more in comparison to the bare tomato surface. The degree of bacterial attachment decreased exponentially with increasing PEG coverage. When desired, PEG film could be removed by rinsing with water. Overall, this work demonstrates the proof-of-concept that an ultrathin film of polyethylene glycol may be used to effectively inhibit the attachment of pathogenic bacteria on tomato surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3abacterial adhesion 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahydrophilicity 3amass spectrometry 3aoxygen 3aplate count 3apolyethylene film 3apolyethylene glycol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atomatoes 0aBacterial adhesion 0aPolymer film 0aEdible coating 0aFresh Produce 0aAnti-adhesion1 aYang, Fan1 aPasupuleti, Sasikiran1 aOh, Jun Kyun1 aKohli, Nandita1 aLee, I-Syuan1 aPerez, Keila1 aVerkhoturov, Stanislav V.1 aSchweikert, Emile A.1 aJayaraman, Arul1 aCisneros-Zevallos, Luis1 aAkbulut, Mustafa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7343-21870 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Aug. 18, v. 185 p.73-81dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01681naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245011900203300001800322520037000340592002800710650002600738650002900764650001300793650002300806650002800829650002000857650001700877650001400894700001700908700002000925700001300945700001100958700001600969700001700985700001201002700001401014700001501028773013301043856007401176852000901250655001201259IND60644802020221122013809.0190522e20190521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064480202DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc00144a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangThese authors contributed equally to this work., Zitai10aEfficient discovery of novel antimicrobials through integration of synthesis and testing in crude ribosome extract  ap. 5886-5889.  aBy coupling in situ [2+3] Huisgen cycloaddition with an in vitro transcription/translation luminescence assay in a crude ribosomal extract, a robust and accurate high-throughput platform was successfully developed and applied for efficient identification of novel structural types of ribosomal inhibitors with antimicrobial activity against drug-resistant bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-infective agents 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3achemical compounds 3acycloaddition reactions 3adrug resistance 3aluminescence 3aribosomes1 aLu, Yongping1 aZhou, Yuanzheng1 aJu, Yuan1 aAn, Qi1 aShen, Silan1 aShi, Jianyou1 aHe, Jun1 aYang, Tao1 aLuo, Youfu0 tChemical communications.g2019 May 21, v. 55, no. 42 p.5886-5889dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc00144a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245013400209506011700343506007600460520138400536592002801920506003701948650001501985650001802000650001402018650002802032653001702060653002102077653001702098653001902115700006102134773009002195856008402285852000902369655001202378IND60771905820221207065231.0220714e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077190582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcomc.2022.1002562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScholle, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4476-698310aInfluence of the electrical anisotropy of unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced plastics on their self strain sensing properties  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis article discusses the main contributing factors for the resistance change of strain sensors with large electrical anisotropy. Typical examples for such a sensor are self sensing applications for carbon fiber reinforced plastics, where the load bearing material itself is used for strain sensing purposes. In many of these applications, electrodes are mounted to the parts surface to act as electrical connection to the conductive fibers. A mathematical approach based on Laplace equation is used to calculate the potential distribution in a two-dimensional rectangle. From this equation, a piezoresistivity theory is derived that takes into account changes in dimensions as well as longitudinal and transverse resistivity. It is shown, that the contribution of each of these factors varies widely between experiments on rather small cross sections and large cross sections. A parameter is derived that can be calculated for a given experiment by measuring the longitudinal and transverse resistivity as well as the geometrical dimensions of the specimen. This parameter is then used to expand a commonly used one-dimensional piezoresistivity theory into a two-dimensional theory, which could proof to be useful in future research analyzing highly anisotropic strain sensors. The developed equations show a good agreement to finite element studies reported in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanisotropy 3acarbon fibers 3aequations 3afinite element analysis 0aSelf-sensing 0aPiezoresistivity 0aCarbon fiber 0aStrain sensing1 aSinapius, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1873-91400 tComposites.g2022 July, v. 8 p.100256-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27515x2666-68207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomc.2022.1002563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03672naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245015800179300001600337520238300353592002802736650001302764650001702777650001402794650001002808650001502818650002702833650001502860650001902875650001102894650001002905650001002915651002102925653001802946653001302964653000902977653002402986653001603010700001803026773009603044856008903140852000903229655001203238IND60611913720221118073554.0190719e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061191372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolat, Zeynel Abidin10aDesign and implementation of a LADM-based external archive data model for land registry and cadastre transactions in Turkey: A case study of municipality  ap. 249-266.  aIt is pointed out that even though Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) standards offers a conceptual scheme defining the legal and geometrical components of real estate, it is important to be compatible with other databases (e.g. with land cover data, archive data, land valuation data and taxation data) that may be related to the model. In the model, the archive data model, which is defined as one of the external data structures, provides a class structure in which the information and documents necessary for land registry and cadastral transactions are represented. According to this class structure, necessary information and documents are kept in archive. Thanks to this structure which enables follow-up of transactions, similar transactions are prevented from being repeated.The General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre (GDLRC) performs 25 different land registry and cadastral transactions. During these transactions, some documents (e.g. power of attorney, real estate value statement, building occupancy permit, authority certificate, etc.) are requested from various external institutions (e.g. Municipality, Notary, Governor's Office, Court, etc.). Considering the fact that 8 million transactions are made annually, approximately 20 million documents are manually controlled. The manual control of such an amount of documents can cause waste of time and paper and some forgery. There is a need for external data management in accordance with LADM that enables data sharing between institutions to check whether the documents requested from external institutions during the transactions have up-to-date and correct information content.This study focuses on the online management of the information and documents requested by the GDLRC from the Municipality during the land registry and cadastral transactions. In this context, an external data model for the management of relevant information and documents is proposed. A web-based application was developed to prove that the proposed model is feasible. The application made possible the online exchange and inquiry of information and documents in the digital environment. As a result, it has been observed that thanks to the application, the time for the transaction was shortened, no document in paper form was required as the documents were inquired in a digital environment and fraud was reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acase studies 3adatabases 3afraud 3agovernance 3ainformation management 3aland cover 3aland valuation 3amodels 3apaper 3ataxes 3aTurkey (country) 0aLand registry 0aCadastre 0aLADM 0aExternal data model 0aWeb service1 aAlkan, Mehmet0 tLand use policy.g2018 Sept., v. 77 p.249-266dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008500170300001400255520158800269592002801857650002901885650001501914650001001929650001901939650001401958650002201972650002201994650001502016650001602031650001602047651001302063653002802076653000802104653001002112653000902122653001002131653001002141653001202151653001202163653001502175700001702190773009702207856008102304852000902385655001202394IND60545050920221119195253.0160901e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054505092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2014.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmall, Christopher10aCorrelation scales of digital elevation models in developed coastal environments  ap. 80-85.  aAccuracy of digital elevation models (DEMs) often depends on how features of different spatial scales are represented. Scale dependence is particularly important in low gradient coastal environments where small vertical errors can affect large areas and where representation of fine scale topographic features can influence how DEMs are used for modeling inundation. It is commonly observed that different types of DEMs represent larger, coarse-scale topographic features similarly but differ in how they represent smaller, finer-scale features. The spatial-scale dependence of DEM accuracy can be quantified in terms of the correlation scale (λC); the spatial wavelength above which models agree with spectral coherency >0.5 and below which they differ. We compare cross spectral analyses of the GDEM2 and SRTM global DEMs with 14,572 LiDAR-derived elevations along transects in diverse coastal environments of New York City. Both global DEMs have positive bias relative to LiDAR ground elevations, but bias (μ) and uncertainty (σ) of GDEM2 (μ: 8.1m; σ: 7.6m) are significantly greater than those of SRTM (μ: 1.9m; σ: 3.6m). Cross-spectral coherency between GDEM2 and the LiDAR DEM begins to roll-off at scales of λ<~3km, while coherency between SRTM and the LiDAR DEM begins to roll-off at scales of λ<~1km. The correlation scale below which coherency with LiDAR attains a signal to noise ratio of 1 is ~1km for GDEM2 and ~0.5km for SRTM; closely matching the divergence scales where the surface roughness of the land cover exceeds the roughness of the underlying terrain.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigital elevation models 3aland cover 3alidar 3aremote sensing 3aroughness 3aspectral analysis 3asurface roughness 3atopography 3auncertainty 3awavelengths 3aNew York 0aDigital elevation model 0aDEM 0aLiDAR 0aSRTM 0aGDEM2 0aUrban 0aWetland 0aCoastal 0aTopography1 aSohn, Robert0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 159 p.80-85dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009900166300002000265500001900285520123800304592002801542650002301570650002501593650002801618650002001646650002101666650001101687650001201698650001601710650002001726700001801746700001401764700002201778700001901800700001601819700001601835700005201851773013101903856008402034852000902118655001202127IND60710991520221117203114.0200915e20200817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071099152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c024662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Yi-Fan10aAtomic Force Microscopy Based Top-Illumination Electrochemical Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy  ap. 12548-12555.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aElectrochemical tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC-TERS) is a powerful technique for the in situ study of the physiochemical properties of the electrochemical solid/liquid interface at the nanoscale and molecular level. To further broaden the potential window of EC-TERS while extending its application to opaque samples, here, we develop a top-illumination atomic force microscopy (AFM) based EC-TERStechnique by using a water-immersion objective of a high numerical aperture to introduce the excitation laser and collect the signal. This technique not only extends the application of EC-TERS but also has a high detection sensitivity and experimental efficiency. We coat a SiO₂ protection layer over the AFM-TERS tip to improve both the mechanical and chemical stability of the tip in a liquid TERS experiment. We investigate the influence of liquid on the tip–sample distance to obtain the highest TERS enhancement. We further evaluate the reliability of the as-developed EC-AFM-TERS technique by studying the electrochemical redox reaction of polyaniline. The top-illumination EC-AFM-TERS is promising for broadening the application of EC-TERS to more practical systems, including energy storage and (photo)electrocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aanalytical chemistry 3aatomic force microscopy 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aliquids 3apolyaniline 3aredox reactions1 aCao, Mao-Feng1 aWu, Si-Si1 aHuang, Teng-Xiang1 aZeng, Zhi-Cong1 aLi, Mao-Hua1 aWang, Xiang1 aRen, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9821-58640 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 17, v. 92, no. 18 p.12548-12555dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c024663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01905naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010500170300001800275520076800293592002801061650001201089650001601101650001101117650001101128650002001139650002401159700005401183700001801237700002001255700001901275700001701294700001801311773011801329856008701447852000901534655001201543IND60647699620221122031232.0190620e20190529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064769962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b010032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Shupeng10aExperimental Investigation on the Microscopic Decomposition Process of Natural Gas Hydrate Particles  ap. 5208-5215.  aHydrate decomposition is an essential part of hydrate mining and has important research significance. In this paper, hydrate thermal decomposition experiments were carried out in a self-designed high-pressure stirring hydrate reaction system, and the microscopic behaviors of the decomposition were captured by a high-speed camera. The main content of the study is the microscopic morphology of hydrate decomposition. According to the experimental data, three kinds of hydrate particles, including granular, flake, and block hydrate particles, were defined, and their decomposition behaviors were analyzed. Finally, based on the independent physical models of the three hydrate particles, physical model of the hydrate particle flow decomposition was established.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3agas hydrate 3amining 3amixing 3aphysical models 3athermal degradation1 aLi, Yuxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6400-77171 aWang, Wuchang1 aSong, Guangchun1 aShi, Zhengzhuo1 aWang, Xiaoyu1 aLichuanjushi,0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 May 29, v. 33, no. 6 p.5208-5215dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b010033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245016300172300001600335520159400351592002801945650001701973650001301990650001002003650001502013650003402028650001902062650003502081650003002116650003502146650003402181650003702215650002702252650001402279650002302293650002102316650001302337650002502350651002102375653001002396653001002406653001502416653001002431653002302441700002102464700002402485700002002509700001602529700001702545700001802562700001702580700001902597773007702616856008902693852000902782655001202791IND60531515920221119174217.0160723e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053151592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.03.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Xiangzi10aDecline in sediment contamination by persistent toxic substances from the outfall of wastewater treatment plant: Effectiveness of legislative actions in Korea  ap. 426-435.  aLegacy and new persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured in sediments near a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) outfall in a semi-enclosed bay, to investigate the current contamination and temporal changes in these contaminants associated with regulation activities in Korea. The concentrations of most of the POPs showed clear decreasing trends with an increase in the distance from the WWTP outfall, indicating that the WWTP discharges greatly contributed to the sediment contamination by POPs. Highly significant correlations were found for most of the POPs, indicating a common source for sediment contamination. Significant declines were found in the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and PAHs in the sediments collected between 2005 and 2013. This result suggested that legislative actions (regulation of the PCDD/Fs in flue gas, total pollution load management, and whole effluent toxicity for WWTP discharges) and change of fuels, were likely to be effective at reducing the POP and PAH levels in sediments during the past several years. The different compositional profiles of the PCDD/Fs and PAHs between 2005 and 2013 implied changes in and/or additional sources of these contaminants. Despite a decline in the PCDD/Fs over time, the present levels of PCDD/Fs in the sediment exceeded some of the sediment quality guidelines suggested by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  aPublisher supplied data 3adibenzofuran 3aflue gas 3afuels 3aguidelines 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apollution load 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3atemporal variation 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment 3aKorean Peninsula 0aPCDDs 0aPCDFs 0aGuidelines 0aPBDEs 0aLegislative action1 aLee, Hyun Kyung,1 aBadejo, Abimbola C.1 aLee, Sang Yoon,1 aShen, Aihua1 aLee, Sunggyu1 aJeong, Yunsun1 aChoi, Minkyu1 aMoon, Hyo-Bang0 tChemosphere.g2016 June, v. 153 p.426-435dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.03.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245008300209300001400292506007600306520043900382592002800821506003700849650001000886650001900896650001700915650001600932650002400948650001600972650001700988650001901005650001701024650003101041650001201072650001301084650001401097650001501111650001001126653001701136653001901153653001601172653002001188700002201208700001501230700001701245700001801262700001901280700001801299700001901317700001601336700001501352700002201367700002201389773010801411856008301519852000901602655001201611IND60670404920221207065355.0200128e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067040492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mmcr.2019.09.0062doi7 aPMC68120352pmcid7 a316670582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGargouri, Marwa10aCombination of amphotericin B and caspofungin in the treatment of mucormycosis  ap. 32-37.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe report a case of invasive mucormycosis in 52 year-old woman.

Breast cancer usually metastasizes to the skeleton, interrupts the normal bone remodeling process and causes osteolytic bone lesions. The aims of the present study were to evaluate its herb-drug interaction with metronomic zoledronate in preventing cancer propagation, metastasis and bone destruction.Mice inoculated with human breast cancer cells tagged with a luciferase (MDA-MB-231-TXSA) in tibia were treated with CV aqueous extract, mZOL, or the combination of both for 4 weeks. Alteration of the luciferase signals in tibia, liver and lung were quantified using the IVIS imaging system. The skeletal response was evaluated using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). In vitro experiments were carried out to confirm the in vivo findings.Results showed that combination of CV and mZOL diminished tumor growth without increasing the incidence of lung and liver metastasis in intratibial breast tumor model. The combination therapy also reserved the integrity of bones. In vitro studies demonstrated that combined use of CV and mZOL inhibited cancer cell proliferation and osteoclastogenesis.These findings suggested that combination treatment of CV and mZOL attenuated breast tumor propagation, protected against osteolytic bone lesion without significant metastases. This study provides scientific evidences on the beneficial outcome of using CV together with mZOL in the management of breast cancer and metastasis, which may lead to the development of CV as adjuvant health supplement for the control of breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aadjuvants 3aanimal models 3abreast neoplasms 3acell proliferation 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aimmune system 3ain vitro studies 3aliver 3aluciferase 3ametastasis 3amicro-computed tomography 3amushrooms 3aneoplasm cells 3askeleton 3atherapeutics 3atibia 3atraditional medicine 0aBreast tumor 0aTraditional Chinese medicines 0aCoriolus versicolor 0aZoledronic acid 0aCombination therapy1 aYue, Grace Gar-Lee1 aGao, Si1 aLuo, Ke-Wang1 aSiu, Wing-Sum1 aShum, Wai-Ting1 aShiu, Hoi-Ting1 aLee, Julia Kin-Ming1 aLi, Gang1 aLeung, Ping-Chung1 aEvdokiou, Andreas1 aLau, Clara Bik-San0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2017 May 23, v. 204 p.77-85dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245016400170300001600334520091300350592002801263650001501291650001101306650001001317650001701327650000901344650001001353650001501363650000901378650001601387650001701403650001501420650001401435650001301449651001801462700002201480700002601502700001801528773012101546856008201667852000901749655001201758IND60780189520221122172650.0220616e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078018952DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452220301712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasil’eva, E.

However, such a promising perspective is poorly investigated in the tropical context. Here we examine the role played by urban green areas in a major city (Recife-Brazil) as a repository for Atlantic forest biodiversity relative to pollination systems. Plant assemblages were examined across 17 urban green areas and compared to those from ten old-growth forest stands in the largest Atlantic forest remnant in northeastern Brazil (natural areas). Just a small portion of tree species inhabiting urban green areas is native to the northeastern Brazilian Atlantic forest (29.8 %). At plant community-level, squares and parks were impoverished in terms of number of species and individuals with specialized pollination systems (e.g. bats, Sphingids), as compared to forest remnants. Moreover, urban green areas were dominated by generalist-pollinated trees with reproductive traits associated with easily accessible floral resources and an increase of hermaphrodites. Finally, squares and parks had similarly low functional diversity of reproductive traits. Our results suggest that urban green areas support largely distorted and impoverished tree assemblages in terms of floral rewards and pollination, while services are restricted to those offered by generalist small insects. This pattern emerges mainly from the contribution of exotic plants. This largely limits the tropical urban green areas as biodiversity repositories and potential source for specialized pollination services, what calls for a better use of tropical urban areas as conservation tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem services 3aforest stands 3afunctional diversity 3agreen infrastructure 3ahermaphroditism 3aindigenous species 3ainsects 3aintroduced plants 3aold-growth forests 3apollination 3areproductive traits 3asocial welfare 3atrees 3aurban areas 3aurban parks 3aBrazil 0aExotic plants 0aFloral traits 0aNative plants 0aTropical urban ecosystem1 aSilva, Jéssica L.S.1 aCruz-Neto, Oswaldo1 aBorges, Laís A.1 aGirão, Luciana C.1 aTabarelli, Marcelo1 aLopes, Ariadna V.0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2020 Oct., v. 54 p.126779-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2020.1267793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245013100175500001900306520100100325592002801326650001501354650002501369650002301394650001401417650001701431650001901448650001301467650001301480650001901493650001401512653001801526653001001544653001301554653001701567653002301584700002501607700001901632700002501651700001501676700002201691773010001713856008701813852000901900655001201909IND60734887020221120180544.0210603e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073488702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1298022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpychaj, Radosław10aPotential valorization of Cornelian cherry (Cornus mas L.) stones: Roasting and extraction of bioactive and volatile compounds  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aimed to characterize the antioxidant potential, bioactive and volatile compounds of the stones from fruits of Cornus mas.Both fresh and roasted stones show a high antioxidant potential (166.48–509.74 μmol TE/g dw stones), which significantly depends on the cultivars. The roasted stones preserved 43.6% (DPPH; ‘Raciborski’) to 97.2% (FRAP; ‘Alesha’) of the antioxidant activity of the non-roasted stones. In the stones, two iridoids and ellagic acid were determined. During roasting, loganic acid remained stable, whereas cornuside was completely degraded. The analyses showed a 30-fold increase in the concentration of ellagic acid and in the formation of two of its derivatives. The major aroma compound of the roasted stones was furfural, but we also identified 18 pyrazine derivatives.This study is the first attempt to valorize Cornelian cherry stones via roasting. The roasted stones can be a coffee substitute, or aromatic and bioactive additions to cereal coffees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCornus mas 3aantioxidant activity 3acoffee substitutes 3acultivars 3aellagic acid 3afood chemistry 3afurfural 3airidoids 3aodor compounds 3apyrazines 0aCornus mas L. 0aStone 0aRoasting 0aAntioxidants 0aVolatile compounds1 aKucharska, Alicja Z.1 aSzumny, Antoni1 aPrzybylska, Dominika1 aPejcz, Ewa1 aPiórecki, Narcyz0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 358 p.129802-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1298023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245007700211300001400288506007600302520057000378592002800948506003700976650001601013650001401029650001301043650001701056650001501073650001001088650001301098650001001111650001501121650001201136650001301148650003001161650001001191653002001201653001701221653001201238653001601250653002301266700002201289700002401311700002201335700002401357700001901381773010801400856008301508852000901591655001201600IND60670405120221207062425.0200128e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067040512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mmcr.2019.09.0042doi7 aPMC68120222pmcid7 a316670562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTambuzzi, Stefano10aFungal aneurism of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA)  ap. 25-27.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this case-report, the Authors show the case of a sudden death occurred in a 38-year-old woman submitted to surgical excision of a right acoustic neurinoma.

Basin wildrye [Leymus cinereus (Scribn. & Merr.) Á. Löve] and creeping wildrye [L. triticoides (Buckley) Pilg.] are perennial Triticeae grasses native to western North America. In this study, variation in the number of florets per inflorescence, percent seed set, seed mass, seed shattering, and seed dormancy was measured in clonally replicated multiyear field evaluations of 164 progeny derived from a backcross between a creeping × basin wildrye hybrid and a true creeping wildrye tester. Genomewide quantitative trait locus (QTL) scans detected independent gene effects for all five traits and one pleiotropic QTL, located on Triticeae homeologous chromosome group 6, associated with major seed shattering (43.1% R ², 26.9 log of odds likelihood ratio [LOD]) and seed dormancy (24.1% R ², 10.6 LOD) effects. We hypothesize that a dominant basin wildrye gene creates an abscission that promotes seed disarticulation but hinders seed development and seed ripening in the creeping wildrye backcross family. Alignments of Leymus chromosome 6 expressed sequence tag markers to the rice (Oryza) genome reveal well-defined correspondence of Leymus wildrye and American wildrice (Zizania palustris L.) seed shatter QTLs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative trait loci 3ainflorescences 3aseed dormancy 3ahybrids 3aforage crops 3aperennials 3apleiotropy 3achromosomes 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aforage grasses 3aLeymus cinereus 3aseed shattering 3aLeymus triticoides 3aseed set 3agenetic markers1 aKellogg, Elizabeth Anne,0 tCrop science.g2009 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.29-40dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/279903Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2008.05.02773Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04127naa a2201021 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011800165300001600283520150400299592002801803650002401831650001601855650003401871650002101905650001701926650002301943650002001966650003101986650003502017650001402052650002102066650004302087650002102130650002002151650001302171650001802184650002402202650001702226650004902243650004002292653001202332653000802344653000902352653000702361653001002368653000902378653000802387653000802395653000902403653000902412653000802421653001002429653000802439653000902447653000802456653001002464653000902474653000902483653000802492653000802500653000802508653000902516653000902525653000702534653000902541653000702550653000902557653000902566653001002575653000802585653000702593653003202600653001702632653001402649653001002663653001802673653001402691700001802705700001902723700001702742700001802759700001702777700001302794700001302807700001702820700001802837700001402855700001802869773011502887856008203002852000903084655001203093IND60567217320221122122026.0180830e20170523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056721732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2017.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Zhu-Ming10aDalbergia odorifera extract promotes angiogenesis through upregulation of VEGFRs and PI3K/MAPK signaling pathways  ap. 132-141.  aThe heart wood of Dalbergia odorifera is a Chinese herbal medicine commonly used for the treatment of various ischemic diseases in Chinese medicine practice.In this study, therapeutic angiogenesis effects of the Dalbergia odorifera extract (DOE) were investigated on transgenic zebrafish in vivo and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro.The pro-angiogenic effects of DOE on zebrafish were examined by subintestinal vessels (SIVs) sprouting assay and intersegmental vessels (ISVs) injury assay. And the pro-angiogenic effects of DOE on HUVECs were examined by MTT, scratch assay, protein chip and western blot.In the in vivo studies, we found that DOE was able to dose-dependently promote angiogenesis in zebrafish SIVs area. In addition, DOE could also restore the injury in zebrafish ISVs area and upregulate the reduced mRNA expression of VEGFRs including kdr, kdrl and flt-1 induced by VEGF receptor kinase inhibitor II (VRI). In the in vitro studies, we observed that DOE promoted the proliferation, migration of HUVECs and also restored the injury induced by VRI. Moreover, protein chip and western blot experiments showed the PI3K/MAPK cell proliferation/migration pathway were activated by DOE.DOE has a therapeutic effects on angiogenesis, and its mechanism may be related to adjusting the VEGFRs mRNA and activation of PI3K/MAPK signaling pathway. These results suggest a strong potential for Dalbergia odorifera to be developed as an angiogenesis-promoting therapeutic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDalbergia odorifera 3aDanio rerio 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aWestern blotting 3aangiogenesis 3acell proliferation 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenetically modified organisms 3aheartwood 3aherbal medicines 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3aischemia 3amessenger RNA 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptors 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aAkt/PKB 0aBCA 0acDNA 0aDA 0aDLAVs 0aDMSO 0aDOE 0adpf 0aECGS 0aEGFR 0aFBS 0aGSK-3 0ahpf 0aHPLC 0aHRP 0aHUVEC 0aISVs 0amRNA 0aMTT 0aPCR 0aPCV 0aPI3K 0aPMSF 0aPS 0aRIPA 0aRt 0aSIVs 0aVEGF 0aVEGFR 0aVRI 0aWT 0aDalbergia odorifera extract 0aAngiogenesis 0aZebrafish 0aHUVEC 0aVEGF receptor 0aPI3K/MAPK1 aWang, Da-Ying1 aYang, Jian-Mei1 aLin, Zhi-Xiu1 aLin, Yun-Xiao1 aYang, Ai-Lin1 aFan, Hua1 aCao, Min1 aYuan, Su-yun1 aLiu, Zong-jun1 aZhou, Xin1 aWang, You-Hua0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2017 May 23, v. 204 p.132-141dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245008700172300001600259520118000275592002801455650001101483650001101494650001101505650000901516650001101525650001501536650000901551653001201560653000801572653000801580653001101588653002401599653003201623700001401655700001601669700001701685773010801702856009001810852000901900655001201909IND60562782520221118072008.0190405e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056278252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2017.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlhamada, M.10aAutomatic oestrus detection system enables monitoring of sexual behaviour in sheep  ap. 105-111.  aAn experiment was conducted to observe the oestrous behaviour in ewes through an automated oestrus detection system. Five mature adult Merino male rams, equipped with an electronic detector (Alpha-D), were included with a total of 60 ewes from the same breed. The libido of the males was assessed as the number and frequency of mounts. The accepted mountings by ewes were recorded by an electronic identifier worn by the female. In the first synchronized oestrus (C1), the ewes were exposed to rams wearing an anti-mating apron. In the following spontaneous cycle (C2), all the rams were allowed to mate. In the third cycle (C3) and the fourth cycle (C4), the rams were assumed to detect ewes in oestrus (open ewes). After the exclusion of isolated readings, the mean interval from sponge withdrawal to onset of oestrus was 31±11h and duration of oestrus in C1–C3 was 22±18, 16±11 and 16±8h, respectively. The libido differed widely among the rams and cycles number with an average number of mounts per ram in C1–C4, that were 213, 322, 85 and 3 respectively. It is concluded that all the females were correctly detected and the assessed libido of males was repeated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3aadults 3aestrus 3aewes 3alibido 3amonitoring 3arams 0aOestrus 0aEwe 0aRam 0aLibido 0aPregnancy diagnosis 0aAutomated oestrus detection1 aDebus, N.1 aLurette, A.1 aBocquier, F.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2017 Apr., v. 149 p.105-111dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2017.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009900160300002000259520116900279592002801448650002301476650002201499650000901521650001301530650001401543650001401557650001901571650001201590700001901602700001901621700001901640700002201659700002301681773013401704856007501838852000901913655001201922IND60539042420221122094039.0160815e20131211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053904242DNAL7 a10.1021/ja411050r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKempa, Thomas J.10aFacet-Selective Growth on Nanowires Yields Multi-Component Nanostructures and Photonic Devices  ap. 18354-18357.  aEnhanced synthetic control of the morphology, crystal structure, and composition of nanostructures can drive advances in nanoscale devices. Axial and radial semiconductor nanowires are examples of nanostructures with one and two structural degrees of freedom, respectively, and their synthetically tuned and modulated properties have led to advances in nanotransistor, nanophotonic, and thermoelectric devices. Similarly, developing methods that allow for synthetic control of greater than two degrees of freedom could enable new opportunities for functional nanostructures. Here we demonstrate the first regioselective nanowire shell synthesis in studies of Ge and Si growth on faceted Si nanowire surfaces. The selectively deposited Ge is crystalline, and its facet position can be synthetically controlled in situ. We use this synthesis to prepare electrically addressable nanocavities into which solution soluble species such as Au nanoparticles can be incorporated. The method furnishes multicomponent nanostructures with unique photonic properties and presents a more sophisticated nanodevice platform for future applications in catalysis and photodetection.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3agold 3ananogold 3ananowires 3aphotonics 3asemiconductors 3asilicon1 aKim, Sun-Kyung1 aDay, Robert W.1 aPark, Hong-Gyu1 aNocera, Daniel G.1 aLieber, Charles M.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Dec. 11, v. 135, no. 49 p.18354-18357dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja411050r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245017200216300001800388520132300406592002801729650002001757650002401777650002501801650002701826650001201853650001601865650001301881650000901894650002801903650001601931650001901947650001401966650001601980650001001996650002002006650001302026650001502039650001302054650001902067700002802086700007702114700003002191700001802221700006502239773012502304856008302429852000902512655001202521IND60780189920221122172702.0220616e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078018992DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-021-02906-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHedayati, Seyed Aliakbar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7658-531410aEffect of Dietary Lactobacillus casei on Physiometabolic Responses and Liver Histopathology in Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) After Exposure to Iron Oxide Nanoparticles  ap. 3346-3354.  aA 60-day feeding trial was performed to assess the dietary effect of Lactobacillus casei as a probiotic supplement on some serum biochemical parameters and liver histopathology in common carp fry after exposure to iron oxide nanoparticles (IoNPs). Six treatments were prepared as follows: control (no IoNP exposure and no dietary probiotic), P6: 10⁶ CFU/g probiotic diet, P7: 10⁷ CFU/g probiotic diet, NPs: 0.15 mg/l IoNPs, NPs + P6: 0.15 mg/l IoNPs with 10⁶ CFU/g probiotic diet, and NPs + P7: 0.15 mg/l IoNPs with 10⁷ CFU/gprobiotic diet. Based on the results, serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly increased in 0.15 mg/l IoNPs, P7, and NPs + P6 treatments compared to the control group. In addition, the examination of antioxidant enzymes showed a significant increase in the levels of cortisol and glutathione S-transferase as well as malondialdehyde level. IoNPs also caused significant histopathological changes in the fish liver during the experiment such as hyperemia in sinusoidal spaces, hepatocytes vacuolation and necrosis, pyknosis, and disruption of hepatic lobules and atrophy. Results revealed the protective effects of dietary L. casei to mitigate the adverse impacts of IoNPs on the physiological processes of common carp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aLactobacillus casei 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3aatrophy 3ablood serum 3acortisol 3adiet 3aglutathione transferase 3ahepatocytes 3ahistopathology 3ahyperemia 3airon oxides 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3anecrosis 3aprobiotics 3aresearch 3atrace elements1 aSheikh Veisi, Rouhollah1 aHosseini Shekarabi, Seyed Pezhman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6407-40041 aShahbazi Naserabad, Saeid1 aBagheri, Dara1 aGhafarifarsani, Hamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1199-61090 tBiological trace element research.g2022 July, v. 200, no. 7 p.3346-3354dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-021-02906-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04634naa a2201021 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010000163300001400263520210200277592002802379650002302407650003402430650002502464650001202489650001802501650000902519650001502528650002402543650001602567650001902583650001602602650001302618650001402631650001302645650001002658650001302668650001402681650001302695650001002708650001202718650001902730650002402749650002102773650001302794650001602807650002202823650000902845650001202854650003602866650003802902653000802940653001002948653000802958653000802966653000902974653001002983653000902993653001003002653001003012653000803022653001003030653000903040653001103049653000803060653001003068653001003078653000803088653000803096653001103104653001103115653000903126653001003135653001203145653001103157653001103168653000903179653001103188653001603199653002003215653001503235653002003250700001703270700002003287700001703307700001903324700001603343700001703359700002003376773011303396856008203509852000903591655001203600IND60567217520221122084913.0180830e20170523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056721752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2017.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ya-Yu10aGlechoma hederacea extracts attenuate cholestatic liver injury in a bile duct-ligated rat model  ap. 58-66.  aIn traditional Chinese medicine, Glechoma hederacea is frequently prescribed to patients with cholelithiasis, dropsy, abscess, diabetes, inflammation, and jaundice. Polyphenolic compounds are main bioactive components of Glechoma hederacea.This study was aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective potential of hot water extract of Glechoma hederacea against cholestatic liver injury in rats.Cholestatic liver injury was produced by ligating common bile ducts in Sprague-Dawley rats. Saline and hot water extract of Glechoma hederacea were orally administrated using gastric gavages. Liver tissues and bloods were collected and subjected to evaluation using histological, molecular, and biochemical approaches.Using a rat model of cholestasis caused by bile duct ligation (BDL), daily oral administration of Glechoma hederacea hot water extracts showed protective effects against cholestatic liver injury, as evidenced by the improvement of serum biochemicals, ductular reaction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. Glechoma hederacea extracts alleviated BDL-induced transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1), connective tissue growth factor, and collagen expression, and the anti-fibrotic effects were accompanied by reductions in α-smooth muscle actin-positive matrix-producing cells and Smad2/3 activity. Glechoma hederacea extracts attenuated BDL-induced inflammatory cell infiltration/accumulation, NF-κB and AP-1 activation, and inflammatory cytokine production. Further studies demonstrated an inhibitory effect of Glechoma hederacea extracts on the axis of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1)/toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) intracellular signaling pathways.The hepatoprotective, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects of Glechoma hederacea extracts seem to be multifactorial. The beneficial effects of daily Glechoma hederacea extracts supplementation were associated with anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic potential, as well as down-regulation of NF-κB, AP-1, and TGF-β/Smad signaling, probably via interference with the HMGB1/TLR4 axis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlechoma hederacea 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aabscess 3aanimal models 3abile 3abile ducts 3abioactive compounds 3ablood serum 3acholelithiasis 3acholestasis 3acollagen 3acytokines 3adiabetes 3aedema 3afibrosis 3ahistology 3ajaundice 3aliver 3amuscles 3anucleoproteins 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3apolyphenols 3aprotective effect 3arats 3atissues 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aALT 0aANOVA 0aAST 0aBDL 0aCTGF 0aELISA 0aEMSA 0aGAPDH 0aγ-GT 0aH&E 0aHMGB1 0aHPLC 0aIL-1β 0aMDA 0aMMP-2 0aMMP-9 0aMPO 0aROS 0aRT-PCR 0aα-SMA 0aTAK1 0aTBARS 0aTGF-β1 0aTIMP-1 0aTIMP-2 0aTLR4 0aTNF-α 0aCholestasis 0aHerbal medicine 0aPolyphenol 0aRosmarinic acid1 aLin, Shih-Yi1 aLeung, Katrina,1 aLiao, Su-Lan1 aWu, Chih-Cheng1 aPan, Pin-Ho1 aChou, Su-Tze1 aChen, Chun-Jung0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2017 May 23, v. 204 p.58-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245008600172300001600258520128100274592002801555650001501583650001901598650001501617650001101632650001001643650001801653650004301671650001101714650001201725650001501737650001201752650006601764650001501830650002101845650001301866700001801879700001901897700002001916700002001936773010701956856008702063852000902150655001202159IND60087695420221118065209.0141102e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008769542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2013.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Kyoung Ro10aExpression and N-glycan analysis of human 90K glycoprotein in Drosophila S2 cells  ap. 170-173.  aHuman 90K (h90K; Mac-2-binding protein) glycoprotein is a potential pharmaceutical due to its inhibitory activity against cancer metastasis and expansion. Here, h90K glycoprotein was produced in insect Drosophila S2 cell system, and its N-glycan pattern was analyzed. A plasmid encoding h90K gene, fused with a hexahistidine tag under the control of Drosophila metallotionein promoter, was stably transfected into S2 cells. After copper sulfate induction, transfected S2 cells secreted recombinant h90K at a good expression level of 28mg/L in a 150-mL spinner flask culture. The purified recombinant h90K showed an apparent molecular weight of ∼78kDa which was much smaller than that (∼97kDa) of the natural h90K. Because de-N-glycosylated h90K appeared at ∼60kDa protein band, it was suggested that the recombinant h90K from S2 cells has small N-glycans with about half the molecular weight (∼18kDa) of N-glycans of the natural h90K. Through detail analyses using high-performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the S2-derived recombinant h90K was confirmed that it has simple paucimannosidic structures containing two or three mannose residues with core fucose as the major (∼79%) N-glycans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3acopper sulfate 3adesorption 3afucose 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ainsects 3aionization 3amannose 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3ametastasis 3amolecular weight 3aplasmids1 aKim, Yeon Kyu1 aCheong, Hogyun1 aKim, Jaoon Y.H.1 aCha, Hyung Joon0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 53, no. 3 p.170-173dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2013.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010200170520093200272592002801204650002101232650001101253650001601264650001901280650001201299650002201311650002101333650001801354650000901372650002101381650001601402653001101418653001901429653001501448653001601463653002201479653001501501700002101516700002801537700002501565700002301590773010001613856008701713852000901800655001201809IND60734887320221120194722.0210813e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073488732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1298102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Haixia10aValidated B vitamin quantification from lentils by selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry  aA validated method for B vitamin separation and quantification from lentil seeds using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (UHPLC-SRM MS) was reported. The use of three enzymes (acid phosphatase, β-glucosidase, and rat serum) with a 4 h incubation was sufficient to convert bound B vitamins into their free forms. Twenty B vitamers were selected and a 5-min UHPLC-SRM MS method was optimized for rapid analysis. This method was applied to quantify B vitamin concentration during lentil seed germination over a 5-day period. Total B vitamins increased up to 1.5-fold on day 5 (from 39.2 µg/g to 60.6 µg/g of dry weight) comparing with dry seeds. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) was the most abundant B vitamin in both dry seeds (34.2%) and in germinated seeds (17.7%-24.5% of total B vitamins); B8 (biotin) and B12 (cyanocobalamin) were not detected in lentil samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid phosphatase 3abiotin 3ablood serum 3afood chemistry 3alentils 3amass spectrometry 3apantothenic acid 3arapid methods 3arats 3aseed germination 3avitamin B12 0aLentil 0aQuantification 0aB vitamins 0aGermination 0aMass spectrometry 0aValidation1 aDe Silva, Devini1 aDissanayaka, Dilanganie1 aWarkentin, Thomas D.1 aVandenberg, Albert0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 359 p.129810-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1298103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245005500172300001600227520081800243592002801061650001101089650002001100650001301120650001201133650001901145650001201164650002301176650001301199650001801212650001501230651001801245653001201263653001601275653002301291653001801314653001801332653002601350700002801376700001901404700002301423700002001446700002101466773011701487856008701604961001201691852000901703655001201712IND60562782820221118071843.0200330e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056278282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhimire, Ramesh10aGreen Space and Adult Obesity in the United States  ap. 201-212.  aThis paper estimates the relationship between green space and body mass index (BMI) in the U.S. We find that accounting for the heterogeneity of green space matters: BMI is significantly lower in counties with larger forestland per-capita, but not in those more abundant in rangeland, pastureland or cropland. This is after controlling for state-specific heterogeneity, and a range of environmental and natural amenities, including the presence of state parks, proximity to national parks, and outdoor recreation resources in the county, all of which have the expected negative correlation with BMI. Hence, the findings suggest that forests, public recreation lands, along with publicly available outdoor recreation resources can be valuable resources to help reduce obesity and associated public health problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody mass index 3acropland 3aforests 3anational parks 3aobesity 3aoutdoor recreation 3apastures 3apublic health 3arangelands 3aUnited States 0aForests 0aGreen space 0aOutdoor recreation 0aPublic health 0aAdult obesity 0aBody mass index (BMI)1 aFerreira, S.q(Susana),1 aGreen, Gary T.1 aPoudyal, Neelam C.1 aCordell, H.

Under certain culture conditions they can accumulate neutral lipids, which are mainly triglycerides (TAG). Microbial TAG that can be used as raw material for biodiesel synthesis are attractive for the biofuel industry. In this study, the ability to synthesize lipids of Rhodotorula glutinis R4, isolated in Antarctica, was compared with eight strains belonging to the genera Rhodotorula and Yarrowia with the aim of proposing a novel source of oils for biodiesel synthesis. All strains were cultured under nitrogen (N) limiting conditions and an excess of carbon (C) in the culture medium. We found that yeasts accumulated between 9–48.9 % (w/w) of lipids. Among them, R. glutinis R4 showed the highest growth (14 g L⁻¹, μmax 0,092 h⁻¹) and lipid production (7 g L⁻¹; 47 % w/w). Microbial oils produced by R. glutinis R4 are similar to vegetable oils, with 61 % of oleic acid, indicating that it is adequate for biodiesel synthesis. Our results demonstrate that biodiesel derived from R. glutinis R4 complies with international fuel standards ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. Therefore, this work demonstrates that Rhodotorula glutinis R4 is a novel and valuable source of microbial oils for biodiesel synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodotorula glutinis 3aYarrowia 3abiodiesel 3abioenergy industry 3acarbon 3aculture media 3amicrobial oils 3anitrogen 3aoleic acid 3araw materials 3atriacylglycerols 3avegetable oil 3ayeasts 3aAntarctica 0aFAME 0aFA 0aSCO 0aFID 0aTAG 0aSFA 0aMUFA 0aPUFA 0aCN 0aIV 0aOS 0aCFPP 0aHHV 0aAUC 0aYAN 0aRhodotorula 0aMicrobial lipids 0aSingle cell oils 0aBiodiesel 0aOleaginous yeast 0aAntarctica 0aThird generation biodiesel1 aViñarta, Silvana C.1 aSu, Ying1 aGuillamón, José Manuel1 aAybar, Manuel J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7187-64350 tJournal of biotechnology.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 310 p.21-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2020.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01552naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245013000163300002000293520055300313592002800866650001100894650002800905650001900933700001900952700002400971700001900995700001801014773013401032856007501166852000901241655001201250IND60539042620221122094110.0160815e20131211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053904262DNAL7 a10.1021/ja411503c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, Daniel

The study was carried out at rice granaries in Bagan Serai, Perak state of Malaysia during harvesting seasons. Actual field speed of rice combine harvester as daily practiced by the operator was recorded through field observation measurements. Besides that, its influence on grain loss in paddy field was also evaluated. The findings of the study found that the combine harvester field speeds in rice harvesting under Malaysian paddy field conditions ranged from 3.87 km/h to 6.11 km/h. While, the best field speed was noticed to be 3.87 km/h, which contributed only 0.67% grain loss or equal to MYR8.04/ha (USD 1.96/ha) of profit losses. The field speed also showed a linear relationship with grain loss. Conclusively, the results can encourage the improvement of mechanization quality in an effort to reduce rice farmer’s profit losses through minimizing grain loss in rice harvesting.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombine harvesters 3afarmers 3amechanization 3apaddies 3arice 3aMalaysia 0aCombine harvester 0aGrain loss 0aPaddy cultivation 0aHarvesting1 aEl Pebrian, Darius1 aJohari, Nor Azi Asminda0 tJournal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences.g2020 Sept., v. 19, no. 6 p.422-425dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23282x1658-077X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssas.2020.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01737naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010000168300001600268520064800284592002800932650002100960650001600981650001300997650001401010650003001024650002201054650001101076650001501087650002101102650001401123700002501137700001701162773010601179856008101285852000901366655001201375IND60083228220221120191724.0141101e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008322822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2012.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarlhofer, Julia10aReduced activity of juvenile hormone esterase in microsporidia-infected Lymantria dispar larvae  ap. 126-128.  aInfection of the fat body of Lymantria dispar (Lep.: Lymantriinae) larvae with the microsporidium Vairimorpha disparis has severe effects on juvenile hormone (JH) metabolism of the host.

In Brazil, 53% of all remaining native vegetation is on private farms, reinforcing the importance of these stakeholders. The aim of this study was to identify landowners’ perceptions of the native areas on their properties as sources of ESs, to support future conservationist management strategies. We tested whether personal variables (gender, age and years of formal education), and farm characteristics (type and size) were determinant in their perceptions. We interviewed 75 landowners in the Brazilian savanna region, using a questionnaire and paired images strategy (e.g., pictures of soybean cultivation with and without native forest vegetation). Our analyses revealed that landowners perceive native areas as providing ESs. Gender, age and size of farm did not affect the landowners’ perceptions of ESs. However, we observed that years of formal education increased the chance of perceiving ESs which are more difficult to observe (pollination and pest regulation). Those services may require more scientific background to be understood. These results highlight with regard to perception of some ESs, education is a stronger factor than experience based on land-use activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3aecosystem services 3aeducation 3afarms 3aforests 3agender 3aindigenous species 3ainterviews 3aland use 3alandowners 3alandscapes 3apests 3apollination 3aquestionnaires 3asavannas 3asoybeans 3astakeholders 3aBrazil 0aCerrado biome 0aAgricultural areas 0aEnvironmental perception 0aStakeholder perception 0aBiodiversity1 aBastos, Rogério Pereira0 tEcosystem services.g2019 Dec., v. 40 p.101029-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.1010293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01975naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007000168300001600238520080400254592002801058650002401086650002501110650001301135650001501148650002301163650001301186650001001199650001501209650002101224651001401245651001201259700001901271700002501290700001901315700001701334700001801351773010601369856008101475852000901556655001201565IND60083228320221120191609.0141101e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008322832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2012.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntúnez, Karina10aAmerican Foulbrood in Uruguay: Twelve years from its first report  ap. 129-131.  aPaenibacillus larvae is the causative agent of American Foulbrood (AFB), a deleterious disease that affects honeybees. In Uruguay it was first reported in 1999. In 2001 the bacterium was spread all over the country, and its prevalence in honey was estimated in 51%. Two P. larvae genotypes were found; ERIC I – BOX A, worldwide distributed and ERIC I – BOX C, exclusively detected in Argentina until then. In the present manuscript we analyzed the evolution of AFB outbreaks from 1999 to 2009, presented a new nation-wide survey carried out during 2011 when a prevalence of 2% was found and discuss national strategies for prevention of the disease. Since Uruguay is a small country where almost all beekeepers are registered, Uruguayan experience can be useful to be applied in other countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmerican foul brood 3aPaenibacillus larvae 3abacteria 3abeekeepers 3adisease prevention 3agenotype 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3anational surveys 3aArgentina 3aUruguay1 aAnido, Matilde1 aBranchiccela, Belén1 aHarriet, Jorge1 aCampá, Juan1 aZunino, Pablo0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2012 May, v. 110, no. 1 p.129-131dElsevier Inc.x0022-20117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2012.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002300163245007700186300001600263520139000279592002801669650002001697650001601717650001301733650001201746650002201758650000901780650001001789650001201799650000901811650002201820650002101842650005901863650003901922650008101961650001102042650001102053650002402064650000902088650001602097700002202113700001902135773011102154852000902265856008102274655001202355IND4420880320221117051514.0181206e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442088032DNAL7 a193668612pmid7 a10.1177/01457217093338572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChasens, Eileen R.10aDaytime Sleepiness and Functional Outcomes in Older Adults With Diabetes  ap. 455-464.  aPurpose This secondary analysis examined the effect of excessive sleepiness on daytime function in older adults with diabetes from the National Sleep Foundation's Sleep and Aging poll. Methods Respondents were older adults (N = 1506; age range, 55-84 years) evaluated by telephone survey on their sleep duration, sleep disturbances, daytime functional outcomes, and self-reported height, weight, and comorbidities. Results Approximately 16% (n = 244) of the sample acknowledged a diagnosis of diabetes; they were older, had more comorbidities, had a higher body mass index (BMI), and were more likely to be sleepy during the daytime than nondiabetic respondents (all P < .05). Respondents with diabetes who reported frequent daytime sleepiness (n = 50; 20%) had significantly (P < .05) higher BMI, lower self-rated health, and more sleep disturbances than those who were not sleepy (n = 194). Sleepy respondents with diabetes also reported more frequent feelings of depression, decreased pleasure in life, naps, feeling drowsy, or dozing off while driving (all P < .05). Excessive sleepiness was significantly associated (P < .001) with an increased risk for depressive symptoms while controlling for BMI, age, and number of comorbidities. Conclusions These results indicate that sleep disturbances affect not only sleep quality but also daytime function in older adults with diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3acomorbidity 3adiabetes 3aelderly 3amental depression 3arisk 3asleep 3asurveys 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aDiabetes Complicationsxepidemiologyxphysiopathology. 2aDiabetes Mellitusxphysiopathology 2aDisorders of Excessive Somnolencexdiagnosisxepidemiologyxphysiopathology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInterviews as Topic 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged1 aSereika, Susan M.1 aBurke, Lora E.0 tDiabetes educator.g2009 May, v. 35, no. 3 p.455-464dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217093338573Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03449naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013300163300001600296520181100312592002802123650001902151650001502170650001802185650001602203650001902219650002202238650001102260650001302271650002602284650001502310650001302325650001802338650001002356650001002366650001002376650001402386650003002400650001502430650001802445650002202463650002202485650002302507650002202530700002302552700002102575700001902596700002202615700002002637700001902657700001702676773008802693856008102781852000902862655001202871IND60575672220221121221920.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057567222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-016-0869-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHubert, Jan10aChanges in the Bacteriome of Honey Bees Associated with the Parasite Varroa destructor, and Pathogens Nosema and Lotmaria passim  ap. 685-698.  aThe honey bee, Apis mellifera, is a globally important species that suffers from a variety of pathogens and parasites. These parasites and pathogens may have sublethal effects on their bee hosts via an array of mechanisms, including through a change in symbiotic bacterial taxa. Our aim was to assess the influence of four globally widespread parasites and pathogens on the honey bee bacteriome. We examined the effects of the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, the fungal pathogens Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae, and the trypanosome Lotmaria passim. Varroa was detected by acaricidal treatment, Nosema and L. passim by PCR, and the bacteriome using MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Overall, the 1,858,850 obtained sequences formed 86 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 3 % dissimilarity. Location, time of year, and degree of infestation by Varroa had significant effects on the composition of the bacteriome of honey bee workers. Based on statistical correlations, we found varroosis more important factor than N. ceranae, N. apis, and L. passim infestation influencing the honey bee bacteriome and contributing to the changes in the composition of the bacterial community in adult bees. At the population level, Varroa appeared to modify 20 OTUs. In the colonies with high Varroa infestation levels (varroosis), the relative abundance of the bacteria Bartonella apis and Lactobacillus apis decreased. In contrast, an increase in relative abundance was observed for several taxa including Lactobacillus helsingborgensis, Lactobacillus mellis, Commensalibacter intestini, and Snodgrassella alvi. The results showed that the “normal” bacterial community is altered by eukaryotic parasites as well as displaying temporal changes and changes associated with the geographical origin of the beehive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aBartonella 3aLactobacillus 3aNosema apis 3aNosema ceranae 3aVarroa destructor 3aadults 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abacteriome 3abeehives 3aectoparasites 3afungi 3ahosts 3amites 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprovenance 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asublethal effects 3atemporal variation 3aworker honey bees1 aBicianova, Martina1 aLedvinka, Ondrej1 aKamler, Martin1 aLester, Philip J.1 aNesvorna, Marta1 aKopecký, Jan,1 aErban, Tomas0 tMicrobial ecology.g2017 Apr., v. 73, no. 3 p.685-698dSpringer USx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-016-0869-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001900167245012700186300001600313500001500329520123900344592002801583650000901611650001701620650004301637650001201680650001301692650002001705650001201725650001401737650003501751650001601786650001701802650004001819650001101859650003201870650003601902650002301938651001101961653000701972653000901979653000901988653001001997653000602007653000702013653000902020653000902029653000802038653000802046653002302054653000802077653000802085653002202093653000702115653000802122653002002130653001102150653001202161653001102173653001102184653000802195653000902203653000802212653000702220653000702227653001102234653000802245653000802253700002102261700001902282700001702301700002502318700002002343700002202363700002302385700002602408700002102434700001902455700002302474700001902497773007502516856008202591852000902673655001202682IND60099094320221117200252.0161021e20130925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009909432DNAL7 a238603252pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.06.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalnina, Ineta10aPolymorphisms in FTO and near TMEM18 associate with type 2 diabetes and predispose to younger age at diagnosis of diabetes  ap. 462-468.  a2019-12-06  aVariations in the FTO gene and near the TMEM18 gene are risk factors for common form of obesity, but have also been linked with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to investigate the contribution of these variants to risk of T2D in a population in Latvia. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the first and fourth intronic regions of FTO and one close to TMEM18 were genotyped in 987 patients with T2D and 1080 controls selected from the Latvian Genome Data Base (LGDB). We confirmed association of SNPs in the first intron (rs11642015, rs62048402 and rs9939609) of FTO and rs7561317 representing the TMEM18 locus with T2D. Association between SNP in FTO and T2D remained significant after correction for body mass index (BMI). The rs57103849 located in the fourth intron of FTO and rs7561317 in TMEM18 showed BMI independent association with younger age at diagnosis of T2D. Our results add to the evidence that BMI related variants in and near FTO and TMEM18 may increase the risk for T2D not only through secondary effects of obesity. The influence of variants in the fourth intron of the FTO gene on development of T2D may be mediated by mechanisms other than those manifested by SNPs in the first intron of the same gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aloci 3arisk factors 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3apatients 3abody mass index 3aintrons 3adatabases 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAge Factors 2aAge of Onset 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xgenetics 2aHumans 2aMembrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aProteinsxgenetics 3aLatvia 0aCI 0aLGDB 0afreq 0agenes 0an 0aOR 0arisk 0aIRX3 0aRec 0aAdd 0aLatvian population 0aRAF 0aCEU 0aAssociation study 0aLD 0aBMI 0aType 2 diabetes 0alogBMI 0aObesity 0ap-perm 0aICD-10 0aGWA 0aEMP2 0aT2D 0ans 0aSD 0aTMEM18 0aSNP 0aFTO1 aZaharenko, Linda1 aVaivade, Iveta1 aRovite, Vita1 aNikitina-Zake, Liene1 aPeculis, Raitis1 aFridmanis, Davids1 aGeldnere, Kristine1 aJacobsson, Josefin A.1 aAlmen, Markus S.1 aPirags, Valdis1 aSchiöth, Helgi B.1 aKlovins, Janis0 tGene.g2013 Sept. 25, v. 527 p.462-468dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.06.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245008500215300001400300520126600314592002801580650001101608650001501619650001901634650001901653650001001672650002401682650001001706650002101716650001301737650001301750650001101763650000901774653001701783653003301800653002201833700001701855700002301872700002001895700001901915700001701934700001901951700002601970700002001996773010902016856008802125852000902213655001202222IND60567217920221120095333.0180830e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056721792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKauferstein, Silke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0066-867910aRelevance of molecular testing in patients with a family history of sudden death  ap. 18-23.  aSudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major cause of death in industrial countries. Although SCD occurs mainly in adults, it may also affect young persons, where genetic cardiac disorders comprise at least half of these cases. This includes primary arrhythmogenic disorders such as long QT syndrome and inherited cardiomyopathies. However, in many cases, postmortem examinations provide no conclusive results explaining the cause of death. Since family members of the deceased may eventually have inherited the same disease, they are at risk of SCD.In the present study, 28 patients with a family history of sudden unexplained death (SUD), of survived cardiac arrest and with a clinical diagnosis of an inherited cardiac disease were screened using phenotype-guided molecular analysis of genes associated with arrhythmogenic cardiac diseases. In 64% of the cases, gene variants with potentially pathogenic cardiac effects were detected suggesting that an arrhythmia syndrome may have caused the death of the deceased family member. Therefore, we recommend that relatives of SUD victims should undergo extended cardiac examination and, depending on the clinical diagnosis, a targeted genetic analysis should follow, which is crucial to identify family members at risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aarrhythmia 3acardiac arrest 3acardiomyopathy 3adeath 3adeveloped countries 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3anecropsy 3apatients 3apeople 3arisk 0aSudden death 0aPostmortem genetic screening 0aCardiac disorders1 aHerz, Nadine1 aScheiper, Stefanie1 aBiel, Stephanie1 aJenewein, Tina1 aKunis, Malte1 aErkapic, Damir1 aBeckmann, Britt-Maria1 aNeumann, Thomas0 tForensic science international.g2017 July, v. 276 p.18-23dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014200170520138600312592002801698650002001726650001601746650002201762650001101784650002301795650001501818650001301833650001101846650002001857650001301877650002601890650001201916651001801928653003101946653003001977653003002007653002802037653001602065700002102081700002702102773009902129856008502228852000902313655001202322IND60670405920221121021651.0191121e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067040592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.1010342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGacutan, Jordan10aTowards an understanding of the spatial relationships between natural capital and maritime activities: A Bayesian Belief Network approach  aEconomic activities are dependent upon natural capital (NC), which are responsible for ‘Ecosystem Services’ (ES). Understanding dependencies on NC provides insight into the ecosystem’s capacity to maintain and develop activities into the future. To determine ‘NC dependencies’, we present a framework linking maritime activities (bottom trawling, artisanal fisheries, aquaculture and tourism) to their demand for ES and further, to the NC components responsible for their production. The framework was operationalised using a spatially-explicit Bayesian Belief Network (BBN), using the Basque coast (SE Bay of Biscay) to illustrate our approach, in identifying trends in the strength and spatial distribution of NC dependencies. For example, benthic trawling was dependent on sedimentary habitats, with ‘moderate’ to ‘high’ dependency of 52% of the study area. The model can also extrapolate NC dependencies to a larger area where the activity currently does not operate, where benthic trawling was estimated to have higher utilisation of ES in deeper waters. When NC dependencies are combined with economic and legislative factors, the current spatial distribution of the activity can be explained, and the potential socio-economic impacts of management decisions could be predicted. The integrative approach contributes towards ecosystem-based spatial planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aaquaculture 3aartisanal fishing 3acoasts 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3amodels 3anatural capital 3aplanning 3asocioeconomic factors 3atourism 3aBay of Biscay 0aEcosystem-based management 0aSocio-economic activities 0aEcosystem service cascade 0aMarine spatial planning 0aBlue Growth1 aGalparsoro, Ibon1 aMurillas-Maza, Arantza0 tEcosystem services.g2019 Dec., v. 40 p.101034-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.1010343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011500158300001800273520186900291592002802160650002102188650002202209650002002231650001402251650001402265650001802279650001702297650001602314650002102330700001702351700001602368773013102384856007502515852000902590655001202599IND60539043020221122055607.0160815e20130206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053904302DNAL7 a10.1021/ja30870542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuyang, Runhai10aAtomistic Theory of Ostwald Ripening and Disintegration of Supported Metal Particles under Reaction Conditions  ap. 1760-1771.  aUnderstanding Ostwald ripening and disintegration of supported metal particles under operating conditions has been of central importance in the study of sintering and dispersion of heterogeneous catalysts for long-term industrial implementation. To achieve a quantitative description of these complicated processes, an atomistic and generic theory taking into account the reaction environment, particle size and morphology, and metal–support interaction is developed. It includes (1) energetics of supported metal particles, (2) formation of monomers (both the metal adatoms and metal–reactant complexes) on supports, and (3) corresponding sintering rate equations and total activation energies, in the presence of reactants at arbitrary temperature and pressure. The thermodynamic criteria for the reactant assisted Ostwald ripening and induced disintegration are formulated, and the influence of reactants on sintering kinetics and redispersion are mapped out. Most energetics and kinetics barriers in the theory can be obtained conveniently by first-principles theory calculations. This allows for the rapid exploration of sintering and disintegration of supported metal particles in huge phase space of structures and compositions under various reaction environments. General strategies of suppressing the sintering of the supported metal particles and facilitating the redispersions of the low surface area catalysts are proposed. The theory is applied to TiO₂(110) supported Rh particles in the presence of carbon monoxide, and reproduces well the broad temperature, pressure, and particle size range over which the sintering and redispersion occurred in such experiments. The result also highlights the importance of the metal–carbonyl complexes as monomers for Ostwald ripening and disintegration of supported metal catalysts in the presence of CO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstwald ripening 3aactivation energy 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3aequations 3aparticle size 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide1 aLiu, Jin-Xun1 aLi, Wei-Xue0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Feb. 06, v. 135, no. 5 p.1760-1771dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja30870543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245015200158300001800310520127000328592002801598650001601626650001301642650004401655650003701699650001901736650003701755700002101792700001901813700001501832700002401847700002001871700001901891700002601910773013101936856007802067852000902145655001202154IND60548772520170628000000.0160905e20160302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054877252DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b103992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Junzhi10aUnexpected Scholl Reaction of 6,7,13,14-Tetraarylbenzo[k]tetraphene: Selective Formation of Five-Membered Rings in Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons  ap. 2602-2608.  aCyclodehydrogenation is a versatile reaction that has enabled the syntheses of numerous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We now describe a unique Scholl reaction of 6,7,13,14-tetraarylbenzo[k]tetraphene, which “unexpectedly” forms five-membered rings accompanying highly selective 1,2-shift of aryl groups. The geometric and optoelectronic nature of the resulting bistetracene analogue with five-membered rings is comprehensively investigated by single-crystal X-ray, NMR, UV–vis absorption, and cyclic voltammetry analyses. Furthermore, a possible mechanism is proposed to account for the selective five-membered-ring formation with the rearrangement of the aryl groups, which can be rationalized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The theoretical results suggest that the formation of the bistetracene analogue with five-membered rings is kinetically controlled while an “expected” product with six-membered rings is thermodynamically more favored. These experimental and theoretical results provide further insights into the still controversial mechanism of the Scholl reaction as well as open up an unprecedented entry to extend the variety of PAHs by programing otherwise unpredictable rearrangements during the Scholl reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3ageometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3athermodynamics 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aNarita, Akimitsu1 aOsella, Silvio1 aZhang, Wen1 aSchollmeyer, Dieter1 aBeljonne, David1 aFeng, Xinliang1 aMüllen, K.q(Klaus),0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Mar. 02, v. 138, no. 8 p.2602-2608dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b103993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014400163300001600307500001900323520142700342592002801769650001401797650001201811650001201823650001601835650002301851650001401874650003101888650002101919650001501940650002201955650001901977650001201996650001402008650001702022650002102039653001802060653001602078653003002094653002102124653002102145700001802166700001702184700001902201700001602220700001802236773009902254856008502353852000902438655001202447IND60731482920221121023501.0210401e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073148292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.02.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Yu10aActivated biochar derived from peanut shells as the electrode materials with excellent performance in Zinc-air battery and supercapacitance  ap. 257-267.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe use of activated biochar-based electrode derived from waste biomass in energy technologies, such as metal-air batteries and supercapacitors, is an important strategy for realizing energy and environmental sustainability in the future. Herein, peanut shells (waste biomass) were employed to prepare activated biochar materials by pyrolysis in molten KCl and heat-treatment. The effective dispersion and corrosion effects of molten salt for the pyrolysis products during pyrolysis obviously increase defects and specific surface area of the activated biochar materials. The prepared activated biochar material (PS-800-1000) by pyrolysis in molten KCl at 800 °C and heat-treatment at 1000 °C exhibits excellent catalytic activity with half-wave potential of 0.84 V vs. RHE, comparable to commercial Pt/C for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 M KOH and outstanding supercapacitance performance in 6 M KOH with high specific capacitance (355 F g⁻¹ at 0.5 A g⁻¹), which exceeds all reported biochar derived from peanut shells. The PS-800-1000-based zinc-air battery (ZAB) displays higher peak power density (141 mW cm⁻²), specific capacity (767 mAh gZₙ⁻¹) and cycling stability than Pt/C-based ZAB. The activated biochar prepared by pyrolysis in molten KCl and heat-treatment method from peanut shells can be a promising candidate for replacing precious metals in energy conversion/storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acapacitance 3acatalytic activity 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy conversion 3aheat treatment 3apeanuts 3apyrolysis 3asurface area 3awaste management 0aPeanut shells 0aMolten salt 0aOxygen reduction reaction 0aZinc-air battery 0aSupercapacitance1 aZhang, Chaoqi1 aKong, Fantao1 aZhao, Qingbiao1 aKong, Aiguo1 aShan, Yongkui0 tWaste management.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 125 p.257-267dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.02.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01310naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245005900159300002000218520038000238592002800618650001300646650002400659650000900683650001500692700001300707700001800720700001500738700001600753773014400769856007400913852000900987655001200996IND60670823520221118061704.0191002e20140826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067082352DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta03034f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guangyu12aA switchable mesh for on-demand oil–water separation  ap. 15284-15287.  aWe report a switchable mesh for oil–water separation that allows handling of various oil–water mixtures in one single device.

Further, using citric acid to catalyze the microwave hydrothermal carbonization resulted in 30% higher maximal yield of hydrochar, and the hydrochar produced had better elemental, proximate and energy properties than hydrochar made during uncatalyzed microwave hydrothermal carbonization. Further, structural analysis revealed that citric acid promoted the formation of nanospheres during microwave hydrothermal carbonization.

Chemical modifications are known to improve nucleic acid stability, but the (i) types, (ii) positions, and (iii) numbers of modifications all matter, making chemically optimizing nucleic acids a combinatorial problem. As a result, in vivo studies of nucleic acid stability are time consuming and expensive. We reasoned that DNA barcodes could simultaneously study how chemical modification patterns affect nucleic acid stability, saving time and resources. We confirmed that rationally designed DNA barcodes can elucidate the role of specific chemical modifications in serum, in vitro and in vivo; we also identified a modification pattern that enhanced stability. This approach to screening chemical modifications in vivo can efficiently optimize nucleic acid structure, which will improve biomaterial-based nucleic acid drugs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA barcoding 3ablood serum 3achemistry 3adrugs 3ain vivo studies 3anucleic acids 3ascreening1 aKalathoor, Sujay1 aFitzgerald, Jordan P.1 aLando, Gwyneth N.1 aDjeddar, Naima1 aBryksin, Anton V.1 aDahlman, James E.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2018 Nov. 28, v. 6, no. 44 p.7197-7203dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8tb01642a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01487naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245014200153300001800295520040300313592002800716650001300744650001200757650002300769650002300792650001100815700001400826700001400840700001600854700001500870700001800885700001700903773013400920856007401054852000901128655001201137IND60698445120221119114450.0200612e20200611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069844512DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc02143a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shan10aBi(iii)-catalyzed aminooxygenation of propargyl amidines to synthesize 2-fluoroalkyl imidazole-5-carbaldehydes and their decarbonylations  ap. 6400-6403.  aThe first example of main group metal Bi(iii)-catalyzed aminooxygenation of fluorinated propargyl amidines was developed to produce 2-fluoroalkyl imidazole-5-carbaldehydes in moderate to excellent yields, in which phenol played a critical role and could be recovered and recycled.

Herein, Li0.04V2O5 nanowires are densely anchored onto reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets to form a Li0.04V2O5@rGO nanocomposite by a hydrothermal method with subsequent thermal treatment. Due to this unique structure, the Li0.04V2O5@rGO exhibits remarkable rate performance and excellent cycling stability. Specifically, it delivers a reversible discharge capacity of 738.09mAhg⁻¹ at a current density of 100mAg⁻¹ in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0V. After 500 cycles, it still maintains a high capacity of 731.70mAhg⁻¹, which represents 95.01% retention of the original reversible capacity. These results indicate that the Li0.04V2O5@rGO could be a promising candidate as cathode active material for long-term cycling performance in lithium-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aelectric power 3afoil 3agraphene oxide 3ahot water treatment 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3ananowires 3atitanium 0aLithium vanadate 0aReduced graphene oxide 0aNanocomposite 0aLithium ion battery1 aChai, Danyang1 aLuo, Zhiping1 aJiang, Ming1 aXu, Weilin1 aXiong, Chuanxi1 aLi, Shan1 aLiu, Hui1 aFang, Dong0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2017 July 15, v. 498 p.210-216dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01558naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245007600200300001800276520053900294592002800833650001400861650002200875650001600897650001300913650001500926650001800941700001700959700001500976700001600991773014201007856007401149852000901223655001201232IND60621068920221121063802.0181115e20181128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062106892DNAL7 a10.1039/c8tb01737a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPennacchioThese authors have equal contribution., F.

Resistant clones are the most widely used control measure for the rust disease caused by A. psidii. Essential oils produced in the plant-host cells are associated with resistance. However, the chemical characteristics of Eucalyptus leaves at different stages of maturity, associated with resistance or susceptibility to A. psidii, need to be determined. The aims of this study were to characterize the chemical composition of essential oils in Eucalyptus leaves at three developmental stages of clones of three E. urophylla × E. grandis hybrids that exhibit different resistance levels to rust and to identify probable resistance-related compounds from them. The rust severity following inoculation and the quantity and quality of the essential oil extracted by hydrodistillation were determined at the first, third, and fifth leaf stages of the three clones. Identification of the compounds present in the essential oil was determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. No rust was observed on the three leaf stages of the resistant clone or on the fifth leaf stage of the susceptible clones. Limonene was found at high percentages in essential oils from the three leaf stages of the resistant clone and at low percentages in the susceptible clones. In vitro and in vivo tests indicated that low limonene percentages stimulated A. psidii urediniospore germination and were not fungitoxic, whereas high percentages caused complete inhibition of germination and degenerative changes in fungal reproductive structures. The limonene present in Eucalyptus leaves can be considered a chemical compound related to the rust resistance of Eucalyptus spp.  aPublisher supplied data  cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq)  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES)  cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)  cInstituto de Pesquisas e Estudos Florestais (IPEF) of Brazil Programa Cooperativo sobre Proteção Florestal (PROTEF) 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aEucalyptus urophylla 3aantifungal properties 3achemical composition 3aclones 3acontrol methods 3adevelopmental stages 3aessential oils 3afungi 3agas chromatography 3agermination 3ahost plants 3ahybrids 3ahydrodistillation 3ain vivo studies 3aleaves 3alimonene 3amass spectrometry 3apathogens 3aphysicochemical properties 3arust diseases 3aurediniospores 0aEucalyptus essential oils 0aeucalyptus rust 0aphenology stage 0aPuccinia psidii 0aresistance 0asecondary metabolism1 ada Silva, André C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5505-76781 aRodella, Roberto A.1 aMarques, Márcia O.

In the meantime, potential sources of PAHs were identified using the principal component analysis (PCA), and the risk of residents’ exposure to PAHs via urban street dust was calculated using the Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) model. The results showed that the total PAHs (∑PAHs) in urban street dust from Tianjin ranged from 538 μg kg⁻¹to 34.3 mg kg⁻¹, averaging 7.99 mg kg⁻¹. According to PCA, the two to three- and four to six-ring PAHs contributed 10.3 and 89.7 % of ∑PAHs, respectively. The ratio of the sum of major combustion specific compounds (ΣCOMB) / ∑PAHs varied from 0.57 to 0.79, averaging 0.64. The ratio of Ant/(Ant + Phe) varied from 0.05 to 0.41, averaging 0.10; Fla/(Fla + Pyr) from 0.40 to 0.68, averaging 0.60; BaA/(BaA + Chry) from 0.29 to 0.51, averaging 0.38; and IcdP/(IcdP + BghiP) from 0.07 to 0.37, averaging 0.22. The biomass combustion, coal combustion, and traffic emission were the main sources of PAHs in urban street dust with the similar proportion. According to the ILCR model, the total cancer risk for children and adults was up to 2.55 × 10⁻⁵and 9.33 × 10⁻⁵, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiomass 3achildren 3acoal 3acombustion 3amodels 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atraffic 3aurbanization 2aAdult 2aChild 2aCities 2aDustxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aHumans 2aNeoplasmsxetiology 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aRisk 2aRisk Assessment 3aChina 0aChina1 aXie, Xiujie1 aMa, Lena Q.1 aKan, Haidong1 aZhou, Qixing0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Feb., v. 21, no. 4 p.2817-2825dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-2190-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245012800209520155500337592002801892650001201920650001101932650002001943650001401963650001101977650002001988650002602008650001802034651001002052653002102062653002602083653003002109700005802139700002202197700001702219773009702236856008702333852000902420655001202429IND60687360320221122192917.0200419e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068736032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1148672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLam, Chor Man1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7783-088410aIntegrated life-cycle data envelopment analysis for techno-environmental performance evaluation on sludge-to-energy systems  aSludge-to-energy systems have been widely recognized as a favourable approach to treat sewage sludge and recover energy from the energy-rich biomass waste simultaneously. An inclusive efficiency benchmarking tool for sludge-to-energy systems is lacking. This study developed a life-cycle data envelopment analysis framework, by integrating life-cycle assessment and data envelopment analysis, for evaluating sludge-to-energy systems. The life-cycle data envelopment analysis approach highlighted the strong linkage between sludge treatment and energy systems and included all the essential performance metrics in benchmarking the efficiency of the sludge-to-energy systems. Using life-cycle data envelopment analysis, this study compared the relative operation efficiency of nine Hong Kong sludge-to-energy systems and seven systems in other urban cities based on the volatile solids reduction, energy recovery, energy use, chemical consumption, sludge residues generation and direct environmental emissions. The results showed that 44% and 69% of the sixteen sludge-to-energy systems were efficient in terms of overall and pure technical efficiency, respectively. The life-cycle data envelopment analysis results also informed the appropriate strategies for improving efficiency, such as increasing energy recovery, reducing energy use and scaling up/down the systems, for the less efficient systems. The life-cycle data envelopment analysis framework is widely applicable for guiding decision-making on enhancing sludge-to-energy systems worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acities 3adecision making 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3alife cycle assessment 3asewage sludge 3aChina 0aSludge to energy 0aLife-cycle assessment 0aData envelopment analysis1 aHsu, Shu-Chien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7232-98391 aAlvarado, Valeria1 aLi, Wing Man0 tApplied energy.g2020 May 15, v. 266 p.114867-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1148673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03515naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003100132024002200163024001900185024001100204040001800215100002000233245009600253300001600349506007600365506017300441520130900614506003701923650002001960650001201980650002901992650002802021650002102049650001402070650001702084650001902101650001802120650001802138650001702156650001602173650002302189650001902212650003002231650001402261650002302275650002002298650001702318650001202335650001902347650001402366650001202380650002302392700002102415700001602436700002102452773007802473856011202551856007702663956009502740961000902835852000902844655001202853IND60006093820221214225017.0150602e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000609382DNAL7 a3111812aris7 a10113/609382hdl7 a10.3390/toxins70308352doi7 aPMC43795282pmcid7 a257679862pmid8 ans7376  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasooly, Reuven10aPlant Compounds Enhance the Assay Sensitivity for Detection of Active Bacillus cereus Toxin  ap. 835-845.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aBacillus cereus is an important food pathogen, producing emetic and diarrheal syndromes, the latter mediated by enterotoxins. The ability to sensitively trace and identify this active toxin is important for food safety. This study evaluated a nonradioactive, sensitive, in vitro cell-based assay, based on B. cereus toxin inhibition of green fluorescent protein (GFP) synthesis in transduced monkey kidney Vero cells, combined with plant extracts or plant compounds that reduce viable count of B. cereus in food. The assay exhibited a dose dependent GFP inhibition response with ~25% inhibition at 50 ng/mL toxin evaluated in culture media or soy milk, rice milk or infant formula, products associated with food poisonings outbreak. The plant extracts of green tea or bitter almond and the plant compounds epicatechin or carvacrol were found to amplify the assay response to ~90% inhibition at the 50 ng/mL toxin concentration greatly increasing the sensitivity of this assay. Additional studies showed that the test formulations also inhibited the growth of the B. cereus bacteria, likely through cell membrane disruption. The results suggest that the improved highly sensitive assay for the toxin and the rapid inactivation of the pathogen producing the toxin have the potential to enhance food safety.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus cereus 3aalmonds 3aantibacterial properties 3abacterial contamination 3abacterial toxins 3acarvacrol 3acell culture 3acell membranes 3aculture media 3adose response 3aenterotoxins 3aepicatechin 3afood contamination 3afood pathogens 3agreen fluorescent protein 3agreen tea 3agrowth retardation 3ainfant formulas 3akidney cells 3amonkeys 3aplant extracts 3arice milk 3asoymilk 3atransgenic animals1 aHernlem, Bradley1 aHe, Xiaohua1 aFriedman, Mendel0 tToxins.g2015 Mar., v. 7, no. 3 p.835-845wJournal:27148x2072-66517nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/609383Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins70308353Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/toxins-07-00835.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245007600164300001800240500001900258520168100277592002801958650001601986650002502002650001202027650001702039650001002056650001002066650002702076650003402103650002702137650001602164650001502180650001402195650001302209650002102222650001302243700001902256700001302275700001202288700001902300700001702319773013502336856004802471852000902519655001202528IND6036916720221119092127.0130319e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603691672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-012-0977-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xin-Mei10aEffects of perfluorinated compounds on development of zebrafish embryos  ap. 2498-2505.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPerfluorinated compounds (PFCs) have been widely used in industrial and consumer products and frequently detected in many environmental media. Potential reproductive effects of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) have been reported in mice, rats and water birds. PFOS and PFOA were also confirmed developing toxicants towards zebrafish embryos; however, the reported effect concentrations were contradictory. Polyfluorinated alkylated phosphate ester surfactants (including FC807) are precursor of PFOS and PFOA; however, there is no published information about the effects of FC807 and PFNA on zebrafish embryos. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effects of these four PFCs on zebrafish embryos. Normal fertilized zebrafish embryos were selected to be exposed to several concentrations of PFOA, PFNA, PFOS or FC807 in 24-well cell culture plates. A digital camera was used to image morphological anomalies of embryos with a stereomicroscope. Embryos were observed through matching up to 96-h post-fertilization (hpf) and rates of survival and abnormalities recorded. PFCs caused lethality in a concentration-dependent manner with potential toxicity in the order of PFOS > FC807 > PFNA > PFOA based on 72-h LC₅₀. Forty-eight-hour post-fertilization pericardial edema and 72- or 96-hpf spine crooked malformation were all observed. PFOA, PFNA, PFOS and FC807 all caused structural abnormalities using early stages of development of zebrafish. The PFCs all retarded the development of zebrafish embryos. The toxicity of the PFCs was related to the length of the PFC chain and functional groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aabnormal development 3acameras 3acell culture 3adeath 3aedema 3aperfluorononanoic acid 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3apericardium 3aphosphates 3apollution 3aresearch 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity1 aLiu, Hong-Ling1 aShi, Wei1 aWei, Si1 aGiesy, John P.1 aYu, Hong-Xia0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2012 Aug., v. 19, no. 7 p.2498-2505dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-0977-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245008300165300001200248520129000260592002801550650000801578650001901586650000801605650001501613650001601628650001201644650001601656650002001672650001901692650001501711650001301726650001201739651001101751700002001762700002101782700001501803700002101818700001901839700002001858700001701878700001701895700002501912700002001937700002001957700001601977700001901993773010902012856007902121852000902200655001202209IND60749278520221121143016.0210901e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074927852DNAL7 a10.1186/1743-422X-7-2302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJobarteh, Modou10aSeroprevalence of hepatitis B and C virus in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected Gambians  ap. 230.  aBACKGROUND: The prevalence of HIV/hepatitis co-infection in sub-Saharan Africa is not well documented, while both HIV and HBV are endemic in this area. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the seroprevalence of HBV and HCV virus in HIV-infected subjects in the Gambia. METHODS: Plasma samples from HIV infected patients (190 individuals with clinically defined AIDS and 382 individuals without AIDS) were tested retrospectively for the presence of HBV sero-markers and for serum HBV DNA, screened for HCV infection by testing for anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA. RESULTS: HBsAg prevalence in HIV-positive individuals is 12.2%. HIV/HBV co-infected individuals with CD4 count of <200 cells uL-1 have a higher HBV DNA viral load than patients with higher CD4 count (log 4.0 vs. log 2.0 DNA copies/ml, p < 0.05). Males (OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.0, 3.2) were more likely to be HBsAg positive than female. HCV seroprevalence was 0.9% in HIV-positive individuals. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HBsAg carriage in HIV- infected Gambians is similar to that obtained in the general population. However co-infected individuals with reduced CD4 levels, indicative of AIDS had higher prevalence of HBeAg retention and elevated HBV DNA levels compared to non-AIDS patients with higher CD4 count.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aHIV infections 3aRNA 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3afemales 3ahepatitis B 3amixed infection 3aseroprevalence 3aviral load 3avirology 3aviruses 3aGambia1 aMalfroy, Marine1 aPeterson, Ingrid1 aJeng, Adam1 aSarge-Njie, Ramu1 aAlabi, Abraham1 aPeterson, Kevin1 aCotten, Matt1 aHall, Andrew1 aRowland-Jones, Sarah1 aWhittle, Hilton1 aTedder, Richard1 aJaye, Assan1 aMendy, Maimuna0 tVirology journal.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.230-230dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-7-2303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245008400155300001600239520108800255592002801343650002201371650001301393650002801406650002101434650001801455650001901473650002401492650002201516650001101538650003301549700001501582700001301597700001301610700001201623700001401635700001501649700001601664773011901680856007401799852000901873655001201882IND60618188120221122054305.0181029e20180103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061818812DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra12613a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, X.

Spinel LiMn₂O₄ and reduced three-dimensional graphene oxide were synthesized using a hydrothermal method and freeze-drying technology, respectively. The structure, morphology and electrochemical performance of the synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge–discharge techniques. The results showed that the LiMn₂O₄/3DG composites exhibited excellent rate capability and stable cycling performance. The discharge capacity was 131 mA h g⁻¹ and the capacity remains at 89.3% after 100 cycles at a 0.5 C rate, while the discharge capacity was 90 mA h g⁻¹ at 10 C. Compared with spinel LiMn₂O₄ materials, the LiMn₂O₄/3DG composites showed obvious improvement in electrochemical performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acathodes 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3afreeze drying 3agraphene oxide 3ahot water treatment 3alithium batteries 3amixing 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aYin, Y.

The results indicated that samples coated with low methoxyl pectin and treated under 60 °Brix for 16 h at both temperatures (20 and 40°C) presented the best process performance. Statistical analysis showed that the application of the coatings resulted in greater firmness and stiffness of the pear cubes at the end of osmotic dehydration. Besides, alginate coating best preserved the phenolic content (31.4%) than uncoated (26.04%) and pectin‐coated (20.77%) ones. However, total colour differences were not improved with the use of edible coatings (alginate or pectin). In terms of quality, the samples coated with both hydrogels had good overall acceptability by the evaluators and good mechanical properties. However, further studies are required to decrease the difference in colour and leaching of bioactive compounds in pear cubes due to the osmotic dehydration treatment.  aPublisher supplied data  cConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas  aPICT‐2017‐0923cCentro de Investigación y Desarrollo en Criotecnología de Alimentos 3acolor 3afirmness 3afood science 3ahydrogels 3aosmotic treatment 3apears 3apectins 3asensory evaluation 3asodium alginate 3astatistical analysis 3asucrose1 aSoteras, Mario1 aCampañone, Laura0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2021 Dec., v. 56, no. 12 p.6474-6483dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.153573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009400168520143500262592002801697650002301725650002501748650001901773650001101792650001701803653002201820653002301842653002501865653002601890653004301916700001601959700001701975700001501992700001402007700001802021773010102039856008602140852000902226655001202235IND60727951520221120141436.0210813e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072795152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1074872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuang10aPromoting landscape connectivity of highly urbanized area: An ecological network approach  aEcological infrastructure is a popular framework for conservation planning. In this paper, one of the most urbanized regions of China-Shenzhen was chosen as the study area. Ecological infrastructure with different configurations and functions were identified and combined to form the urban ecological network. The ecological sources were identified using morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and landscape connectivity analysis. The ecological resistance surface developed from ecosystem service value was modified basing on ecological sensitivity and landscape connectivity. The ecological network was constructed by minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and then optimized and accessed. The results show that: (1) the ecological network consists of 25 ecological sources distributed mainly in the southeast and west. Twenty-nine ecological corridors were extracted and 36 ecological nodes identified. (2) In the optimized ecological network, 10 new ecological sources were added, and 46 ecological corridors and 59 ecological nodes were identified. It would promote the connectivity of the ecological sources and the stability of ecological functioning process. (3) The ecological network took ecosystem service value and ecological sensitivity into consideration and lays emphasis on improving landscape connectivity, providing an approach to optimizing urban ecological network and contributing to urban planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem services 3ahabitat connectivity 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3aurbanization 0aEcosystem service 0aEcological sources 0aEcological corridors 0aEcological resistance 0aMorphological spatial pattern analysis1 aWu, Maoquan1 aHu, Mengmeng1 aFan, Zhen,1 aWang, Tao1 aXia, Beicheng0 tEcological indicators.g2021 June, v. 125 p.107487-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1074873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03671naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012400167300001600291520241700307592002802724596005502752596006902807596005702876596005002933653002002983653001603003653001803019653002403037653001703061700005803078773010503136856008303241852000903324655001203333IND60682782120221119161121.0200207e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068278212DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-19-1009-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, QuanChao10aCalonectria pentaseptata Causes Severe Leaf Disease of Cultivated Eucalyptus on the Leizhou Peninsula of Southern China  ap. 493-509.  aEucalyptus (Myrtaceae, Myrtales) trees are widely cultivated for commercial purposes worldwide. Calonectria leaf blight is one of the most prominent diseases associated with Eucalyptus trees grown in plantations in Asia and South America. Recently, symptoms of leaf blight, shoot blight, tree death, and seedling rot caused by Calonectria species have been observed in commercial Eucalyptus plantations and nurseries in Leizhou Peninsula, which is one of the most densely Eucalyptus-planted areas in southern China. Disease samples were collected from 10 Eucalyptus species and a number of Eucalyptus grandis, E. tereticornis, and E. urophylla hybrid genotypes that were planted on plantations at 13 sites and one experimental nursery. A total of 773 isolates of Calonectria were obtained from 683 plantation trees and nursery seedlings. Fifty-five representative isolates from all the surveyed sites and Eucalyptus species/genotypes were selected for molecular identification. These 55 isolates were identified by DNA sequence analyses based on the calmodulin (cmdA), histone H3 (his3), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), and β-tubulin (tub2) gene regions, as well as a combination of morphological characteristics. The results indicated that these 55 isolates present one single species, Calonectria pentaseptata. Determined by sequences of cmdA, his3, tef1, and tub2 gene regions, only two genotypes were identified among the 55 representative isolates; 54 of these isolates share the same genotype, suggesting that the genetic diversity of Ca. pentaseptata collected during this study was relatively low. A growth study indicated that Ca. pentaseptata is a high-temperature species. The mating test results suggested that Ca. pentaseptata is heterothallic or lacks the ability to recombine to produce fertile progeny. Inoculation results showed that Ca. pentaseptata causes leaf blight and stem rot, resulting in tree death of the two widely planted Eucalyptus genotypes in southern China, and that the two genotypes differ significantly in their susceptibility to infection by Ca. pentaseptata. A selection program to develop Eucalyptus planting stocks with high levels of resistance to Calonectria leaf blight in China during the long-term should be urgently initiated.

Subjects consumed either plain water or water plus flavor (Infuze), ad libitum, at each visit. Pre and post exercise, fluid consumption (change in fluid reservoir weight) and BM (nude) were measured. During exercise, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), rate of perceived exertion (RPE), oxygen consumption (VO₂), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), core temperature (TC), and physiological strain index (PSI) were recorded every 15 min during exercise.No significant differences were observed for fluid consumption between fluid conditions (512 ± 97.2 mL water vs. 414.3 ± 62.5 mL Infuze). Despite a significant decrease from baseline, there were no significant differences in overall change of BM (Δ −1.18 vs. −0.64 Kg) or percent body weight loss for water and Infuze conditions, respectively (1.58 ± 0.6 and 0.79 ± 0.2%). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in HR (144 ± 6 vs. 143 ± 8 bpm), SBP (157 ± 5 vs. 155 ± 5 mmHg), RPE, VO₂ (27.4 ± 0.9 vs. 28.1 ± 1.2 ml/Kg/min), RER, TC (38.1 ± 0.1 vs. 37.0 ± 0.1 °C), and peak PSI (5.4 ± 0.4 vs. 5.7 ± 0.8) between conditions.Offering individuals the choice to actively manipulate flavor strength did not significantly influence ad libitum fluid consumption, fluid loss, or physiological strain during 60 min of moderate intensity exercise in the heat.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Forest Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody weight changes 3aexercise 3aflavor 3aheart rate 3aheat 3aoxygen consumption 3arelative humidity 3asystolic blood pressure 3atemperature1 aCarr, Kyle W.1 aAnna, Jacob L.1 aDupre, Brianna R.1 aSmith, Meghan E.1 aDinenno, Frank A.1 aRichards, Jennifer C.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2020 Apr., v. 89 p.102575-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.1025753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245014700202300001800349500002000367520136600387592002801753596006201781650001701843650001401860650000901874650000901883650003001892650001801922650001801940650002001958650001201978650001101990650001302001650001102014700001702025700001702042700002002059700002002079700002402099773012402123856007402247852000902321655001202330IND60787072020221116171315.0220807e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078707202DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.144632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarbia, Penelope S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9876-145410aSeasonal and developmental diet shifts in sympatric and allopatric intertidal gobies determined by stomach content and stable isotope analysis  ap. 1051-1062.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource partitioning facilitates the coexistence of sympatric species through spatial, temporal and/or trophic strategies. Fishes living in the intertidal zone demonstrate highly adaptive plastic behaviour, including resource partitioning, through spatial and temporal shifts in diet and microhabitat. Although intertidal fish assemblages are influenced by inter‐ and intraspecific competition, few studies have compared the extent of resource partitioning between sympatric species in the context of trophic niche plasticity. Here we used complementary approaches, stomach content and stable isotope (δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N) analyses, to evaluate seasonal and developmental shifts in trophic niche position in two sympatric (Favonigobius lentiginosus and Bathygobius krefftii) and one allopatric (Bathygobius cocosensis) species of intertidal goby. The results indicate that resource partitioning in the two sympatric species varied with season, with almost no trophic niche overlap in summer to about ~30% overlap in winter. Also, evidence of dietary changes was found in B. cocosensis, which is likely associated with a shift in microhabitat and intraspecific competition. The findings highlight the temporal range of behavioural plasticity in trophic niche position of intertidal gobies, which likely has high adaptive value in the dynamic intertidal zone.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University 3aFavonigobius 3aallopatry 3adiet 3afish 3aintraspecific competition 3alittoral zone 3amicrohabitats 3astable isotopes 3astomach 3asummer 3asympatry 3awinter1 aBrown, Culum1 aPark, Joo M.1 aGaston, Troy F.1 aRaoult, Vincent1 aWilliamson, Jane E.0 tJournal of fish biology.g2020 Oct., v. 97, no. 4 p.1051-1062dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:13582x0022-11127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.144633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245019800180300001600378520166000394592002802054650004402082650001702126650002002143650002102163650001502184650002602199650003702225650001902262650001802281650001902299650001102318650002802329650001802357650004402375650001502419650001502434650002002449650003402469650003302503650002702536650001302563650003702576653001702613653003402630653002202664653001702686653002702703653002502730700003002755700002002785700002002805700001602825700002702841773012502868856008202993852000903075655001203084IND60609390120221119223843.0180823e20170701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060939012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2017.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubendhiran, Subbiramaniyan10aGreen reduction of reduced graphene oxide with nickel tetraphenyl porphyrin nanocomposite modified electrode for enhanced electrochemical determination of environmentally pollutant nitrobenzene  ap. 207-216.  aNitrobenzene (NB) is widely used in the manufacturing of different types of products and other aromatic chemicals. Moreover, it is highly toxic and environmental pollutant compound. Therefore, the detection of nitro aromatic compounds (NACs) has gained more attention in the field of sensor. This article describes the green reduction utilized to preparation of green reduced graphene oxide/nickel tetraphenyl porphyrin (GRGO/Ni-TPP) nanocomposite modified electrode for the determination of nitrobenzene (NB). The GRGO was prepared by environmentally friendly method and using caffeic acid (CA) as a reducing agent. Moreover, the GRGO/Ni-TPP nanocomposite was prepared via the π-π stacking interaction between the RGO and Ni-TPP. In addition, the prepared material was confirmed by the UV–Visible spectroscopy (UV), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The structural morphology and elemental composition of the prepared nanocomposite was confirmed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Besides, the electrochemical studies of the prepared nanocomposite was characterized by the CV and DPV technique. The DPV studies displayed the linearity response of the proposed sensor about 0.5–878µM with the sensitivity of 1.277µAµM⁻¹cm⁻² and the limit of detection (LOD) is 0.14µM. Furthermore, the GRGO/Ni-TPP nanocomposite modified electrode shows good selectivity towards the detection of NB. In addition, the real sample analysis exhibited appreciable recovery towards the determination of NB using various types of water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acaffeic acid 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelemental composition 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agraphene oxide 3amanufacturing 3ananocomposites 3anickel 3anitroaromatic compounds 3anitrobenzenes 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apollutants 3aporphyrins 3areducing agents 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asustainable technology 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aNitrobenzene 0aNickel tetra phenyl porphyrin 0aGreen preparation 0aCaffeic acid 0aReduced graphene oxide 0aReal sample analysis1 aSakthinathan, Subramanian1 aChen, Shen-Ming1 aTamizhdurai, P.1 aShanthi, K.1 aKaruppiah, Chelladurai0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2017 July 01, v. 497 p.207-216dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245014700162300001200309520163300321592002801954650003001982650002102012650000902033650001002042650002002052650001302072650003902085650002602124650001202150650002802162650001102190650001302201651001602214700001902230700001602249700001902265700001702284700001602301700001402317700001702331700001602348700001802364700001902382700001302401700001902414773010902433856007902542852000902621655001202630IND60749278720221121143005.0210901e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074927872DNAL7 a10.1186/1743-422X-7-2322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Ai-Mei10aTranscription phase, protein characteristics of DEV UL45 and prokaryotic expression, antibody preparation of the UL45 des-transmembrane domain  ap. 232.  aBACKGROUND: Some UL45 gene function of Herpesvirus was reported. While there was no any report of the duck enteritis virus (DEV) UL45 protein as yet. RESULTS: The UL45 gene and des-transmembrane domain of UL45 (named UL45Δ gene, 295-675bp of UL45) of DEV were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a(+). The constructed recombinant plasmids were transformed into the host strain BL21(DE3) PLysS and induced by IPTG. SDS-PAGE analysis showed the UL45 gene couldn't express while UL45Δ gene was highly expressed. His Purify Kit or salting-out could purify the protein effectively. Using the purified protein to immunize New-Zealand rabbits and produce polyclonal antibody. The agar diffusion reaction showed the titer of antibody was 1:32. Western blot analysis indicated the purified rabbit anti-UL45Δ IgG had a high level of specificity and the UL45 gene was a part of DEV genome. The transcription phase study of UL45 gene showed that expression of UL45 mRNA was at a low level from 0 to 18 h post-infection (pi), then accumulated quickly at 24 h pi and peaked at 42 h pi. It can be detected till 72 h pi. Besides, western blot analysis of purified virion and different viral ingredients showed that the UL45 protein resided in the purified virion and the viral envelope. CONCLUSIONS: The rabbit anti-UL45Δ IgG was produced successfully and it can serve as a good tool for penetrating studies of the function of DEV UL45 protein. The transcription phase and protein characteristics analysis indicated that DEV UL45 gene was a late gene and UL45 protein may be a viral envelope protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnatid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aWestern blotting 3aagar 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3aplasmids 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolyclonal antibodies 3arabbits 3aviral envelope proteins 3avirion 3avirology 3aNew Zealand1 aMa, Guang-Peng1 aTei, Ankun,1 aWang, Mingshu,1 aLuo, Dan-Dan1 aLu, Li-Ting1 aZhou, Tao1 aZhu, De-Kang1 aLuo, Qi-Hui1 aJia, Ren-Yong1 aChen, Zheng-Li1 aZhou, Yi1 aChen, Xiao-Yue0 tVirology journal.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.232-232dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-7-2323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001900148245008300167300001600250500001900266520150600285592002801791650001901819650001301838650002101851650001001872650001401882650001301896650001201909650001101921650001901932650003801951650000801989650002201997650001302019700001902032700002402051700002702075700002802102700002602130700002502156773010402181856008402285852000902369655001202378IND6036916920221119092149.0141112e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603691692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Sónia,10aAluminium long-term stress differently affects photosynthesis in rye genotypes  ap. 105-112.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe ability of crops to overcome Al toxicity varies among crop species and cultivars. Among the Triticeae genus, rye (Secale cereale) is considered the most Al-tolerant species. In the present work, two rye genotypes differing in Al tolerance (‘Riodeva’: Al-sensitive and ‘Donkowsky Zlote’: Al-tolerant) were exposed to 1.11 and 1.85 mM Al during three weeks. Growth, water status and photosynthesis related parameters were assessed. After three weeks of Al exposure, both genotypes presented similar decrease in leaf growth. Al-induced RWC decreased in both genotypes, but was more remarkable in ‘Riodeva’. Al toxicity induced a decrease in net photosynthetic rate only after three weeks of exposure. In ‘D. Zlote’, A decrease was accompanied by stomatal closure, Chl a content and qₚ reduction, but no alterations in RuBisCo or sFBPase activity were observed. In ‘Riodeva’ plants exposed to 1.11 mM Al, A decrease was accompanied by Cᵢ/Cₐ increase whereas in plants exposed to 1.85 mM Al Cᵢ/Cₐ was not affected. Nevertheless, for both conditions RuBisCo activity decreased. A decrease did not limited glucose accumulation in neither of the rye genotypes. This study revealed that Al-induced earlier damages in the ‘Riodeva’ genotype, but both genotypes showed long-term high susceptibility to Al. Furthermore, the photosynthetic parameters proved to be a good tool to monitor Al-sensitivity and long-term exposure showed to be crucial to evaluate Al-sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSecale cereale 3aaluminum 3achronic exposure 3acrops 3acultivars 3agenotype 3aglucose 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3arye 3astomatal movement 3atoxicity1 aPinto, Glória1 aDias, Maria Celeste1 aCorreia, Carlos Manuel1 aMoutinho-Pereira, José1 aPinto-Carnide, Olinda1 aSantos, Conceição,0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2012 May, v. 54 p.105-112dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01567naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013500154300001800289520034300307592002800650650001100678650001400689650002300703650002600726650001200752700001600764700001500780700001600795700001700811700001300828700001400841700001800855700001500873700001700888700001700905700001800922773013400940856007401074852000901148655001201157IND60698445620221119114433.0200612e20200611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069844562DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc02438d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Chao,10aCoordination induced electron redistribution to achieve highly reversible Li-ion insertion chemistry in metal–organic frameworks  ap. 6424-6427.  aHerein, the coordination-induced increase in the electron density of fused C₆ rings in MOFs as high performance anode materials for Li⁺ ion batteries is described.

Special attention is given to seasonal variations, because the integrated annual values that are usually provided do not allow us to establish comparisons with seasonal phytoplankton dynamics. The eutrophication risk associated with river inputs is addressed by means of an indicator (Index of Coastal Eutrophication Potential, ICEP, Billen and Garnier, Mar Chem 106:148–160, 2007). An overview of the temporal evolution and the intra-annual variability of the ICEP is discussed for specific rivers and integrated coastal regions. The annual dynamics of the eutrophication indicator is analyzed to delimit those periods when the risk of eutrophication is particularly high. The trends in nutrient fluxes and coastal phytoplankton are compared by means of a case study (Seine Bay). The decrease in phosphorus matches a general decrease in phytoplankton biomass in the summer. However, sustained high values of nitrogen still foster the emergence of harmful algal blooms, and we found an increase in the summer abundance of dinoflagellates. The abatement of phosphorus alone is not enough to shortcut harmful blooms and toxic outbreaks in the Seine Bay. A reduction in nitrogen inputs may be necessary to effectively minimize eutrophication problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDinophyceae 3aalgal blooms 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass 3acase studies 3acoasts 3aeutrophication 3aissues and policy 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3arisk 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3aEurope1 aGarnier, Josette1 aLassaletta, Luis1 aBillen, Gilles1 aLe Gendre, Romain1 aRiou, Philippe1 aCugier, Philippe0 tBiogeochemistry.g2013 May, v. 113, no. 1-3 p.481-505dSpringer Netherlandsx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-012-9778-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100006300158245012200221300001600343520163700359592002801996650001702024650003902041650001502080650001602095650000902111650001902120650001802139650001202157650002502169650001202194653000802206653002202214653002602236653001202262653002502274700001802299700002502317773010702342856009302449852000902542655001202551IND60525209320221119062726.0190318e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052520932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.10.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOchota, Małgorzata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9885-969410aSuperoxide dismutase and taurine supplementation improves in vitro blastocyst yield from poor-quality feline oocytes  ap. 922-927.  aBlastocyst production in vitro seems to be crucial part of assisted reproduction techniques in feline species. However, the results of cats’ oocyte maturation and embryo development are still lower than those in other species. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the supplementation with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and taurine during maturation or culture would improve the blastocyst yield obtained from lower grades of oocytes, that are usually discarded, as not suitable for further in vitro purposes. To investigate the effect of antioxidants’ addition, the good- and poor-quality oocytes, were cultured with the addition of 10-mmol taurine and 600 UI/mL SOD. The nuclear maturity, embryo development, and blastocyst quality were subsequently assessed. In control group, without antioxidant supplementation, significantly less poor-quality oocytes matured (42% vs. 62%) and more degenerated (35% vs. 20%), comparing to the experimental group supplemented with SOD and taurine. The amount of obtained blastocyst was much higher, when poor quality oocytes were supplemented with SOD and taurine (supplementation to IVM—4%; supplementation to IVC—5.5%; supplementation to IVM and IVC—5.9% of blastocyst), comparing to not supplemented control group (1.3%). The best blastocysts were obtained when poor oocytes had antioxidants added only during embryo culture (185 ± 13.4 blastomeres vs. 100 ± 1.5 in control). In the present study, we reported that the lower grades of oocytes can better mature and form significantly more blastocysts with better quality, when cultured with addition of SOD and taurine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3ablastocyst 3ablastomeres 3acats 3aembryo culture 3aembryogenesis 3aoocytes 3asuperoxide dismutase 3ataurine 0aCat 0aOocyte maturation 0aBlastocyst production 0aTaurine 0aSuperoxide dismutase1 aPasieka, Anna1 aNiżański, Wojciech0 tTheriogenology.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 85, no. 5 p.922-927dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.10.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245011200210300001400322520132700336592002801663650002101691650001201712650002001724650000901744650000901753650001201762653001801774653001801792653002101810653001601831653001201847700005701859700005501916700002401971773010501995856008702100852000902187655001202196IND60790035420221116150953.0220830e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079003542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaye, Chrystal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7071-777410a‘The day I killed my cows was the day I walked away’: Mycoplasma bovis, moral economy and moral capital  ap. 86-94.  aWe explore the impact of a recent Mycoplasma bovis outbreak on affected farms in southern NZ through the lenses of moral economy and moral capital. Qualitative interviews were conducted with farmers impacted by M. bovis, local veterinarians, rural business advisors, Ministry for Primary Industries staff, and Rural Support Trust staff. In addition to economic capital associated with the business of farming, our research identified several forms of moral capital that were accrued, lost and exchanged across the many layers of the farming moral economy. Reputational moral capital, moral capital associated with productivity of stock, decision-making around killing livestock, and contested compensation claims concerning the value of breeding livestock were evident within participants' accounts of the M. bovis outbreak and its management. We suggest that livestock strongly embody these forms of moral capital in the farming moral economy because animals require care in order to survive and thrive, and the care invested in livestock is paid forward to be realized as economic dividends in the forms of milk, progeny, and meat. This analysis adds depth to understanding farmers' responses to the M. bovis outbreak, the eradication program as it was implemented, and the longer-term impacts during the recovery phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycoplasma bovis 3acapital 3adecision making 3ameat 3amilk 3aprogeny 0aMoral economy 0aMoral capital 0aMycoplasma bovis 0aNew Zealand 0aFarming1 aNoller, Geoff1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5451-028X1 aBryan, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5932-673X1 aDoolan-Noble, Fiona0 tJournal of rural studies.g2022 Oct., v. 95 p.86-94dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03756naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245016800201300001800369500002000387520194500407592002802352596009202380596009202472596002502564596002602589650002002615650001502635650001102650650001102661650002402672650002002696650000902716650001502725650002102740650002402761650002502785650001602810650001102826650001602837650001102853650001402864651001702878651001102895700006302906700006202969773012403031856007403155852000903229655001203238IND60787072320221116171336.0220807e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078707232DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.144832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetean, Flávia F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9949-511610aIntegrative taxonomy identifies a new stingray species of the genus Hypanus Rafinesque, 1818 (Dasyatidae, Myliobatiformes), from the Tropical Southwestern Atlantic  ap. 1120-1142.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn integrative approach by the congruence of genetics, morphology and ecological niche modelling (ENM) was used to delimit a new species of Hypanus (Rafinesque, 1818), a recently resurrected genus of marine stingrays comprising eight species, five of which occur in the western Atlantic. The species with the widest distribution, Hypanus americanus (Hildebrand and Schroeder, 1928), from the northeastern coast of the United States to southeastern Brazil, was demonstrated to be paraphyletic based on protein‐coding mitochondrial genome analyses. This data set also indicates that the genetic distance between the new species Hypanus berthalutzae sp. nov. and its three closely related species (H. americanus, H. longus and H. rudis) varies from 0.82% to 3.14%. In addition, Bayesian Analysis of Population Similarity using the mitochondrial gene mt‐nd2 supports the separation of H. berthalutzae sp. nov. (southwestern Atlantic) from its sister species H. rudis (eastern Atlantic). Similarly, morphological and morphometric analyses corroborated four morphotypes within the H. americanus species group and indicated the ventral caudal fold height and length and interspiracular and interorbital lengths as useful measurements to distinguish among them. Claspers of adult males also exhibit morphological differences among species. The ENM agreed with molecular and morphological analyses and delimits the distribution of H. berthalutzae sp. nov. to shallow areas close to shore along the Brazilian coast, from the mouth of the Amazon River to São Paulo State, including the northeastern oceanic islands, suggesting that the great outflow of fresh water and sediments and the Mid‐Atlantic Ridge might act as barriers.

Thus, the addition of aminopeptidase inhibitors to rabbit semen extenders could be a solution to decrease the hormone degradation. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of the protease activity inhibition on rabbit semen quality parameters and reproductive performance after artificial insemination. Seminal quality was not affected by the incubation with protease inhibitors, being the values of motility, viability, and acrosome integrity not significantly different between the protease inhibitors and the control group. In addition, seminal plasma aminopeptidase activity was inhibited in a 55.1% by the protease inhibitors. On the other hand, regarding the effect of protease inhibitors on reproductive performance, our results showed that the presence of protease inhibitors affected the prolificacy rate (9.2 ± 0.26 and 9.3 ± 0.23 vs. 8.2 ± 0.22 total born per litter for negative control, positive control, and aminopeptidase inhibitors group, respectively; P < 0.05), having this group one kit less per delivery. We conclude that the addition of a wide variety of protease inhibitors in the rabbit semen extender negatively affects prolificacy rate. Therefore, the development of new extenders with specific aminopeptidase inhibitors would be one of the strategies to increase the bioavailability of GnRH analogues without affecting the litter size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrosome 3aaminopeptidases 3aartificial insemination 3abioavailability 3aenzyme activity 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ainsemination 3alitter size 3aproteinase inhibitors 3arabbits 3areproductive performance 3asemen extenders 3aseminal plasma 3aviability 0aRabbit 0aAminopeptidase activity 0aProtease inhibitor 0aSeminal quality 0aReproductive performance1 aVicente, J.S.1 aTalaván, A.M.1 aViudes-de-Castro, M.P.0 tTheriogenology.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 85, no. 5 p.928-932dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.10.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03989naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133040001800169100002100187245011000208300001400318500001900332506007600351506003100427520204600458592002802504596004502532506003702577650001202614650003002626650001802656650001802674650001602692650002302708650001902731650001002750650003102760650001202791650001002803650001602813650001902829650001302848650002202861650001502883650001002898650001502908650001402923651001702937653001802954653002202972653001702994653003203011700001903043700002203062700001703084700002503101773014503126856008303271852000903354655001203363IND60727952020221207115938.0210524e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072795202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rama.2021.01.0042chorus7 a10.1016/j.rama.2021.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrennan, Jameson10aGrazing Behavior, Forage Quality, and Intake Rates of Livestock Grazing Pastures Occupied by Prairie Dogs  ap. 12-21.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aPrairie dogs can reduce the carrying capacity on rangelands by up to 50% through direct consumption of vegetation and by clipping plants. Studies have shown that forage quality and digestibility are greater on prairie dog towns than off town; however, research is lacking that quantifies rates of forage and nutrition intake by cattle. In 2012−2016, a study was conducted in South Dakota to evaluate livestock grazing behavior, diet quality, and forage intake on three plant communities in pastures occupied by prairie dogs. Plant communities studied were grass dominated on-town sites (PDOG-GRASS), forb dominated on-town sites (PDOG-FORB), and grass dominated off-town sites (NO-PDOG). Three pastures with varying levels of prairie dog occupation (0%, 20%, and 40%) were studied. Each pasture was grazed by a herd of yearling steers, a subset of which were fitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars. Daily time spent grazing was estimated for each plant community. Forage quality and intake were estimated using ruminally fistulated steers that were allowed to graze in 30-min increments within each plant community for June, July, and August of each year. Rumen samples were weighed and analyzed for forage quality. Intake was calculated as the rate of organic matter per minute and multiplied by average grazing time based on GPS collar data. Livestock grazing preference decreased linearly (P < 0.001) on PDOG-GRASS sites and increased linearly (P = 0.001) for NO-PDOG sites through the growing season. Crude protein content was significantly higher (P = 0.002) on the PDOG-FORB sites versus PDOG-GRASS and NO-PDOG. Few differences in forage quality were evident between the PDOG-GRASS and NO-PDOG communities. Organic matter intake rates were similar between PDOG-GRASS and NO-PDOG communities; PDOG-FORB intake rates were reduced 59% compared with NO-PDOG sites. This study will inform land managers of potential forage contributions of on-town and off-town plant communities in pastures colonized by prairie dogs.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCynomys 3aadministrative management 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3afeed intake 3afistulated animals 3aforage quality 3aforbs 3aglobal positioning systems 3agrasses 3aherds 3aoccupations 3aorganic matter 3apastures 3aplant communities 3arangelands 3arumen 3avegetation 3ayearlings 3aSouth Dakota 0aforage intake 0alivestock grazing 0aprairie dogs 0awildlife livestock conflict1 aOlson, Kenneth1 aJohnson, Patricia1 aBlock, Janna1 aSchauer, Christopher0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2021 May, v. 76 p.12-21dElsevier Inc.aThe Society for Range ManagementwJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2021.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245007900178300001400257520236100271592002802632650001202660650001902672650001602691650001902707650001102726650001302737650002102750653002002771653001802791653001402809653001602823653001402839700002002853700002002873773010602893856008502999852000903084655001203093IND60630367620221121145457.0200607e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063036762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoppola, A.q(Antonio),10aCharacterization of calcium looping sorbents with a novel twin bed reactor  ap. 49-54.  aThe experimental characterization of sorbents for Calcium Looping (Ca-L) processes is generally accomplished by thermogravimetric analysis or by using single fluidized bed bench scale reactors. These methods may present limitations, the most significant being the poor ability to reproduce the thermal history that sorbent particles experience in a real Ca-L plant. This limitation may severely affect the correct evaluation of the sorbent behavior in terms of CO₂ capture capacity and attrition. In this study, a purposely developed experimental apparatus is applied for Ca-based sorbent testing under conditions that simulate a realistic thermal history of the sorbent. The apparatus consists of two identical lab-scale bubbling beds (Twin Beds - TB) operated batchwise as the calciner and the carbonator, respectively. The reactors are connected to each other via a rapid solids pneumatic transfer line, designed so as to enable rapid and selective transfer of the sorbent from one reactor to the other at the end of each calcination/carbonation stage. The two beds consist mostly of coarse-grained silica sand, acting as a thermal ballast, to which sorbent samples to be characterized are added.The TB apparatus has been used to investigate the effect of the thermal history on the performance of two limestones, in terms of CO₂ capture capacity and attrition tendency, upon multiple calcination/carbonation cycles under the typical operating conditions of the Ca-L process. The results have been compared with those obtained for the same sorbents carried out in a single lab-scale fluidized bed reactor (SB) and under the same operating conditions. The comparison showed that the CO₂ capture capacity in the TB system is larger than that found in SB tests for both sorbents. On the contrary, the absence of strong thermal shocks in the TB experiments leads in general to a decrease of the attrition tendency, with a reversal in terms of generated fines between calcination and carbonation stages. Indeed, the generation rate of fines measured in the TB tests during carbonation is smaller than that measured in the corresponding calcination stage, which is opposite to what was found during the tests in the SB device. These findings indicate that the sorbent thermal history plays a non-negligible role on its CO₂ capture performance in Ca-L.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonation 3afluidized beds 3aquartz 3asorbents 3athermogravimetry 0aCalcium looping 0aFluidized bed 0aLimestone 0aCO2 capture 0aAttrition1 aScala, Fabrizio1 aSalatino, Piero0 tFuel processing technology.g2018 Apr., v. 172 p.49-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245011700168300002000285520145800305592002801763650004401791650002301835650002201858650001501880650001701895650001101912650001401923650002301937650001501960650002001975650001501995650002802010650002802038650000902066650001602075650001802091650001302109650001802122650001402140650001702154650003302171650002402204650002102228650003702249650003702286700001802323700002002341700002602361700001802387700001702405700001902422700001902441773014402460856007402604852000902678655001202687IND60670824720221118061525.0191002e20140909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067082472DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta03097d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeerakumar, Pitchaimani10aHighly stable and active palladium nanoparticles supported on porous carbon for practical catalytic applications  ap. 16015-16022.  aCarbon porous materials (CPMs) containing highly dispersed palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) with an average size of ca. 5 nm were synthesized by microwave (MW) irradiation procedure, during which the Pd²⁺ ions were effectively reduced to the Pd⁰ form and highly dispersed on the carbon support. The Pd/CPM samples were characterized by a variety of analytical and spectroscopy techniques, viz. N₂ adsorption/desorption isotherm measurements, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning and field emission transmission electron microscopy (SEM/FETEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Raman spectroscopy. The Pd/CPM composites were employed as heterogeneous catalysts for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in aqueous media. The reaction was monitored by UV-Visible spectroscopy, yielding a pseudo-first-order rate constant (k) of 6.87 × 10⁻² s⁻¹. Moreover, the catalysts were exploited for C–C coupling reactions using the microwave (MW) method. In addition, a novel electrochemical sensor for the detection of 4-NP was developed based on a Pd/CPM-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) methods. The 4-NP sensor was found to exhibit excellent sensitivity, lower detection limit, reliability, and durability surpassing the reported modified electrodes, rendering practical industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aaminophenols 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3adurability 3aglassy carbon electrode 3aindustrial applications 3aions 3airradiation 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3ap-nitrophenol 3apalladium 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensors (equipment) 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aMadhu, Rajesh1 aChen, Shen-Ming1 aVeeramani, Vediyappan1 aHung, Chin-Te1 aTang, Pi-Hsi1 aWang, Chen-Bin1 aLiu, Shang-Bin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Sept. 9, v. 2, no. 38 p.16015-16022dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta03097d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015000168300001400318520153400332592002801866650002601894650001201920650001101932650001601943650001301959650000901972650001001981650001701991650001302008650001102021650001202032650001102044650001602055653001502071653002102086653002302107653001502130653002602145653001102171700002002182700002002202700002202222773011402244856008302358852000902441655001202450IND60727952120221120141516.0210519e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072795212DNAL7 a10.1053/j.jepm.2021.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaheer, Omar A.10aDiagnosis, treatment, and characterization with advanced diagnostic imaging of an oral ectopic elodontoma in a pet rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)  ap. 28-31.  aOral tumors are uncommon in rabbits, and one study reports benign odontogenic tumors are relatively common compared to domestic companion animals, which has important treatment and prognostic implications.A 10-year-old male intact dwarf-mix rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) presented with weight loss and a 4-day history of progressive inappetence, decreased fecal output, and ptyalism. A head CT revealed a partially mineralized, mildly contrast enhancing oral mass associated with the right buccal mucosa and protruding to the level of the tongue. The head CT also revealed dental malocclusion with an odontogenic abscess ipsilaterally to the mass. An excisional biopsy of the oral mass revealed an ectopic elodontoma. Following excisional biopsy of the oral mass, the rabbit's dental malocclusion was treated with a dental trim and the abscess was treated with systemic antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and surgical debridement with marsupialization. The rabbit continues to have periodic dental trims and has had no clinical recurrence of the mass in the sixteen months following excision, although the buccal mucosa in the location appears irregularly textured.This is the first report to characterize an ectopic oral elodontoma with advanced imaging. Ectopic elodontoma should be a differential diagnosis for buccal mucosal masses in rabbits. Odontogenic oral tumors are more commonly reported in rabbits compared to other nondomestic species, and reasonable long-term control was achieved in this case by excisional biopsy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aabscess 3abiopsy 3adebridement 3aexcision 3ahead 3amales 3amalocclusion 3amedicine 3amucosa 3arabbits 3atongue 3aweight loss 0aElodontoma 0aComplex odontoma 0aEctopic elodontoma 0aOral tumor 0aOryctolagus cuniculus 0aRabbit1 aLudwig, Latasha1 aGardhouse, Sara1 aFoster, Robert A.0 tJournal of exotic pet medicine.g2021 Apr., v. 37 p.28-31dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000103x1557-50637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2021.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008700166520170800253592002801961650002301989650001302012650005202025650001502077650001702092650001702109650002202126650002602148650001702174650001402191650001102205650001802216650002402234653003602258653003502294653002902329653003102358653002102389700001702410700001702427700001202444700001302456700001502469700001702484700005202501700001702553773011202570856008302682852000902765655001202774IND60731484120221121101142.0211003e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073148412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1131602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jiuchuan10a5G-enabled ultra-sensitive fluorescence sensor for proactive prognosis of COVID-19  aThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading around the globe since December 2019.

In this paper, we proposed a 5G-enabled fluorescence sensor for quantitative detection of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 by using mesoporous silica encapsulated up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs@mSiO₂) labeled lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). The sensor can detect spike protein (SP) with a detection of limit (LOD) 1.6 ng/mL and nucleocapsid protein (NP) with an LOD of 2.2 ng/mL. The feasibility of the sensor in clinical use was further demonstrated by utilizing virus culture as real clinical samples. Moreover, the proposed fluorescence sensor is IoMT enabled, which is accessible to edge hardware devices (personal computers, 5G smartphones, IPTV, etc.) through Bluetooth. Medical data can be transmitted to the fog layer of the network and 5G cloud server with ultra-low latency and high reliably for edge computing and big data analysis. Furthermore, a COVID-19 monitoring module working with the proposed the system is developed on a smartphone application (App), which endows patients and their families to record their medical data and daily conditions remotely, releasing the burdens of going to central hospitals. We believe that the proposed system will be highly practical in the future treatment and prevention of COVID-19 and other mass infectious diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aInternet 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3abiosensors 3afluorescence 3aimmunoassays 3amobile telephones 3anucleocapsid proteins 3aporous media 3aprognosis 3asilica 3avirus culture 3awireless technology 0aProactive prognosis of COVID-19 0a5G-enabled fluorescence sensor 0aLateral flow immunoassay 0aInternet of medical things 0a5G communication1 aChen, Shuqin1 aTian, Shulin1 aLiu, Ke1 aNi, Jian1 aZhao, Ming1 aKang, Yuejun1 aMa, Xing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2248-48061 aGuo, Jinhong0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 June 01, v. 181 p.113160-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1131603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245016800161520100100329592002801330650002301358650001601381650001801397650001601415650001401431650001001445650001101455650001201466650002001478650001401498650000901512650001601521653002201537653002301559653000801582653002201590653001501612700001601627700001801643700001601661700005301677700001601730773012801746856008301874852000901957655001201966IND60790035720221116150858.0220914e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079003572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pmpp.2022.1018862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Han12aA cytosolic thiouridylase gene MoCTU2 in Magnaporthe oryzae is important for vegetative hyphal growth, conidiation, and responses to rapamycin and high temperature  aCytoplasmic thiouridylase Ctu1-Ctu2 protein complex is responsible for thiolation on the wobble base U34 of tRNAs and plays an important role in cell development in model organisms. However, the biological function of this protein complex in plant pathogenic fungi remains unknown. In this study, we identified a cytosolic thiouridylase gene MoCTU2 in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. The ΔMoctu2 mutant showed reduced vegetative hyphal growth and conidiation, and increased responses to rapamycin and high temperature. However, MoCTU2 had a minor impact on the ability of the mutant causing blast disease on rice. MoCTU2 was constitutively expressed at various developmental stages, with a peak during appressorium formation; the MoCtu2-GFP fusion was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm. Altogether, our findings indicate that the cytosolic thiouridylase gene MoCTU2 is required for fungal development, conidiation, and responses to rapamycin and high temperature in the blast fungus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aappressoria 3ablast disease 3aconidiation 3acytoplasm 3agenes 3ahyphae 3amutants 3aplant pathology 3arapamycin 3arice 3atemperature 0aRice blast fungus 0aPyricularia oryzae 0aTOR 0atRNA modification 0aThiolation1 aZuo, Yushan1 aZhang, Huixia1 aLiu, Cuicui1 aYang, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6085-92451 aChen, Lijie0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2022 Sept., v. 121 p.101886-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl39032x0885-57657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2022.1018863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245008600166300001200252520135900264592002801623650000801651650001501659650001501674650002401689650001501713650002901728650001301757700002001770700001601790700001801806773010901824856007901933852000902012655001202021IND60749279220221120151916.0210901e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074927922DNAL7 a10.1186/1743-422X-7-2372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Johanna A12aA role for the histone deacetylase HDAC4 in the life-cycle of HIV-1-based vectors  ap. 237.  aHIV-1 integration is mediated by the HIV-1 integrase protein, which joins 3'-ends of viral DNA to host cell DNA. To complete the integration process, HIV-1 DNA has to be joined to host cell DNA also at the 5'-ends. This process is called post-integration repair (PIR). Integration and PIR involve a number of cellular co-factors. These proteins exhibit different degrees of involvement in integration and/or PIR. Some are required for efficient integration or PIR. On the other hand, some reduce the efficiency of integration. Finally, some are involved in integration site selection. We have studied the role of the histone deacetylase HDAC4 in these processes. HDAC4 was demonstrated to play a role in both cellular double-strand DNA break repair and transcriptional regulation. We observed that HDAC4 associates with viral DNA in an integrase-dependent manner. Moreover, infection with HIV-1-based vectors induces foci of the HDAC4 protein. The related histone deacetylases, HDAC2 and HDAC6, failed to associate with viral DNA after infection. These data suggest that HDAC4 accumulates at integration sites. Finally, overexpression studies with HDAC4 mutants suggest that HDAC4 may be required for efficient transduction by HIV-1-based vectors in cells that are deficient in other DNA repair proteins. We conclude that HDAC4 is likely involved in PIR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3ahistone deacetylase 3aintegrases 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirology1 aYeung, Jennifer1 aKao, Gary D1 aDaniel, Rene,0 tVirology journal.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.237-237dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-7-2373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011300164300001600277500001500293520122100308592002801529650002201557650002201579650001901601650002501620650002101645650001501666650002101681650001601702650002301718650001401741650001901755650001901774653004501793653002101838653002501859653003101884653001801915653001401933700001501947700001701962700001901979700001201998700001402010700001602024700001602040700001702056700001302073773012502086856008202211852000902293655001202302IND60609390820221119224035.0180823e20170701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060939082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2017.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yongjin10aSimple and facile ultrasound-assisted fabrication of Bi2O2CO3/g-C3N4 composites with excellent photoactivity  ap. 144-154.  a2019-12-06  aBi2O2CO3/g-C3N4 (BOC/CN) composites photocatalyst was fabricated via a facile ultrasonic-assisted method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical and photocatalytic properties of the as-prepared samples were characterized by various analytical techniques. The results indicated that the Bi2O2CO3 nanoflakes grew on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets, forming closely contacted interfaces between the Bi2O2CO3 and the g-C3N4 component. BOC/CN composites with 50wt% of g-C3N4 showed the optimal photoactivity for the degradation of RhB under visible light, which was approximately 2.2 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4 and 7 times of pure Bi2O2CO3, respectively. The enhanced performance of the BOC/CN composites was mainly attributed to a synergistic effect including the accelerated separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers, demonstrated by Photoluminescence (PL), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and photocurrent density. Finally, a possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed based on the experimental results. It is expected that such a facile route method could provide new insights into fabricating other g-C3N4-based composite photocatalysts for environmental remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphotoluminescence 3acrystal structure 3aphotocatalysis 3aultrasonic treatment 3aelectrochemistry 3ananosheets 3aelectric current 3aremediation 3aanalytical methods 3asynergism 3acarbon nitride 3aphotocatalysts 0aBi2O2CO3/g-C3N4 composites photocatalyst 0aPhotodegradation 0aPhotocurrent density 0aUltrasonic assisted method 0aVisible light 0aimpedance1 aBian, Yuan1 aTan, Pengfei1 aShang, Yanyang1 aLiu, Yi1 aWu, Laidi1 aZhu, Anquan1 aLiu, Wenwen1 aXiong, Xiang1 aPan, Jun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2017 July 01, v. 497 p.144-154dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05256naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245008800165520319600253592002803449596009903477596008903576650002903665650001003694650002203704650000903726650002103735650001203756650002003768650001803788650002003806650002203826650001403848650001103862650001003873650001503883650001003898650001103908650001303919650003303932650001703965650001803982650003104000650001404031650001504045650001304060650001804073650002404091650002504115650001404140650001204154650002004166651001004186653001504196653001804211653001304229700001204242700001604254700001804270700001904288700005704307773010204364856008304466852000904549655001204558IND60682782820221119160943.0200131e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068278282DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-19-1093-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFayette, J.10aFirst Report of Lasiodiplodia hormozganensis Causing Fruit Rot of Eggplant in Haiti  aEggplant (Solanum melongena) is a major component of the vegetable crop produced for domestic consumption within Haiti, estimated at 851 metric tons in 2017 (FAO 2019). In a preliminary study in June 2018, eggplant fruits were observed with circular, tan, water-soaked lesions that extended to the entire fruit, which became spongy and mummified. Incidence of disease in two plots at the Centre Rural de Développement Durable de Bas-Boen, Croix-des-Bouquets, Haiti, was estimated at 20%. Two isolates, G18-1373 and G18-1374, were obtained from the margins of actively expanding lesions and cultured on water agar plates supplemented with sterile pine needles. Conidia were produced in pycnidia after 14 days at 25°C and were cylindrical to spherical in shape, melanized, striated, with equatorially positioned septa and measured 18.7 ± 2.8 μm long and 11.2 ± 1.3 μm wide (n = 400 per isolate), placing the isolates morphologically in Lasiodiplodia. Pathogenicity testing of both isolates was performed on two eggplant fruits for each of the two isolates, plus a negative control fruit. Prior to inoculation, the fruits were surface sterilized for 1 min in dilute bleach (0.6% sodium hypochlorite solution) and then rinsed twice with sterile tap water. Inoculation was performed by excising a 5-mm-diameter tissue core out of the fruit, which was replaced with a 5-mm-diameter acidified potato dextrose agar (APDA) plug containing actively growing hyphal tips. Negative controls were inoculated solely with a 5-mm core of APDA. The wounds were wrapped with Parafilm following inoculation, and the fruits were placed in a humid chamber kept at 25°C. Three days postinoculation, the fruits were evaluated for disease development. The inoculation experiment was repeated twice. The control fruits remained asymptomatic. Fungi were reisolated from the symptomatic plants and compared with the original strains, matching morphological identity to the original isolates. However, morphology is not a suitable characteristic to distinguish species in Lasiodiplodia, so regions of the internal transcribed spacer rDNA (White et al. 1990), translation elongation factor 1-α (Machado et al. 2014), and β-tubulin (Glass and Donaldson 1995) were sequenced for both isolates, resulting in GenBank accession numbers MK040609, MK040610, MK040617, MK040618, MK040619, and MK040620, respectively. A combined phylogenetic tree obtained by maximum likelihood using MEGA (https://megasoftware.net) and checked for concatenation allowance using PAUP (https://paup.phylosolutions.com) grouped the isolates within the Lasiodiplodia hormozganensis clade. The genus Lasiodiplodia contains several important phytopathogenic species on a wide range of hosts (Alves et al. 2008), including closely related L. theobromae, reported to cause fruit spot on eggplant (Vieira et al. 2018; Woodward et al. 2005). To our knowledge, this is the first report of L. hormozganensis causing fruit rot in eggplant. Chemical disease management is limited in Haiti; therefore, investigation of the host range and disease incidence in eggplant growing areas is necessary to determine if removal of inoculum is a viable strategy.  aPublisher supplied data  acooperative agreement # AID-OAA-A-15-00039cUnited States Agency for International Development  acooperative agreement # 2016-37620-25850cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aLasiodiplodia theobromae 3aPinus 3aSolanum melongena 3aagar 3ableaching agents 3aconidia 3aconifer needles 3aculture media 3adisease control 3adisease incidence 3aeggplants 3afruits 3afungi 3ahost range 3ahosts 3ahyphae 3ainoculum 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amelanization 3apathogenicity 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphylogeny 3aplant rots 3apycnidia 3aribosomal DNA 3asodium hypochlorite 3astatistical analysis 3atap water 3atubulin 3avegetable crops 3aHaiti 0avegetables 0aLasiodiplodia 0aeggplant1 aBec, S.1 aLoubeau, S.1 aFulton, J.

The comprehensive gasification model (CGM), having two reaction regions and one radial heat transfer region, was used to simulate the influence of the swirl number (SN) on gasification performance, multiphase flow, reactions in the space, and reactions regarding the membrane wall. The results show that an SN of 0.66 is a critical point to divide low-swirl and high-swirl flows for the single-swirl-burner gasifiers of this study. Gasifier performance increases sharply with increased SN for low-swirl burners, whereas SN has little influence on gasifier performance (and multiphase flow) for high-swirl cases.In this paper, we examine the relationship between burner swirl and flow fields, temperature distributions in the space and on membrane wall, slag thickness, and the molten slag velocity distribution on the membrane wall. The influence of SN on these parameters is more remarkable at the top of the reattachment point than below it. The slag layer formed on the membrane wall isolates high-temperature gas effectively, except around the reattachment point. To guarantee gasifier performance and membrane wall safety, the burner SN should be between 0.66 and 0.9 for the single-swirl-burner gasifiers of this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburners 3acoal 3agasification 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3aslags 3atemperature 0aComprehensive gasification model 0aSlag 0aNumerical simulation 0aGasification 0aSwirl flow1 aLiang, Qinfeng1 aDai, Zhenghua1 aLiu, Haifeng0 tFuel processing technology.g2018 Apr., v. 172 p.142-154dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245011900163300001200282520137600294592002801670650001901698650003501717650000801752650001701760650001301777650001401790650001901804650001501823650001301838700001801851700001901869700002001888773010901908856007902017852000902096655001202105IND60749279420221120151908.0210901e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074927942DNAL7 a10.1186/1743-422X-7-2392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Gab Jung10aDynamic correlation between CTL response and viral load in primary human immunodeficiency virus-1 infected Koreans  ap. 239.  aBACKGROUND: HIV-1 specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have an important role as antiviral effector cells for controlling HIV-1 infection. METHODS: To investigate CTL response during the early stage of HIV infection, we measured immunity-related factors including CD4⁺ T cell counts, CD8⁺ T cell counts, HIV-1 RNA viral loads and IFN-γ secretion according to CTL response in 78 selected primary HIV-1-infected Koreans. RESULTS: The CTL response was strongly induced by HIV-1 specific Gag and Nef peptides (p = 0.016) compared with induction by Tat or Env peptides. These results suggest that the major antiviral factors inducing strong HIV-specific CTL responses are associated with the Gag and Nef viral regions in primary HIV-1 infected Koreans. The relationship between viral load and CTL response showed varying correlations with time following HIV infection. CTL response was inversely correlated with viral loads at preseroconversion stage I (r = -0.224 to -0.33) and changed to a positive correlation at the preseroconversion stage II (r = 0.132 to 0.854). Finally, it changed to an inverse correlation again after seroconversion until a viral set point was established on serological profiling (r = -0.195 to -0.407). CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a dynamic correlation between viral load and subsequent CTL responses during early HIV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aRNA 3acytotoxicity 3apeptides 3asecretion 3aseroconversion 3aviral load 3avirology1 aLee, Hak Sung1 aHong, Kee-Jong1 aKim, Sung-Soon,0 tVirology journal.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.239-239dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-7-2393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013500168520187800303592002802181650002502209650001302234650001602247650001502263650001002278650001802288650001302306650001602319650001002335650001502345650001302360650001002373650001902383650001902402650001002421650001502431650002802446650001402474650001402488650001702502650001402519651001002533653002502543653001902568653002802587653001802615653002102633653002402654700001302678700001602691700001902707700001802726700001802744700001302762700001702775700001702792773011502809856008502924852000903009655001203018IND60727952520221120131147.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072795252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1047682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Xuehuai10aComprehensive genomic analysis and characterization of a new ST 174 type Klebsiella variicola strain isolated from chicken embryos  aKlebsiella variicola is a widespread opportunistic pathogen that causes infections in humans and animals. Herein a novel Klebsiella strain, AHKv-S01, was isolated and identified from dead chicken embryos in Anhui, China. Its genome contained a circular chromosome of 5,505,304 bp, with 5244 protein-coding genes, and an integrative conjugative element region containing 79 ORF sequences. AHKv-S01 was given a new sequence type number—174. Phylogenetic analyses showed that rpoB partial nucleotide sequences were highly reliable for identifying Klebsiella spp. Most of the 340 unique genes of AHKv-S01 were involved in cell envelop biogenesis, transcription, transport, and metabolic processes. Moreover, AHKv-S01 was sensitive to several antibiotics, but it showed strong resistance to penicillins, macrolides, and lincosamide. The genome contained three drug efflux pump superfamilies, β-lactamase genes, and fosfomycin resistance-related genes. Most drug resistance genes showed amino acid mutations. Multiple virulence and pathogenic factors were also identified, and they were mainly related to adhesion, secretion, iron acquisition, and immune evasion. Chicken embryo lethality assay results revealed that the 7-day chicken embryo lethality rate was 80%, 40%, and 50% for AHKv-S01, K. pneumoniae ATCC10031, and K. pneumoniae CICC24714, respectively. The median lethal dose of AHKv-S01 was 39.9 CFU/embryo. Even low infection levels of AHKv-S01 caused a significant reduction in chicken embryo hatchability. Severe pathological changes to the liver, heart, and brain tissues of embryos infected with AHKv-S01 were observed, and these changes appeared earlier in the heart and brain than in the liver. To conclude, our results provide a foundation for further studies aiming to assess the potential risk of K. variicola to poultry populations and production yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella variicola 3aadhesion 3aamino acids 3abiogenesis 3abrain 3achick embryos 3achickens 3achromosomes 3adeath 3afosfomycin 3agenomics 3aheart 3aimmune evasion 3alethal dose 50 3aliver 3amacrolides 3aopportunistic pathogens 3aphylogeny 3asecretion 3atransporters 3avirulence 3aChina 0aKlebsiella variicola 0aChicken embryo 0aWhole genome sequencing 0aSequence type 0aEmbryo lethality 0aEmbryo hatchability1 aYin, Lei1 aMa, Haitian1 aPan, Xiaocheng1 aZhang, Danjun1 aZhao, Ruihong1 aDai, Yin1 aHou, Hongyan1 aHu, Xiaomiao0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2021 June, v. 90 p.104768-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1047683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008200173300001400255520167600269592002801945650002301973650002201996650001302018650001202031650002002043650001802063650001302081650001102094650001802105650002502123650002302148650002102171650001702192653001702209653002302226653001402249653001802263653002002281653002902301700002502330700001302355773010602368856008502474852000902559655001202568IND60630368220221121145503.0200607e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063036822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNatarajan, Pradeep10aMicrowave torrefaction of Prosopis juliflora: Experimental and modeling study  ap. 86-96.  aThis study is focused on evaluating the effect of particle size and microwave power on torrefaction of the invasive biomass species, Prosopis juliflora (PJF), via experiments and theoretical model. Experiments were conducted using a central composite design (CCD) approach to construct response surfaces capturing the effects of these two factors on three key characteristics of the obtained char, viz. yield, calorific value and energy recovery. Highest char yield was obtained at an intermediate microwave power for a given particle size, while the calorific value increased with both the parameters. The response surface for energy recovery was convex with maxima at 481W power for 1.9mm particles. A microwave-based thermogravimetric study was conducted to obtain the mass loss profile during torrefaction. Assuming a global, single-step, power-law kinetic model with Arrhenius-type rate constant for torrefaction, the apparent activation energy and reaction order were estimated to be 173.93kJmol⁻¹ and 1.3, respectively. To explain the trends of char yields, a new approach was proposed that integrates the temperature profile information with the inferred kinetic model. Two parameters, viz. torrefaction time and average temperature, are introduced to quantify the temperature profiles during torrefaction. The generic model can be extended to any biomass species and reactor configuration by conducting suitable experiments. Detailed composition analysis of the bio-oil revealed that, unlike conventional torrefaction, significant degradation of lignin also occurred along with hemicellulose degradation at low bulk temperatures during microwave torrefaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProsopis juliflora 3aactivation energy 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aenergy recovery 3ahemicellulose 3akinetics 3alignin 3aparticle size 3atemperature profiles 3atheoretical models 3athermogravimetry 3atorrefaction 0aTorrefaction 0aProsopis juliflora 0aMicrowave 0aParticle size 0aMicrowave power 0aCentral composite design1 aSuriapparao, Dadi V.1 aVinu, R.0 tFuel processing technology.g2018 Apr., v. 172 p.86-96dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024001700115024002800132040001800160100002000178245009600198300001600294506017300310520139400483592002801877650001401905650002001919650002001939650001201959650001601971650001301987650001202000650001702012650001302029650003502042650001502077650001802092650002002110650001202130650001502142650001202157650001202169650001102181650001902192650001102211650001302222650001402235650002102249650002202270700001702292700003202309700001702341700002102358700002302379700002202402773013002424856011202554856007402666956013402740961001302874852000902887655001202896IND60480305620221214225855.0160126e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048030562DNAL7 a10113/621062hdl7 a3155922aris7 a10.1111/jipb.123752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScully, Erin D.10aCharacterization of novel Brown midrib 6 mutations affecting lignin biosynthesis in sorghum  ap. 136-149.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe presence of lignin reduces the quality of lignocellulosic biomass for forage materials and feedstock for biofuels. In C4 grasses, the brown midrib phenotype has been linked to mutations to genes in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway. For example, the Bmr6 gene in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) has been previously shown to encode cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), which catalyzes the final step of the monolignol biosynthesis pathway. Mutations in this gene have been shown to reduce the abundance of lignin, enhance digestibility, and improve saccharification efficiencies and ethanol yields. Nine sorghum lines harboring five different bmr6 alleles were identified in an EMS‐mutagenized TILLING population. DNA sequencing of Bmr6 revealed that the majority of the mutations impacted evolutionarily conserved amino acids while three‐dimensional structural modeling predicted that all of these alleles interfered with the enzyme's ability to bind with its NADPH cofactor. All of the new alleles reduced in vitro CAD activity levels and enhanced glucose yields following saccharification. Further, many of these lines were associated with higher reductions in acid detergent lignin compared to lines harboring the previously characterized bmr6‐ref allele. These bmr6 lines represent new breeding tools for manipulating biomass composition to enhance forage and feedstock quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 plants 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aSorghum bicolor 3aalleles 3aamino acids 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3abreeding 3acinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 3adetergents 3adigestibility 3aenzyme activity 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3aglucose 3agrasses 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amodels 3amutation 3aphenotype 3asaccharification 3asequence analysis1 aGries, Tammy1 aFunnell‐Harris, Deanna L.1 aXin, Zhanguo1 aKovacs, Frank A.1 aVermerris, Wilfred1 aSattler, Scott E.0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2016 Feb., v. 58, no. 2 p.136-149dBlackwell Pub.wJournal:jnl3949844x1672-90727nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/621063Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.123753Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Scully_et_al-2016-Journal_of_Integrative_Plant_Biology.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245006400171520205100235592002802286650001302314650001302327650001702340650001302357650003002370650001402400650001402414650000902428651001102437651001502448651001802463653002002481653000902501653001802510653003102528653003102559700001902590700002302609700002102632700001902653773011502672856008502787852000902872655001202881IND60727952620221120131250.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072795262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1047692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarcissac, Edith10aParamyxovirus circulation in bat species from French Guiana  aBats are recognized as reservoirs of numerous viruses. Among them, paramyxoviruses, for example, Hendra and Nipah viruses, are highly pathogenic to humans. Nothing is known regarding the circulation of this viral family in bats from French Guiana. To search for the presence of paramyxoviruses in this territory, 103 bats of seven different species were sampled and screened using a molecular approach.Four distinct paramyxovirus sequences were detected from three bat species (Desmodus rotundus, Carollia perspicillata, and Pteronotus alitonus) at high prevalence rates. In D. rotundus, two types of paramyxovirus co-circulate, with most of the bats co-infected.The phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed that three of them were closely related to previously characterized sequences from D. rotundus, C. perspicillata, and P. parnellii from Brazil and Costa Rica. The fourth sequence, identified in D. rotundus, was closely related to the one detected in P. alitonus in French Guiana and to previously described sequences detected in P. parnellii in Costa Rica. All paramyxovirus sequences detected in this study are close to the Jeilongvirus genus.Altogether, our results and those of previous studies indicate a wide geographical distribution of these paramyxoviruses (from Central to South America) and suggest potential cross-species transmissions of paramyxoviruses between two different bat families: Mormoopidae (P. alitonus) and Phyllostomidae (D. rotundus). In addition, their closeness to paramyxoviruses identified in rodents emphasizes the need to investigate the role of these animals as potential reservoirs or incidental hosts. Finally, the high prevalence rates of some paramyxoviruses in certain bat species, associated with the presence of large bat colonies and, in some cases, their potential proximity with humans are all parameters that can contribute to the risk of cross-species transmission between bat species and to the emergence of new paramyxoviruses in humans, a risk that deserves further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarollia 3aDesmodus 3aRespirovirus 3agenetics 3ageographical distribution 3ainfection 3aphylogeny 3arisk 3aBrazil 3aCosta Rica 3aFrench Guiana 0aParamyxoviruses 0aBats 0aFrench Guiana 0aPhylogenetic relationships 0aCross-species transmission1 aDonato, Damien1 aThoisy, Benoit de,1 aLacoste, Vincent1 aLavergne, Anne0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2021 June, v. 90 p.104769-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1047693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006900147245013700216300001500353520155500368592002801923650002301951650001301974650002801987650002502015650001802040650001602058650001102074650002202085650000902107650001202116650003302128650002402161650000902185650001302194650001002207651001002217653002602227653002002253653001902273700001802292700001702310773013502327856008102462852000902543655001202552IND60698446420221119114504.0200612e20200714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069844642DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145200006042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubuga, Clement Kubreziga1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7856-495210aFood-based indicators are related to iron and iodine deficiencies of mother–toddler dyads during the lean season in northern Ghana  ap. 92-101.  aFe and iodine deficiencies are among the common forms of nutritional deficiencies globally and cause detrimental effects on mother and child. In developing countries, strategies to address these problems rarely use preventative dietary approaches. This cross-sectional study aims to ascertain whether dietary diversity score (DDS) and dietary patterns (DP) can predict the associated risk (AR) of Fe and iodine deficiencies in mother–toddler dyads during the dry/lean season in northern Ghana. Data were collected from women (15–49 years; n 118) and their toddlers (6–23 months, n 121). Dyads DDS and DP were calculated from their food intake recall. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine whether DDS, DP and socio-demographic factors predict higher odds of Fe and iodine deficiencies in dyads. DDS and DP predicted Fe and iodine deficiencies AR. Compared with DDS ≥4, women with DDS <4 have higher odds of Fe deficiency (ID) (adjusted OR (AOR) 1·82, 95 % CI 1·03, 3·21) and iodine deficiency (AOR 9·73, 95 % CI 3·19, 29·67). Two DP emerged in principal component analyses, ‘rural elites diet’ predicted ID risk in mothers (AOR 8·65, 95 % CI 1·76, 42·39), while ‘indigenous diet’ predicted iodine deficiency risk (AOR 11·41, 95 % CI 1·36, 95·97) in mothers only. The AR of Fe and iodine deficiencies in vulnerable populations may be predicted by diet-based measures in northern Ghana. We recommend further research into DDS and DP to predict Fe and iodine status of mother–toddler dyads in Ghana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3adeveloping countries 3aeating habits 3afood intake 3aiodine 3aiodine deficiency 3airon 3amothers 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3atoddlers 3awomen 3aGhana 0aFood-based indicators 0aDry/lean season 0aMicronutrients1 aKennedy, Gina1 aSong, Won O.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2020 July 14, v. 124, no. 1 p.92-101dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145200006043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245009700173300001100270520159200281592002801873650001701901650000801918650001801926650002001944650001701964650002101981650002202002650001402024650002902038650001502067650001302082650001302095650001202108700002202120700002202142773010702164856007802271852000902349655001202358IND60749279720221120151924.0210901e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074927972DNAL7 a10.1186/1743-422X-7-392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Marie-Noëlle10aCharacterization of transgene expression in adenoviral vector-based HIV-1 vaccine candidates  ap. 39.  aRecombinant adenovirus vectors have been extensively used in gene therapy clinical studies. More recently, the capability of inducing potent cell-mediated and humoral immunity has made these vectors equally attractive candidates for prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine applications. Merck and Co., Inc., developed HIV-1 vaccine candidates based on adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vectors in which the E1 gene, a critical component for adenovirus replication, was replaced by the cytomegalovirus immediate/early promoter, followed by mutated versions of the HIV-1 gag, pol or nef genes (constructs referred to as MRKAd5gag, MRKAd5pol and MRKAd5nef, respectively). Vaccine performance was evaluated in vitro in a novel assay that measures the level of transgene expression in non-permissive A549 cells. Various combinations of vectors were studied. The results indicate that the vaccine induces a dose-dependent expression of the HIV-1 transgenes in vitro. Furthermore, the gag, pol, and nef transgenes are expressed differentially in A549 cells in an MOI-dependent and formulation-dependent manner, yielding an unexpected enhancement of protein expression in trivalent vs. monovalent formulations. Our data suggest that the presence of additional virus in multivalent formulations increases individual transgene expression in A549 cells, even when the amount of DNA encoding the gene of interest remains constant. This enhancement appears to be controlled at the transcriptional level and related to both the total amount of virus and the combination of transgenes present in the formulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aDNA 3adose response 3agene expression 3agene therapy 3ahumoral immunity 3aprotein synthesis 3aserotypes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenes 3avaccines 3avirology 3aviruses1 aRolling, Judith A1 aOwen, Katherine E0 tVirology journal.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.39-39dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-7-393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015200169300001400321500001900335520142300354592002801777650001201805650001801817650001601835650001001851650001201861650001501873650001801888650001101906650001101917650001101928653001601939653004701955653002002002653000902022700002002031700005702051700001902108773013402127856008102261852000902342655001202351IND60698446520221119114609.0200612e20200714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069844652DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145200006412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBailey, Hannah M.10aMost meat products have digestible indispensable amino acid scores that are greater than 100, but processing may increase or reduce protein quality  ap. 14-22.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that meat products have digestible indispensable amino acid scores (DIAAS) >100 and that various processing methods will increase standardised ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) and DIAAS. Nine ileal-cannulated gilts were randomly allotted to a 9 × 8 Youden square design with nine diets and eight 7-d periods. Values for SID of AA and DIAAS for two reference patterns were calculated for salami, bologna, beef jerky, raw ground beef, cooked ground beef and ribeye roast heated to 56, 64 or 72°C. The SID of most AA was not different among salami, bologna, beef jerky and cooked ground beef, but was less (P < 0·05) than the values for raw ground beef. The SID of AA for 56°C ribeye roast was not different from the values for raw ground beef and 72°C ribeye roast, but greater (P < 0·05) than those for 64°C ribeye roast. For older children, adolescents and adults, the DIAAS for all proteins, except cooked ground beef, were >100 and bologna and 64°C ribeye roast had the greatest (P < 0·05) DIAAS. The limiting AA for this age group were sulphur AA (beef jerky), leucine (bologna, raw ground beef and cooked ground beef) and valine (salami and the three ribeye roasts). In conclusion, meat products generally provide high-quality protein with DIAAS >100 regardless of processing. However, overcooking meat may reduce AA digestibility and DIAAS.  aPublisher supplied data 3abologna 3adigestibility 3aground beef 3aileum 3aleucine 3ameat jerky 3aprotein value 3asalami 3asulfur 3avaline 0aAmino acids 0aDigestible indispensable amino acid scores 0aProtein quality 0aBeef1 aMathai, John K.1 aBerg, Eric P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6173-62791 aStein, Hans H.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2020 July 14, v. 124, no. 1 p.14-22dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145200006413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001700158245021600175300001600391520152200407592002801929650002601957650001901983650001202002650002002014650003102034650001002065650001802075650001302093650001502106650004302121650002202164650002002186650001102206653001702217653002202234653001002256653000902266653001802275653001102293700001802304700001402322700001502336700001402351700001702365700001902382700001802401700001502419773010702434856009302541852000902634655001202643IND60525210120221119062722.0190318e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052521012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Weiwei10aCoordinated microRNA and messenger RNA expression profiles for understanding sexual dimorphism of gonads and the potential roles of microRNA in the steroidogenesis pathway in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)  ap. 970-978.  aSexual dimorphism is a widespread phenomenon in animals. However, the potential role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating this dimorphism is not fully understood. In our study, we used an integrated approach to identify functional targets of miRNA by combining the paired expression profiles of miRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in ovaries and testes of young Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. The results revealed that 67 upregulated and nine downregulated miRNAs and 2299 upregulated and 3260 downregulated genes were identified in the ovary compared with those in the testis (P < 0.01). The target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted and overlapped with the differentially expressed mRNAs. Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were conducted in these coincident genes. By correlating miRNA-mRNA and predicting computational target, two types of negatively regulatory miRNA-mRNA correlations (upregulated or downregulated miRNA and downregulated or upregulated mRNA) were obtained. Seven functional miRNA-target gene pairs, miR-17-5p/DMRT1, miR-20a/DMRT1, miR-138/CYP17A2, miR-338/CYP17A2, miR-200a/CYP17A2, miR-456/AMH, and miR-138/AMH, were predicted at the sequence level and further detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction on the basis of the significantly negative relationships. Our results suggest that the integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiling can provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of sexual dimorphism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aanimal ovaries 3aanimals 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3aprediction 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asexual dimorphism 3asteroidogenesis 3atestes 0aNile tilapia 0aSexual dimorphism 0amiRNA 0amRNA 0aTranscriptome 0aGonads1 aLiu, Wenzhong1 aLiu, Qing1 aLi, Baojun1 aAn, Lixia1 aHao, Ruirong1 aZhao, Jinliang1 aLiu, Shaozhen1 aSong, Jing0 tTheriogenology.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 85, no. 5 p.970-978dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245005200162520175200214592002801966650002101994650001502015650001702030650002102047650001002068650001702078653002602095653002602121653001702147653002102164653002002185700001802205700001702223700001502240700002702255700001902282700001902301700001502320700001502335773011202350856008302462852000902545655001202554IND60731484720221121210938.0220621e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073148472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1131662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Qing10aCell nucleus as endogenous biological micropump  aMicropumps can generate directional microflows in blood vessels or bio-capillaries for targeted transport of nanoparticles and cells in vivo, which is highly significant for biomedical applications from active drug delivery to precision clinical therapy. Meanwhile, they have been extensively used in the biosensing fields with their unique features of autonomous motion, easy surface functionalization, dynamic capture and effective isolation of analytes in complex biological media. However, synthetic devices for actuating microflows, including pumps and motors, generally exhibit poor or limited biocompatibility with living organisms as a result of the invasive implantation of exogenous materials into blood vessels. Here we demonstrate a method of constructing endogenous micropumps by extracting nuclei from red blood cells, thus making them intrinsically and completely biocompatible. The nuclei are extracted and then driven by a scanning optical tweezing system. By a precise actuation of the microflows, nanoparticles and cells are navigated to target destinations, and the transport velocity and direction is controlled by the multifunctional dynamics of the micropumps. With the targeted transport of functionalized micro/nanoparticles followed by a dynamic mixing in microliter blood samples, the micropumps provide considerable promises to enhance the target binding efficiency and improve the sensitivity and speed of biological assays in vivo. Furthermore, multiplexing by simultaneously driving an array of multiple nuclei is demonstrated, thus confirming that the micropumps could provide a bio-friendly high-throughput in vivo platform for the treatment of blood diseases, microenvironment monitoring, and biomedical analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiosensors 3acell nucleus 3achemical species 3adrugs 3atherapeutics 0aOptofluidic transport 0aEndogenous micropumps 0aCell nucleus 0aOptical tweezers 0aActive delivery1 aWang, Weihong1 aLi, Xiaogang1 aLi, Yuchao1 aFerraro, P.q(Pietro),1 aJiao, Xingyuan1 aLiu, Xiaoshuai1 aZhang, Yao1 aLi, Baojun0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 June 15, v. 182 p.113166-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1131663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03805naa a2200913 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002000167245012600187300001600313520153000329592002801859650000801887650001801895650001201913650001301925650001901938650002301957650001301980650001901993650001802012650001202030650002602042650001702068650001302085650003002098650001702128650001002145650003002155650001102185650001102196650002802207650001202235650000902247650001602256650002602272650002602298651001102324653000702335653000702342653000802349653000902357653001302366653001302379653000702392653000802399653000702407653000702414653000702421653000902428653001002437653000702447653000702454653000802461653000902469653000702478653000902485653000802494653000702502653002002509653000902529653001702538653001302555653002702568700001902595700001902614700002102633700002102654700001702675700002102692773007502713856008202788852000902870655001202879IND60099091920221118220430.0161021e20130925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009909192DNAL7 a238315122pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalkan, Göknur14aThe association between Interleukin (IL)-4 gene intron 3 VNTR polymorphism and alopecia areata (AA) in Turkish population  ap. 565-569.  aAlopecia areata (AA) is hypothesized to be an organ-specific autoimmune disease of hair follicles mediated by T cells. As immunological and genetic factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AA, the purpose of the present study was to investigate possible associations between the functional Interleukin (IL)-4 gene intron 3 VNTR polymorphism and AA susceptibility and disease progression in Turkish population.The study group consisted of 116 unrelated patients with AA and 125 unrelated healthy controls. Genomic DNA was isolated and IL-4 gene 70bp VNTR polymorphism determined by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers.No association was observed between AA patients and controls according to genotype distribution (p=0.051). The allele distribution of IL-4 gene intron 3 VNTR polymorphism was statistically different between AA patients and control group (p=0.026). The frequency of P1 allele in patients was significantly higher than that in the control group. When the P2P2 genotype was compared with P1P2+P1P1 genotypes, a statistically significant difference was observed between patients and controls (p=0.036). Intron 3 VNTR polymorphism in the IL-4 gene was found to be associated with AA susceptibility in Turkish population.The results suggest that IL-4 VNTR polymorphism in the intron 3 region may be a risk factor for the development of AA among Turkish population. This is the first to report that intron 3 VNTR polymorphism in the IL-4 gene is associated with AA susceptibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aT-lymphocytes 3aalleles 3aalopecia 3adisease course 3adisease resistance 3agenotype 3ahair follicles 3ainterleukin-4 3aintrons 3aminisatellite repeats 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 2aAdult 2aAlopecia Areataxgenetics 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInterleukin-4xgenetics 2aIntrons 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMinisatellite Repeats 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 0aTurkey 0aAA 0aIL 0aPCR 0aVNTR 0aTh cells 0aTC cells 0aNK 0aTNF 0aAT 0aAU 0aSD 0aSPSS 0aANOVA 0aOR 0aCI 0aHLA 0aSNPs 0aRA 0aESRD 0aSLE 0aMS 0aAlopecia areata 0aIL-4 0aPolymorphism 0aAlopecia 0aGenetic skin disorders1 aKarakus, Nevin1 aBaş, Yalçın1 aTakçı, Zennure1 aÖzuğuz, Pınar1 aAteş, Ömer1 aYigit, Serbulent0 tGene.g2013 Sept. 25, v. 527 p.565-569dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006400167300001600231500001900247520219400266592002802460650002702488650001302515650001102528650001502539650002402554650000902578650002502587650001202612651000902624700002302633700002202656700002202678700002302700700002402723700002102747700002102768700003002789700002902819700002102848700001702869773013402886856008303020852000903103655001203112IND60701415020221118115727.0200726e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070141502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2020.04.2132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancis, Sarah10aP165 Physical Activity: What Do Older Adults Need and Want?  ap.

IA participants (n = 51) were recruited at congregate meal sites while DC participants (n = 66) were recruited from 2 OAs volunteer programs.FG recordings were transcribed verbatim and reviewed for major themes using standard theme analysis protocols. Sociodemographic data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Kruskal-Wallis H Test assessed between group differences for sociodemographic attributes (P < .05).The mean age of participants was 74.4 ± 7.0 years. Participants were mostly educated (77.2%) females (83.1%) in “average or higher” health (84.8%). IA participants were more educated than DC participants (P < .0001). The sample was diverse (44.2% White, 38.9% Black). DC was more diverse (P < .0001). Nearly one-third were widowed (30.5%). Almost one-half (46.6%) classified their PA level as “somewhat high” to “high” with 63.6% claiming to have participated in regular exercise in the last 3 months. DC participants reported a higher exercise participation rate (P = .008). PA motivators were socialization and health benefits. PA barriers were pain, limited disposable income, health limitations, and low motivation. Preferred PA programming attributes included group-based, expert-led, and age-appropriate (eg, walking [IA], dancing [DC]).This sample of community-residing OAs are not meeting PA recommendations. The perceived PA needs and preferences were similar regardless of being rural- or urban-residing. These findings provide useful information to better enable tailoring of PA messaging and programming for community-residing OAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adescriptive statistics 3aexercise 3aincome 3amotivation 3anutrition education 3apain 3aqualitative analysis 3asurveys 3aIowa1 aHarrison, Elgloria1 aContrady, Annette1 aMontgomery, Doris1 aRudolph, Catherine1 aLord, Lillie Monroe1 aAsongwed, Elmira1 aJackson, Phronie1 aJean Baptiste, Anne Marie1 aJohnson-Largent, Tiffany1 aHarris, Michelle1 aJeffery, Tia0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2020 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.S94-S95dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2020.04.2133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01508naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245007600157300001800233520036100251592002800612650001300640650002700653650002300680650001000703650001600713650001600729650001100745700002000756700001800776700001700794700002100811700002200832700001900854700003300873773013400906856007301040852000901113655001201122IND60658596720221120090630.0190826e20100421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065859672DNAL7 a10.1039/b926031e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamuel, Jorice10aLanthanide-chelate silica nanospheres as robust multicolor Vis-NIR tags  ap. 2647-2649.  aDifferent lanthanide chelates have been simultaneously embedded in a silica matrix yielding bright dual-mode lanthanide doped nanospheres which are uniform in size distribution, tunable, photostable, and leakage free.

Along with being responsible for significant morbidity in human populations, Chlamydia is also responsible for wide spread infection and disease in many animal hosts, with reports that many Australian koala subpopulations are endemically infected. An understanding of the role played by IFNγ in koala chlamydial diseases is important for the establishment of better prophylactic and therapeutic approaches against chlamydial infection in this host. A limited number of IFNγ sequences have been published from marsupials and no immune reagents to measure expression have been developed. Through preliminary analysis of the koala transcriptome, we have identified the full coding sequence of the koala IFNγ gene. Transcripts were identified in spleen and lymph node tissue samples. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that koala IFNγ is closely related to other marsupial IFNγ sequences and more distantly related to eutherian mammals. To begin to characterise the role of this important cytokine in the koala's response to chlamydial infection, we developed a quantitative real time PCR assay and applied it to a small cohort of koalas with and without active chlamydial disease, revealing significant differences in expression patterns between the groups. Description of the IFNγ sequence from the koala will not only assist in understanding this species' response to its most important pathogen but will also provide further insight into the evolution of the marsupial immune system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydia 3aPhascolarctos cinereus 3acytokines 3agenes 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3alymph nodes 3amorbidity 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aspleen 3atranscriptome 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChlamydia Infectionsxmetabolism 2aDNA Primers 2aInterferon-gammaxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhascolarctidae 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aCD 0acDNA 0aGAPDH 0aIFNγ 0aIL 0aMHC 0aMOMP 0aNK 0aPBMC 0aqrtPCR 0aTh 0aCt 0aTNFα 0aUV 0aUTR 0aKoala 0aInterferon gamma 0aImmune system 0aEvolution 0aChlamydia1 aPavasovic, Ana1 aPrentis, Peter J.1 aBeagley, Kenneth W.1 aTimms, Peter1 aPolkinghorne, Adam0 tGene.g2013 Sept. 25, v. 527 p.570-577dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001700188245009800205300001600303506007600319520139200395592002801787506003701815650002501852650002601877650001801903650001201921650003101933650001601964650002401980650002102004650002402025650002202049650003002071650003002101650005102131650002002182650001702202650002302219650002002242650002402262650001802286700002102304700001502325700001202340700001302352700001502365700001202380700002002392700001902412773010002431856004802531852000902579655001202588IND50059389520221207143208.0121017e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005938952DNAL7 a230114012pmid7 aPMC34720682pmcid7 a10.1007/s11103-012-9965-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Shu-Yuan10aRoles of the different components of magnesium chelatase in abscisic acid signal transduction  ap. 519-537.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe H subunit of Mg-chelatase (CHLH) was shown to regulate abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and the I subunit (CHLI) was also reported to modulate ABA signaling in guard cells. However, it remains essentially unknown whether and how the Mg-chelatase-catalyzed Mg-protoporphyrin IX-production differs from ABA signaling. Using a newly-developed surface plasmon resonance system, we showed that ABA binds to CHLH, but not to the other Mg-chelatase components/subunits CHLI, CHLD (D subunit) and GUN4. A new rtl1 mutant allele of the CHLH gene in Arabidopsis thaliana showed ABA-insensitive phenotypes in both stomatal movement and seed germination. Upregulation of CHLI1 resulted in ABA hypersensitivity in seed germination, while downregulation of CHLI conferred ABA insensitivity in stomatal response in Arabidopsis. We showed that CHLH and CHLI, but not CHLD, regulate stomatal sensitivity to ABA in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana). The overexpression lines of the CHLD gene showed wild-type ABA sensitivity in Arabidopsis. Both the GUN4-RNA interference and overexpression lines of Arabidopsis showed wild-type phenotypes in the major ABA responses. These findings provide clear evidence that the Mg-chelatase-catalyzed Mg-ProtoIX production is distinct from ABA signaling, giving information to understand the mechanism by which the two cellular processes differs at the molecular level.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aabscisic acid 3aalleles 3agene expression regulation 3aguard cells 3amagnesium chelatase 3aseed germination 3asignal transduction 3astomatal movement 3asurface plasmon resonance 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDown-Regulation 2aGenes, Plant 2aLyasesxmetabolism 2aProtein Binding 2aSignal Transduction 2aUp-Regulation1 aZhang, Xiao-Feng1 aLu, Zekuan1 aXin, Qi1 aWu, Zhen1 aJiang, Tao1 aLu, Yan1 aWang, Xiao-Fang1 aZhang, Da-Peng0 tPlant molecular biology.g2012 Nov., v. 80, no. 4-5 p.519-537dSpringer-Verlagx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-012-9965-3  aDNAL 7aarticle04018naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010500167520218400272592002802456650001302484650001702497650002502514650000902539650002502548650002602573650001602599650001202615650001502627650002602642650001302668650002002681650003002701650002102731650002302752650001902775650003202794650002502826650001802851650001702869653002502886653002902911653001002940653003102950653002802981700001603009700001903025700001403044700001803058700001603076700002603092700001803118700001803136700001903154700001903173773010703192856008403299852000903383655001203392IND60683542520221119201453.0200320e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068354252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2020.1046022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shengping10aIs least limiting water range a useful indicator of the impact of tillage management on maize yield?  aTillage management is a key factor driving changes in soil physical properties (SPP) and crop yield around the world. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the relationships between SPP and crop yield. The dynamic of SPP during the growth period is also seldom taken into account to understand suitable soil physical environment for crop growth. Moreover, the crop growth process cannot be explained by an individual SPP substantially. The least limiting water range (LLWR), which integrates soil penetration resistance, air porosity, and soil water potential, may provide a better understanding of soil-crop relationship, especially in regions with limited precipitation. Our objective was to explain how dynamic SPP affected grain yield during the growth period. A long-term field experiment was established in 2003, with continuous spring maize, on sandy loam soil. Seasonal changes of SPP (i.e. bulk density, penetration resistance, porosity, mean weight diameter, LLWR, and plant available water) were determined under reduced tillage with residue incorporated (RT-RI), conventional tillage with residue removal (CT), and no-tillage with residue mulch (NT-RM). The results showed that these SPP were affected by both tillage management and growth stage. Bulk density, porosity, S index, and mean weight diameter were not effective indicators to explain the changes of grain yield under the three tillage managements. The range of LLWR was narrower than plant available water (PAW) during the growth period and more sensitive to assess soil water availability under RT-RI, CT, and NT-RM. NT-RM significantly increased the lower limit of LLWR, which made it more difficult for root water uptake. Hence, RT-RI presented higher corn yield compared to NT-RM, even if the water content remained lower. Redundancy analysis further indicated that maize yield was mainly driven by lower limit of LLWR and penetration resistance. Overall, LLWR was an aggregative indicator including not only soil penetration resistance but also air porosity and soil water potential, which can better explain the change of grain yield under the long-term tillage management in semi-arid region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3abulk density 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3adevelopmental stages 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3amulches 3ano-tillage 3aplant available water 3aporosity 3areduced tillage 3aresistance to penetration 3asandy loam soils 3aseasonal variation 3asemiarid zones 3asoil penetration resistance 3asoil water potential 3awater content 3awater uptake 0aConservation tillage 0aSoil physical properties 0aYield 0aLeast limiting water range 0aSoil water availability1 aWu, Xueping1 aLiang, Guopeng1 aGao, Lili1 aWang, Bisheng1 aLu, Jinjing1 aAbdelrhman, Ahmed Ali1 aSong, Xiaojun1 aZhang, Mengni1 aZheng, Fengjun1 aDegré, Aurore0 tSoil & tillage research.g2020 May, v. 199 p.104602-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.1046023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245005900170520134600229592002801575650001301603650001701616650002001633650002401653650001101677650001501688650001501703650002801718650001001746650002501756651001201781653001601793653001601809653001001825700001901835700001701854700003101871700002001902773011601922856008502038852000902123655001202132IND60670402820221122063712.0200103e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067040282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2019.1013062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSulyok, Mihály10aPredicting tick-borne encephalitis using Google Trends  aData generated through public Internet searching offers a promising alternative source of information for monitoring and forecasting of infectious disease. Here future cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) were predicted using traditional weekly case reports, both with and without Google Trends data (GTD). Data on the weekly number of acute, confirmed TBE cases in Germany were obtained from the Robert Koch Institute. Data relating to the volume of Internet searching on TBE was downloaded from the Google Trends website. Data were split into training and validation parts. A SARIMA (0,1,1) (1,1,1) [52] model was used to describe the weekly TBE case number time series. Google Trends Data was used as an external regressor in a second, as optimal identified SARIMA (4,1,1) (1,1,1) [52] model. Predictions for the number of future cases were made with both models and compared with the validation dataset.

The kurgan was built by representatives of the early (Repino) stage of the Yamnaya culture (about 5500 years ago) and included four successively made structures. According to archaeological data, the kurgan was built during decades, and 300-year-long interval was determined by radiocarbon dating. During that period, the morphological and physicochemical properties of buried soils changed: the lower boundary of the humus horizon became more tonguing; the degree of zooturbation of the profiles by burrowing animals increased; the organic carbon content dropped; and the contents of carbonate carbon, gypsum, and exchangeable sodium in the composition of exchangeable bases and magnetic susceptibility increased. The trend of changes in morphological properties, in the content of organic carbon and carbonates, and in magnetic susceptibility in the materials from the early to late kurgan structures correlated with that for the soils buried under them. Our study enables us to suggest that the climate during the analyzed period (the early stage of the Yamnaya culture) was more arid than the modern climate. The technological approaches used by the ancient builders for kurgan construction were revealed on the basis of data on the micromorphology and physicochemical properties of the materials of kurgan structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussia 3aarchaeology 3acarbon radioisotopes 3acarbonates 3achronosequences 3aclimate 3aexchangeable sodium 3agypsum 3ahumus horizons 3amagnetic susceptibility 3amicrostructure 3aorganic carbon 3apaleoclimatology1 aKhokhlova, O.

The supply and recirculation of hydrogen determines the output performance of PEMFC that is required to be well regulated. The hydrogen excess ratio (HER) is asked to locate at appropriate operating points and the pressure difference between anode and cathode should be limited within a reasonable range. In this paper, a pseudo-reference-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model predictive control (MPC) integrated with the feedback linearization is proposed for the HER regulation and the pressure balance of electrodes. The nonlinear hydrogen delivery system model is developed which consists of two actuators: flow control valve and hydrogen circulating pump. To address the high nonlinearity of the hydrogen delivery system, the feedback linearization is formulated. The MIMO MPC is then developed based on the feedback linearized model with the defined pseudo-reference which can effectively reduce the overshoot of HER. Comparing with the normal MPC based on one working-point first-order Taylor expansion, the more accurate hydrogen regulation performance of the proposed MPC can be achieved. The proposed MPC can effectively reduce the HER overshoot by 59.25% at the initial response phase with nearly same convergence time. Under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) simulation condition, the average overshoot reduction of anode pressure and HER can reach to 47.45% and 77.34% that demonstrates a well application prospect of the proposed MPC in the automotive PEMFC hydrogen regulation. A hardware in loop (HIL) experiment was finally conducted to show the real-time capacity of the proposed MPC method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3apollution 0aProton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) 0aHydrogen excess ratio (HER) 0aBalance of the pressure difference 0aFeedback linearization 0aModel predictive control (MPC) 0aPseudo-reference1 aWang, Ya-Xiong1 aXiao, Xuelian1 aHe, Hongwen1 aSun, Fengchun0 tApplied energy.g2021 July 01, v. 293 p.116919-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1169193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008500164300001600249520110600265592002801371650003001399650001601429650002701445650003201472650002401504650002201528650001901550650001101569650001601580650001101596650001501607650001201622651001601634700002501650700002001675700001801695700002001713700002101733700002001754773010701774856008101881852000901962655001201971IND60083225820221118162252.0141101e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008322582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2012.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoe, Se Eun10aPrevalence and distribution of six bee viruses in Korean Apis cerana populations  ap. 330-333.  aThe prevalence and distribution of six bee viruses was investigated in 527 Apis cerana samples which were collected from five provinces in South Korea.

The most prevalent virus in 81 larvae samples was SBV, with an incidence of 60.49%, followed by BQCV in 48.14%, DWV in 6.17%, and KBV in 1.23% of samples. CBPV infection was not detected in larvae samples, and acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) was not present in both larvae and adult bee. Simultaneous infections with up to four viruses were also identified. Of these, infections with SBV and BQCV were most frequent in 25.61% of samples. The distribution of these viruses varied considerably throughout the geographic regions investigated. The three provinces of Gyeongbuk, Jeonnam, and Chungbuk had the highest frequency of bee viruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcute bee paralysis virus 3aApis cerana 3aBlack queen cell virus 3aChronic bee paralysis virus 3aDeformed wing virus 3aKashmir bee virus 3aSacbrood virus 3aadults 3abee viruses 3alarvae 3apopulation 3aviruses 3aSouth Korea1 aNguyen, Lien Thi Kim1 aNoh, Jin Hyeong1 aKoh, Hong Bum1 aJean, Young Hwa1 aKweon, Chang Hee1 aKang, Seung Won0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2012 Mar., v. 109, no. 3 p.330-333dElsevier Inc.x0022-20117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2012.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245007100173300001600244520127400260592002801534650001201562650002001574650001501594650001501609650001701624650001601641650003101657650001401688650001501702650001801717650001601735653003101751653002001782653001801802653002601820653002801846700001801874700001401892773007701906856008901983852000902072655001202081IND60531514420221119174605.0160723e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053151442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avom Eyser, C.10aFate and behaviour of diclofenac during hydrothermal carbonization  ap. 280-286.  aHydrothermal carbonization (HTC) has become an esteemed method to convert sewage sludge into biochar. Besides dewatering and disinfection the process is suggested to reduce the micropollutant load, which would be beneficial for the use of biochar as fertilizer. This study was designed to examine reduction of micropollutants and formation of transformation products during HTC using the example of diclofenac. We investigated compounds' removal at HTC conditions in inert experiments and in real samples. Results showed that HTC temperature (>190 °C) and pressure (∼15 bar) have the potential to fully degrade diclofenac in inert experiments and spiked sewage sludge (>99%) within 1 h. However, interfering effects hinder full removal in native samples resulting in 44% remaining diclofenac. Additionally, a combination of suspected-target and non-target analysis using LC-MS/MS and LC-HRMS resulted in the determination of six transformation products. These products have been reported in biochar from HTC for the first time, although other studies described them for other processes like advanced oxidation. Based on the detected transformation products, we proposed a degradation mechanism reflecting HTC reactions such as dehydroxylation and decarboxylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3adecarboxylation 3adewatering 3adiclofenac 3adisinfection 3afertilizers 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3asewage sludge 3atemperature 0aHydrothermal carbonization 0aPharmaceuticals 0aSewage sludge 0aDegradation mechanism 0aTransformation products1 aSchmidt, T.C.1 aTuerk, J.0 tChemosphere.g2016 June, v. 153 p.280-286dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.03.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011400171300001600285520144000301592002801741650002101769650002501790650001101815650002701826650002801853650001001881650002001891650001001911650001201921650001101933650001401944700001401958700001701972700001801989700001702007700001502024773010702039856008702146852000902233655001202242IND60087693320221118065142.0141102e20130710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008769332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2013.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shaowen10aRNA interference with carbon catabolite repression in Trichoderma koningii for enhancing cellulase production  ap. 104-109.  aThe cellulase and xylanase genes of filamentous Trichoderma fungi exist under carbon catabolite repression mediated by the regulator carbon catabolite repressor (CREI). Our objective was to find the role of CREI in a cellulase-hyperproducing mutant of Trichoderma koningii, and address whether enzyme production can be further improved by silencing the cre1 gene. cre1 partially silenced strains were constructed to improve enzyme production in T. koningii YC01, a cellulase-hyperproducing mutant. Silencing of cre1 resulted in derepression of cellulase gene expression in glucose-based cultivation. The cre1 interference strain C313 produced 2.1-, 1.4-, 0.8-, and 0.8-fold higher amounts of filter paper activity, β-1,4-exoglucanase activity (ρ-nitrophenyl-β-d-cellobioside as substrate), β-1,4-endoglucanase activity (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as substrate), and xylanase activity, respectively, than the control strain, suggesting that silencing of cre1 resulted in enhanced enzyme production capability. In addition, downregulation of cre1 resulted in elevated expression of another regulator of xylanase and cellulase expression, xyr1, indicating that CREI also acted as a repressor of xyr1 transcription in T. koningii under inducing conditions. These results show that RNAi is a feasible method for analyzing the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression and improving xylanase and cellulase productivity in T. koningii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aTrichoderma koningii 3acarbon 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afungi 3agene expression 3agenes 3amutants 3asodium 3axylanases1 aLiu, Gang1 aYu, Jianteng1 aTian, Shengli1 aHuang, Baiqu1 aXing, Miao0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2013 July 10, v. 53, no. 2 p.104-109dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2013.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03380naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013900165300001200304520143300316592002801749596005901777596010001836596010401936596002702040596006402067650001802131650001902149650002102168650002102189650001602210650001702226650001202243650003402255650001702289650002102306650001702327650001502344650001302359650001602372650001802388651001002406700005102416700001502467700001202482700001302494700001702507700001202524700001202536700001702548700001602565773012902581856008302710852000902793655001202802IND60781758620221121232557.0220929e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078175862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-022-03084-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Chenbin10aComparative analysis of the structure and function of rhizosphere microbiome of the Chinese medicinal herb Alisma in different regions  ap. 448.  aRhizoma Alismatis, a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine, is the dried tuber of Alisma orientale and Alisma A. plantago-aquatica, mainly cultivated in Fujian and Sichuan provinces (China), respectively. Studies have shown that the rhizosphere microbiome is a key factor determining quality of Chinese medicinal plants. Here we applied metagenomics to investigate the rhizosphere microbiome of Alisma in Fujian and Sichuan, focusing on its structure and function and those genes involved in protostane triterpenes biosynthesis. The dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes. Compared with Fujian, the rhizosphere of Sichuan has a greater α diversity and stronger microbial interactions but significantly lower relative abundance of archaea. Microbes with disease-suppressing functions were more abundant in Sichuan than Fujian, but vice versa for those with IAA-producing functions. Gemmatimonas, Anaeromyxobacter, and Pseudolabrys were the main contributors to the potential functional difference in two regions. Genes related to protostane triterpenes biosynthesis were enriched in Fujian. Steroidobacter, Pseudolabrys, Nevskia, and Nitrospira may contribute to the accumulation of protostane triterpenes in Alisma. This work fills a knowledge gap of Alisma’s rhizosphere microbiome, providing a valuable reference for studying its beneficial microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data  a82073958cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81673534cInnovative Research Group Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China  aZDXM-3-24cJiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization  a2019cQing Lan Project  aSYSD2020248cSuzhou Science and Technology Development Plan 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aAlisma orientale 3aAnaeromyxobacter 3aChloroflexi 3aGemmatimonas 3aNevskia 3aOriental traditional medicine 3abiosynthesis 3amedicinal plants 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiome 3arhizomes 3arhizosphere 3atriterpenoids 3aChina1 aGu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4100-05281 aTian, Rong1 aXu, Fei1 aHan, Yun1 aJi, Yuanyuan1 aLi, Tao1 aZhu, Yu1 aLang, Peilei1 aWu, Wenqing0 tArchives of microbiology.g2022 July, v. 204, no. 7 p.448-448dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-022-03084-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04274naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245015100164300001400315520253300329592002802862650002402890650001102914650001802925650001602943650002102959650002002980650002003000650002303020650001503043650002003058650001103078650001303089650001103102650002403113650001303137650001903150650001803169650001003187651001103197651001203208653001303220653003303233653001803266653002003284653001803304653001403322700001603336700001503352700001503367700001603382700002003398700001703418700001803435773011403453856008403567852000903651655001203660IND60567215620221122235919.0190403e20170701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056721562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2017.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyyoub, A.12aA simple and alternative approach based on reference evapotranspiration and leaf area index for estimating tree transpiration in semi-arid regions  ap. 61-68.  aThe present work aims to develop a simple approach relating normalized daily sap flow (liters per unit of leaf area) and daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) (mm/day). Two methods (FAO-Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM) and Hargreaves-Samani (HARG)) of the calculation of ET0 were tested in order to examine their impact on the established relationships. The data sets used for developing this approach are taken over well irrigated orchards from three experimental sites (olive trees, cv. “Olea europaea L.”, olive trees, cv. “Arbequino” and citrus trees cv. “Clementine Afourar”) conducted in the Tensift region around Marrakech (center of Morocco) and one experimental site (pecan orchard, cv. “Carya illinoinensis, Wangenh. K. Koch”) conducted in the Yaqui Valley, northwest of Mexico).The results showed that the normalized daily sap flow was linearly correlated with ET0 (mm per day) calculated by FAO-PM method. The coefficient of determination (R2) and the slope of this linear regression varied between 0.71 and 0.97 and between 0.30 and 0.35, respectively, depending on the type of orchards. For HARG method, the relationship between both terms is also linear but with more discrepancy (R2=0.7). This was somehow expected since this method is known to underestimate ET0 values in the semi-arid areas. Afterward, the validation of the developed linear relationship was performed over an olive orchard (“Olea europaea L.”) where the measurements of sap flow were available for another cropping season (2004). The scatter plot between the normalized measured and estimated sap flow based on FAO-PM method reveals a very good agreement (slope=1, and RMSE=0.14L/m2 leaf area). However, for the estimation of normalized sap flow based on HARG method, the correlation is relatively more scattered (slope=0.95, and RMSE=0.35L/m2 leaf area). A further validation was performed using the measurements of evapotranspiration (ET) by eddy correlation system and the results showed that the correlation between normalized measured ET and estimated normalized sap flow is best when using FAO-PM method (RMSE=0.33L/m2 leaf area) for estimating ET0 than when using HARG method (RMSE=0.51L/m2 leaf area).Finally, the performance of the developed approach was compared to the traditional dual crop coefficient scheme for estimating plant transpiration. Cross-comparison of these two approaches with the measurements data gave satisfactory results with an average value of RMSE equal to about 0.37mm/day for both approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarya illinoinensis 3aCitrus 3aOlea europaea 3aclementines 3acrop coefficient 3adata collection 3aeddy covariance 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation 3aleaf area index 3aolives 3aorchards 3apecans 3aregression analysis 3asap flow 3asemiarid zones 3atranspiration 3atrees 3aMexico 3aMorocco 0aSap flow 0aReference evapotranspiration 0aTranspiration 0aLeaf area index 0aTree orchards 0aSemi-arid1 aEr-Raki, S.1 aKhabba, S.1 aMerlin, O.1 aEzzahar, J.1 aRodriguez, J.C.1 aBahlaoui, A.1 aChehbouni, A.0 tAgricultural water management.g2017 July 01, v. 188 p.61-68dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2017.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01768naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245006100159300001800220520073000238592002800968650002400996650002101020650002701041650002301068650002601091650004401117650001801161700002601179700002201205773013401227856007201361852000901433655001201442IND60658597320221120115658.0190817e20100323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065859732DNAL7 a10.1039/b926072b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Shengxiong13aAn extended cavitand with an introverted carboxylic acid  ap. 2459-2461.  aThe condensation of a Kemp's triacid derivative with a diamino resorcinarene yielded a cavitand with the deepest cavity prepared to date featuring an inwardly-directed carboxylic acid.

This study determined the effect of three hydraulic retention times (1, 2, and 4 days) on changes in system efficiency, reactive mixture, and microbial activity in bioreactors under upward flow conditions. Bioreactors were sacrificed in the weeks 8, 17 and 36, and the reactive mixture was sampled at the bottom, middle, and top layers. Physicochemical analyses were performed on reactive mixture post-treatment and correlated with sulfate-reducing bacteria and cellulolytic and dehydrogenase activity. All hydraulic retention times were efficient at increasing pH and alkalinity and removing sulfate (>60%) and metals (85–99% for Fe2+ and 70–100% for Zn2+), except for Mn2+. The longest hydraulic retention time (4 days) increased residual sulfides, deteriorated the quality of treated effluent and negatively impacted sulfate-reducing bacteria. Shortest hydraulic retention time (1 day) washed out biomass and increased input of dissolved oxygen in the reactors, leading to higher redox potential and decreasing metal removal efficiency. Concentrations of iron, zinc and metal sulfides were high in the bottom layer, especially with 2 day of hydraulic retention time. Sulfate-reducing bacteria, cellulolytic and dehydrogenase activity were higher in the middle layer at 4 days of hydraulic retention time. Hydraulic retention time had a strong influence on overall performance of passive reactors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3aalkalinity 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3adissolved oxygen 3aenzyme activity 3airon 3amanganese 3amicrobial activity 3apH 3aredox potential 3aremediation 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfates 3asulfides 3azinc 0aAcid mine drainage (AMD) 0aSulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) 0aMetal removal 0aEfficiency 0aHydraulic retention time (HRT) 0aBiochemical passive reactor (BPR)1 aEscobar, Maria C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6794-559X1 aNeculita, Carmen M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8388-79161 aArbeli, Ziv1 aRoldan, Fabio0 tChemosphere.g2016 June, v. 153 p.244-253dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.03.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01706naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245017700175300001600352520056900368592002800937650001200965650001100977650001100988650001100999650001601010650001601026651001901042651001101061700002001072700002601092700002601118773012101144856008201265852000901347655001201356IND60780187820221117042643.0220616e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078018782DNAL7 a10.1134/S003294522203002X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDel Moral-Flores, L.

Unfortunately, this approach is impractical in the many systems that have insufficient data to parameterize ecosystem interactions or reliably calibrate or validate such models. We devised a different approach composed of a minimum realistic model that guides decisions in data‐ and resource‐scarce systems. We applied our approach to a case study in an invaded ecosystem from Christmas Island, Australia, where there are concerns that cat (Felis catus) eradication to protect native species, including the red‐tailed tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda), could release mesopredation by invasive rats (Rattus rattus). We used biophysical constraints (metabolic demand) and observable parameters (e.g., prey preferences) to identify the combined cat and rat abundances that could threaten the tropicbird population. The population of tropicbirds was not sustained when predated by 1607 rats (95% credible interval [CI]: 103–5910) in the absence of cats and 21 cats (95% CI: 2–82) in the absence of rats. For every cat removed from the island, the bird's net population growth rate improved, provided rats did not increase by more than 77 individuals (95% CI: 30–174). Thus, in this context, 1 cat is equivalent to 30–174 rats. Our methods are especially useful for on‐the‐ground predator control in the absence of knowledge of predator–predator interactions to determine whether current abundance of predators threatened the prey population of interest; managing only 1 predator species was sufficient to protect the prey species given potential release of another predator; and control of multiple predator species was needed to meet the conservation goal. With our approach limited information can be used for maximum value in data‐poor systems because it shifts the focus from predicting future trajectories to identifying conditions that impede conservation.  aPublisher supplied data  cAustralian Research Council Centre of Excellence Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers  aLP160100496cAustralian Research Council  aDE190101416cCentre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions, Australian Research Council 3aPhaethon 3aRattus rattus 3abirds 3acase studies 3acats 3aecosystems 3aindigenous species 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3apredation 3apredator control 3aprey species 3arats 3athreatened species 3aAustralia1 aO'Brien, Katherine R.1 aHolden, Matthew H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5135-94331 aAdams, Matthew P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4875-02251 aBaker, Christopher M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9449-36321 aBean, Nigel G.1 aSisson, S.

Results demonstrated that exposure time to subcritical CO₂ treatment had a negative effect on PCL transesterification activity whereas exposure time to supercritical CO₂ treatment had a positive effect. But generally, most compressed treatments significantly enhanced PCL esterification activity. Conformational analysis by FT-IR and fluorescence emission spectra revealed that enhanced activities after supercritical CO₂ treatment were correlated with the secondary and tertiary structural changes of PCL. Secondary structure changes also appeared to be responsible for enhancement of PCL activities by subcritical CO₂ treatment. Compared to native PCL, treated PCL's esterification activity significantly decreased in hydrophilic organic media, while transesterification activity significantly increased in tert-amyl alcohol and acetone. After supercritical treatment, the thermal stability of PCL significantly decreased in esterification reactions, however, there was no significant difference in transesterification reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia cepacia 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetone 3aadverse effects 3aalcohols 3acarbon dioxide 3aesterification 3aexposure duration 3afluorescence 3ahydrophilicity 3amolecular conformation 3athermal stability 3atransesterification1 aZhang, Houjin1 aXu, Jing1 aYan, Yunjun0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2013 July 10, v. 53, no. 2 p.110-117dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2013.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245013600170300001200306520167400318592002801992650002402020650002602044650001702070650001802087650002202105650002602127650001902153650002902172650001302201650001402214650000902228650003702237650001802274650001402292651001002306653001502316653001802331653002902349653002702378700001902405700001502424700001602439700001602455700001802471700001502489700001802504700002002522773012702542856009002669852000902759655001202768IND60633015320221118183238.0190617e20180902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063301532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuang, Dai10aEmerging high-level ciprofloxacin resistance and molecular basis of resistance in Salmonella enterica from humans, food and animals  ap. 1-9.  aDisease caused by nontyphoidal serotypes of Salmonella enterica is the leading cause of foodborne illness worldwide. Many serotypes have also developed resistance to antimicrobials commonly used for the treatment of salmonellosis. Here we analyze 179 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates identified among 3680 Salmonella isolated from humans, food, animals, and water collected in Shanghai, China. They were assessed for antimicrobial susceptibility, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants, and mutations in quinolone resistance determination regions (QRDRs); genetic relatedness was examined using PFGE. Ciprofloxacin resistance in Salmonella increased from 2.3% in 2006 to 5.9% in 2012. Multidrug resistance was common, and most carried mutations in QRDR (97.2%) and PMQR determinants (71.5%). Mutations frequently included changes in gyrA: Ser83Phe (53.6%) and Asp87Asn (35.8%), and in parC: Thr57Ser (53.1%) and Ser80Arg (44.1%). Mutations in parC and parE without changes in gyrA were identified in S. Derby and most S. Thompson. Among PMQR determinants, aac(6′)-Ib-cr (62.0%) and oqxA/oqxB (33.5%/33.0%) were most common, and conferred resistance without target mutations in five S. Typhimurium isolates. PFGE analysis revealed that S. Typhimurium, isolated from pork and aquatic products, and S. Indiana, isolated from chicken, were highly similar to isolates from humans, suggesting these products be the major source of ciprofloxacin-resistant infections. Our findings highlight the important role QRDRs and PMQR play in ciprofloxacin resistance of Salmonella, and reveal the potential sources of the pathogen associated with human infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella enterica 3aantibiotic resistance 3achicken meat 3aciprofloxacin 3afoodborne illness 3agenetic relationships 3ahuman diseases 3amultiple drug resistance 3amutation 3apathogens 3apork 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3asalmonellosis 3aserotypes 3aChina 0aSalmonella 0aCiprofloxacin 0aAntimicrobial resistance 0aMolecular epidemiology1 aZhang, Jianmin1 aXu, Xuebin1 aShi, Weimin1 aChen, Sheng1 aYang, Xiaowei1 aSu, Xudong1 aShi, Xianming1 aMeng, Jianghong0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2018 Sept. 02, v. 280 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01695naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245011700161300001400278506002800292520067000320592002800990506003701018650001601055650001901071650001501090650001801105700001901123700002101142773013201163856007701295852000901372655001201381IND60785435920221207073909.0120524e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078543592DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha40172122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGITIN, Liliana14aThe Influence of Extraction Method on the Apparent Content of Bioactive Compounds in Romanian Allium spp. Leaves  ap. 93-97.  aResource is Open Access  aIn order to characterize the composition of bioactive compounds in Allium spp., an important source of traditional foods, analysesof their physicochemical properties, total phenols, and flavonoid content were carried out using three of the most popular Romanian leafvarieties (Allium cepa var. ‘Diamant’, ‘Rubiniu’, and Allium ursinum L.).

Of all methodologies applied, metagenetics is the most used one to analyse sourdoughs, allowing to elucidate their microbial structure, albeit that it is based on the sequencing of a very small part of whole-community DNA. Although shotgun metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and meta-metabolomics are very promising to analyse sourdough fermentations and the terminology is often used in a confusing way, they have not been fully used sensu stricto yet. For instance, up to now, metatranscriptomics is restricted to the use of a functional gene microarray for lactic acid bacteria. Further, meta-metabolomics often deals with metabolite target analysis of sourdough fermentation samples to determine the actual concentrations of residual substrates and metabolites produced as well as to list their volatilome solely. In contrast, genomics has been applied several times, albeit that the whole-genome sequence of only one yeast strain and of 41 lactic acid bacterial strains, originally isolated from sourdoughs, is available. However, the genomics data accessible in public databases should be considered with caution because of inaccurate gene annotations, due to automated annotation pipelines, thereby possibly overruling original, high-quality, well-curated gene annotations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aautomation 3adatabases 3afermentation 3agenes 3alactic acid bacteria 3ametabolites 3ametagenomics 3amicroarray technology 3asourdough 3aterminology 3atranscriptomics 3ayeasts 0aSourdough 0aLactic acid bacteria 0aYeasts 0aOmics1 aVan Kerrebroeck, Simon1 aVuyst, Luc de,0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2019 Aug. 02, v. 302 p.90-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.05.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245009500179300001600274506002800290520138400318592002801702506003701730650002201767650001701789650002201806650002401828650002001852650001001872650001301882650001501895650002001910650001901930650001501949650001901964650001301983653001401996653001502010653001102025653001602036700002002052700001902072773010502091856009002196852000902286655001202295IND60785436720221207074103.0201207e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078543672DNAL7 a10.21776/ub.habitat.2020.031.3.152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPertiwi, Yugo Indah14aThe Strategy of Agriculture Land Management at Gunungsari Area, Kucur Village, Dau, Malang  ap. 125-135.  aResource is Open Access  aThe purpose of this study is to describe the structure of land ownership and agricultural land management strategies in the Gunungsari region and explore the socio-economic and ecological conditions that drive the selection of existing land management strategies. The case study was chosen as a research design with Gunungsari agricultural land area as the case. Data collection was carried out through in-depth interviews with key informants, semi-structured interviews with sample farmers, field observations and documents. Data were analyzed descriptively qualitatively. The results of the study illustrate that dominant individual agricultural land ownership is fragmented into different plot locations with an area of less than 0.5 hectares. Perennial crop monoculture, annual intercropping, perennial crop intercropping, and mixed gardens are available agricultural land management strategies. Perennial crops as the main crops as well as edge crops are still the dominant choice of farm families, according to the internal uniqueness of each family in their interactions with external factors. This choice has consequences for the current land cover of the Gunungsari region. The actor approach that places social practice as a result of dynamic interactions between the actor's internal conditions and the context of his social-ecological environment is seen as relevant.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3acase studies 3acollective action 3acontinuous cropping 3adata collection 3afarms 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3aland management 3aland ownership 3aperennials 3asocioeconomics 3avillages 0aownership 0amanagement 0aactors 0aenvironment1 aHidayat, Kliwon1 aYuliati, Yayuk0 tHabitat.g2020 Dec., v. 31, no. 3 p.125-135dUniversity of BrawijayawJournal:27740x2338-20077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21776/ub.habitat.2020.031.3.153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01373naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245009500162506002800257520046200285592002800747506003700775650001800812650002100830650000900851700001900860773012800879856007901007852000901086655001201095IND60785436820221207073919.0190625s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078543682DNAL7 a10.5281/zenodo.32525082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlyenko, O.O.10aDevelopment and vitality of populations of dominant wood species in dendropark Trostyanets  aResource is Open Access  aIn the article were described and revealed the results of long-term examinations of dynamics of number and age structure of populations of 14 dominant species of park dendrocenosis as well as the comparative quantitative assessment of the degree of their dynamics and the intensity and direction of dynamic processes of examined populations as well.

In the case of injury to the stands containing species of Quercus genus, the symptoms are also manifested by the reduction in height and stand basal area, crown scarring, discoloration of the leaves and an abnormal grouping on the top of the lures, followed shortly by the appearance of epicormic branch. Sustainable management of forests viewed from the perspective of the unconscious economy without maintaining the state of health and good vegetation, obtained through management at the intersection of economic requirements and what can produce biologically and physically a forest ecosystem under certain given conditions. This concept can be expressed by a series of qualitative or quantitative indicators. In the present paper analyses the increase losses, expressed from the perspective of wood biomass accumulations, were determined on the radial section for 5 years period, using the method of couples applied to stands situated in similar conditions of vegetation but with major differences in status health and vegetation. The differences between the situations considered normal and those with declining phenomena show that these losses are between 14 and 22% in the affected stands compared control stands.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aQuercus 3adecline 3adiscoloration 3aepicormics 3aforest ecosystems 3astand basal area 3awood 0aincreases 0alosses 0aoak 0asessile oak 0astands1 aBlaga, Tatiana1 aColişar, Alexandru1 aMoldovan, Cristian1 aPetrişor, Rareş1 aTăut, Ioan0 tCurrent Trends in Natural Sciences.g2018 Dec., v. 7, no. 14 p.211-217dEditura Universitatii din PitestiwJournal:27829x2284-953X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245008100181300001400262520104700276592002801323650002401351650002201375650001501397650001001412650002201422650001901444650001901463650001301482650002001495650001601515653002001531653001701551653002101568653002001589653001701609700002601626700002701652700002501679700002501704700002701729700002201756773012301778856008501901852000901986655001201995IND60633017120221118183016.0200330e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063301712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2017.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Ontiveros, J.M.10aDevelopment and implementation of a fish counter by using an embedded system  ap. 53-62.  aThe development and implementation of an instrument for the automatic counting of ornamental fish by using an embedded system, is introduced herein. The proposed instrument is tested with two marine species, the Guppies (Poecilia Reticulata) and Mollies (Poecilia Sphenops), under conditions of controlled lighting and specimens whose sizes vary from 0.5 to 2.3 cm. The counting is done by digital image processing obtaining an average accuracy up to 96.64% using different species of fishes and different sizes. The main contributions are the theoretical and experimental study to determine the aquarium background color and the algorithm of the proposed method implemented in a low cost and high performance embedded system, specifically in a Raspberry Pi 2 executing the free GNU Octave Scientific Programming Language, thus, allowing the counting instrument to be reliable, portable and easily migratory to different operating systems. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive with state-of-the-art ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoecilia reticulata 3aPoecilia sphenops 3aalgorithms 3acolor 3acomputer software 3adigital images 3aimage analysis 3alighting 3aornamental fish 3araspberries 0aEmbedded system 0aFish counter 0aImage processing 0aOrnamental fish 0aRaspberry Pi1 aInzunza-González, E.1 aGarcía-Guerrero, E.E.1 aLópez-Bonilla, O.R.1 aInfante-Prieto, S.O.1 aCárdenas-Valdez, J.R.1 aTlelo-Cuautle, E.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 Feb., v. 145 p.53-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2017.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245013800167300001600305506002800321520134700349592002801696506003701724650002701761650001801788650002801806650002401834650001001858650001601868650001401884650000901898650001701907650001401924650001701938650001001955700003001965773013501995856007702130852000902207655001202216IND60785437820221207084839.0100625e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078543782DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha38136762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDADA, Oyeyemi Adigun10aPeriod of Weed Control in Okra [Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench] as Influenced by Varying Rates of Cattle Dung and Weeding Regimes  ap. 149-154.  aResource is Open Access  aField trials were conducted during 2005 and 2006 planting seasons to investigate the influence of cattle dung and the critical period of weed interference on growth and yield components of okra [Abelmoschus esculentus (L). Moench]. The study was a factorial trial laid out in a split plot design and replicated three times. The main plot comprised of four levels of cattle dung and the sub plots were three regimes of weeding. The growth attributes viz; plant height, number of leaves, leaf area and dry matter production differed significantly due to different treatments. These attributes increased significantly owing to application of cattle dung which leads to continuous availability of nutrients to the plants as well as appropriate timing of weeding which reduced the influence of weed interference on the okra. Yield and yield components were influenced significantly by application of cattle dung and weeding regimes. Highest fresh fruit yield (102.93 t ha-1) was observed in plots that received 8 t ha-1cattle dung and weeded at 3 and 6 weeks after sowing. Application of 8 t ha-1 of cattle dung as well as weeding at 3 and 6 weeks after sowing significantly enhanced okra growth and fruit yield. However, plots with sub-optimal cattle dung rate and infested with weeds till harvest produced least dry matter and fresh fruit yield.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3acattle manure 3adry matter accumulation 3aexperimental design 3afeces 3afruit yield 3aleaf area 3aokra 3aplant height 3araw fruit 3aweed control 3aweeds1 aFAYINMINNU, Ojo Olajumoke0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2010 June, v. 38, no. 1 p.149-154dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha38136763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011100172300001600283520121900299592002801518650001201546650002001558650001101578650001501589650002801604650001001632653001901642653002101661653002401682653001801706653002601724653002001750700006201770773012501832856008501957852000902042655001202051IND60633017420221118182655.0200330e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063301742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2017.12.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakhshipour, Adel10aEvaluation of support vector machine and artificial neural networks in weed detection using shape features  ap. 153-160.  aWeed detection is still a challenging problem for robotic weed removal. Small tolerance between the cutting tine and main crop position requires highly precise discrimination of the weed against the main crop. Close similarities between the shape features of sugar beet and common weeds make it impossible to define an exclusive feature to be able to efficiently detect all the weeds with acceptable accuracy. Therefore in this study, it was tried to integrate several shape features to establish a pattern for each variety of the plants. To enable the vision system in the detection of the weeds based on their pattern, support vector machine and artificial neural networks were employed. Four species of common weeds in sugar beet fields were studied. Shape feature sets included Fourier descriptors and moment invariant features. Results showed that the overall classification accuracy of ANN was 92.92%, where 92.50% of weeds were correctly classified. Higher accuracies were obtained when the SVM was used as the classifier with an overall accuracy of 95.00% whereas 93.33% of weeds were correctly classified. Also, 93.33% and 96.67% of sugar beet plants were correctly classified by ANN and SVM respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acutting 3aneural networks 3arobots 3asugar beet 3asupport vector machines 3aweeds 0aMachine vision 0aImage processing 0aPattern recognition 0aWeeding robot 0aPrecision agriculture 0aPlant phenotype1 aJafari, Abdolabbas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2212-98010 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 Feb., v. 145 p.153-160dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2017.12.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02024naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003300154245008500187300001400272506002800286520089400314592002801208506003701236650001601273650002301289650001301312650001101325650001401336653001001350653001101360653002101371653001501392700003201407773012501439856008901564852000901653655001201662IND60785438220221207084832.0150602e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078543822DNAL7 a10.17268/sci.agropecu.2012.01.012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobles, Julio Estuardo Amaya10aGrowth of onion (Allium cepa L.) var.

Estimation of forage intake and monitoring the feeding behavior are key activities to evaluate the health and welfare state of animals. Acoustic monitoring is a practical way of performing these tasks, however it is a difficult task because masticatory events (bite, chew and chew-bite) must be detected and classified in real-time from signals acquired in noisy environments. Acoustic-based algorithms have shown promising results, however they were limited by the effects of noises, the simplicity of classification rules, or the computational cost. In this work, a new algorithm called Chew-Bite Intelligent Algorithm (CBIA) is proposed using concepts and tools derived from pattern recognition and machine learning areas. It includes (i) a signal conditioning stage to attenuate the effects of noises and trends, (ii) a pre-processing stage to reduce the overall computational cost, (iii) an improved set of features to characterize jaw-movements, and (iv) a machine learning model to improve the discrimination capabilities of the algorithm. Three signal conditioning techniques and six machine learning models are evaluated. The overall performance is assessed on two independent data sets, using metrics like recognition rate, recall, precision and computational cost. The results demonstrate that CBIA achieves a 90% recognition rate with a marginal increment of computational cost. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, CBIA improves the recognition rate by 10%, even in difficult scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3acattle 3adata collection 3afeed intake 3agrazing 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprecision agriculture 0aDairy cows 0aPrecision livestock farming 0aAcoustic monitoring 0aSignal processing 0aMachine learning1 aVanrell, Sebastián R.1 aGalli, Julio R.1 aGiovanini, Leonardo L.1 aRufiner, H.

Capillary and adsorptive water contents had hysteretic behavior. The amount of adsorptive water was significant in all the tested soils. In analyzing the phase transition and water migration processes in multiphase porous systems, it is helpful to properly evaluate the unfrozen capillary water content and adsorptive water content, respectively. In this study, an innovative procedure was developed to determine the total, adsorptive, and capillary water contents in frozen soils based on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique. We found a threshold value of the proton spin–spin relaxation time, T₂, that separates the unfrozen pore water into two distinct regimes: the adsorptive regime for small T₂ values and the capillary regime for large T₂ values. We showed that the relationship between adsorptive (or capillary) water content and temperature is hysteretic for all three tested soils experiencing a freeze–thaw cycle. The hysteresis behavior of capillary or adsorptive water content during a freeze–thaw cycle is attributable to capillary effect, metastable nucleation, pore blocking, and variation of microstructure. In all the tested soils, the adsorptive water content was significantly larger than the capillary water content and was supported by the experimental evidence inferred from previous pore water potential measurements of various soils.  aPublisher supplied data  a51239010cNational Science Foundation of China  a41502301cNational Science Foundation of China  a41572293cNational Science Foundation of China 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3ahysteresis 3amicrostructure 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atemperature 3avadose zone 3awater content 3awater potential1 aWei, Changfu1 aLai, Yuanming1 aChen, Pan0 tVadose zone journal.g2018, v. 17, no. 1 p.1-12dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2016.12.01243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245014200165300001400307506002800321520098400349592002801333506003701361650002601398650001101424650001401435650001301449650001801462650001901480650001201499650001601511650002301527650001701550653002101567653001801588700002901606773013301635856007501768852000901843655001201852IND60785438520221207084838.0090701e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078543852DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha362742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKAMEL, Ayman Mohamed10aSecondary and Primary Plant Metabolites as Chemical Markers for Resistance of Bitter Candytuft (Iberis amara) Plant against Insect Attack  ap. 80-87.  aResource is Open Access  aA correlation between the levels of secondary and primary plant metabolites and food coefficient parameters with the population density of infested broccoli plants was studied. Cucurbitacins and glucosinolates compounds were good signs of resistance in bitter candytuft plants. On the other hand, lower values or the absence of these markers rendered broccoli susceptible to the pests under study, not during all stages of growth but whenever these values were much lower throughout growth stages. The major cucurbitacins were isolated and purified from bitter candytuft and identified by spectroscopic techniques. Glucosinolates content in bitter candytuft was also studied. The development of cabbage aphid treated with various bitter candytuft extracts as well as isolated cucurbitacins was also evaluated.

The mulching treatment only markedly increased the soil temperature in the maize seeding growth stage. Higher plant density decreased the root surface area, root volume, root length, and root diameter. Plastic mulch in combination with high plant density is a common agronomic technique in rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) production. However, the effects of combining colored film mulching and plant density on soil temperature, soil water storage, the maize roots, and yield have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. Thus, a field experiment to explore the effects of colored film mulching and plant density on soil temperature and water, maize roots, and yield was conducted on main plots with three types of mulching (non‐mulching, transparent film mulching, and black plastic film mulching), which were divided into three subplots with three plant densities (60,000, 75,000, and 90,000 plants ha⁻¹). The results were as follows: The mulching increased the soil water storage during the entire period of maize growth, and transparent film mulching increased soil water storage more than black film mulching. The mulching only markedly increased soil temperature in the maize seeding and jointing stages compared with the non‐mulching treatment, but the plant density augmented the soil temperature after the seeding stage. Compared with the non‐mulching treatment, the mulching treatments significantly increased root length, root length density, and root diameter by 17.0, 21.4, and 11.6%, respectively, during the heading stage and by 65.2, 70, and 11.6%, respectively, during the mature stage. As plant density increased, root surface area, root volume, root length, and root diameter decreased. The best combination, which attained higher yield and profit than other treatments, was the combination of a plant density of 90,000 plants ha⁻¹ and black film mulching.  aPublisher supplied data  a20180550617cNatural Science Foundation of Liaoning  a2018YFD0300301cNational Key Research and Development Project of China  a51609137cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aZea mays 3acorn 3afield experimentation 3aplant density 3aplastic film 3aplastic film mulches 3aroot growth 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water storage 3asowing 3asurface area 3avadose zone 3awater temperature1 aChen, Zhijun1 aJiang, Hao1 aZhang, Linlin0 tVadose zone journal.g2018, v. 17, no. 1 p.1-12dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2018.05.01043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245009200131300001400223506002800237520164800265592002801913506003701941650001901978650001201997650001402009650002102023650000902044650002102053650002102074650002202095650001902117650000902136651001402145653001302159653002902172700001302201700001302214773009902227852000902326655001202335IND60785440620221207092652.0120119e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078544062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWIGATI, ENDANG10aGenetic variation of Anggoli fish (Pristipomoides multidens) based on allozyme patterns  ap. 73-79.  aResource is Open Access  aThe objectives of the research were to study the genetic variation and allozyme band pattern of Pristipomoides multidens from several locations of Indonesian sea based on the pattern of allozyme. Samples of the fish were collected from three geographically different water areas of Bali, Sumbawa and Moluccas. Ten different enzymes, ADH, MDH, LDH, α-GPD, PGM, GPI, IDH, ME, EST and SP were used in this study. Polymorphic loci of genetic variation were in line with the Hardy-Weinberg’s equilibrium. The genetic variation was calculated based on the proportion of polymorphic loci, frequency of allele, amount of allele per locus, and heterozygosity. The results of this research indicate that from the 10 different enzymes, 16 loci were detected, and 3 of them were polymorphic (PGM-1, GPI-1 and EST). Population of Moluccas has 2 polymorphic loci (PGM-1 and GPI-1) by proportion of 13%, however, population from Bali and Sumbawa has only 1 polymorphic locus (EST-1) with the value of 6%. The allelic number per locus was 1.06 – 1.125, while the observed heterozygosity (D) of the populations was 0.005. The fish population of Moluccas is having better genetic variation than that of population from Bali and Sumbawa. The genetic distance between populations was between 0.002 – 0.005. The closest genetic distance is between Bali and Sumbawa (D = 0,002), while the longest genetic distance was resulted between populations of Sumbawa and Moluccas (D = 0.005). Based on the UPGMA cluster analysis for the genetic distances, indicated that there was 2 main geographic groups, (1) Moluccas, and (2) Bali and Sumbawa as single population.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPristipomoides 3aalleles 3aallozymes 3acluster analysis 3afish 3afish communities 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3aIndonesia 0aallozyme 0aPristipomoides multidens1 aSutarno,1 aHARYANTI0 tBiodiversitas.g2003 July, v. 4, no. 2 p.73-79dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245012800159300001600287500000900303520135600312592002801668650001501696650001701711650001601728650002801744650001401772650001501786650002601801650001301827650000901840650001601849650002901865650001801894700002101912773011701933856007702050852000902127655001202136IND60671907120221116160710.0191126e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067190712DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2003.18602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasbruch, K.12aA Time Domain Transmission Method for Determining the Dependence of the Dielectric Permittivity on Volumetric Water Content  ap. 186-192.  aepub  aA method for determining the dependence of the dielectric permittivity of municipal refuse on its volumetric water content is developed and tested. The method is based on time domain transmission (TDT) measurements collected with an automated network analyzer (ANA). Measurements in variably saturated sand were first made to test the method's ability to measure the apparent dielectric permittivity. The method was then extended to samples of municipal refuse to determine whether a single calibration can be used to describe the relationship between the dielectric permittivity and the volumetric water content of refuse. The results show that the relationship between the dielectric permittivity and the volumetric water content within the refuse shows significant spatial variability. The results do show, however, that a calibration based on multiple samples collected throughout the landfill can be used to measure the volumetric water content with a root mean square volumetric water content measurement error of <0.04 cm³ cm⁻³ Deviations from the common calibration are not explained by variations in bulk density or porosity among samples. It is recommended that a calibration be derived from samples collected throughout a municipal landfill before a water content monitoring method based on dielectric permittivity measurements is used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3abulk density 3acalibration 3adielectric permittivity 3alandfills 3amonitoring 3amunicipal solid waste 3aporosity 3asand 3avadose zone 3avolumetric water content 3awater content1 aFerré, T.

The extracted gum was further characterized for particle size, zeta-potential, surface morphology, thermal stability, functional groups, and polymorphism. The optimized conditions like water to raw material ratio of 44.98 ml/g, extraction time of 40 min and ultrasonic power of 60 W provided the uppermost extraction yield of 31.52% ± 0.22% that was analogous to the predicted value. The average mean diameter of OFG was measured to be 256.3 ± 18.4 nm in addition to the zeta potential of −9.85 ± 0.12 mV. SEM image of OFG powder revealed irregular, rough surfaced and amorphous structure of OFG powder. The degree of esterification was measured to be 7.8 with high thermal stability, as exposed by DSC. The FT-IR spectrum of OFG displayed a broad peak at 3405.20 cm⁻¹ announcing presence of OH group and hydrophilicity attribute. The spectrum also presented the small peak at 1605.20 cm⁻¹ (CO) owing to the presence of galacturonic acid besides galactose and rhamnose.In conclusion, ultrasound and microwave irradiation assisted extraction process under the shed of Box-Behnken design offered superior yield of OFG that may be used as a pharmaceutical excipient for designing medicated or health products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aesterification 3aexperimental design 3afruits 3agalactose 3agalacturonic acid 3ahydrophilicity 3amicrowave radiation 3amoieties 3aokra 3aparticle size 3araw materials 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal stability 3aultrasonics 3azeta potential 0aOkra 0aBox Behnken design 0aResponse surface methodology 0aExtraction 0aMicrowave 0aUltrasound 0aOptimization 0aAbelmoschus esculentus1 aAggarwal, Geeta1 aJindal, Manish1 aBaldi, Ashish1 aJain, Upendra Kumar1 aChandra, Ramesh1 aMadan, Jitender0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 Feb., v. 145 p.169-178dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2017.12.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01404naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245006800174300001400242506002800256520050400284592002800788506003700816653001700853653001500870653001900885773012500904856008801029852000901117655001201126IND60785441220221207092644.0180531e196706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078544122DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.1967.1.2.19222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudraud, Pierre,14aLes problèmes analytiques de la recherche de la chaptalisation  ap. 55-63.  aResource is Open Access  aLes vins rouges pour lesquels le rapport de l'alcool à l'extrait sec réduit est supérieur à 4,6 et les vins blancs pour lesquels ce rapport est supérieur à 6,5 sont présumés suralcoolisés.

We include a sustainable, flexible research software framework for plant‐scale model development. This is an improved model concept for fluid dynamic processes, evaporation, root water uptake. We have developed a general model concept and a flexible software framework for the description of plant‐scale soil–root interaction processes including the essential fluid mechanical processes in the vadose zone. The model was developed in the framework of non‐isothermal, multiphase, multicomponent flow and transport in porous media. The software is an extension of the open‐source porous media flow and transport simulator DuMuˣ to embedded mixed‐dimensional coupled schemes. Our coupling concept allows us to describe all processes in a strongly coupled form and adapt the complexity of the governing equations in favor of either accuracy or computational efficiency. We have developed the necessary numerical tools to solve the strongly coupled nonlinear partial differential equation systems that arise with a locally mass conservative numerical scheme even in the context of evolving root architectures. We demonstrate the model concept and its features, discussing a virtual hydraulic lift experiment including evaporation, root tracer uptake on a locally refined grid, the simultaneous simulation of root growth and root water uptake, and an irrigation scenario comparing different models for flow in unsaturated soil. We have analyzed the impact of evaporation from soil on the soil water distribution around a single plant's root system. Moreover, we have shown that locally refined grids around the root system increase computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that the assumptions behind the Richards equation may be violated under certain conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aEXC 310/1cCluster of Excellence in Simulation Technology 3acomputer software 3adifferential equation 3aevaporation 3airrigation 3amodels 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3asoil water 3asolutes 3avadose zone 3awater distribution 3awater uptake1 aHeck, Katharina1 aSchröder, Natalie1 aClass, Holger1 aHelmig, Rainer0 tVadose zone journal.g2018, v. 17, no. 1 p.1-21dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2017.12.02103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01365naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245005100163506002800214520042700242592002800669506003700697650001600734650001300750650001000763650001200773650001400785650001700799700001900816773012800835856007900963852000901042655001201051IND60785442020221207090913.0190504s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078544202DNAL7 a10.5281/zenodo.25861362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeregrym, M.M.10aFritillaria ruthenica Wikstr. in Doneck Upland  aResource is Open Access  aThe results investigation of horology and ecological and coenotic characteristics, state of populations of rare species of Ukrainian flora Fritillaria ruthenica Wikstr. in Doneck upland are given in the article.

This site is near the Subsurface Disposal Area for radioactive and other hazardous waste at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. Within 4 mo, we detected tracer in one of 13 sampled aquifer wells, and in eight of 11 sampled perched-water wells as far as 1.3 km away. These detections show that (i) low-permeability layers in the unsaturated zone divert some flow horizontally, but do not prevent rapid transport to the aquifer; (ii) horizontal convective transport rates within the unsaturated zone may exceed 14 m d⁻¹, perhaps through essentially saturated basalt fractures, tension cracks, lava tubes, or rubble zones; and (iii) some perched water beneath the Subsurface Disposal Area derives from episodic surface water more than 1 km away. Such rapid and far-reaching flow may be common throughout the Snake River Plain, and possibly occurs in other locations that have a geologically complex unsaturated zone and comparable sources of infiltrating water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abasalt 3ahazardous waste 3alava 3anaphthalene 3aponds 3asulfonates 3asurface water 3avadose zone 3awells 3aIdaho 3aSnake River1 aPerkins, Kim S.1 aRose, Peter E.1 aRousseau, Joseph P.1 aOrr, Brennon R.1 aTwining, Brian V.1 aAnderson, Steven R.0 tVadose zone journal.g2002 Aug., v. 1, no. 1 p.89-101dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2002.89003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010500169300001600274520129000290592002801580650002201608650001401630650001501644650002901659650001301688650002701701650002301728650001101751650002601762650001501788650002401803651001001827653003501837653002401872653003301896653002601929653002201955700001701977700001401994700001602008700001502024700001802039700001202057773012502069856008502194852000902279655001202288IND60633020520221118002427.0200330e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063302052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2017.12.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Haining10aDesign and implementation of an index calculation system for forestry ecological assessment in China  ap. 253-274.  aIn recent years, ecological issues have become increasingly serious with the development of modern society. An effective assessment for the ecological environment status is of great significance for the protection and construction of the ecological environment. We present the China Forestry Ecological Index Calculation System (CFEICS), which provides the quantitative measurement and qualitative evaluation for the forestry ecosystem status. However, a series of problems arises in the process of system design and implementation, including frequent changing of the ecological indicator system, low reporting rate but high error rate of ecological basic data, and long period and low efficiency of system development. To address the abovementioned problems, we first designed a database model by using a table-driven approach (TDA). Second, we implemented a reusable software system—the dynamic ecological data management system (DEDMS)—based on the TDA. The DEDMS contains data access, data verification, data statistics, index calculation, and index expression components. Third, we applied the DEDMS to the CFEICS and completed the final CFEICS. After practical test and application, the system was used as the official ecological index calculation system in Chinese forestry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental indicators 3aforestry 3ainformation management 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3aquantitative analysis 3astatistics 3asystems engineering 3aChina 0aForestry ecological assessment 0aEcological security 0aEcological carrying capacity 0aTable-driven approach 0aReusable software1 aWang, Longhe1 aPeng, Fan1 aGu, Jinfeng1 aLu, Shuhan1 aZhang, Dahong1 aLi, Lin0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 Feb., v. 145 p.253-274dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2017.12.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03421naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245010400180300001600284520196300300592002802263650001302291650001502304650002102319650000902340650001202349650001402361650001902375650001102394650001302405650004302418650001502461650000902476650002202485651003102507653002802538653004302566653002402609653002102633653001902654653003202673700002702705773012502732856008502857852000902942655001202951IND60633020820221118002305.0200330e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063302082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2017.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTagarakis, Aristotelis C.10aProximal sensor-based algorithm for variable rate nitrogen application in maize in northeast U.S.A.  ap. 373-378.  aGround-based proximal sensing can aid in within-field, mid-season, and on-the-go nitrogen (N) management of maize (Zea mays L.) but algorithms require regional calibration. Our objective was to develop algorithms for predicting N needs of maize in the northeastern US using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We established six replicated trials at research farms with up to six N rates (0, 56, 112, 168, 224, and 336 kg N ha⁻¹) applied pre-plant, and eleven trials with five N rates (0, 56, 112, 168, 224 and 336 kg N ha⁻¹ sidedressed at V7) and an N-rich treatment (168 kg ha⁻¹ applied pre-plant and 168 kg N ha⁻¹ sidedressed at V7) conducted on commercial farms. Sensor and yield data from the zero-N and N-rich plots of the on-farm trials were added to the data from the six pre-plant trials to determine a (1) yield prediction model, developed using NDVI obtained at V7, and (2) a Response Index (RIₕₐᵣᵥₑₛₜ), calculated as the yield in the highest N fertilized treatment divided by the yield in the low-N treatment. In addition, a virtual RI derived from NDVI values taken at V7 (RINDVI) was calculated. The most economic rate of sidedress N (MERN) was determined for the on-farm trials. The regression between RIₐₗgₒ and virtual RINDVI resulted in two equations, as the correlation was heavily impacted by weather in the growing season; for years with normal precipitation, the response to N post-sensing was greater (RIₐₗgₒ = 3.8 ∗ RINDVI − 2.38) than in years with severe drought (RIₐₗgₒ = 1.45 ∗ RINDVI − 0.3). The N prescriptions (yield predictions and RIs combined) correlated well with the MERN (r² = 0.82) across sites. We conclude that crop sensing is a promising technology for on-the-go N applications for maize in the Northeast but further studies are needed to determine RIs under a range of weather conditions and soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aalgorithms 3acommercial farms 3acorn 3adrought 3aequations 3agrowing season 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aprediction 3asoil 3ayield forecasting 3aNortheastern United States 0aMost economic rate of N 0aNormalized difference vegetation index 0aNutrient management 0aProximal sensing 0aResponse index 0aVariable rate N application1 aKetterings, Quirine M.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 Feb., v. 145 p.373-378dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2017.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03837naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245010500162300001300267500002000280500000900300520240300309592002802712596005102740650001302791650001102804650001102815650002902826650001402855650001502869650001702884650001002901650001502911650001802926650002302944650002202967650001602989650001203005650002203017650001603039700003103055700002803086700002003114773013203134856008003266852000903346655001203355IND60671909520221116160705.0220819s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067190952DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2018.08.01622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeue, Martin10aDetermining Millimeter‐Scale Maps of Cation Exchange Capacity at Macropore Surfaces in Bt Horizons  ap. 1-11.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: Coatings determine the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of macropore surfaces. We predicted the millimeter‐scale, 2D spatial distribution of CEC at intact macropores. The approach combined infrared spectroscopy and CEC measurements of small samples. The CEC distribution in clay–organic coatings was similar for two different Bt horizons. During preferential flow in structured soils, solute transport is largely restricted to a complex network of macropores. Clay–organic coatings of macropore surfaces determine soil physicochemical properties relevant for mass transport and carbon and nutrient turnover, such as the cation exchange capacity (CEC). However, due to the lack of an appropriate measurement approach, the small‐scale spatial distributions of the CEC and its quantities are unknown to date. The objective of this work was to develop a method for predicting the millimeter‐ to centimeter‐scale, two‐dimensional spatial distribution of the CEC at intact macropore surfaces. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy was used to analyze bulk soil and separated coating material and for intact macropore surfaces as DRIFT mapping. To determine effective CEC (CECₑff), a reduction of soil mass down to 0.5 g for use in the standard barium chloride batch method was tested to account for the limited amount of soil material that can be separated from thin macropore coatings. Linear and partial least squares regression analyses were applied to predict the CECₑff distribution at intact macropore surfaces for samples from Luvisol Bt horizons from loess (L) and glacial till (T) using DRIFT spectral data. The highest CECₑff values were found for coatings and pinhole fillings rich of clay–organic material (L: 38 cmol kg⁻¹; T: 29 cmol kg⁻¹) compared with low CECₑff values of uncoated cracks and earthworm burrows that were similar to those of bulk soil (L: 21 cmol kg⁻¹; T: 14 cmol kg⁻¹). The location of millimeter‐ to centimeter‐sized regions with increased CECₑff levels at intact macropore surfaces corresponded with the location of clay–organic coatings. The proposed method allows determining the CEC at macropore surfaces to quantify their effect on nutrient transport by preferential flow as well as on plant nutrient supply in macropores that may serve as preferential growth paths for plant roots.  aPublisher supplied data  aLE 3177/1‐2cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aLuvisols 3abarium 3acarbon 3acation exchange capacity 3achlorides 3aearthworms 3aglacial till 3aloess 3amacropores 3amass transfer 3anutrient transport 3apreferential flow 3areflectance 3asolutes 3aspectral analysis 3avadose zone1 aBeck-Broichsitter, Steffen1 aFelde, Vincent J.M.N.L.1 aGerke, Horst H.0 tVadose zone journal.g2019, v. 18, no. 1 p.1-11dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2018.08.01623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01798naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003400144245009300178300001600271506002800287520041900315592002800734506003700762650001800799650001200817650001400829651001600843653002500859653002900884653002300913653002100936653002100957653002700978653002501005653001801030700002101048700002101069700002201090700002301112773014101135856007901276852000901355655001201364IND60785445320221207085807.0220704e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078544532DNAL7 a10.15407/ukrbotj79.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarshall, A.

The drinking behavior of bucket-fed calves has not been monitored automatically yet, although sufficient milk intake is essential for calves’ health and growth. The objectives of this pilot study were (1) to evaluate the technical and mathematical feasibility of using an acceleration sensor to detect drinking events in bucket-fed dairy calves, (2) to develop an algorithm for an acceleration sensor (SMARTBOW ear tag, Smartbow GmbH, Weibern, Austria) for monitoring drinking behavior in bucket-fed dairy calves, and (3) to validate the SMARTBOW sensor for monitoring drinking events in bucket-fed dairy calves to observations from video recordings. Three preweaned dairy calves were equipped with ear-tag accelerometers. Calves were housed in individual pens and fed milk from a teat-bucket twice a day. Acceleration data were collected and calf behavior was video-recorded for 5 d for 24 h d⁻¹. Based on a training data set, an algorithm was developed to predict drinking events. Further 15 d of data were generated by simulation. Video recordings were used to analyze whether drinking events (n = 174) were predicted correctly for the complete data set. Sensitivity (82.9%), specificity (96.9%), and accuracy (96.2%) were good, but precision (60.4%) was not yet optimal. Cohen’s Kappa (0.68) indicated substantial agreement between sensor and video analysis. More research based on a larger number of animals with the aim to optimize the underlying algorithm and to further increase sensitivity and precision is planned.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccelerometers 3aalgorithms 3adairy calves 3adata collection 3adrinking 3aear tags 3amilk 3amilk consumption 3amonitoring 0aCalf 0aDrinking behavior 0aAccelerometer 0aValidation 0aDE 0aDEa 0aDEp 0aFN 0aFP 0aTN 0aTP1 aLidauer, Laura1 aSattlecker, Georg1 aKickinger, Florian1 aAuer, Wolfgang1 aSturm, Valentin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1493-60591 aEfrosinin, Dmitry1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0902-66401 aDrillich, Marc1 aIwersen, Michael0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 Feb., v. 145 p.298-301dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007300147245008000220300001200300520116300312592002801475596005501503650001201558650001101570650000901581650001901590650001101609650001601620650000901636650001801645650001701663650000901680651001701689700001801706700002901724773014101753856008201894852000901976655001201985IND60656456520221118122603.0190919e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065645652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-019-4257-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCompaore, Wendkuuni Florentin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4799-630310aGold Mine Impact on Soil Quality, Youga, Southern Burkina Faso, West Africa  ap. 207.  aThe present study aims to assess the impact of a gold mine located in the southeastern part of Burkina Faso on local soil quality. This information is needed in order to determine any health hazards and potential remediation strategies as the mining site is expected to be turned over to the local community after the closure of the mine. For the purpose, total minor and trace elements analysis as well as a sequential extraction were performed and results were interpreted using different methodologies: enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation index (Igeo) computed using two separate background samples, and comparison to selected national standard. The soil analysis revealed a moderate to significant soil EF and Igeo with hotspots located closer to the ore processing plant and on the east side of the site, with a maximum arsenic concentration of 286.55 ± 12.50 mg/kg. Sequential extraction revealed, however, that less than 2% of the arsenic is found in the exchangeable part. Cobalt and zinc are more distributed in the different fractions than arsenic.

It included all or part of 18 municipalities, distributed in the western and eastern Cariri regions of Paraíba state. The monthly average values of reference evapotranspiration according to Penman-Monteith method were applied in the annual hydrological balance for obtaining the annual time series of the aridity index for the period from 1950 to 2013. The Mann-Kendall test (MK) was used for trend identification in the annual time series of rainfall and aridity index, at a significance level of α = 0.05. The slope of the trends was obtained by Sen’s method, and the values of rainfall, aridity index, and statistics MK were spatially kriging, to generate thematic maps. The results indicate an increase in rainfall and reduced dryness in the watershed of the upper Paraíba River, conditions that do not contribute to trigger the process of land degradation (desertification), indicating that the cause of this environmental problem is not climatic. Thus, it can be suggested that the observed manifestations of land degradation (desertification) derive much of human than climatic actions. However, there is a trend of increasing dryness and reducing rainfall in the central portion of the watershed, with stronger core in the location of Camalaú. The spatial distribution of rainfall and aridity index shows that minimum values of rainfall coincide with maximum values of the aridity index. Higher values of rainfall were observed in the northwestern portion of the watershed, while the northeast and southeast portions had the lower rainfall values, with the strongest core in the locality of Cabaceiras. The eastern sector of the watershed has high dryness, unlike the western sector, rainier, with minimum values of dryness. In the western portion of the watershed, the aridity index was in the range considered semiarid, with moderate susceptibility to land degradation process. Similarly, in the eastern portion, the dryness stood in the range considered arid, with high susceptibility. The cores with more pronounced dryness correspond to the municipalities of Cabaceiras, Caraúbas, and São João do Cariri.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adesertification 3adry environmental conditions 3aevapotranspiration 3ahumans 3akriging 3aland degradation 3arain 3arivers 3athematic maps 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds1 ade Azevedo, Pedro Vieira1 aCosta dos Santos, Carlos Antonio0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2017 Feb., v. 127, no. 3-4 p.741-751dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-015-1661-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009600169520133900265592002801604650001501632650001701647650003501664650001201699650002501711650001901736650001401755650001001769650003301779650001401812650001301826653002601839653001001865653005301875653004801928653002101976653001801997700005702015700002802072773012502100856008202225852000902307655001202316IND60646205820221118064639.0190624e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064620582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2019.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSixto, Alexandra10aFast and simple method using DLLME and FAAS for the determination of trace cadmium in honey  aA novel method for the determination of trace cadmium in honey is presented. It consists of a preconcentration step based on dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) and measurement by flame AAS. Samples are dissolved in water. A mixture of carbon tetrachloride (extraction solvent) and acetonitrile (dispersion solvent) containing ammoniun pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) as complexing agent is injected rapidly into the dissolved sample by means of a syringe pump. After centrifugation, an aliquot of the organic phase is injected in the nebuliser of an atomic absorption spectrometer by means of a lab-made microsampling device. Response (integrated absorbance) was linear with concentrations up to 12 μg L−1. Precision (sr(%)) at the 5 μg L−1 level was < 3.1%. Detection and quantification limits were 1.6 and 5.5 μg per 100 g of honey respectively. Six commercial samples were spiked at the 10 μg per 100 g level and analysed by the proposed method and by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. The results did not differ at the 5% significance level, with recoveries for the DLLME/FAAS method ranging from 82 to 125%. The proposed method requires simple sample preparation and does not use expensive equipment, thus it could be used as screening method for the content of cadmium in honey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aacetonitrile 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3acarbon tetrachloride 3acentrifugation 3aequipment 3ahoney 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3ascreening 3asolvents 0aCadmium determination 0aHoney 0aDispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) 0aFlame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) 0aFood composition 0aFood analysis1 aMollo, Alicia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1887-063X1 aKnochen, M.q(Moisés),0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2019 Sept., v. 82 p.103229-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2019.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013800162300001600300520125800316592002801574650001501602650002001617650001101637650000801648650001301656650001501669650001601684650001901700650001601719651001801735651001101753651001701764700001601781700003201797700001901829700001101848773011301859856008101972852000902053655001202062IND60574138820221118225614.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057413882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-015-1663-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Jiaxi10aIntercomparison of the temperature contrast between the arctic and equator in the pre- and post periods of the 1976/1977 regime shift  ap. 761-767.  aBased on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis temperature dataset in the period of 1948–2014, the temperature contrast between the Arctic and equator in the pre- and post periods of the 1976/1977 regime shift is compared. An index measuring the temperature contrast is defined as the difference between the Arctic zone (70° N–90° N) and the equatorial region (10° S–10° N). The variations of the temperature contrast can be mainly explained by the local sea ice variations through sea ice–albedo–temperature feedback before 1976/1977 and the energy transportation to the Arctic together with the local sea ice after 1976/1977. The impacts of the Arctic minus equator (AmE) temperature contrast on the high-level westerly jet, and the polar easterlies show a significant difference during the two periods. A strong temperature anomaly associated with the temperature contrast in the two periods is found in the high latitude, but different patterns are observed at the high and low levels. The correlated water vapor appeared in the Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent before 1976/1977 and moved to northeastern Canada and eastern North America after 1976/1977.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold zones 3adata collection 3aenergy 3aice 3alatitude 3aprediction 3atemperature 3atransportation 3awater vapor 3aArctic region 3aCanada 3aIndian Ocean1 aXu, Jianjun1 aPowell, Alfred M., Jr.cJr.1 aGuan, Zhaoyong1 aLi, Li0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2017 Feb., v. 127, no. 3-4 p.761-767dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-015-1663-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013400160300001600294520179200310592002802102650000802130650001202138650001202150650001302162650001802175650001202193650001902205650001502224650001302239650001102252773011302263856008102376852000902457655001202466IND60574139020221118230602.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057413902DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-015-1665-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ye10aGlobal biogeophysical interactions between historical deforestation and climate through land surface albedo and interactive ocean  ap. 769-777.  aDeforestation is expanding and accelerating into the remaining areas of undisturbed forest, and the quality of the remaining forests is declining today. Assessing the climatic impacts of deforestation can help to rectify this alarming situation. In this paper, how historical deforestation may affect global climate through interactive ocean and surface albedo is examined using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity (EMIC). Control and anomaly integrations are performed for 1000 years. In the anomaly case, cropland is significantly expanded since AD 1700. The response of climate in deforested areas is not uniform between the regions. In the background of a global cooling of 0.08 °C occurring with cooler surface air above 0.4 °C across 30° N to 75° N from March to September, the surface albedo increase has a global cooling effect in response to global-scale replacement of forests by cropland, especially over northern mid-high latitudes. The northern mid-latitude (30° N–60° N) suffers a prominent cooling in June, suggesting that this area is most sensitive to cropland expansion through surface albedo. Most regions show a consistent trend between the overall cooling in response to historical deforestation and its resulting cooling due to surface albedo anomaly. Furthermore, the effect of the interactive ocean on shaping the climate response to deforestation is greater than that of prescribed SSTs in most years with a maximum spread of 0.05 °C. This difference is more prominent after year 1800 than that before due to the more marked deforestation. These findings show the importance of the land cover change and the land surface albedo, stressing the necessity to analyze other biogeophysical processes of deforestation using interactive ocean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aclimate 3acooling 3acropland 3adeforestation 3aforests 3aglobal cooling 3aland cover 3alatitude 3amodels0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2017 Feb., v. 127, no. 3-4 p.769-777dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-015-1665-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007800164300001600242520190600258592002802164650001102192650001502203650002002218650001102238650001502249650001602264700001602280700001502296700002102311700001602332700001802348773011302366856008102479852000902560655001202569IND60574139420221118225938.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057413942DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-015-1673-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicolini, G.10aPerformance of eddy-covariance measurements in fetch-limited applications  ap. 829-840.  aWhen estimating gas fluxes by means of the eddy covariance (EC) technique, measurement representativeness is ensured by the availability of an adequate fetch. In applications over spatially limited fetches, it is possible to constrain the sensed source area by shortening the measurement height, but this comes at the cost of potentially violating some fundamental assumptions of the method or introducing significant measurement errors. In addition, reliability of footprint models when applied to measurements close to the surface is still debatable. In this manuscript, we investigate whether it is possible to use the EC method for determining the surface-atmosphere exchange over spatially limited ecosystems on horizontal scales of about 100 m. The objectives are (1) to determine the adequate positioning of the instruments in the atmospheric boundary layer, (2) to assess the quality of measurement in search of potential biases, (3) establish whether the source area is sufficiently constrained, (4) and evaluate the performances of some popular footprint models in such conditions. Most notably, we carried out an experiment to assess the footprint of two low EC systems and to evaluate the prediction of the selected footprint models against empirical data.Our findings show that (1) depending on the properties of the underlying exchange surface, EC measurements as low as 0.8 m above the canopies’ displacement height are still feasible; (2) spectral losses as high as 34 ± 6 % can occur (dominated by instruments displacement), but can still be quantified and largely corrected; and (3) the measurement source area is sufficiently constrained during daytime conditions and two footprint models predict it accurately. We conclude that it is possible to apply EC in fetch-limited applications, at least when surface properties of adjacent land covers do not differ too drastically.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3amodels 3aprediction 3atroposphere1 aFratini, G.1 aAvilov, V.1 aKurbatova, J.

Evidence from an experimental analysis  ap. 168-176.  aThere is a wide array of empirical work on the use of monetary and non-monetary measures to manage residential water consumption. However, there has been little focus on exploring the ability to change human attitudes and behavior through offering consumers sustainable resource management. This research helps bridge this gap, through an experimental trial in Brisbane, Australia. Choices of different monetary and non-monetary incentives for managing water demand are offered to survey participants. A structural behavioral model is then developed to identify direct and indirect impacts of attitudes and behavior and which can be compared between separate groups drawn from the survey’s participants. Our results suggest that both monetary and non-monetary incentives offered to households significantly reduce water consumption, which is especially so for those holding pro-environmental attitudes/behavior. Importantly, the impact is higher for non-monetary incentives. The results therefore provide valuable insight for the development of long-term sustainable resource management policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3ahouseholds 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aresource management 3asurveys 3aAustralia 0aQ25 0aR11 0aPro-environmental behavior 0aEnvironmental attitudes 0aWater consumption1 aGifford, Robert1 aTorgler, Benno1 aGarcia-Valiñas, Marian1 aAthukorala, Wasantha1 aManagi, Shunsuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7883-14271 aWilson, Clevo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3885-04950 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 Oct., v. 149 p.168-176dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.05.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009100162300001600253520130400269592002801573650002001601650001101621650001201632650003001644650002501674651001101699700002301710700001401733773011301747856008101860852000901941655001201950IND60574139920221118230652.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057413992DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-015-1677-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMimić, G.10aComplexity analysis of the air temperature and the precipitation time series in Serbia  ap. 891-898.  aIn this paper, we have analyzed the time series of daily values for three meteorological elements, two continuous and a discontinuous one, i.e., the maximum and minimum air temperature and the precipitation. The analysis was done based on the observations from seven stations in Serbia from the period 1951–2010. The main aim of this paper was to quantify the complexity of the annual values for the mentioned time series and to calculate the rate of its change. For that purpose, we have used the sample entropy and the Kolmogorov complexity as the measures which can indicate the variability and irregularity of a given time series. Results obtained show that the maximum temperature has increasing trends in the given period which points out a warming, ranged in the interval 1–2 °C. The increasing temperature indicates the higher internal energy of the atmosphere, changing the weather patterns, manifested in the time series. The Kolmogorov complexity of the maximum temperature time series has statistically significant increasing trends, while the sample entropy has increasing but statistically insignificant trend.

This work investigated the enrichment effect of the GFB with Agaricus bisporus polysaccharide (ABP) flour and inulin. Volatile compounds, as well as the antioxidant and structural properties of the fortified GFB were evaluated. Sweet potato-glutinous rice flour was fortified with ABP flour and the same with inulin at different levels (3, 6 and 9%), besides a constant percentage of xanthan gum (0.5%) was added to all the blends. Addition of ABP flour resulted in higher levels of volatile compounds compared to inulin addition and the control. ABP flour formulation (F₃) had the highest total phenolic content (19.05 mg GAE/g), reducing power (5.31 mg/mL, EC₅₀ value), DPPH (6.85 mg/mL, EC₅₀ value), ABTS (8.86 mg/mL, EC₅₀ value) radical-scavenging activities, and β-carotene bleaching (13.22 mg/mL, EC₅₀ value). Conversely, the control and inulin formulation (F₁) showed the lowest levels of these activities. The micrographs of the ABP flour formulations showed polyhedral, aggregated, and some spherical granules, whereas inulin formulations revealed spherical granules bound together with deformed granules. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the amide I band and both α- and β-glycosidic linkages. The current findings exhibited that ABP flour and inulin had good attributes to improve the antioxidant activity of GFB and modify its structural characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data  a214122cMinistry of Education of the People’s Republic of China 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeta-carotene 3ableaching 3agluten-free bread 3agranules 3ainulin 3amedian effective concentration 3amushrooms 3aprebiotics 3arice flour 3avolatile compounds 3axanthan gum1 aZhu, Ke-Xue1 aPeng, Wei1 aHassan, Hayat A.1 aObadi, Mohammed1 aAhmed, Mohamed I.1 aZhou, Hui-Ming0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2019 Sept., v. 13, no. 3 p.1884-1897dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-019-00107-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100001600172245013400188300001600322520122800338592002801566650003201594650001501626650001701641650001001658650001801668650002701686650000901713650001901722650001901741650001801760650001701778650001901795650001301814650000901827650003801836650003501874650003101909650003501940650004101975650001902016650001402035650002002049650002202069650004602091650003502137700001702172700003002189700001402219700001502233700001502248773008302263856008902346852000902435655001202444IND4466489920221119193350.0141110e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446648992DNAL7 a221692062pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.11.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFajardo, C.10aAssessing the impact of zero-valent iron (ZVI) nanotechnology on soil microbial structure and functionality: A molecular approach  ap. 802-808.  aIn this work, nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI) particles have been used as an immobilisation strategy to reduce Pb and Zn availability and mobility in polluted soils. The application of NZVI to two soil microcosms (MPb and MZn) at a dose of 34mgg⁻¹ soil efficiently immobilised Pb (25%) and zinc (20%). Exposure to NZVI had little impact on the microbial cellular viability and biological activity in the soils. Three bacterial genes (narG, nirS and gyrA) were used as treatment-related biomarkers. These biomarkers ruled out a broad bactericidal effect on the bulk soil microbial community. A transcriptome analysis of the genes did not reveal any changes in their expression ratios after the NZVI treatment: 1.6 (narG), 0.8 (nirS) and 0.7 (gyrA) in the MPb microcosm and 0.6 (narG), 1.2 (nirS) and 0.5 (gyrA) in the MZn microcosm. However, significant changes in the structure and composition of the soil bacteria population were detected by fluorescence insitu hybridisation. Thus, our results showed that NZVI toxicity could be highly dose and species dependent, and the effective applicability of the proposed molecular approach in assessing the impact of this immobilisation strategy on soil microbial population.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological activity in soil 3abiomarkers 3afluorescence 3agenes 3ahybridization 3aimmobilization in soil 3airon 3ananotechnology 3apolluted soils 3asoil bacteria 3asoil ecology 3asoil structure 3atoxicity 3azinc 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aGenes, Bacterialxdrug effects 2aIronxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aLeadxisolation & purification 2aNanostructuresxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aNanotechnology 2aPhylogeny 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxisolation & purification 2aZincxisolation & purification1 aOrtíz, L.T.1 aRodríguez-Membibre, M.L.1 aNande, M.1 aLobo, M.C.1 aMartin, M.0 tChemosphere.g2012 Feb., v. 86, no. 8 p.802-808dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.11.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008300163300001600246500001500262520151500277592002801792650001101820650000901831650001101840650001901851650001501870650001601885650003001901653000901931700001701940700001501957700001501972773011301987856008102100852000902181655001202190IND60574140020221117051342.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057414002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-015-1649-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiong10aImpact of East Asian winter monsoon on MJO over the equatorial western Pacific  ap. 551-561.  a2019-12-06  aThis paper investigates the processes and mechanisms by which the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) affects the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) over the equatorial western Pacific in boreal winter (November–April). The results show that both the EAWM and MJO over the equatorial western Pacific have prominent interannual and interdecadal variabilities, and they are closely related, especially on the interannual timescales. The EAWM influences MJO via the feedback effect of convective heating, because the strong northerlies of EAWM can enhance the ascending motion and lead the convection to be strengthened over the equatorial western Pacific by reinforcing the convergence in the lower troposphere. Daily composite analysis in the phase 4 of MJO (i.e., strong MJO convection over the Maritime Continent and equatorial western Pacific) shows that the kinetic energy, outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), moisture flux, vertical velocity, zonal wind, moist static energy, and atmospheric stability differ greatly between strong and weak EAWM processes over the western Pacific. The strong EAWM causes the intensity of MJO to increase, and the eastward propagation of MJO to become more persistent. MJO activities over the equatorial western Pacific have different modes. Furthermore, these modes have differing relationships with the EAWM, and other factors can also affect the activities of MJO; consequently, the relationship between the MJO and EAWM shows both interannual and interdecadal variabilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3awind 3awinter 3amonsoon season 3aconvection 3atroposphere 3aMadden-Julian Oscillation 0aheat1 aLi, Chongyin1 aLing, Jian1 aTan, Yanke0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2017 Feb., v. 127, no. 3-4 p.551-561dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-015-1649-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005600165300001600221520159800237592002801835650001201863650001401875650001201889650001601901650000901917650001101926650001601937650002501953651001701978651001501995773011302010856008102123852000902204655001202213IND60574140420221117051452.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057414042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-015-1681-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŞen, Zekâi,10aInnovative trend significance test and applications  ap. 939-947.  aHydro-climatological time series might embed characteristics of past changes concerning climate variability in terms of shifts, cyclic fluctuations, and more significantly in the form of trends. Identification of such features from the available records is one of the prime tasks of hydrologists, climatologists, applied statisticians, or experts in related topics. Although there are different trend identification and significance tests in the literature, they require restrictive assumptions, which may not be existent in the structure of hydro-climatological time series. In this paper, a method is suggested with statistical significance test for trend identification in an innovative manner. This method has non-parametric basis without any restrictive assumption, and its application is rather simple with the concept of sub-series comparisons that are extracted from the main time series. The method provides privilege for selection of sub-temporal half periods for the comparison and, finally, generates trend on objective and quantitative manners. The necessary statistical equations are derived for innovative trend identification and statistical significance test application. The application of the proposed methodology is suggested for three time series from different parts of the world including Southern New Jersey annual temperature, Danube River annual discharge, and Tigris River Diyarbakir meteorology station annual total rainfall records. Each record has significant trend with increasing type in the New Jersey case, whereas in other two cases, decreasing trends exist.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aequations 3aexperts 3ameteorology 3arain 3arivers 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aDanube River 3aNew Jersey0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2017 Feb., v. 127, no. 3-4 p.939-947dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-015-1681-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245016900174300001800343520133900361592002801700596006901728650003401797650002701831650002201858650002501880650001701905650001801922650001801940650002401958650001801982650002002000650002202020650001502042650001802057650003202075650002002107650002602127650001702153650001802170700002402188700002602212700001602238700002702254700002002281773013502301856008302436852000902519655001202528IND60656459320221118122536.0191003e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065645932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-019-00117-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega-Gálvez, Antonio10aChemical and bioactive characterization of papaya (Vasconcellea pubescens) under different drying technologies: evaluation of antioxidant and antidiabetic potential  ap. 1980-1990.  aChilean papaya slices were dried using different technologies to evaluate the effect of the different technologies on drying kinetics, bioactive compounds and biological activities. Five techniques were used: freeze drying (FD), vacuum drying (VD), solar drying (SD), convective drying (CD) and infrared drying (IRD). Fresh and dried samples were evaluated in terms of proximate composition, phenolic profiles, total phenolic and flavonoid contents, β-carotene, vitamin C, and antioxidant and α-glucosidase activities. CD-papaya showed lower processing time, requiring 270 min to reach the dynamic equilibrium condition, while SD-papaya required 870 min. The five drying technologies were found to have variable effects on proximate composition. VD-samples showed the lowest loss of individual phenolic compounds, total phenolic content and vitamin C while IRD- and CD-samples showed lower total flavonoids (42%) and β-carotene (32%) loss after processing, respectively. With respect to biological activities, all samples possessed enzymatic activity in a dose-dependent manner (0–2.0 mg ml⁻¹), being IRD-sample the most effective in inhibiting α-glucosidase (IC₅₀ = 13 mg ml⁻¹). Also, the highest antioxidant capacity measured by DPPH and ORAC was obtained for the papaya samples dried using a vacuum drier.  aPublisher supplied data  a1170601cFondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aVasconcellea pubescens 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abeta-carotene 3abioactive compounds 3adose response 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aflavonoids 3afreeze drying 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aprocessing time 3aproximate composition 3asolar drying 3avacuum drying1 aPoblete, Jacqueline1 aQuispe-Fuentes, Issis1 aUribe, Elsa1 aBilbao-Sainz, Cristina1 aPastén, Alexis0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2019 Sept., v. 13, no. 3 p.1980-1990dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-019-00117-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245015100172520139500323592002801718650001201746650001701758650002301775650001501798650001101813651001201824653002601836653002201862653002301884653003701907653003401944653002801978700006302006700002002069700002302089700002002112773010202132856008702234852000902321655001202330IND60646208320221119183355.0201104e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064620832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambert, Louise10aUnpacking the organisational diversity within the collaborative economy: The contribution of an analytical framework from social enterprise theory  aThe field of the collaborative economy is characterized by a wide spectrum of sustainability oriented grassroots initiatives such as cooperatives, social businesses, associations and informal initiatives. However, many of these organisations are facing isomorphic pressures from the purely for profit organisational models and lack institutional support. For the further development of these grassroots initiatives, it is therefore important to better understand the organisational models that allow them to maintain a strong social mission in spite of these pressures. To this purpose, this paper develops a hierarchical cluster analysis of 50 collaborative economy initiatives operating in the Region of Brussels Capital. The analysis shows the existence of four main clusters of enterprises operating in the Brussels Region: foreign for-profit enterprises, start-ups, citizen initiatives and partnership social enterprises. Each of these clusters is characterized by a specific combination of analytical features such as the mission, the governance structure, the legal form and the type of economic resource mobilisation. On this basis, the paper explores the likely organisational trajectories of these clusters in the collaborative economy and the various institutional strategies that can strengthen the recognition and support for the sustainability oriented grassroots initiatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acooperatives 3aeconomic resources 3agovernance 3amodels 3aBelgium 0aCollaborative economy 0aSharing practices 0aSocial enterprises 0aUrban sustainability transitions 0aGrassroots social innovations 0aHierarchical clustering1 aDedeurwaerdere, Tom1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9494-26881 aNyssens, Marthe1 aSeveri, Elisabetta1 aBrolis, Olivier0 tEcological economics.g2019 Oct., v. 164 p.106343-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009000164300001800254520141500272592002801687650002001715650001301735650002301748650001101771650001801782650002701800650001101827650001801838650002101856650001501877650002501892650002701917651001001944700001601954700001501970700001701985700001902002700001602021700001702037773011502054856008102169852000902250655001202259IND60574140920221117051303.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057414092DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-015-1684-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Yongjie10aSimulating the role of gravel in freeze–thaw process on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau  ap. 1011-1022.  aSoils containing gravel (particle size ≥2 mm) are widely distributed over the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP). Soil mixed with gravel has different thermal and hydrological properties compared with fine soil (particle size <2 mm) and thus has marked impacts on soil water and heat transfer. However, the most commonly used land models do not consider the effects of gravel. This paper reports the development of a new scheme that simulates the thermal and hydrological processes in soil containing gravel and its application in the QTP. The new scheme was implemented in version 4 of the Community Land Model, and experiments were conducted for two typical sites in the QTP. The results showed that (1) soil with gravel tends to reduce the water holding capacity and enhance the hydraulic conductivity and drainage; (2) the thermal conductivity increases with soil gravel content, and the response of the temperature of soil mixed with gravel to air temperature change is rapid; (3) the new scheme performs well in simulating the soil temperature and moisture—the mean biases of soil moisture between the simulation and observation reduced by 25–48 %, and the mean biases of soil temperature reduced by 9–25 %. Therefore, this scheme can successfully simulate the thermal and hydrological processes in soil with different levels of gravel content and is potentially applicable in land surface models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3adrainage 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3agravel 3aheat transfer 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amodels 3aparticle size 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3athermal conductivity 3awater holding capacity 3aChina1 aLyu, Shihua1 aLi, Suosuo1 aGao, Yanhong1 aMeng, Xianhong1 aAo, Yinhuan1 aWang, Shujin0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2017 Feb., v. 127, no. 3-4 p.1011-1022dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-015-1684-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011200164300001600276520139400292592002801686650001701714650001201731650002801743650001501771650001601786650000901802650001401811650001101825651001401836651002101850700001601871700001401887700001501901773011301916856008102029852000902110655001202119IND60574141020221117052305.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057414102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-015-1653-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaltacı, H.14aThe influence of atmospheric circulation types on regional patterns of precipitation in Marmara (NW Turkey)  ap. 563-572.  aIn this study, regional patterns of precipitation in Marmara are described for the first time by means of Ward’s hierarchical cluster analysis. Daily values of winter precipitation data based on 19 meteorological stations were used for the period from 1960 to 2012. Five clusters of coherent zones were determined, namely Black Sea-Marmara, Black Sea, Marmara, Thrace, and Aegean sub-regions. To investigate the prevailing atmospheric circulation types (CTs) that cause precipitation occurrence and intensity in these five different rainfall sub-basins, objective Lamb weather type (LWT) methodology was applied to National Centers of Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis of daily mean sea level pressure (MSLP) data. Precipitation occurrence suggested that wet CTs (i.e. N, NE, NW, and C) offer a high chance of precipitation in all sub-regions. For the eastern (western) part of the region, the high probability of rainfall occurrence is shown under the influence of E (SE, S, SW) atmospheric CTs. In terms of precipitation intensity, N and C CTs had the highest positive gradients in all the sub-basins of the Marmara. In addition, although Marmara and Black Sea sub-regions have the highest daily rainfall potential during NE types, high daily rainfall totals are recorded in all sub-regions except the Black Sea during NW types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaily Values 3aMarmara 3aatmospheric circulation 3aprediction 3aprobability 3arain 3asea level 3awinter 3aBlack Sea 3aTurkey (country)1 aKındap, T.1 aÜnal, A.1 aKaraca, M.0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2017 Feb., v. 127, no. 3-4 p.563-572dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-015-1653-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011700170300001600287520122500303592002801528650001401556650001701570650001901587650001401606650002301620650001501643650002501658650002201683650001101705650001501716650000901731651001701740651001401757700001801771700002701789700002101816700002001837700002101857700002901878773010901907856008102016852000902097655001202106IND60574142420221117051427.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057414242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-016-1245-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrossi, Mariana A.14aThe road to 2020 targets and the learnings from the emblematic South American plant genus Nassauvia (Asteraceae)  ap. 329-351.  aThe elaboration of a comprehensive database about the distribution of the South American genus Nassauvia has allowed investigate its conservation biogeography. The combined use of historical (Dispersal Vicariance Analysis) and ecological (UPGMA) biogeographical approaches has led to detecting past, present and future critical areas in the evolution and persistence of the genus. According to the size of distribution areas, number of locations, environmental niche models, and predicted shifts of these spatial characteristics following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change forecasts for the next decade, it has been possible to award the level of global and national risk for all species of the genus and assign their corresponding IUCN categories. Severe gaps in legal and in situ conservation policies have been detected within the region, making it urgent the adoption of measures aimed at preventing the extinction of the most endangered species. We identify a future dramatic loss of Nassauvia species in the Andes and conversely a species increase in Patagonia. Patagonia has emerged as the cradle of the genus and could be its refuge in the future according the predictions targeted by climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNassauvia 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3adatabases 3aendangered species 3aextinction 3ain situ conservation 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aprediction 3arisk 3aAndes region 3aArgentina1 aDraper, David1 aApodaca, María José,1 aVitali, Maira S.1 aPataro, Luciano1 aKatinas, Liliana1 aMoreno Saiz, Juan Carlos0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2017 Feb., v. 26, no. 2 p.329-351dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-016-1245-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245013400173300001600307520114500323592002801468650002901496650001701525650001001542650001501552650001101567650002101578650001101599650002201610650001101632650002201643650001001665650002301675651001201698700003501710700002201745700001901767700002401786773010901810856008101919852000902000655001202009IND60574142720221117051328.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057414272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-016-1252-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŽuna Pfeiffer, Tanja10aEffectiveness of mowing for the flora diversity preservation: a case study of steppe-like grassland in Croatia (NATURA 2000 site)  ap. 439-460.  aIntensive human activities have resulted in a critical reduction of grasslands in Croatia, one of the richest Europian countries in terms of biodiversity. Sub-Pannonic steppic grasslands are very rare, only few occur in the continental part of Croatia and most of them are protected as NATURA 2000 sites. We studied vascular flora of the Sub-Pannonic stepic grassland with the aim to examine the changes in plant communities 15 years from the mowing application. Results showed that hand mowing once per year at the end of vegetation season increased the species diversity as well as the number of medium and low growth taxa. The critically endangered, nearly threatened and vulnerable species remained preserved. The occurrence of trees, shrubs and invasive species as a consequence of succession and anthropogenic influences could be important threat for steppe-like grassland flora. From a conservation point of view infrequent mowing regime could be an effective management tool, although it needs to be adapted to regional and local circumstances for maintaining high biodiversity of steppe-like grasslands and valuable plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acase studies 3aflora 3agrasslands 3ahumans 3ainvasive species 3amowing 3aplant communities 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3avulnerable species 3aCroatia1 aŠpoljarić Maronić, Dubravka1 aZahirović, Vanda1 aStević, Filip1 aMihaljević, Melita0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2017 Feb., v. 26, no. 2 p.439-460dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-016-1252-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03568naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245016100170300001800331520186200349592002802211596002202239650004402261650001902305650000902324650002602333650001802359650000902377650001102386650001702397650001602414650001802430650002502448650000902473650002702482650003902509650002502548650002002573650002502593650001602618650001502634650002002649650002202669650001602691700001902707700002202726700006302748773013502811856008302946852000903029655001203038IND60656462720221118123937.0191003e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065646272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-019-00152-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoşkun, Özgenur10aInfluence of extraction conditions on structural and functional characteristics of black cumin protein concentrates and ACE-inhibition in their hydrolyzates  ap. 2328-2338.  aCold press oils are value-added food ingredients that are increasingly produced. Due to the removal of oil, protein content in cold press deoiled meals substantially increase. Here, we made an attempt to manufacture protein concentrates from cold press meals of black cumin and studied the influence of aqueous (alkali extraction-isoelectric precipitation, AE-IP) and organic (n-hexane) extraction conditions on the structure and functionality of these concentrates. To determine the basic structural attributes, SDS-PAGE and 2D-electrophoresis, DSC, rheological and FT-IR analysis were utilized. Black cumin proteins contained both α- and β-secondary structural elements, and the proteins were potentially glycosylated. This in turn affected their gel-like behavior prior to heating. The presence of a number of high pI proteins was also detected via 2D-electrophoresis. Functional characteristics of the concentrates were investigated based on solubility, water and oil holding capacities, and dynamic surface tension analysis. Deoiled meals contained 22.3% oil, which was only slightly affected by aqueous extraction. Protein content in the meals was approx. 26.5% which increased to 57.7 and 65.8%, after aqueous (AE-IP) extraction and both aqueous (AE-IP) and hexane extraction, respectively. Solubility, WHC, OHC were found to be improved by hexane extraction. Based on DSC analysis, presence of black cumin oil in the concentrates enhanced the thermal stability of the proteins, while black cumin proteins demonstrated considerable surface activity at the air–water interface. Finally upon enyzmatic proteolysis, protein hydrolyzates demonstrated slight angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity. Based on the current findings, deoiled black cumin meals represent a viable source of biologically and technically functional proteins.  aPublisher supplied data  a115O569cTUBİTAK 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aNigella sativa 3acold 3afunctional properties 3aglycosylation 3aheat 3ahexane 3ahydrolysates 3aingredients 3alipid content 3aliquid-air interface 3aoils 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein concentrates 3aprotein content 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aproteolysis 3asolubility 3asurface tension 3athermal stability 3avalue added1 aÇakır, Bilal1 aVahapoğlu, Beyza1 aGülseren, İbrahim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7339-11590 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2019 Sept., v. 13, no. 3 p.2328-2338dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-019-00152-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012000169300001400289520144700303592002801750650001001778650002401788650002301812650001501835650002701850650002301877650001201900650001301912650001901925650001901944650001101963650002201974650001701996650001402013650001602027650000902043650001202052653001902064653001202083653001302095653002002108653002302128700001502151700001602166700001602182700005902198700001802257773010202275856008602377852000902463655001202472IND60646211220221119185401.0190719e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064621122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Weidong10aUptake and accumulation of cadmium in flooded versus non-flooded Salix genotypes: Implications for phytoremediation  ap. 79-88.  aThe willow (Salix spp.) is a promising candidate coping with global climate warming and environment pollution. In this study, differences in plant growth, Cd uptake and accumulation, and extractable Cd in the rhizosphere between flooded and non-flooded (well-drained) Salix genotypes were investigated using a pot experiment in the rainshelt. All Salix genotypes grew well under well-drained conditions. In contrast, the flooded Salix genotypes developed hypertrophied lenticels, adventitious roots and aerenchyma, and decreased aboveground biomass production compared with the corresponding non-flooded genotypes, varying with genotypes and Cd levels in the medium. The non-flooded Salix genotypes had high Cd accumulation in aerial tissues with high leaf Cd bioconcentration factors (BCF) and translocation factors (TFs) relative to genotypes, displaying good Cd phytoextraction potentials. The flooded Salix genotypes dramatically decreased Cd accumulation in aerial tissues with low Cd BCFs and TFs, and large amounts of Cd accumulated in roots compared to the non-flooded genotypes, showing Cd phytostabilization traits. The extractable Cd in rhizosphere changed with genotypes and treatments, and comparatively, EDTA-extractable Cd could reflect well Cd phytoavailability to the willows in the soil. It was concluded that flooding tended to shift from phytoextraction to phytostabilization for Cd by willows during whole growing season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalix 3aaboveground biomass 3aadventitious roots 3aaerenchyma 3abioaccumulation factor 3abiomass production 3acadmium 3agenotype 3aglobal warming 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3aphytoaccumulation 3aplant growth 3apollution 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3awillows 0aSalix genotype 0aCadmium 0aFlooding 0aPhytoextraction 0aPhytostabilization1 aYang, Yang1 aDing, Zheli1 aYang, Xiaoe1 aZhao, Fengliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1309-58761 aZhu, Zhiqiang0 tEcological engineering.g2019 Oct., v. 136 p.79-88dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03433naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016600165300001800331520161000349592002801959596007701987650002202064650001502086650001302101650001602114650001502130650001202145650001102157650001602168650002702184650002102211650001002232650001802242650000902260650001402269650001402283650001302297650001402310650002002324650000902344650001402353650001802367650001002385650001102395650001202406650002102418650002802439650001302467650002302480650001702503650000902520700002002529700001302549700001802562773013502580856008302715852000902798655001202807IND60656463220221118123954.0191003e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065646322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-019-00155-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarrar, Emad10aGurum (Citrullus lanatus var.

Colocynthoide) seed was evaluated for lipid, amino acid, mineral, proximate, sugar, vitamin composition, volatile compound and functional characteristics in seeking to identify nutritious plant containing a higher amount of nutrients that can be employed in food related industries. The gurum seed was found to be rich in fat (33.05%), crude fiber (26.42%), protein (18.55%), carbohydrates (14.41%), and ash (3.40%) and it has sufficient amino acids content. The gurum seed was found to have a higher content of minerals with potassium 2116.83 mg/100 g among highest followed by sodium 461.23 mg/100 g and magnesium 405.63 mg/100 g. Calcium, zinc, iron, copper and manganese are also present in a significant amount. Gurum seeds could be used as an affluent source of vitamins, mainly B6 and B9 with the amounts of 11.37 and 9.24 mg/100 g respectively, while sucrose constituted 41.5% of the all sugars. Oil of gurum seed has an altitude amount of unsaturated fatty acids, with C18:2 and C18:1 as the major acids, whereas, triglycerides as a major component of lipid classes. The gurum seed showed water absorption 3.46 mL /g and oil absorption 2.39 mL/g. The foaming capacity, stability of foam and emulsifying capacity were 18.5%, 16.55%, and 44.2%, respectively. 49 volatile compounds from the extract of gurum seeds were identified; with organic acids as a prime component. This study has shown the potentials of gurum seed, a by-product with a high nutritional value to provide sufficient economic resourceful raw material alternative to food industrial firms.  aPublisher supplied data  aBY2016022-33cScience and Technology Support Program of Jiangsu Province 3aCitrullus lanatus 3aabsorption 3aaltitude 3aamino acids 3abyproducts 3acalcium 3acopper 3acrude fiber 3aemulsifying properties 3afoaming capacity 3afoams 3afood industry 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aminerals 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3aoils 3apotassium 3araw materials 3aseeds 3asodium 3asucrose 3atriacylglycerols 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3avitamins 3avolatile compounds 3awater uptake 3azinc1 aSheth, Sujitraj1 aWei, Wei1 aWang, Xingguo0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2019 Sept., v. 13, no. 3 p.2357-2366dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-019-00155-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005500165300001600220520103400236592002801270650001401298650001601312650001701328650002401345650001501369650001501384650000901399650002001408650001101428651002001439700002001459700002001479700001901499700001801518700002201536700002001558773009401578856008101672852000901753655001201762IND60574143620221117052249.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057414362DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078160700952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsipov, V.

According to the statistical data of the International Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (www.cred.be), earthquakes are among the leaders in all aspects: the number of fatalities, the number of injured, and the caused economic loss. The widely accepted strategy for reducing the damage and social losses implies preventive measures in high-risk zones identified by mapping with different details. About 5% of RF territory is referred to the areas characterized by a high level of seismic hazard, where earthquakes with intensities I = 8–9 and 9–10 by the MMSK-86 scale may occur. The Caucasus is among the most hazardous and densely populated regions in the country. During the preparation to the 2014 Olympic Games, the individual seismic risk was assessed for the Greater Sochi territory including the Olympic sites. The paper analyzes the results of seismic risk monitoring, obtained in 2007 and 2013.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisasters 3aearthquakes 3aepidemiology 3afinancial economics 3ageophysics 3amonitoring 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asports 3aCaucasus region1 aLarionov, V.

The analysis was carried out using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a photodiode array detector and mass spectrometry. Although the findings revealed similar anthocyanin profiles in seeds of the eight landraces tested, the relative concentrations of the individual anthocyanin compounds showed marked variations. Delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and peonidin-3-O-glucoside were the most abundant anthocyanins, with concentrations ranging between 21.4–239.0, 23.6–130.6 and 21.4–135.4 µg/g of dry seed, respectively in seeds of the test landraces, while total anthocyanins ranged between 95 and 505 µg/g of dry seed. The preponderance of delphinidin 3-O-glucoside was observed in the black and brown mottled seeds. This study is the first report regarding the profile and concentrations of anthocyanins in Kersting’s groundnut and suggests that the seeds of this underutilized grain legume can potentially be exploited as a natural source of anthocyanins for the development of cosmetic, food and pharmaceutical products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrotyloma geocarpum 3aanthocyanins 3adelphinidin 3adrugs 3alandraces 3amass spectrometry 3apeanuts 3apigmentation 3aseed coat 3aseeds 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aMohammed, Mustapha1 aNdibewu, Peter P.1 aDakora, Felix D.0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2019 Sept., v. 13, no. 3 p.2310-2317dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-019-00150-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013300165300001600298520128800314592002801602650001901630650002301649650001701672650002901689650002201718650000901740650001401749650001801763650002401781650001501805650001801820650001801838650001601856650002801872651001201900651001401912651001101926700004301937700001801980700002201998700001902020773009402039856008102133852000902214655001202223IND60574144520221117052200.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057414452DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078160700462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaplan, E.

For this purpose low fat, light, reduced fat and full fat ice creams were produced using 2, 5, 7.5 and 10% milk fat respectively. According to the results, reduction of fat in ice cream contributed to a significant decrease in total solid (TS) and caloric value of the samples and increased their protein content and pH value significantly (p < 0.05). The QDA of sensory properties demonstrated that the decreased fat samples had lower viscosity, mouth coating, smoothness and firmness and higher melting rate and coldness sensations in comparison with the full fat ice cream. PCA technique was used to simplify discussion of the obtained results. Two principal components (PC) named as PC1 and PC2 described a total of 96.12% of the variation of the initial variables. PC1 was primarily related to the values of coldness, viscosity, mouth coating, smoothness, firmness, melting rate, overall acceptance, pH, TS, protein and calorie; while PC2 was related to the acidity of the samples. Distribution pattern of the studied attributes showed that the melting rate and coldness sensation discovered in opposite quadrants of other sensory attributes; while, close relations were observed between the smoothness and TS, viscosity and mouth coating and also between the pH value, protein content and melting rate of the ice cream. A comparison between the correlation results of the fat content with the sensory attributes showed that the viscosity of the ice cream samples was more dramatically affected by the fat reduction. Therefore, it is suggested to use a type of fat replacer which can effectively improve the viscosity of low fat ice cream products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acoatings 3afat replacers 3afirmness 3alipid content 3alow fat ice cream 3amelting 3amilk fat 3amouth 3apH 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprotein content 3asensation 3asensory properties 3aviscosity0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2019 Sept., v. 13, no. 3 p.2417-2425dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-019-00162-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01249naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010800169300001300277500002200290520017700312592002800489650001600517650001600533650002000549650001300569650001600582700002500598700001900623700001900642700002300661773013500684856008300819852000900902655001200911IND60656465320221118123802.0191003e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065646532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-019-00237-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrassia, Melania10aCorrection to: Polyphenols, methylxanthines, fatty acids and minerals in cocoa beans and cocoa products  ap. 1729.  aPublished Erratum  aThe original version of the article unfortunately contained error in author group.

Plant functional traits in seven ontogenetic stages, following complete trajectories, of a tropical light-demanding evergreen medicinal treelet (Rauvolfia vomitoria Afzel.) were examined in a common garden experiment in the field. The highly plastic morph-physiological and potential defense traits showed complex and nonlinear variations with increasing tree height (age), revealing a mostly clear-defined transition at reproductive onset. Leaf photosynthetic rate varied in a unimodal pattern throughout ontogeny, with the highest value occurring at reproductive onset. Except for the oldest plants, priority of resource use in leaves across ontogeny shifted to enhance photosynthetic rate, photosynthetic N and P use efficiencies, and prevention of physical damage (higher leaf thickness, leaf mass per area and lignin concentration), but to decrease carbon-based chemical defense (i.e., total phenolics). Fine root phenolics were relatively stable, but lignin concentration increased throughout ontogeny. With higher levels than fine roots and aboveground parts, the concentrations of an indole alkaloid (i.e. reserpine) increased steadily in coarse roots, especially during the reproductive stages. Whereas, tree growth progressively shifted from the demand of N relative to P, based on the indirect evidence from N:P stoichiometry. Our results demonstrated that, under the conditions of no environmental interference, the pronounced trajectories in functional traits were observed throughout the life cycle of R. vomitoria plants due to strong ontogeny-induced shifts in resource allocation. The synergies or tradeoffs of the defense syndromes differed between and within the classes of defense (i.e., physical versus chemical), and also, between and within above- and below-ground tissues across the ontogenetic developmental stages, which could probably be explained by multiple defense hypotheses. The revealed variations of the growth traits and secondary metabolites of R. vomitoria plants at different developmental stages will be helpful for maximizing the reserpine yield through the suitable cultivation practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRauvolfia vomitoria 3aaerial parts 3achemical defenses 3adevelopmental stages 3afine roots 3agrowth traits 3aleaf mass 3aleaves 3alignin 3anutrient use efficiency 3aontogeny 3aphenolic compounds 3aphotosynthesis 3areproduction 3areserpine 3aresource allocation 3asecondary metabolites 3astoichiometry 3atissues 3atree growth 3atree height 0aDefense syndromes 0aFunctional traits 0aPlant ontogeny 0aReproductive stages1 aCai, Z.Q.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1988-17040 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 Oct. 05, v. 138 p.111450-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245012000183520107700303592002801380650003401408650002401442650002501466650001901491650001701510650001601527650001501543650001301558650001601571650000901587650001901596650001501615650002101630650002601651653001001677653000901687653000901696653000801705653000801713653002801721653002701749653001501776700002901791700007101820700002001891700001901911700001801930773011701948856008602065852000902151655001202160IND60646213220221118062800.0190617e20191005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064621322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNizioł-Łukaszewska, Zofia10aBiochemical properties, UV-protecting and fibroblast growth-stimulating activity of Plantago lanceolata L. extracts  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the biological properties, i.e. qualitative and quantitative characteristics of phenolic and flavonoid compounds, DPPH and ABTS+ scavenging and Fe2+ chelating activity, and the UV-protecting and cytotoxicity properties of Plantago lanceolata extracts. The assays included different extracts: aqueous (A), ethanolic 96% (E), aqueous-glycerine (GLC), and aqueous-glycol (GLY) extracts at the ratio of 1:4. The most powerful antioxidant properties were shown by the GLY and GLC extracts. The use of glycol and glycerine allowed isolation of caffeic, synaptic, and salicylic acid derivates. The cytotoxicity assay showed that the A and GLC extracts could potentially be used in cosmetic products even at high concentrations without impairing the viability of cells. The study showed that Plantago lanceolata extracts are potential new multifunctional ingredients of cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Moreover, the extracts have the ability to absorb UV radiation, which makes them potential components of natural sunscreen cosmetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aPlantago lanceolata 3aantioxidant activity 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3afibroblasts 3aflavonoids 3aglycerol 3aingredients 3airon 3asalicylic acid 3asunscreens 3atoxicity testing 3aultraviolet radiation 0aABTS+ 0aDPPH 0aEMEM 0aFBS 0aGAC 0aFree radical scavenging 0aUV-protecting activity 0aAnti-aging1 aGaweł-Bęben, Katarzyna1 aRybczyńska-Tkaczyk, Kamila1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2100-13151 aJakubczyk, Anna1 aKaraś, Monika1 aBujak, Tomasz0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 Oct. 05, v. 138 p.111453-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006500151245012200216520172600338592002802064650002102092650001302113650002502126650001002151650001702161650001402178650001502192650003202207650002302239650002602262650002202288650001302310650001302323650001402336650003202350650001602382650001002398650002002408650002602428653002302454653001902477653001802496700002302514700002302537773011702560856008602677852000902763655001202772IND60646213720221118062856.0190617e20191005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064621372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakovljević, Dragana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9436-076510aNutrient limitation as a tool for the induction of secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity in basil cultivars  aSweet basil (Ocimum spp.) is an important source of secondary metabolites with a significant diversity of polyphenolic compounds. In order to investigate possibilities of induced synthesis of secondary metabolites under conditions of limited nutrition, four basil cultivars (‘Small leaved’, ‘Genovese’, ‘Dark Opal’ and ‘Lemon basil’) were exposed to different levels of mineral nutrition (high, medium and low) with two forms of nitrogen (nitrate alone or in combination with ammonium) and under controlled conditions. Nutrient limitation effects have been assessed on lipid peroxidation, the activity of phenylalanine ammonium lyase (PAL), total phenolic content, flavonoid concentration, and total antioxidant activity together with LC-DAD-MS/MS analysis of main phenolic acids in different plant parts. After one month of prolonged nutrient limitation results clearly indicate induced synthesis of assessed metabolites, together with lower lipid peroxidation, higher PAL activity, and prominent antioxidant activity. The results are also cultivar and nutrient specific. The highest content of phenolic compounds (particularly caffeic acid – 1.45 mg g−1 DW) and the highest antioxidant activity (IC50 = 22.36 μg ml−1) was in extracts from ‘Small leaved’ basil roots, whereas the highest concentration of rosmarinic acid (61.2 mg g−1 DW) was in extracts from ‘Genovese’ basil roots, both under the condition of nutrient limitation. This study provided a novel approach for the higher metabolite production with uniformity of cultivation conditions and lower content of mineral nutrition applied and pointed out to basil roots as a viable source of metabolites of interests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcimum basilicum 3aammonium 3aantioxidant activity 3abasil 3acaffeic acid 3acultivars 3aflavonoids 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alipid peroxidation 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3apolyphenols 3aroots 3arosmarinic acid 3asecondary metabolites 0aMineral deficiency 0aAbiotic stress 0aPhenolic acid1 aTopuzović, Marina1 aStanković, Milan,0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 Oct. 05, v. 138 p.111462-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013300166300001600299520114000315592002801455596010201483650003401585650002301619650001701642650002301659650001201682650001401694650001801708650001101726650001701737651001001754700001401764700001501778700001801793700001401811700001701825700001401842700001701856773013201873856008102005852000902086655001202095IND60656466620221118123421.0190814e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065646662DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-018-1012-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ya-Juan10aCharacterization of the complete plastid genome sequence of eleutherococcus brachypus (araliaceae), an endangered shrub in China  ap. 295-297.  aEleutherococcus brachypus: (Harms) Nakai (Araliaceae) is an endangered shrub that it is endemic to western China. In this study, we characterized the complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast (cp) genome in E. brachypus. The total length of the cp genome was 156,981 bp, including a large single copy (LSC) region of 86,921 bp, a small single copy (SSC) region of 18,184 bp, and a pair of inverted repeats (IRs) comprising 25,938 bp. The cp genome of E. brachypus contained 114 genes, including 80 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNA genes, and four rRNA genes. In total, 15 genes comprising tRNA-Lys (UUU), tRNA-Gly (UCC), tRNA-Leu (UAA), tRNA-Val (UAC), tRNA-Ile (GAU), tRNA-Ala (UGC), rps16, atpF, rpoC1, petB, petD, rps16, rpl2, ndhB, and ndhA contained a single intron, and three genes contained two introns, i.e., ycf3, clpP, and rps12. The GC contents of the whole cp genome, LSC region, SSC region, and IR region were 38.0, 36.2, 32.0, and 43.0% respectively, which are similar to those in other Araliaceae plants. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that E. brachypus has a close relationship with congeneric E. gracilistylus.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017A-085cThe Scientific Research Project of the Higher Education Institutions of Gansu Province 3aEleutherococcus gracilistylus 3achloroplast genome 3achloroplasts 3aendangered species 3aintrons 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3ashrubs 3atransfer RNA 3aChina1 aGao, Hong1 aChen, Yuan1 aGuo, Feng-Xia1 aBai, Gang1 aGuo, You-Yan1 aYan, Fang1 aWang, En-Jun0 tConservation genetics resources.g2019 Sept., v. 11, no. 3 p.295-297dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000001672x1877-72527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12686-018-1012-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245010600204300001600310520098000326592002801306596005901334650002101393650002301414650001701437650002301454650001301477650002501490650001401515650001601529650001801545650002501563650001701588650001001605651001001615700001501625700001801640700001601658700001601674700001301690700001701703700001601720773013201736856008101868852000901949655001201958IND60656467520221118123358.0190814e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065646752DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-018-1004-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Xiaolong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4251-584110aComplete chloroplast genome of Cinnamomum japonicum (Laurales: Lauraceae), an endangered tree species  ap. 267-269.  aCinnamomum japonicum, belonging to family Lauraceae, is an endangered species in China. Here, the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of C. japonicum was de novo assembled using Illumina sequencing data for the first time.

It is found that peaks in the disease occurrence are related to the warm and humid weather conditions. Bioclimatic models of the needle cast ranges have been built using the climate variables; the spatial dynamics of the disease occurrence have been projected under various scenarios of climate warming over the 21st century. Model experiments have shown that the needle cast disease would shift northwards into the new regions in Krasnoyarsk krai, where the phytopathogen has not yet been registered in the nurseries. The largest forest areas exposed to needle cast disease are predicted to be at a high risk of outbreaks by 2020 under moderate climate warming. With a significant warming trend by 2080, potential risk areas will be reduced, because the pine expansion into the permafrost zone should be limited by slow thawing of its active layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLophodermium 3aPinus sylvestris 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimatic factors 3adisease occurrence 3aforests 3afungi 3aglobal warming 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3apermafrost 3aplant pathogens 3aprovenance 3arisk 3atemperature 3athawing 3aSiberia1 aKuzmina, N.

A simple method involving methanol extraction of CGM powder followed by basification and ether extraction was developed to isolate the triterpenic fraction including OA. The triterpenic fraction was chromatographed on a Phenomenex Gemini C₁₈ column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) under a simple gradient elution of a mobile phase containing acetonitrile and water at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min⁻¹. The detection wavelength was set at 210 nm. Good linearity was achieved in the range of 100.0–1000.0 μg mL⁻¹ with r² > 0.9993, and the limit of quantification was 32.22 μg mL⁻¹. Accuracy measured at three concentration levels was in the range of 93.72–99.56%, while intra-day and inter-day precisions estimated using both OA standard and CGM samples were no more than 2.83 and 4.57% RSD, respectively. Finally, this method was applied to real CGM samples from various batches, revealing that the OA contents were between 88.13 and 100.83 μg mg⁻¹. These results suggest that the current method can be applied as an efficient analytical method for quality control of CGM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amethanol 3aquality control 3awavelengths1 aZhao, Jing1 aJeong, Kyung Min1 aYoo, Da Eun1 aHan, Se Young1 aChoi, Su-Young1 aKo, Dong-Hyeon1 aKim, Hyun-ji1 aSung, Na-Hye1 aLee, Jeongmi0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2017 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.49-56dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-016-0853-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01784naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012600167300001400293520081800307592002801125650001601153650002101169650001301190650002101203650001201224650001401236650002301250773011901273856008101392852000901473655001201482IND60574147820221117052216.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057414782DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-016-0866-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Kyung-Lae10aEmergence of hydrogen bonds from molecular dynamics simulation of substituted N-phenylthiourea–catechol oxidase complex  ap. 57-68.  aA series of N-phenylthiourea derivatives was built starting from the X-ray structure in the molecular mechanics framework and the interaction profile in the complex with the catechol oxidase was traced using molecular dynamics simulation.

Elevated tritium, radiocarbon, Hg, and volatile organic compounds associated with low‐level radioactive waste (LLRW) at the USGS Amargosa Desert Research Site (ADRS) have stimulated research on factors and processes that affect contaminant gas distribution and transport. Consequently, we examined the sources, mixing, and biogeochemistry of CO₂ and CH₄, two additional important species in the unsaturated zone at ADRS. In spring 2015 and 2016, shallow unsaturated zone gas samples were collected from the 1.5‐m depth both inside and outside the LLRW disposal area. Samples also were collected from two 110‐m‐deep multilevel gas‐sampling boreholes and a distant background site. These samples were analyzed for CO₂ mole fraction (xCO₂) and C isotopic composition (δ¹³C‐CO₂) and CH₄ mole fraction (xCH₄). Graphical analysis of the results indicates mixing of CO₂ characteristic of the root zone (δ¹³C −18 to −19‰), deep soil gas of the capillary fringe (−13 to −15‰), and CO₂ produced by microbial respiration of organic matter disposed in the LLRW trenches (−22 to −25‰). Distribution of CH₄ overall reflects atmospheric sources and production in anaerobic microzones in the LLRW area and methanotrophy in the undisturbed shallow subsurface outside the LLRW area. Although xCH₄ reflecting lateral transport from the LLRW area is decreasing with time in the deep profiles, deep unsaturated zone xCO₂ has changed little in recent decades. The results imply that CH₄ and δ¹³C‐CO₂ may serve as good tracers of anthropogenic effects in the unsaturated zone even when CO₂ primarily reflects natural processes.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSGS Toxic Substances Hydrology Program  cUSGS National Research Program  cUSGS Nevada Water Science Center 3aarid zones 3abiogeochemistry 3acapillary fringe 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon radioisotopes 3aorganic matter 3aradioactive waste 3arhizosphere 3asoil air 3aspring 3atritium 3avadose zone 3avolatile organic compounds 3awaste disposal sites1 aWalvoord, M.A.1 aThomas, R.B.1 aGreen, C.T.1 aBaker, R.J.1 aThordsen, J.J.1 aStonestrom, D.A.1 aAndraski, B.J.0 tVadose zone journal.g2018, v. 17, no. 1 p.1-11dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2017.11.02003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle06070naa a2201525 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245009500159300001300254500002000267500000900287520224200296592002802538650001002566650001502576650001402591650001802605650002502623650002102648650002002669650001302689650001502702650001602717650001902733650000902752650001102761650001202772650002802784650001602812650002102828651001002849651000902859651001002868651001202878700001502890700001602905700002202921700001902943700001602962700001502978700001602993700001703009700001903026700001103045700001603056700001803072700002003090700001703110700001603127700001503143700001603158700001803174700001503192700001503207700001703222700002003239700001603259700001403275700001403289700001803303700002003321700001903341700001603360700001703376700001703393700001603410700001503426700001703441700001603458700002303474700001603497700002203513700001503535700001503550700001803565700001703583700001503600700001403615700001703629700001703646700002003663700001503683700001403698700001903712700001503731700001103746700001403757700001803771700001403789700001403803700001503817700001503832700001903847700001603866700001503882700001603897700001503913700001603928700001703944700001103961700001503972700001703987700001204004700001504016700001404031700001404045700001604059700001404075700002104089700001904110700001804129700001504147700001404162700001704176700001804193700001504211700001604226700001504242700002304257700001604280700001504296773013204311856008004443852000904523655001204532IND60671889920221120025702.0220819s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067188992DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2018.03.00622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalle, S.10aAMMA‐CATCH, a Critical Zone Observatory in West Africa Monitoring a Region in Transition  ap. 1-24.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: AMMA‐CATCH is a long‐term critical zone observatory in West Africa. Four sites sample the sharp ecoclimatic gradient characteristic of this region. Combined measurements of meteorology, water, and vegetation dynamics began in 1990. Intensification of rainfall and hydrological cycles is observed. The strong overall re‐greening may hide contrasted changes. West Africa is a region in fast transition from climate, demography, and land use perspectives. In this context, the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA)–Couplage de l'Atmosphère Tropicale et du Cycle eco‐Hydrologique (CATCH) long‐term regional observatory was developed to monitor the impacts of global change on the critical zone of West Africa and to better understand its current and future dynamics. The observatory is organized into three thematic axes, which drive the observation and instrumentation strategy: (i) analyze the long‐term evolution of eco‐hydrosystems from a regional perspective; (ii) better understand critical zone processes and their variability; and (iii) meet socioeconomic and development needs. To achieve these goals, the observatory has gathered data since 1990 from four densely instrumented mesoscale sites (∼10⁴ km² each), located at different latitudes (Benin, Niger, Mali, and Senegal) so as to sample the sharp eco‐climatic gradient that is characteristic of the region. Simultaneous monitoring of the vegetation cover and of various components of the water balance at these four sites has provided new insights into the seemingly paradoxical eco‐hydrological changes observed in the Sahel during the last decades: groundwater recharge and/or runoff intensification despite rainfall deficit and subsequent re‐greening with still increasing runoff. Hydrological processes and the role of certain key landscape features are highlighted, as well as the importance of an appropriate description of soil and subsoil characteristics. Applications of these scientific results for sustainable development issues are proposed. Finally, detecting and attributing eco‐hydrological changes and identifying possible regime shifts in the hydrologic cycle are the next challenges that need to be faced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSahel 3ademography 3aevolution 3aglobal change 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydrologic cycle 3ainstrumentation 3aland use 3alandscapes 3ameteorology 3amonsoon season 3arain 3arunoff 3asubsoil 3asustainable development 3avadose zone 3avegetation cover 3aBenin 3aMali 3aNiger 3aSenegal1 aGrippa, M.1 aPeugeot, C.1 aMoussa, I.

We studied AEs during loading–unloading–reloading cycles under confined compression. The number of AE hits reflected well the soil deformation regimes. Soil compression and swelling indices correlate with AE parameters. The Gutenberg–Richter power law b value varied with wet soil yield stress. Application of mechanical stresses to soil results in deformation, microfracturing, particle motion, and liquid reconfiguration that may release measurable amounts of stored elastic energy in the form of acoustic emissions (AEs). This study aimed to systematically study AE characteristics during confined uniaxial compression of soil samples and link various AE parameters to soil deformation regimes. We hypothesized that variations in AE characteristics could offer new insights into the transition between elastic and plastic soil deformation and noninvasively identify the onset of yield stress. We subjected soil samples at known water contents to a loading–unloading–reloading cycle under uniaxial compression using an oedometer coupled with an AE monitoring system. The soil was a sandy loam equilibrated with two initial gravimetric water contents (12 and 25%) and two initial bulk densities (1.3 and 1.55 Mg m⁻³) for each water content. Observed AE event numbers (hits) and their energy content (E) varied during stress application to soil samples. Close agreement was found between soil yield stress deduced from normalized cumulative AE parameters and measured stress–void ratio curves (precompression stress, σₚc) for the dry soil; however, the yield stress deduced from AE parameters was significantly larger than σₚc for the wet soil. Swelling and compression indices were strongly correlated to AE hits and E, respectively. The preliminary results illustrate the potential of monitoring passive AE during load application to characterize soil mechanical parameters (potentially in situ). Nevertheless, additional studies with controlled pore water pressure and a range of soil types would be required to generalize these findings to offer a robust AE‐based method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3adeformation 3aenergy 3aenergy content 3aliquids 3asandy loam soils 3asoil compaction 3asoil treatment 3avadose zone 3awater content1 aBahrami, Mostafa1 aKeller, Thomas1 aOr, Dani0 tVadose zone journal.g2017 July, v. 16, no. 7 p.1-12dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2017.02.00493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245011900132300001400251506002800265520108600293592002801379506003701407650001501444650002501459650002001484653001401504653002201518653001201540653001201552773014001564852000901704655001201713IND60785419320221207113503.0170908e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078541932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFierascu, Petia10aOn quality in the preuniversity education - a prerequisite for improving the quality of life of future generations  ap. 93-97.  aResource is Open Access  aRegarding „Quality in education”, respectively about ARACIP a lot of misconceptions are circulating: that entangles the educational process, that is „form without substance”, „it buries us in papers” (opinions of teachers, school managers and, sometimes, local representatives).

One group (10 rats) received the musical stimuli before (‘B’), another during (‘D’) and the third before and during (‘BD’) the memory test, while the ten control (‘C’) animals were kept in silence. The animals’ spatial learning and memory ability was tested in an 8-arm radial maze. Rats exposed to the music showed a significant (7.1%) improvement in task acquisition (Group BD), but it did not practically change in Group D and worsened by 10.5% in Group B. The 2-h working memory significantly improved by 12.1% (BD) while practically did not change in Groups B and D. The reference memory improved by 11.9% in Group BD, but did not change in Group B and D, compared to the Control. The performance of the groups during the 4-h working memory test did not differ significantly. During the long-term test period the spatial memory performance of the music-exposed rats did not show significant differences compared to the Control (Table 1). At the same time, most results obtained in the long-term period were better than the corresponding short-term data. In conclusion, this particular piece of music, falling within the rats’ hearing range, was suitable for improving hippocampus-dependent spatial learning capacity, but only if the animals were exposed to it not only before but also during the task.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3ahearing 3ahumans 3amales 3amemory 3amusic 3arats 0aAccelerated music 0aRat 0aSpatial learning 0aMemory1 aHorváth, Krisztina,1 aLukács, Anita1 aVezér, Tünde1 aGlávits, Róbert1 aFodor, Kinga1 aFekete, Sándor György0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2018 May, v. 202 p.94-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2018.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245007800167300001600245500000900261520147900270592002801749650002201777650001001799650000901809650001601818650000901834650001401843650001101857650001501868650002201883650001301905650001201918650001101930650001601941650001701957650001601974650001101990651001202001700002302013773011702036856007702153852000902230655001202239IND60671891520221122004721.0191126e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067189152DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2004.00742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenbom, Annette E.10aInfrared Thermography and Fracture Analysis of Preferential Flow in Chalk  ap. 271-280.  aepub  aPreferential flow in fractured Cretaceous chalk has been investigated using infrared thermography (IRT) in a quarry in Denmark. Fracture mapping along the vertical quarry walls shows numerous horizontal fractures and four sets of vertical fractures respectively striking 25°, 60°, 145°, and 175°. Water flows out of the exposed walls mainly through fractures and to a minor extent by seepage through the matrix. To clarify which of the five fracture systems are hydraulically active, the exposure has been investigated using IRT. By making use of the contrast between the constant temperature of groundwater and the temperature of the exposed wall on a cold winter and a hot summer day, zones of groundwater discharge have been delineated. The results of the IRT suggest that the vertical shear fractures are the main hydraulically active conduits. Furthermore, the horizontal fractures are more hydraulically active in areas where they intersect a vertical stained fracture or in association with some flint layers. Stains of Fe³⁺ and Mn were observed primarily in fractures with a strike of approximately 25° and 175°, suggesting that the water flows preferentially in these fracture sets. The possible influence of the regional setting on the flow pattern is considered. The results suggest that the combined use of detailed fracture analysis and IRT is a valuable method for providing the input data required for both modeling and monitoring of fractured media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCretaceous period 3achalk 3acold 3agroundwater 3airon 3amanganese 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apreferential flow 3aquarries 3aseepage 3asummer 3atemperature 3athermography 3avadose zone 3awinter 3aDenmark1 aJakobsen, Peter R.0 tVadose zone journal.g2005 May, v. 4, no. 2 p.271-280dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2004.00743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01188naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245011200164506002800276520022300304592002800527506003700555650002100592650001900613651001200632700002000644700001800664773012800682856007900810852000900889655001200898IND60785420420221207073913.0190503s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078542042DNAL7 a10.5281/zenodo.25655572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSagaidak, S.І.10aCreation of geographic culture of Pinus sylvestris L. as a bank of species genofund conservation in Ukraine  aResource is Open Access  aOn the basis of available literature and own researches the modern area of Pinus sylvestris L. is shown.

Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in captivity are known to display anticipatory behaviours before feeding sessions, but it is unknown whether they would anticipate non-alimentary events. Furthermore, there is no published information available for any species on whether the level of anticipatory behaviour is predictive of an animal’s actual participation in the following event or reward: answering this question would bring us closer to understanding this behaviour and its related affective states. In this study, we used sound cues to condition dolphins to the arrival of toys in their pool or a positive Human-Animal Interaction (HAI) with a familiar trainer, and measured their anticipatory behaviour before each event. The protocol was validated since the dolphins performed significantly more anticipatory behaviour before the toys and HAI contexts than a control situation, by means of increased frequencies of surface looking and spy hopping. Furthermore, we found that dolphins showed more anticipatory behaviour before the HAI than the toys context (Linear Mixed Model with 1000 permutations, all P < 0.001). In the second part of the investigation, higher anticipatory behaviour before toy provision, HAIs, and feeding sessions was significantly correlated to higher levels of participation in the event itself (measured by time spent with humans/toys, and number of times dolphins left during feeding sessions; LMM with 1000 permutations, respectively: β = 0.216 ± 0.100 SE, P = 0.039; β = 0.274 ± 0.097 SE, P = 0.008; β = −0.169 ± 0.080 SE, P = 0.045). Our results suggest that toys and HAIs were perceived as rewarding events, and we propose that non-food human interactions play an important role in these animals’ lives. We also provide some of the first empirical evidence that anticipatory behaviour is correlated to the level of participation in the following event, supporting anticipatory behaviour as a measure of motivation, and hope that this stimulates further work regarding the use of this behaviour to assess and improve animal welfare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTursiops truncatus 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal welfare 3acaptive animals 3adolphins 3ahuman-animal relations 3ahumans 3amotivation 3astatistical models 3atoys 3atraining (animals) 0aAnimal welfare 0aAnticipatory behaviour 0aBottlenose dolphins 0aEnrichment 0aHuman-animal interactions 0aPositive reinforcement training1 aRödel, Heiko G.1 aBoivin, Xavier1 aDelfour, Fabienne0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2018 May, v. 202 p.85-93dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2018.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009600170300001400266520226500280592002802545650002302573650001402596650001602610650001102626650001202637650000902649650001302658650001002671650001102681653001102692653002302703653001702726653001002743653001802753700002002771700001902791700001802810700002202828700001802850773011402868856008602982852000903068655001203077IND60633005320221121231018.0190318e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063300532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2018.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrei, Daniela10aCan body nosing in artificially reared piglets be reduced by sucking and massaging dummies?  ap. 20-27.  aSelection for hyper-prolific sows has substantially increased litter size. Consequently, the number of piglets in a litter may exceed the number of functional teats. To solve this problem, surplus piglets may be removed from the sow 2 days after birth and raised artificially. However, these piglets show increased levels of oral behaviours, such as belly nosing, directed at other piglets. This behaviour resembles massaging and sucking at the sow’s udder and thus is considered to be redirected suckling behaviour. The present study investigated whether oral behaviour directed at piglets can be reduced in artificially reared piglets by providing them with sucking and massaging dummies. In a two-by-two between-group factorial design, the artificial rearing pens were equipped with one of four treatments: a sucking dummy, a massaging dummy, a combined sucking–massaging dummy, or no dummy. The behaviour of 126 piglets (in 21 groups of 6 piglets) was scored from video by continuous focal observation lasting 90 min per piglet each on days 4 and 18 after introduction to the artificial rearing system. Data were analysed using linear mixed-effects models. Body nosing (composed of belly nosing and nosing on any other body part) increased from day 4 to 18 in all treatments, but piglets provided with a combined sucking–massaging dummy showed the smallest increase. Piglets spent more time nosing the combined dummy than the sucking or the massaging dummy. However, there was no causal inverse relationship between the duration of body nosing and dummy nosing. All but one piglet showed body nosing at least once. Resting, play-fighting, or oral manipulation of piglets (other than body nosing), dummies, and pen equipment were hardly affected by the treatments. Piglets with a combined dummy tended to have a longer average resting bout duration compared with piglets in other treatments. In conclusion, only the combined sucking–massaging dummy was effective in reducing the increase in body nosing over time. However, this reduction was rather small in absolute terms and the combined dummy did not prevent body nosing. The tested dummies were thus not successful in eliminating the redirected oral behaviour in artificially reared piglets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial rearing 3aequipment 3alitter size 3amodels 3apiglets 3asows 3asuckling 3ateats 3audders 0aPiglet 0aArtificial rearing 0aBelly nosing 0aDummy 0aEarly weaning1 aWürbel, Hanno,1 aWechsler, Beat1 aGygax, Lorenz1 aBurla, Joan-Bryce1 aWeber, Roland0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2018 May, v. 202 p.20-27dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2018.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012200160300001400282506002800296520112000324592002801444506003701472650001101509650002501520650002101545650001501566650001001581650001701591650001601608650001401624650001101638650000901649653001801658653002201676653001501698773012601713856008201839852000901921655001201930IND60785421920221207055749.0170322e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078542192DNAL7 a10.23869/bphjbr.9.1.200342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHellēn,10aControl Region-mtDNA heterogeneity of Kalimantan false gharial (Tomistoma schiegelii) population: a preliminary study  ap. 19-25.  aResource is Open Access  aThe preliminary genetic study on Kalimantan false gharial from the wild was reported.

The largest mean scale of SWC and environmental factors along the transect was 121 km. Precipitation and temperature were large‐scale factors controlling SWC. Elevation and sand were moderate‐scale factors controlling SWC. Clay content was the dominant factor controlling SWC at all scales. Soil water content (SWC) varies both spatially and temporally and is highly controlled by various factors operating at different intensities and scales. In this study, we investigated the scale‐specific controls of SWC along a 500‐km transect using multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) at 42 sites. Soil water content and six environmental factors were divided into different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residuals to represent different scales. Different values of IMFs for SWC and environmental factors were obtained throughout the whole profile and within five soil layers (0–1, 1–2, 2–3, 3–4, and 4–5 m). The largest scales (i.e., the scales that explain largest portion of variances) of SWC and environmental factors depended on the soil layer from which SWC was involved in MEMD analysis, and they were 272, 126, 134, 126, 117, and 121 km for soil layers from 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, and 0 to 5 m, respectively. The residuals accounted for a majority (33–78.1%) of the variance of the original data. At large scales (>250 km), precipitation and temperature were the controlling factors on SWC, whereas at moderate scales (65 km), elevation and sand were the factors determining SWC. In contrast, at all scales, clay content affected SWC distribution. The scale‐specific prediction of SWC on the basis of IMFs and residuals contained more information on environmental factors than the results obtained at the measurement scale. Overall, SWC prediction from IMFs and their residuals were superior to those based on the original data. Using information obtained from MEMD could improve our understanding of the scale‐specific characteristics of soil water and environmental factors across a long transect scale.  aPublisher supplied data  a41571130083cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41471189cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41530854cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41722106cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aclay fraction 3aprediction 3asand 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atemperature 3avadose zone 3avariance1 aWang, Yunqiang1 aZhang, Xingchang1 aWang, Li0 tVadose zone journal.g2018, v. 17, no. 1 p.1-12dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2018.05.00973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245021300161300001600374506002800390520128200418592002801700506003701728650000801765650001901773650002001792650002001812650002301832650001101855650000801866650001401874773013501888856007702023852000902100655001202109IND60785423720221207055742.0121124e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078542372DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha40275352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSMOLIK, Milosz10aR-ISSR - Tool for Generation of a New Type of Products, Applied for the Identification of Putative Molecular Marker Linked to QTL Determined Tolerance to Nutrient Deprivation Stress in Rye (Secale cereale L.)  ap. 238-246.  aResource is Open Access  aThis study presents results confirming the possibility of the application of various combinations of RAPD and ISSR primers in one multiplex PCR for the rye genome and generating a new type of R-ISSR products. The plant material consisted of two inbred lines (Ot0-6 and Ot1-3), F1 and two bulks (tolerant and susceptible), selected from a population of RILs (F9) with different responses to stress caused by nutrient deprivation at the seedling stage. In one PCR reaction, the DNA of five genotypes was amplified separately, with RAPD, ISSR, and RAPD+ISSR primers. In total, 28 R-ISSR combinations were tested by combining 20 and 8 appropriately selected RAPD and ISSR primers. 567 loci were amplified, including 230 RAPD, 136 ISSR and 207 amplified R-ISSR loci, of which 114 were new. It was shown that only one ISSR product was identified amongst sequenced R-ISSR products with identical electrophoretic mobility as co-migrating RAPDs and ISSRs. The remaining ones had heteroamplicons (R-ISSR) sequences. A similar range of variability was observed both in R-ISSR profiles and in RAPD, as well as in ISSR. The correlation coefficient between the matrices of genetic similarity for five rye genotypes calculated by means of the Mantel test was highly significant rAB.C = 0.964.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aSecale cereale 3aelectrophoresis 3agenetic markers 3agenetic similarity 3agenome 3arye 3aseedlings0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2012 Nov., v. 40, no. 2 p.238-246dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha40275353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245009100161300001600252500000900268520156900277592002801846650001101874650001201885650001301897650001401910650002201924650000901946650000901955650001501964650002301979650001102002650002202013650001002035650001102045650001802056650001802074650001602092700002302108773011802131856007702249852000902326655001202335IND60671893920221121035923.0191126e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067189392DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2004.19002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHull, Larry C.10aFate of Brine Applied to Unpaved Roads at a Radioactive Waste Subsurface Disposal Area  ap. 190-202.  aepub  aBetween 1984 and 1993, MgCl₂ brine was used to suppress dust on unpaved roads at a radioactive waste subsurface disposal area. Because Cl⁻ might enhance corrosion of buried metals in the waste, we investigated the distribution and fate of Cl⁻ in the vadose zone using pore water samples collected from suction lysimeters and soluble salt concentrations extracted from sediment samples. The Cl/Br mass ratio and the total dissolved Cl⁻ concentration of pore water show that brine contamination occurs primarily within 13 m of treated roads, but can extend as much as 30 m laterally in near-surface sedimentary deposits. Within the deep vadose zone, which consists of interlayered basalt lava flows and sedimentary interbeds, brine has moved up to 110 m laterally. This lateral migration suggests formation of perched water and horizontal transport during periods of high recharge. In a few locations, brine migrated to depths of 67 m within 3 to 5 yr. Elevated Cl⁻ concentrations were found to depths of 2 m in roadbed material. In drainage ditches along roads, where runoff accumulates and recharge of surface water is high, Cl⁻ was flushed from the sediments in 3 to 4 yr. In areas of lower recharge, Cl⁻ remained in the sediments after 5 yr. Vertical brine movement is directly related to surface recharge through sediments. The distribution of Cl⁻ in pore water and sediments is consistent with estimates of vadose zone residence times and spatial distribution of surface water recharge from other investigations at the subsurface disposal area.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3abromine 3achlorine 3acorrosion 3adrainage channels 3adust 3alava 3alysimeters 3amagnesium chloride 3ametals 3aradioactive waste 3aroads 3arunoff 3asoluble salts 3asurface water 3avadose zone1 aBishop, Carolyn W.0 tVadose zone journal.g2004 Feb., v. 3, no. 1 p.190-202dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2004.19003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03759naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245012600131300001600257506002800273520248000301592002802781506003702809650002102846650002002867650001402887650001202901650001102913650001402924650002202938651001302960653002302973653002002996653002303016653001703039700002103056700002103077700001903098700001903117773020403136852000903340655001203349IND60785423820221207055943.0201111e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078542382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatista, Marco10aObesidade Infantil e Estilos de Vida - Caracterização de crianças do 1º Ciclo do Concelho do Entroncamento - Portugal  ap. 243-250.  aResource is Open Access  aObjetivo: Analisar se a prática regular de atividade física influencia a prevalência da obesidade, nas crianças.

ABSTRACT Objective: To determine whether regular physical activity influences the prevalence of obesity in children. Methods: This study includes a sample of 239 students representing 32.16% of the population of 743 students of 1st Cycle of Entroncamento city (public education). Ages ranging between 6 and 12 years and 50.6% belong to the female gender. Body composition was assessed (Height, Weight, Skinfold, Body Mass Index and Percent Fat Mass); Results: The results, when compared with previous studies in the same county, seem to indicate that this population has evolved positively in regard to the prevalence of obesity and the prevalence of overweight, as well as indicate lower values than those presented by international studies specifically WHO (2002) and (2009). Conclusions: most individuals do regular physical activity within or outside the school, and 14.5% are those who never practice it. It can be said that all the students say make a conscious power, preferring the "good food" as opposed to those that can be considered harmful to health, and rarely eat ice cream, fries and opposed eat fruit and vegetables several times a day.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody composition 3abody mass index 3aeducation 3afemales 3afruits 3aice cream 3aphysical activity 3aPortugal 0aobesidade infantil 0aestilos de vida 0aactividade física 0asedentarismo1 aHonório, Samuel1 aMartins, Júlio,1 aMassuça, Luis1 aSoares, Filipe0 tRevista brasileira de obesidade, nutrição e emagrecimento.g2015 Sept., v. 9, no. 54 p.243-250dInstituto Brasileiro de Pesquisa e Ensino em Fisiologia do ExercíciowJournal:27930x1981-99197nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245006700179300001600246520115000262592002801412650001601440650002201456650001701478650002001495650000901515650000901524650000901533650001001542650001001552650001101562650001101573653001701584653001601601653001401617653001501631653001201646653001701658700002101675700002001696773011701716856008701833852000901920655001201929IND60633007320221118185946.0190705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063300732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2018.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulholland, Michele M.14aThe nose may not know: Dogs’ reactions to rattlesnake odours  ap. 108-112.  aAccording to anecdotal reports from dog (Canis lupus familiaris) owners and data from veterinary studies, domestic dogs often fail to avoid, and indeed will approach, venomous snakes. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that odours associated with rattlesnakes will elicit investigation, but not a negative emotional reaction, from domestic dogs. In a repeated measures design using newspaper on which southern Pacific rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus helleri) and other stimulus animals (rosy boa, Lichanura trivirgata; mouse, Mus musculus; and snail, Cornu aspersum) had lived, we found that dogs did indeed sniff the rattlesnake stimuli more so than rosy boa or snail, but less than mouse (p < 0.05). Using nostril choice as our measure, whereby preferential use of the right nostril (right hemisphere) may indicate negative emotional arousal, we failed to find any evidence that rattlesnake odours elicited negative emotional states. Given that dogs are motivated to investigate, but may not be made afraid by, rattlesnake odours, our data provide a potential explanation for the reported high rates of rattlesnake envenomation of dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3aCrotalus oreganus 3aMus musculus 3aanimal behavior 3adogs 3amice 3anose 3aodors 3asmell 3asnails 3asnakes 0aDomestic dog 0aRattlesnake 0aOlfaction 0aLaterality 0aEmotion 0aEnvenomation1 aOlivas, Victoria1 aCaine, Nancy G.0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2018 July, v. 204 p.108-112dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2018.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03571naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245010300160300001300263500002000276500000900296520225800305592002802563596006602591650001702657650001202674650002002686650001502706650002302721650001402744650002202758650002202780650002602802650001602828650001602844650002002860700003002880700001302910773013702923856008003060852000903140655001203149IND60671894620221120200607.0220819e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067189462DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2017.01.00212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz, Siul10aMechanics and Energetics of Soil Penetration by Earthworms and Plant Roots: Higher Rates Cost More  ap. 1-16.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: We quantified mechanical differences between earthworms and roots using penetration rates. Mechanical modeling was justified by direct imaging of both plant roots and earthworms. We validated model predictions with rate‐controlled miniature cone penetrometer experiments. Earthworm burrows are dominantly formed through mechanical processes, not ingestion. We outline mechanical and energetic limitations for a range of water contents. We quantified the mechanics and energetics of soil penetration by burrowing earthworms and growing plant roots considering different penetration rates and soil mechanical properties. The mechanical model considers cavity expansion by cone‐like penetration into a viscoelastic soil material in which penetration rates affect the resulting forces and hence the mechanical energy required. To test the predicted penetration rate effects on forces and energetics, we conducted rate‐controlled cone penetration experiments across rates ranging from 1 to 200 μm s⁻¹ to determine the mechanical resistance forces for cone geometries similar to plant roots and earthworms. These measurements also enabled inverse estimation of soil rheological parameters that were in good agreement with literature values for similar soils and water contents. The results suggest that higher soil penetration rates typical for earthworm activity (about 200 μm s⁻¹) may significantly increase resistance forces and energy expenditure by up to threefold relative to slower penetration rates of plant roots (0.2 μm s⁻¹) for similar soil properties and geometries. Another important mechanical difference between earthworms and roots is the radial pressures that earthworms' hydro‐skeleton exerts (<230 kPa), whereas plant roots may exert radial pressures exceeding 1 MPa. These inherent differences in burrowing rates and expansion pressures may significantly extend the range of conditions suitable for root growth in drier and compacted soil compared to earthworm activity. Results suggest that the mechanical energy costs of soil bioturbation under agricultural intensification and drier climate could greatly increase the energetic costs of these ecologically important soil structure‐forming bioprocesses.  aPublisher supplied data  cSwiss National Science Foundation's National Research Program 3abioturbation 3aclimate 3acompacted soils 3aearthworms 3aenergy expenditure 3aingestion 3aintensive farming 3amechanical models 3amechanical properties 3aroot growth 3avadose zone 3aviscoelasticity1 aSchymanski, Stanislaus J.1 aOr, Dani0 tVadose zone journal.g2017 Aug., v. 16, no. 8 p.1-16dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2017.01.00213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245014100211300001400352520210000366592002802466650002002494650001002514650001102524650002702535650001102562650003302573650001102606653001102617653003702628653003002665653001202695700002602707700001902733700002302752700001902775700002202794700002302816700002902839773011502868856008702983852000903070655001203079IND60633007820221118185947.0190705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063300782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2018.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinero, Michela1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8285-550110aUsing qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA) to explore the emotional state of horses and its association with human-animal relationship  ap. 53-59.  aThis study aimed to apply qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA) to horses farmed in single boxes, in order to investigate their emotional state and explore its association with indicators of human-animal relationship. A fixed list of 13 QBA descriptive terms was determined. Three assessors experienced with horses and skilled in measuring animal behaviour underwent a common training period, consisting of a theoretical phase and a practical phase on farm. Their inter-observer reliability was tested on a live scoring of 95 single stabled horses. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted to analyse QBA scores and identify perceived patterns of horse expression, both for data obtained in the training phase and from the on-farm study. Given the good level of agreement reached in the training phase (Kendall W = 0.76 and 0.74 for PC1 and PC2 scores respectively), it was considered acceptable in the subsequent on-farm study to let these three observers each carry out QBA assessments on a sub-selection of a total of 355 sport and leisure horses, owned by 40 horse farms. Assessment took place immediately after entering the farms: assessors had never entered the farms before and were unaware of the different backgrounds of the farms. After concluding QBA scoring, the assessors further evaluated each horse with an avoidance distance test (AD) and a forced human approach test (FHA). A MANOVA test was used to assess the association of the AD and FHA tests with the on-farm QBA PC scores. The QBA approach described in this paper was feasible on farm and showed good acceptability by owners. In the analysis of on-farm QBA scores, the first Principal Component ranged from relaxed/at ease to uneasy/alarmed, the second Component ranged from curious/pushy to apathetic. Horses perceived as more relaxed/at ease with QBA showed less avoidance during the AD test (P = 0.0376), and responded less aggressively and fearfully to human presence in the FHA test (P < 0.0001). Our results support the hypothesis that QBA is sensitive to the quality of human contact in horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3afarms 3ahorses 3ahuman-animal relations 3ahumans 3aprincipal component analysis 3asports 0aHorses 0aQualitative behaviour assessment 0aHuman-animal relationship 0aWelfare1 aDalla Costa, Emanuela1 aDai, Francesca1 aCanali, Elisabetta1 aBarbieri, Sara1 aZanella, Adroaldo1 aPascuzzo, Riccardo1 aWemelsfelder, Françoise0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2018 July, v. 204 p.53-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2018.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03578naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007400172300001500246520236600261592002802627650002002655650000902675650002502684650000902709650002702718650001102745650000902756650002002765653001402785653001102799653001202810653001402822653002702836700002602863700002202889700001902911700001402930773011602944856008703060852000903147655001203156IND60633008220221118185823.0190705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063300822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2018.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoody, Carly M.10aCan you handle it? Validating negative responses to restraint in cats  ap. 94-100.  aCats routinely undergo handling and restraint for examinations and procedures throughout their lifetime. In recent years there has been increased awareness that some forms of restraint have the potential to negatively impact cat health and welfare, but there has been limited research to assess alternatives. Full-body restraint is known to be aversive and cause stress responses across a range of species. The current study therefore validated measures for identifying negative cat responses to handling by comparing passive restraint (n = 22; the control treatment) to full-body restraint (n = 25; negative treatment), during a physical examination. Given that cats respond differently to unfamiliar people, and handlers are often unfamiliar to cats, an Unfamiliar Person Test was used to account for differences in cat responses to an unknown handler. Cats were then restrained according to treatment, and assessed for behavioural and physiological responses during the following phases: 1) placement into restraint, 2) restraint, and 3) post-restraint. The results show the odds of struggling were 8.2 (95% CI: 1.47, 58.53; P = .009) times greater in cats being placed into full-body restraint in comparison to passively restrained cats. During the physical examination, full-body restrained cats showed more breaths per minute (P = .004), more lip licks per minute (F1,42 = 6.18; P = .017), and were more likely to hold their ears in a back or side position during the first 15 s of handling (P < 0.0001), compared to passively restrained cats. Analysis of pupil dilation ratio (pupil diameter/iris diameter) showed an interaction between treatment and friendliness (F1,43 = 8.39; P = .006); unfriendly cats handled using full-body restraint showed a larger pupil dilation ratio than unfriendly cats handled with passive restraint (P = .0007). Immediately after the handler released the cat from restraint, the odds of staying on the examination table were 6.1 (95% CI: 1.04, 36.10; F1,44 = 4.23; P = .0458) times greater for cats restrained with passive restraint, in comparison to cats that underwent full-body restraint. These results provide scientific validation of negative cat responses to handling, and may be used in further research to assess the welfare effects of different handling techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3acats 3aclinical examination 3aears 3ahuman-animal relations 3apeople 3apets 3astress response 0aRestraint 0aFeline 0aWelfare 0aBehaviour 0aUnfamiliar person test1 aPicketts, Victoria A.1 aMason, Georgia J.1 aDewey, Cate E.1 aNiel, Lee0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2018 July, v. 204 p.94-100dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2018.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245011400159300001400273506002800287520156300315592002801878506003701906650001001943650001401953650001701967650001601984650001102000650001202011650001302023651001202036651001202048653001102060653002802071653002902099653002802128653001702156653001002173653001302183700002102196700002102217700002402238700002002262700001702282700001702299773013302316856007602449852000902525655001202534IND60785425720221207055635.0090701e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078542572DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha3412722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJIDAVU, Mihai14aThe response of several tomato cultivars for processing in central transylvania conditions. i. yield capacity  ap. 54-61.  aResource is Open Access  aNine tomato varieties, hybrids F1 and selection (Perla Clujului, Natalia, Chico Grande, Indiana, Red River, Event, Jet, Montego, Cluj 8-2002) have been tested for their yield characteristics and compared in order to experiment and control, at Fruit Research Station Cluj-Napoca (FRS Cluj-Napoca), Romania. All the cultivars presented a low height of the plants and a low number of sprouts, respectively multi-stage fruiting, which makes them fit for industrial exploitation. Of all the analysed cultivars, Chico Grande, Event, Jet, Montego and Line Cluj 8-2002 had the required characteristics, all expressed on a high level, which makes them possible genitors for future breeding programmes. The Early Fruit Yield (EFY), at least for the conditions from Central Transylvania, was quite high in all the cultivars. Besides the Chico Grande variety, early high productions were obtained from hybrid Jet, Line Cluj 8-2002, Red River and Natalia. The Total Fruit Yield oscillated between 58.0 tons per hectare (Indiana) and 63.0 tons per hectare (Natalia). Besides Natalia, high productions were also obtained from the other varieties created at Cluj-Napoca such as: Perla Clujului and Line Cluj 8-2002 (both of them had a production of 60.8 tons per hectare). Between Total Fruit Yield and Mature Fruit Yield there was registered a strong correlation, the two types of production increase and decrease together, all the time, both in the same direction. There is also a significant positive correlation between the Total Fruit Yield and the weight of the fruit.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPerla 3acultivars 3afruit weight 3afruit yield 3afruits 3ahybrids 3atomatoes 3aIndiana 3aRomania 0atomato 0aTotal Fruit Yield (TFY) 0aMature Fruit Yield (MFY) 0aEarly Fruit Yield (EFY) 0acorrelations 0ayield 0abreeding1 aSESTRAS, Radu E.1 aAPAHIDEAN, Maria1 aSESTRAS, Adriana F.1 aHARSAN, Eugenia1 aTAMAS, Elena1 aGAO, Yanming0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2006 Aug., v. 34, no. 1 p.54-61dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha3412723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03981naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245016200170300001400332520212900346592002802475650002002503650002002523650002002543650002302563650001002586650001902596650001402615650000902629650002302638650001602661650001602677650002302693650001802716650001502734650001602749650001402765650001402779650003302793650001402826650002302840650002002863653001402883653001802897653001202915653001902927653001602946653001802962653002402980700001903004700006003023700002503083700006103108773011503169856008603284852000903370655001203379IND60633008720221118190517.0190318e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063300872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2018.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDudde, Anissa10aMore eggs but less social and more fearful? Differences in behavioral traits in relation to the phylogenetic background and productivity level in laying hens  ap. 65-70.  aDifferent lines of laying hens have undergone a strong selection pressure for productivity traits, which has been proposed as a potential cause of undesirable side effects like behavioural disorders. One reason for such behavioral changes might be due to energy trade-offs, as high productive laying hens may conserve energy expenditure on activity in order to sustain the high level of egg production. However, beside the level of egg production, also phylogenetic origin has potential implications on differences in fearfulness, stress reactivity and sociality in layers. In this study, we compared four purebred layer lines differing in egg laying productivity and phylogenetic origin on their fearfulness and sociality prior to the start of laying. We used 77 chickens in a 2 x 2 group design, with two layer lines with white egg shell color and two lines with brown color which differed in laying performance (∼200 versus ∼300 egg / y, respectively, within colors). We measured fearfulness and sociality using five different behavioral tests (visual cliff, social approach, novel-object, mirror approach and tonic immobility). The data from the tests were analyzed using a principle component analysis revealing that our data were best explained by two components representing the dimension social behavior (PC1) and fear (PC2), respectively, which were further analyzed by a linear model (LM). The high productive lines showed a lower social motivation (lower values on PC1social, LM: p < 0.0001) than the less productive lines and the white hens had a higher social motivation than brown hens (higher values on PC1social, LM: p = 0.0004). Our results indicated that phylogeny and level of egg production affected the two dimensions of behavior differently with sociality but not fearfulness likely linked to the level of egg productivity. The decreased engagement in social behavior is consistent with the notion of energy trade-offs due to intense selection on egg productivity. The unintentional impacts of selection on behavior deserves further research, especially with regard to potential effects on welfare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanimal behavior 3abehavior change 3abehavior disorders 3acolor 3aegg production 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3aenergy expenditure 3afearfulness 3alaying hens 3alaying performance 3alinear models 3amotivation 3aoviposition 3aparalysis 3aphylogeny 3aprincipal component analysis 3apurebreds 3aselection pressure 3asocial behavior 0aPhylogeny 0aDomestication 0aPoultry 0aAnimal welfare 0aLaying hens 0aGallus gallus 0aResource allocation1 aSchrader, Lars1 aWeigend, Steffen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5670-28081 aMatthews, Lindsay R.1 aKrause, E.

The authors examined the impact of foliar calcium fertlizers (Calcinit, Calcium chloride, Fruton Calcium Calcium, Folanx®Ca29 Lebosol Calcium Forte Calcium Forte) on the fruit size and firmness, their chemical composition, content of macronutrients in the foliage and fruits, and their colour. It was found that the applied fertlizers have varied impact on the examined attributes. The bushes sprayed with the Lebosol Calcium Forte and Calcinit preparations had big fruits with a high content of K and Mg, and dark foliage. The application of the Lebosol Calcium Forte fertilizer increased the content of polyphenols and vitamin C in the fruits. The smallest amounts of such compounds were determined in the fruits sprayed with the Calcinit fertilizer. The highest firmness and resistance to mechanical damage were achieved in the case of the fruits collected from the bushes sprayed with the foliar fertlizers containing calcium chloride, such as Fruton Calcium and Folanx Ca29. It was determined that the application of the calcium preparations resulted in the increase of the calcium content in the fruits and foliage. The highest amounts of this element were determined in the case of the plants sprayed with the Folanx Ca29 and Lebosol Calcium Forte preparations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3achemical composition 3acolor 3acultivars 3afirmness 3afoliar application 3afruit size 3aleaves 3amechanical damage 3apolyphenols0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2012 Nov., v. 40, no. 2 p.163-169dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha40280583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002200157245009700179300001400276506002800290520080200318592002801120506003701148650001601185650002201201650001101223650001101234650001401245650001801259650001001277650001501287650001101302650001501313651001201328653003001340653004501370653001701415653001301432653004501445700002601490700002201516700003001538700003001568700002201598700002601620773016401646856009201810852000901902655001201911IND60785426020221207055633.0170815e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078542602DNAL7 a10.21498/2518-1017.4(33).2016.886962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamorodov, V.

Phenolic acids, flavonoids, amino acids, carbs, and vitamins could be found throughout the entire lemon fruit, including the peel, seed, and pulp. However, lemon peel, a by-product of the lemon, is never fully utilised and is constantly discarded. The lemon peel was employed in this work to optimise the quantity of polyphenols, phenolic acids, and flavonoids utilising response surface methodology (RSM). A central composite design (CCD) was used in this study, and factors including ethanol concentration (70–90%), extraction temperature (45–65&#xb0;C), and extraction duration (80–120 minutes) were examined. Based on the results obtained, ethanol concentrations and extraction temperatures were significantly affected the total polyphenols, phenolic acids and flavonoids content. However, the experimental data was adequately fitted with the second-order polynomial models. Based on the multi-responses optimized extraction conditions were as follows: 85.77%, 65&#xb0;C and 120 minutes for ethanol concentration, extraction temperature and extraction time, respectively. This optimized condition could be useful for phenolics extraction from lemon peel.

Bien que les levures et les bactéries soient présentes à la fois sur la vendange et le matériel vinaire, ces deux fermentations ne se produisent pas ensemble : on observe d'abord la fermentation alcoolique qui est le phénomène fondamental, puis, après un délai très variable, la fermentation malolactique. Cette dernière peut d'ailleurs ne pas se produire spontanément. Il y a donc dans un tel cas prédominance des levures sur les bactéries. En introduisant des bactéries cultivées dans le vin, on provoque parfois la fermentation malolactique mais pas toujours. En ensemençant le moût par ces bactéries on peut obtenir un développement tel qu'il gêne les levures et le déroulement de la fermentation alcoolique.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 0awinemaking 0ayeasts 0abacteria0 tOENO One.g1969 Dec., v. 3, no. 4 p.315-368dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.1969.3.4.19693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245011600162300001200278500002000290500000900310520164000319592002801959650001901987650001402006650002002020650002302040650001502063650002302078650001602101650001502117650001202132700001502144700001602159700002002175773013702195856008002332961001302412852000902425655001202434IND60671897120221120115608.0220819e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067189712DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2017.07.01452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, G.10aSoil Variability and Biogeochemical Fluxes: Toward a Better Understanding of Soil Processes at the Land Surface  ap. 1-4.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: Pattern recognition techniques can help explain biogeochemical flux variability. Dynamic factors and their impact on biogeochemical flux variability need better identification. Controls on biogeochemical fluxes are time and space scale dependent. Soil biogeochemical fluxes in the vadose zone are characterized by a large degree of variability in space and time. This fact leads to the need for the development and application of appropriate methodologies to better understand the high nonlinearity and complex feedback mechanisms responsible for such fluxes. In this sense, there still exists a lack of knowledge in topics such as the scale dependence of the spatial and temporal variability of the controls on soil moisture and biodegradation rates and the dynamic behavior of flow and transport model parameter, and its association with the presence of roots. Knowledge of the variability of biogeochemical fluxes is needed for assorted applications ranging from natural hazards and environmental pollution risk assessment to agricultural production and water resources management. The contributions to this special section epitomize the ongoing effort toward the characterization, quantification, modeling, and understanding of biogeochemical fluxes in the vadose zone at several spatial and temporal scales. The main progress has been the identification of different controls on soil moisture and biodegradation rates depending on the scale of the study as well as the important dependence of the spatial and temporal variability of biogeochemical fluxes on dynamic properties such as vegetation and weather variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3apollution 3arisk assessment 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil water 3atemporal variation 3avadose zone 3avegetation 3aweather1 aBrocca, L.1 aGerke, H.H.1 aPachepsky, Y.A.0 tVadose zone journal.g2017 Oct., v. 16, no. 10 p.1-4dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2017.07.01453Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle04115naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245014600173300001400319506002800333520279800361592002803159506003703187650002303224650001203247650002803259650001203287650001003299650001103309650001003320650001103330650001803341650001303359653001803372653001303390653000903403653001503412653001003427653001203437700001903449773010503468856008703573852000903660655001203669IND60785427920221207055622.0170710e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078542792DNAL7 a10.22167/r.ipecege.2015.3-4.362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunha, Ana Paula10aAnálise da viabilidade econômica de uma Unidade de Beneficiamento de Sementes = Analysis of the economicviability of a Seed Processing Unit  ap. 36-57.  aResource is Open Access  aO objetivo deste trabalho consiste em apurar a viabilidade econômica de instalação de uma Unidade de Beneficiamento de Sementes – UBS, em uma propriedade rural localizada no município de Brasília/DF. Antes do projeto (cenário A), a soja produzida com qualidade para semente era entregue à uma grande empresa do setor, que se encarregava das etapas de beneficiamento e comercialização, remunerando o produtor com uma bonificação de 9% sobre o preço da soja. Em um segundo momento (cenário B), considera-se que o produtor investirá na construção de uma UBS em sua propriedade, realizando o beneficiamento da soja e sendo remunerado com uma bonificação de 40% sobre o preço do produto entregue à empresa. Conhecendo os resultados gerados em cada cenário, é possível verificar qual será a variação da receita líquida operacional, proporcionada pelo investimento, e calcular indicadores de viabilidade financeira como Valor Presente Líquido – VPL, Taxa Interna de Retorno - TIR, Payback descontado –PBDe Índice de Rentabilidade - IR. Além destes indicadores, calculados sob a hipótese de uso de recursos próprios, o trabalho contém uma análise sobre as condições de financiamento do projeto. Quando se considera a obtenção de crédito, que possui uma taxa de juros real negativa, observa-se que o VPL sofre um aumento significativo, passando de R$ 11.082.279,19 (em caso de investimento com recursos próprios) para R$ 14.716.511,27. = The main objective of this study is to establish the economic viability of building a Seed Processing Unit - SPU, on a farm in the city of Brasília/DF. Before the project (scenario A), the soybean produced with quality for seeds was delivered to a seeds company, which was in charge of the stages of processing and marketing, paying the farmer with a bonus of 9% on the price of soybeans. In a second step (scenario B), it is considered that the farmer will invest in building a SPU, making the processing of soybeans and being paid with a bonus of 40% on the price of the product delivered to the company. With results from both scenarios (A and B), it is possible to estimate the change in the net operating revenue, provided by the investment, and calculate financial viability indicators such as Net Present Value - NPV, Internal Rate of Return - IRR, Payback discounted - PBD and the Profitability Index - PI. Along with these indicators - calculated without considering third parties capital - the work contains an analysis of the project financing conditions. When considering the loan, which has a negative real interest rate, it is observed that the NPV suffers a significant increase, from R$ 11,082,279.19 (in case of investment with own resources) to R$ 14,716,511.27.Keywords: processing, seeds. soybean.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlycine (Fabaceae) 3acapital 3aeconomic sustainability 3afarmers 3afarms 3aincome 3aloans 3aprices 3aprofitability 3asoybeans 0aprocessamento 0asementes 0asoja 0aprocessing 0aseeds 0asoybean1 aHarbs, Ricardo0 tRevista iPecege.g2015 July, v. 1, no. 3/4 p.36-57dInstituto PecegewJournal:27854x2359-50787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22167/r.ipecege.2015.3-4.363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245018300167506002800350520119100378592002801569506003701597650001501634650002301649650001501672650001401687650002201701650003101723650001001754650002301764650001601787650001301803650001101816651001101827653002401838653001501862653001601877653001401893653002301907700002601930700002601956700002701982700002602009700002702035773011302062856008302175852000902258655001202267IND60785428620221207055644.0220620s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078542862DNAL7 a10.37486/2675-1305.ec040172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngel, Eduardo10aPopulation density, spatial patterns and sample size of Edessa meditabunda (F., 1794) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) on alternative plants during soybean off-season in southern Brazil  aResource is Open Access  aEdessa meditabunda (F., 1794) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is considered a potential pest for soybean crops in the Neotropical region. During winter (i.e. the soybean off-season), the stink bugs seek alternative host plants such as Saccharum angustifolium (Nees) Trin. and Andropogon bicornis L. at the edge of crop fields for shelter. The objective of this study was to investigate the population density between plants and tussock diameter, spatial distribution and sample size of E. meditabunda on A. bocornis and S. angustifolium at the edge of cultivated areas during soybean off-season. In both plants, the increase of tussock diameter resulted in a higher population density of E. meditabunda. Tussocks of S. angustifolium had a higher average number of stink bugs.plant-1 than A. bicornis. We observed an aggregation trend in both plant species. For practical applicability following Integrated Pest Management, a minimum sample size of 106 and 116 plants for A. bicornis and S. angustifolium respectively was obtained. Evaluation of host plants at the edges of crop fields during soybean off-season plays an important role in management strategies during the next cropping season.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAndropogon 3aEdessa meditabunda 3aNeotropics 3aSaccharum 3aalternative hosts 3aintegrated pest management 3apests 3apopulation density 3asample size 3asoybeans 3awinter 3aBrazil 0aPopulation dynamics 0aMonitoring 0aHeteroptera 0aStink bug 0aManagement systems1 aSilveira, Dienefer A.1 aBortolotto, Rafael P.1 aPasini, Mauricio P.

Their communities are established either spontaneously, as in some artisan-type products, or using a starter culture. The latter usually consists of Staphylococcus carnosus and/or Staphylococcus xylosus strains, although strains from other CNS species also have potential for application. However, it is not entirely clear how the fitness of alternative starter cultures within a fermented meat matrix compares to conventional ones and how this may be affected by processing conditions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the influence of two key processing conditions, namely temperature and acidity, on the competitiveness of a cocktail of five different strains of CNS belonging to species that are potentially important for meat fermentation (Staphylococcus xylosus 2S7-2, S. carnosus 833, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus equorum DFL-S19, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus FPS1). To this end, fermented meat models consisting of cured meat batters with initial pH values of 5.3, 5.5, or 5.7 were inoculated with these strains, stuffed in containers, and incubated at 23, 30, or 37 °C. Both the pH level and the temperature influenced the composition of the CNS communities, giving a competitive advantage to the best adapted species. Staphylococcus xylosus preferred low temperature and mild acidity, whereas an elevated temperature selected for S. epidermidis and a low pH for S. carnosus. Under the conditions tested, S. saprophyticus and S. equorum were outcompeted by the three other CNS species. Hence, CNS communities in fermented meats are not only established based on the initial presence of specific species in the meat batter but also by their subsequent adaptation to the processing conditions during fermentation, potentially overruling the use of starter cultures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus carnosus 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aStaphylococcus equorum 3aStaphylococcus saprophyticus 3aStaphylococcus xylosus 3aacidity 3abatters 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3acolor 3acontainers 3acured meats 3afermentation 3afermented meat 3aflavor 3ameat 3amodels 3apH 3astarter cultures 3atemperature 0aStarter cultures 0aMeat 0aFermentation 0aStaphylococcus1 aVan Reckem, Emiel1 aDe Smet, Stefaan1 aVuyst, Luc de,1 aLeroy, Frédéric0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2018 June 02, v. 274 p.52-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03772naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245016900170300001400339520205900353592002802412650001802440650002702458650002102485650002702506650002802533650002202561650001302583650003302596650001202629650001802641650001802659650002002677650002702697650002302724650000902747650001802756650001802774650001102792650002002803653002702823653001602850653001502866653001202881653001802893653001602911700002102927700002202948700002202970773012802992856008903120852000903209655001203218IND60633011020221118183529.0190318e20180620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063301102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeir, Even10aListeria monocytogenes strains show large variations in competitive growth in mixed culture biofilms and suspensions with bacteria from food processing environments  ap. 46-55.  aInteractions and competition between resident bacteria in food processing environments could affect their ability to survive, grow and persist in microhabitats and niches in the food industry. In this study, the competitive ability of L. monocytogenes strains grown together in separate culture mixes with other L. monocytogenes (L. mono mix), L. innocua (Listeria mix), Gram-negative bacteria (Gram− mix) and with a multigenera mix (Listeria + Gram− mix) was investigated in biofilms on stainless steel and in suspensions at 12 °C. The mixed cultures included resident bacteria from processing surfaces in meat and salmon industry represented by L. monocytogenes (n = 6), L. innocua (n = 5) and Gram-negative bacteria (n = 6; Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas fragi, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). Despite hampered in growth in mixed cultures, L. monocytogenes established in biofilms with counts at day nine between 7.3 and 9.0 log per coupon with the lowest counts in the Listeria + G− mix that was dominated by Pseudomonas. Specific L. innocua inhibited growth of L. monocytogenes strains differently; inhibition that was further enhanced by the background Gram-negative microbiota. In these multispecies and multibacteria cultures, the growth competitive effects lead to the dominance of a strong competitor L. monocytogenes strain that was only slightly inhibited by L. innocua and showed strong competitive abilities in mixed cultures with resident Gram-negative bacteria. The results indicates complex patterns of bacterial interactions and L. monocytogenes inhibition in the multibacteria cultures that only partially depend on cell contact and likely involve various antagonistic and bacterial tolerance mechanisms.

The aim of this study was to compare soil genesis and morphological characteristics in different landforms with WRB and Soil Taxonomy (ST) Systems. From nine studied profiles, six profiles were selected as representative profiles and dug in Colluvial fans, Piedmont plain, and Alluvial plain physiographic units, respectively. Then, the soils were classified according to the pattern of the two systems. Also, variation analysis of variance (ANOVA) and comparing means were used to quantify interested soil properties. The results of soil physio-chemical properties at different landform positions were significant based on analysis of variance of the effect of physiographic units and soil depth at the level of 1 %. Soil classification results based on WRB indicated that WRB were recognized four reference soil groups (RSG) included Regosols, Cambisols, Calcisols, and Gleysols at the first level of WRB classification in comparison of ST with recognizing two order Entisols and Inceptisols could separate more soils. The soils were located on the alluvial plain with a high groundwater level in the WRB due to the creation of restrictive conditions for root development in contrast to the ST called “Aquepts” in the suborder level but in a WRB is classified as the “Gleysols” RSG. On the other hand, ST, unlike WRB, used the Shallow criteria at the family level to describe the shallowness of soils and the limitations of root development. Generally, the efficiency of each system varies despite the differences in their structure and depending on the purpose of using them.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCalcisols 3aCambisols 3aEntisols 3aGleysols 3aInceptisols 3aRegosols 3aWorld Reference Base for Soil Resources 3aalluvial plains 3aanalysis of variance 3ahigh water table 3apiedmont 3asoil depth 3asoil formation 0awater hammer 0awater conveyance pipeline 0asurge tower pipe 0anegative pressure1 aBāqirnizhād, Majīd,1 aAbtahi, A.1 aGhasemi, R.0 t̒Ulūm-i āb va khāk.g2021 Dec., v. 25, no. 3 p.191-207dIsfahan University of TechnologywJournal:27871x2476-55547nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245013500165300001300300500002000313500000900333520176400342592002802106596005902134596005902193596007502252650002202327650001302349650000902362650001302371650001302384650001302397650001602410650003002426650002202456650002102478650001102499650001002510650001502520650001602535650001502551650002302566650001602589650002302605650001002628650001102638651001002649700001702659700002202676700002102698700001202719700001602731773013202747856008002879852000902959655001202968IND60671899620221123031541.0220819s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067189962DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2018.10.01892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yongyong10aEstimating Deep Drainage Using Deep Soil Moisture Data under Young Irrigated Cropland in a Desert‐Oasis Ecotone, Northwest China  ap. 1-10.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: Deep drainage rates under young cropland in the desert‐oasis region were investigated. Deep drainage rates were estimated by a simulation approach based on deep soil moisture data. Annual deep drainage averaged 468 mm; the annual deep drainage coefficient averaged 43%. Deep drainage reduces agricultural water productivity under cropland recently converted from native desert soils (i.e., young cropland) and increases the risks of nutrient and pesticide leaching into groundwater in the desert‐oasis ecotone. However, the deep drainage rates under young cropland in these oasis environments remain unclear, especially for winter irrigation, a common practice in Northwest China. The objective of this study was to estimate the deep drainage rate using the HYDRUS‐1D model based on soil moisture data in the deep vadose zone. Soil moisture at depths ranging from 0 to 200 cm was measured using HydraProbe II soil sensors in maize (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fields in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Using a novel simulation approach based on soil moisture data in the deep vadose zone, the HYDRUS‐1D model provided reliable estimates of deep drainage as confirmed by comparison with estimates from the soil water balance method and prior studies in the region. The annual deep drainage averaged 468 mm, and the annual deep drainage coefficient averaged 43% in the young croplands. The winter irrigation amount averaged 265 mm, and the deep drainage coefficient during winter averaged 21% in the young croplands. The sandy soil of the young cropland and inefficient irrigation scheduling are detrimental to water conservation, causing relatively large deep drainage losses and enhancing the risks of groundwater pollution.  aPublisher supplied data  a41630861cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41877153cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFC0504304cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acropland 3adrainage 3aecotones 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3airrigated farming 3airrigation rates 3amodels 3aoases 3apesticides 3asandy soils 3asoil water 3asoil water balance 3avadose zone 3awater conservation 3awheat 3awinter 3aChina1 aZhao, Wenzhi1 aOchsner, Tyson E.1 aWyatt, Briana M.1 aLiu, Hu1 aYang, Qiyue0 tVadose zone journal.g2019, v. 18, no. 1 p.1-10dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2018.10.01893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04251naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245014600175300001400321520210400335592002802439650001402467650001402481650001302495650003802508650003702546650001002583650001602593650001002609650002302619650002102642650002102663650001202684650002502696650001402721650001502735650001402750650003002764650001802794650002202812650001702834650001402851651001702865653000802882653000902890653000902899653000902908653000902917653000902926653000902935653000902944653000802953653000902961653000902970653000802979653000902987653003002996653003003026653002003056653002503076653001803101653002403119700002503143700002103168700002103189700005703210773012803267856008903395852000903484655001203493IND60633012820221118182741.0190318e20180802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063301282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAijuka, Matthew10aEnteroaggregative Escherichia coli is the predominant diarrheagenic E. coli pathotype among irrigation water and food sources in South Africa  ap. 44-51.  aDiarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) has been implicated in foodborne outbreaks worldwide and have been associated with childhood stunting in the absence of diarrhoea. Infection is extraordinarily common, but the routes of transmission have not been determined. Therefore, determining the most prevalent pathotypes in food and environmental sources may help provide better guidance to various stakeholders in ensuring food safety and public health and advancing understanding of the epidemiology of enteric disease. We characterized 205 E. coli strains previously isolated from producer distributor bulk milk (PDBM)(118), irrigation water (48), irrigated lettuce (29) and street vendor coleslaw (10) in South Africa. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC) were sought. We used PCR and partial gene sequencing for all 205 strains while 46 out of 205 that showed poor resolution were subsequently characterized using cell adherence (HeLa cells).PCR and partial gene sequencing of aatA and/or aaiC genes confirmed EAEC (2%, 5 out of 205) as the only pathotype. Phylogenetic analysis of sequenced EAEC strains with E. coli strains in GenBank showing ≥80% nucleotide sequence similarity based on possession of aaiC and aatA generated distinct clusters of strains separated predominantly based on their source of isolation (food source or human stool) suggesting a potential role of virulence genes in source tracking. EAEC 24%, 11 out of 46 strains (PDBM = 15%, irrigation water = 7%, irrigated lettuce = 2%) was similarly the predominant pathotype followed by strains showing invasiveness to HeLa cells, 4%, 2 out of 46 (PDBM = 2%, irrigated lettuce = 2%), among stains characterized using cell adherence.Therefore, EAEC may be the leading cause of DEC associated food and water-borne enteric infection in South Africa. Additionally, solely using molecular based methods targeting virulence gene determinants may underestimate prevalence, especially among heterogeneous pathogens such as EAEC.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk milk 3achildhood 3adiarrhea 3aenteropathogenic Escherichia coli 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3afeces 3afood safety 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3ahuman cell lines 3airrigation water 3alettuce 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3apathotypes 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3asequence homology 3astakeholders 3avirulence 3aSouth Africa 0aDEC 0aEAEC 0aEIEC 0aETEC 0aEPEC 0aDAEC 0aAIEC 0aDMEM 0aPBS 0aMEGA 0aNICD 0aTSB 0aUPEC 0aEnteroaggregative E. coli 0aEvolutionary relationship 0aVirulence genes 0aCell adherence assay 0aMultiplex PCR 0aFoodborne pathogens1 aSantiago, Araceli E.1 aGirón, Jorge A.1 aNataro, James P.1 aBuys, Elna M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7836-92950 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2018 Aug. 02, v. 278 p.44-51dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245017300130300001400303506002800317520124600345592002801591506003701619650002101656650002401677650003201701650002201733650002001755650001001775650001301785650001801798650002201816650003001838651001401868653003901882653002301921653002601944653001001970700002201980700002002002700002002022773013302042852000902175655001202184IND60785431520221207080219.0161130e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078543152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaepuloh, Uus10aEkspresi enzim rekombinan reverse transcriptase (rtrnase h) simian betaretrovirus serotipe-2 asal macaca fascicularis indonesia dalam sistem ekspresi eschericia coli  ap. 49-54.  aResource is Open Access  aReverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme is a key tool in molecular biology for the synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA) from messenger RNA (mRNA). Combining RT activity with PCR amplification has been a gold standard as the first step in cloning the coding region of any gene of interest. Evidently, RTs have been critical in advancing molecular biology, genetics and medicine to their current stage. In this study, we were developing the RTRNase H recombinant enzyme isolated from serotype-2 simian betaretrovirus-2 (SRV-2) infected Indonesian Macaca fascicularis using Escherichia coli expression system. The study was conducted using RT SRV-2 gene expression using E. coli expression system, proteins purification, and application to RT PCR technique. The SDS PAGE expression analysis showed a specific band size of 32.7 kDa assumed as RT protein enzyme. Application of RT SRV-2 enzyme generated to the RT PCR technique of β-globin CDV and SRV-2 env gene target showed that the RT SRV-2 enzyme was capable to reverse transcribed mRNA into cDNA as indicated by the presence of specific DNA band compared with commercial RT enzymes. This RT SRV-2 enzyme showed its activity similar to that of commercial one, although the activity was lower.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aMacaca fascicularis 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3amedicine 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular biology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aIndonesia 0aescherichia coli expression system 0arecombinant enzyme 0areverse transcriptase 0aSRV-21 aIskandriati, Diah1 aPamungkas, Joko1 aSajuthi, Dondin0 tJurnal Ilmu Pertanian Indonesia.g2013 Apr., v. 18, no. 1 p.49-54dBogor Agricultural UniversitywJournal:27739x2443-34627nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245009200175300001600267520175600283592002802039650001202067650001002079650001502089650002002104650002102124650001302145650001102158650001002169650001502179650001802194650002902212650001102241650000902252650001302261650001702274650002702291650001502318650001902333650001502352650000902367650002002376650001102396650001602407650001502423651002202438653003102460653001902491653001602510653002502526653002602551700002202577700002702599700002202626773010602648856008702754852000902841655001202850IND60545611320221118182653.0160902e20150115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054561132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuzmanović, Maja10aRisk assessment based prioritization of 200 organic micropollutants in 4 Iberian rivers  ap. 289-299.  aThe use of chemicals is continuously growing both in total amount as well as in a number of different substances, among which organic chemicals play a major role. Owing to the growing public awareness on the need of protecting both ecosystems and human health from the risks related to chemical pollution, an increasing attention has been drowned to risk assessment and prioritization of organic pollutants. In this context, the aims of this study were (a) to perform an environmental risk assessment for 200 organic micropollutants including both regulated and emerging contaminants (pesticides, alkylphenols, pharmaceuticals, hormones, personal care products, perflourinated compounds and various industrial organic chemicals) monitored in four rivers located in the Mediterranean side of the Iberian Peninsula, namely, the Ebro, Llobregat, Júcar and Guadalquivir rivers; and (b) to prioritize them for each of the four river basins studied, taking into account their observed concentration levels together with their ecotoxicological potential. For this purpose, a prioritization approach has been developed and a resulting ranking index (RI) associated with each compound. Ranking index is based on the measured concentrations of the chemical in each river and its ecotoxicological potential (EC50 values for algae, Daphnia sp. and fish). Ten compounds were identified as most important for the studied rivers: pesticides chlorpyriphos, chlorfenvinphos, diazinon, dichlofenthion, prochloraz, ethion carbofuran and diuron and the industrial organic chemicals nonylphenol and octylphenol that result from the biodegration of polyethoxylated alkyphenol surfactants. Also, further research into chronic toxicity of emerging contaminants is advocated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia 3aalgae 3acarbofuran 3achlorfenvinphos 3achronic toxicity 3adiazinon 3adiuron 3adrugs 3aecosystems 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental assessment 3aethion 3afish 3ahormones 3ahuman health 3apersonal care products 3apollutants 3aprioritization 3aprochloraz 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asurfactants 3awatersheds 3aIberian Peninsula 0aEcological risk assessment 0aPrioritization 0aToxic units 0aMediterranean rivers 0aEmerging contaminants1 aGinebreda, Antoni1 aPetrović, M.q(Mira),1 aBarceló, Damià,0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Jan. 15, v. 503-504 p.289-299dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03794naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245012500181300001400306500001500320520211500335592002802450650001902478650001602497650001202513650001502525650001402540650001802554650002002572650001102592650001102603650000902614650002102623650001802644650002102662650002102683650001502704650001202719651001102731653001502742653002202757653001102779653001302790653001602803653002702819653001502846700002302861700002102884700001802905700002002923700002902943700002302972773011502995856008503110852000903195655001203204IND60646194020221119035601.0190807e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064619402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2019.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScolforo, Henrique Ferraco10aStand-level growth and yield model system for clonal eucalypt plantations in Brazil that accounts for water availability  ap. 22-33.  a2019-12-06  aGrowth and yield (G &Y) model systems aim at forecasting forest productivity. The lack of environmental variables to account for how water availability constrains eucalyptus production in Brazil, however, is argued to be a major drawback of these model systems. Thus, this study aimed to develop a stand-level G & Y model system that accounts for water availability (G & Y with SWD), highlighting its usefulness when applied for clonal eucalypt stands under drier climatic conditions. The dataset is composed of remeasurement information of sixteen research sites that span all climatic regions in Brazil. A total of eleven eucalypt clones were planted in single block plots at each site, and extra replications under the rainfall exclusion system were also installed for these eleven clones in fourteen sites. Linear algebra techniques were used to simultaneously fit a compatible set of prediction and projection basal area equations. A stand-level volume equation was also developed. These equations were validated through the use of an independent dataset composed of the rainfall exclusion plots. Finally, the accuracy and usefulness of a conventional G & Y model system applied to clonal eucalypt stands in Brazil was compared to the new proposed G & Y model system, which accounts for the impact of water availability in eucalyptus productivity. The prediction and projection basal area equations accounting for water availability displayed estimates in the order of 5% more accurate compared to the conventional basal area modeling. Stand-level volume estimates were 40% and 74% less biased through the use of the new G & Y model system. This result highlighted how useful and powerful the newly developed approach is, since the model system was capable to provide accurate estimates through the use of the rainfall exclusion plots. The new G & Y model system is a powerful alternative to estimate forest afforestation yield and is fully capable to accurately update forest inventories. The model system can also be used for projecting how forest growth may be impacted by short-term climate variation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic zones 3aplantations 3aalgebra 3aEucalyptus 3aequations 3aafforestation 3adata collection 3amodels 3aclones 3arain 3aforest inventory 3aforest growth 3astand basal area 3aclimatic factors 3aprediction 3aforests 3aBrazil 0aBasal area 0aForest production 0aVolume 0aAccuracy 0aEnvironment 0aClimatic water deficit 0abasal area1 aMcTague, John Paul1 aBurkhart, Harold1 aRoise, Joseph1 aMcCarter, James1 aAlvares, Clayton Alcarde1 aStape, José Luiz,0 tForest ecology and management.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 448 p.22-33dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245018300170520069400353592002801047650001901075650001101094650001501105650001201120650001401132650001501146650002201161650001701183650001901200650001101219650001301230650002501243650001101268650001101279653002501290653003001315700002001345700002201365700005601387700002201443773010601465856008701571852000901658655001201667IND60662954520221117021035.0200128e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066295452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1221052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Mangat10aProduction of xylose, levulinic acid, and lignin from spent aromatic biomass with a recyclable Brønsted acid synthesized from d-limonene as renewable feedstock from citrus waste  aThis work aimed to develop a green protocol for chemical processing of spent aromatic biomass to obtain xylose, levulinic acid, and lignin in good yields via treatment with p-cymene-2-sulphonic acid (p-CSA), a Brønsted acid synthesised from d-limonene as a renewable feedstock from citrus waste.

Despite that many LCA methods remain sensitive to uncertain input data, which can reduce the utility of their results, uncertainty arising from constituent LCA models remains poorly understood. Here, we begin to address this problem by evaluating the extent to which parameter-value uncertainty affects the SimpleBox 2.0 fate and transport model, which serves as a backbone for many LCA ecotoxicological impact categories. Two Monte Carlo type sampling methods were used to evaluate dispersion in steady-state concentration values for three chemicals involved in grenade production: toluene, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). Parameters were first sampled stochastically one-at-a-time, then by randomly exploring a local patch of the parameter space. We confirmed that global temperatures contribute primarily to the overall variance of model results, which at most spanned approximately 8 decades in magnitude. These results are consistent with previous results obtained for the whole of the LCA method. LCA methods carry out calculations iteratively; a reduction in the error of a single component, such as the fate and transport model, may therefore improve its performance and utility as a decision-making aid.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental impact 3afate and transport models 3alife cycle assessment 3atemperature 3atrinitrotoluene 3auncertainty 3avariance 0aUncertainty 0aSensitivity analysis 0aLife cycle assessment 0aFate and transport model 0aSimpleBox 0aTrinitrotoluene1 aCollier, Zachary A.1 aNguyễn, Thu Phong,1 aChappell, Mark0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 494-495 p.104-112dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04061naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245017700162300001600339520212100355592002802476650002202504650001202526650001602538650001902554650004002573650002302613650001802636650002702654650001602681650002202697651001002719653001302729653002402742653001902766653002802785653001102813653001102824653000702835653001102842653000902853653001102862653000602873653001402879653001802893653000702911653000702918653000802925653000702933653000702940653000702947653000602954653000802960653000802968653000802976653000802984653000802992653000703000653001103007653000703018700001403025700002003039700001303059700001603072700001603088773011703104856008503221852000903306655001203315IND60646194520221119035903.0190807e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064619452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2019.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi, Nan10aDiurnal and nocturnal transpiration behaviors and their responses to groundwater-table fluctuations and meteorological factors of Populus tomentosa in the North China Plain  ap. 445-456.  aFor theories of forest water utilization over day-night cycles, it is important to have a reliable information on plant transpiration behaviors during daytime and nighttime and their environmental controls. With the help of thermal dissipation probes, our study investigated the seasonal variations in the diurnal (Qday) and nocturnal stand water use (Qnight) of a Populus tomentosa plantation and explored their responses to groundwater table (GT) fluctuations and the meteorological factors. The results indicated that Qnight occurred on most nights during the growing season in the P. tomentosa plantation, but with a different seasonal dynamic from Qday. A distinct increase in the ratio of nocturnal to daily water use appeared at the beginning and the end of the growing season. During the experimental period, stem refilling accounted for 61% of Qnight, indicating that P. tomentosa was able to draw on stored water in the stem to support transpiration. The Qday and Qnight were positively and negatively related to GT, respectively. When the GT varied within 170 cm of the surface, the proportion of stem refilling accounting for Qnight increased with GT. The positive and negative correlations were found in meteorological factors with Qday and Qnight, respectively. Among the single meteorological factors except for ET0, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) explained the highest variation in Qday in 2010 and 2011, respectively. In contrast, Qnight was dominantly affected by VPD in 2011. Nocturnal stand water-use could help P. tomentosa to recharge the consumption of water stored in the stem and overcome the seasonal drought. The compensation effect of groundwater on the nocturnal stand water-use of P. tomentosa could reduce its consumption of water stored in the stem. As the stand age of P. tomentosa plantation varied, the key meteorological drivers of both Qday and Qnight also changed. Our results enable better understanding of the water-use strategies of poplars in the North China Plain and can lead to refinement of current silvicultural techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus tomentosa 3adrought 3agroundwater 3agrowing season 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aseasonal variation 3atranspiration 3avapor pressure deficit 3awater table 3awater utilization 3aChina 0aSap flow 0aNocturnal water use 0aStem refilling 0aGroundwater fluctuation 0aPoplar 0aTnight 0aRe 0aQnight 0aQday 0aQdaily 0aQ 0aRe/Qnight 0aQnight/Qdaily 0aGT 0aRs 0aPAR 0aWS 0aTa 0aRH 0aP 0aVPD 0aET0 0aLAI 0aDBH 0aVsf 0aJs 0aSAplot 0aAG1 aXi, Benye1 aClothier, Brent1 aWang, Ye1 aLi, Guangde1 aJia, Liming0 tForest ecology and management.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 448 p.445-456dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245018200160300001600342500001900358520153600377592002801913650002501941650002201966650000801988650001701996650003302013650001502046650001402061650001102075650002102086650001202107650001002119700001102129700001202140700001402152700001402166700001202180700001302192773013502205856008102340852000902421655001202430IND60709020020221120183546.0200902e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070902002DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437200501802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Y.14aThe Effect of Co-Transforming Eucalyptus urophylla Catechol-O-methyltransferase and Caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase on the Biosynthesis of Lignin Monomers in Transgenic Tobacco  ap. 879-887.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHere, the regulatory effects of co-transforming catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and ca-ffeoyl‑CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) isolated from Eucalyptus urophylla S. T. Blake on the biosynthesis of lignin monomers were investigated using a tobacco as a model system. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants were separately transformed with sense EuCOMT and full-length interfering RNA of EuCCoAOMT, and co-transformed with both EuCOMT and EuCCoAOMT respectively. The target genes’ expression levels, the lignin, lignin monomer and cellulose contents, and the anatomical structures of the stems in transgenic tobacco lines were determined. The expression of EuCOMT was detected, and a significant inhibition of tobacco’s native CCoAOMT expression was triggered by the full-length interfering RNA of EuCCoAOMT in transgenic tobacco plants. No significant differences were observed in stem diameter at both the 5th and 7th nodes among transgenic and wild type plants, nor in the xylem cell area or cell wall thickness at the 7th node of the stem. Compared with wild-type plants, the changes in the lignin and cellulose contents in transgenic plants were less than 10%. The G-lignin content of the co-transformed transgenic plants decreased by 57.38%, resulting in a 114.94% increase in the S/G ratio. Thus, the suppression of CCoAOMT’s expression substantially inhibited the synthesis of G-lignin, and the optimal directional regulatory effect on the S/G ratio was observed in plants co-regulated by EuCOMT and EuCCoAOMT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus urophylla 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aRNA 3abiosynthesis 3acatechol O-methyltransferase 3acell walls 3acellulose 3alignin 3aplant physiology 3atobacco 3axylem1 aLi, J.1 aLiu, H.1 aZhang, Y.1 aZhang, X.1 aQin, Z.1 aChen, B.0 tRussian journal of plant physiology.g2020 Sept., v. 67, no. 5 p.879-887dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl3870074x1021-44377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10214437200501803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05015naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011900164520287700283592002803160650002103188650002503209650001103234650001203245650001503257650001203272650001303284650001303297650002203310650001603332650002503348650002403373650001603397650001403413650001203427650002003439650001603459650001703475650001103492650001203503650001903515650002103534650001403555650001803569650002503587650002603612650001303638650001503651653001003666653001703676653001403693653001303707653002403720653002503744653002403769653001503793700001503808700005903823700001403882700002003896700001803916700001403934700001303948700001503961700001603976700001403992700001304006700001604019773010304035856008604138852000904224655001204233IND60736069720221119073105.0220110e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073606972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.1058452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Li10aBiochemical and metabolic responses of the deep-sea mussel Bathymodiolus platifrons to cadmium and copper exposure  aGreater interest in commercial deep-sea mining has been accompanied by mounting environmental concerns, including metal contamination resulting from mining activities. However, little is known about the toxic effects of metal exposure on deep-sea life. Given its ability to accumulate metals from the surrounding environment, its wide distribution at both vents and seeps, and its high abundance, the deep-sea mussel Bathymodiolus platifrons could serve as an ideal model to investigate the toxicological responses of deep-sea organisms to metal exposure. Here, we evaluated metal accumulation, traditional metal-related biomarkers, namely acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione, metallothioneins, and malondialdehyde, as well as metabolic profiles in the gills of B. platifrons after a 7-day exposure to copper (100 μg/L), cadmium (500 μg/L), or copper-plus-cadmium treatments (100 μg/L Cu and 500 μg/L Cd). Metal exposure concentrations selected in this study can be found in deep-sea hydrothermal environments. Metal exposure resulted in significant metal accumulation in the gills of the mussel, indicating that B. platifrons has promise for use as an indicator of deep-sea metal pollution levels. Traditional biomarkers (AKP, ACP, and measured antioxidants) revealed cellular injury and oxidative stress in mussels following metal exposure. Metabolic responses in the three treatment groups indicated that metal exposure perturbed osmoregulation, energy metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism in mussels, in a response marked by differentially altered levels of amino acids, hypotaurine, betaine, succinate, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, guanosine, guanosine 5′-monophosphate, and inosine. Nevertheless, several uniquely altered metabolites were found in each treatment exposure group, suggesting dissimilar modes of toxicity between the two metal types. In the Cd-exposed group, the monosaccharide D-allose, which is involved in suppressing mitochondrial ROS production, was downregulated, a response consistent with oxidative stress in Cd-exposed B. platifrons. In the Cu-exposed group, the detected alterations in dopamine, dopamine-related, and serotonin-related metabolites together suggest disturbed neurotransmission in Cu-exposed B. platifrons. In the Cu-plus-Cd group, we detected a decline in fatty acid levels, implying that exposure to both metals jointly exerted a negative influence on the physiological functioning of the mussel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate changes in metabolite profiles in Bathymodiolus mussels exposed to metal. The findings reported here advance our understanding of the adverse impact of metal exposure on deep-sea life and can inform deep-sea mining assessments through the use of multiple biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aallose 3abetaine 3abiomarkers 3acadmium 3acatalase 3adopamine 3aenergy metabolism 3afatty acids 3afructose 6-phosphate 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3aglutathione 3aguanosine 3ainosine 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3amodels 3amussels 3aosmoregulation 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3asuccinic acid 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asynaptic transmission 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 0aMetal 0aMetabolomics 0aMytilidae 0aDeep-sea 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aPhysiological stress 0aEnvironment monitor 0aToxicology1 aLi, Mengna1 aZhong, Zhaoshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1643-54071 aChen, Hao1 aWang, Xiaocheng1 aWang, Minxiao1 aXu, Zheng1 aCao, Lei1 aLian, Chao1 aZhang, Huan1 aWang, Hao1 aSun, Yan1 aLi, Chaolun0 tAquatic toxicology.g2021 July, v. 236 p.105845-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.1058453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03849naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006900151245014200220520202800362592002802390650002202418650001402440650001702454650002902471650001902500650001502519650001402534650001902548650001402567650001202581650001402593650001702607650001502624650002002639650002802659650001302687650001502700650001402715651001102729653001202740653002502752653001902777653001402796653002502810653001202835653001102847700002902858700002302887700003402910700006202944700002303006700003203029773010303061856008603164852000903250655001203259IND60736069820221119073156.0220110e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073606982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.1058462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaustino, Lucemberg Sales1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2721-882X10aEffects of the toxic dinoflagellates Prorocentrum lima and Ostreopsis cf. ovata on immune responses of cultured oysters Crassostrea gasar  aOyster production in Brazil has been highlighted as an important economic activity and is directly impacted by the quality of the environment, which is largely the result of human interference and climate change. Harmful algal blooms occur in aquatic ecosystems worldwide, including coastal marine environments which have been increasing over the last decades as a result of global change and anthropogenic activities. In this study, the native oysters Crassostrea gasar from Northeast of Brazil were exposed to two toxic benthic dinoflagellate species, Prorocentrum lima and Ostreopsis cf. ovata. Their respective effects on C. gasar physiology and defense mechanisms were investigated. Oyster hemocytes were first exposed in vitro to different concentrations of both dinoflagellate species to assess their effects on hemocyte functions, such as phagocytosis, production of reactive oxygen species, as well as mortality. Results highlighted an alteration of hemocyte phagocytosis and viability in presence of O. cf. ovata, whereas P. lima did not affect the measured hemocyte functions. In a second experiment, oysters were exposed for 4 days in vivo to toxic culture of O. cf. ovata to assess its effects on hemocyte parameters, tissues damages and pathogenic Perkinsus spp. infection. An increase in hemocyte mortality was also observed in vivo, associated with a decrease of ROS production. Histopathological analyses demonstrated a thinning of the epithelium of the digestive tubules of the digestive gland, inflammatory reaction and a significant increase in the level of infection by Perkinsus spp. in oysters exposed to O. cf. ovata. These results indicate that oysters C. gasar seem to be pretty resilient to an exposure to P. lima and may be more susceptible to O. cf. ovata. Furthermore, the latter clearly impaired oyster physiology and defense mechanisms, thus highlighting that harmful algal blooms of O. cf. ovata could potentially lead to increased susceptibility of C. gasar oysters to parasite infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea gasar 3aPerkinsus 3aProrocentrum 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate change 3aepithelium 3ahemocytes 3ahistopathology 3amortality 3aoysters 3aparasites 3aphagocytosis 3aphysiology 3apoisonous algae 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3aviability 3aBrazil 0aBivalve 0aHarmful algal blooms 0aHistopathology 0aHemocytes 0aToxic dinoflagellate 0aBenthic 0aOyster1 aQueiroga, Fernando Ramos1 aHégaret, Hélène1 aMarques-Santos, Luis Fernando1 aNeves, Raquel A.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2627-96661 aNascimento, Silvia1 ada Silva, Patrícia Mirella0 tAquatic toxicology.g2021 July, v. 236 p.105846-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.1058463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001500171245008000186300001800266520118700284592002801471650002901499650002501528650001501553650001901568650001401587650001301601650001201614650001701626650000901643650001501652650001701667650002101684650001101705650001001716650001201726650001601738650001401754650001601768650003401784650001701818650005601835650003601891650004901927650004101976650002302017650004902040653002302089653002502112653001602137653001202153653001702165700001902182700001602201700001702217700001402234700001602248773011102264856008702375852000902462655001202471IND50060632420221118023310.0190402e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006063242DNAL7 a234112292pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.11.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Yutuo10aSimple, fast, and efficient process for producing and purifying trehalulose  ap. 1183-1188.  aA new property of recombinant trehalose synthase (GTase) from Thermus thermophilus HB-8 (ATCC 27634) was found and described in this study. GTase can act on sucrose and catalyze trehalulose formation without isomaltose, isomaltulose, or isomelezitose, releasing small amounts of glucose and fructose as byproducts. Maximum trehalulose yield (approximately 81%) was obtained at an optimum temperature of 65°C and was independent of substrate concentration. A simple, fast, and efficient method of producing and purifying trehalulose is then described. In the first step, GTase catalyzed trehalulose formation using a 20% sucrose substrate. Miscellaneous sugars were then rapidly removed, while trehalulose was completely preserved by Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Finally, the cells were separated by centrifugation, and salt ions were removed by an ion-exchange resin, subsequently obtaining a high-purity trehalulose solution. A trehalulose recovery rate of over 95% was achieved using this process. This method has a simple process, fast separation efficiency, and low investment in production equipment, so greatly to improve production efficiency and reduce production costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aThermus thermophilus 3abyproducts 3acentrifugation 3aequipment 3afructose 3aglucose 3aion exchange 3aions 3aisomaltose 3aisomaltulose 3aproduction costs 3aresins 3asalts 3asucrose 3atemperature 3atrehalose 3atrehalulose 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistry 2aBiocatalysis 2aDisaccharidesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aGlucosyltransferasesxchemistry 2aIndustrial Microbiologyxeconomicsxmethods. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolism 2aSucrosexchemistry 2aThermus thermophilusxchemistryxenzymology. 0aTrehalose synthase 0aThermus thermophilus 0aTrehalulose 0aSucrose 0aPurification1 aLiang, Jiayuan1 aHuang, Ying1 aLei, Panxian1 aDu, Liqin1 aHuang, Ribo0 tFood chemistry.g2013 June 01, v. 138, no. 2-3 p.1183-1188dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.11.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245009500161300001400256520131600270592002801586650001301614650001701627650001001644650002401654650002501678650001501703650002001718650001901738650002201757651001301779653002601792653001901818653001901837653002701856773012801883856007702011852000902088655001202097IND60767439120221118032302.0220216e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076743912DNAL7 a10.2982/028.110.02012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWerema, Chacha14aThe Avifauna of a Naturally Regenerating Secondary Forest, Pangani, North-Eastern Tanzania  ap. 77-85.  aAs humans modify native ecosystems with increasing frequency, natural habitats including forests are lost. Under such circumstances, secondary forests can increasingly be important to conservation of biodiversity at landscape scales. However, in East Africa, little is known about avian community composition in regenerating secondary forests. In this study, avian diversity of a regenerating secondary forest was assessed in Pangani, northeastern Tanzania, using point counts. Sixty point counts were conducted for a duration of 12 days in about 90 ha of the regenerating secondary forest. Thirty species were found to utilise the regenerating secondary forest, of which 12 are categorized as forest-dependent species, and 12 were forest visitors. Using the same sampling effort in the adjoining riverine forest, there were 42 bird species, of which 11 and 13 were forest-dependent species and forest visitors, respectively. These results suggest that the regenerating secondary forest provided a habitat for a number of bird species including forest-dependent species and a few intra-African migrants, and it is thus of conservation value, at least at a local scale. Maintaining such regenerating secondary forests can provide greater landscape connectivity for the survival and, possibly, dispersal of birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aavifauna 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3acommunity structure 3ahabitat connectivity 3alandscapes 3anatural history 3ariparian areas 3asecondary forests 3aTanzania 0abiodiversity recovery 0abird diversity 0acoastal forest 0aforest-dependent birds0 tJournal of East African natural history.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 110, no. 2 p.77-85dNature KenyawJournal:19739x1026-16137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2982/028.110.02013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04014naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245015700172520235300329592002802682650003902710650002502749650004102774650000902815650001202824650003102836650000902867650001502876650001702891650001502908650002202923650001802945650001302963650003002976650002003006650001703026650003203043650001303075650001203088651001403100653001503114653003103129653002903160653001503189700006403204700002703268773010803295856008403403852000903487655001203496IND60736070520221119023712.0210619e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073607052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2021.1050222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeralta, Guillermo10aSoil compaction alleviation by deep non-inversion tillage and crop yield responses in no tilled soils of the Pampas region of Argentina. A meta-analysis  aNo till is considered part of the good management practices recommended in conservation agriculture. Regardless of the benefits of this practice, shallow compaction or soil hardening by farm machinery traffic can lead to soil constraints to crop growth. Deep non-inversion tillage could be proposed together with other practices to alleviate this soil compaction. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed experimental results (32 field studies) obtained throughout the Pampas Region focused on the immediate effects and duration of soil mechanical alleviation measured by relevant soil physical properties and by the impact on maize and soybean yield. Treatments were classified in: a) Control (no tilled soils), and b) Subsoiled (no tilled soil subjected to mechanical compaction alleviation by deep non-inversion tillage). Data were analyzed by comparing pairs of the same experiment (t-paired test). The response to compaction alleviation (Δ Subsoiled - Control) for different soil variables was related to soil and climate and agricultural history management. Deep non-inversion tillage significantly decreased soil bulk density (0−0.20 m; P < 0.0001; -4.3 % in average), increased infiltration rate fivefold (Δ = +213 mm.h⁻¹) and decreased soil penetration resistance in the 0−0.20 m layer 44 % in average (Δ = -0.86 MPa). Soil penetrometer resistance profiles (0 to 0.4 m) of Control situations peaked at 0.15−0.20 m. This peak disappeared in deep tillage, showing significant penetration resistance decreases at these layers. Soil compaction alleviation works had a durability of not more than 17 months (±2.8 months) after being performed. Deep non-inversion tillage enhanced soybean yields (26 % on average; Δ = +561 kg. ha⁻¹; P < 0.0001), mainly in yields lower than 2000 kg. ha⁻¹, usually associated with clay soils. In maize, mean responses to deep non-inversion tillage were only 6% (Δ = +567 kg. ha⁻¹; P < 0.0001). Considering these results, deep non-inversion tillage could be a promising practice to close rainfed crop yield gaps in the region. Nevertheless, due to its low durability in time, it is strategic to incorporate further compaction prevention and structural regeneration practices such as cover crops, diversified crop rotations and controlled traffic according to soil and environment characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural conservation practice 3aagricultural history 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3aclay 3aclimate 3acontrolled traffic systems 3acorn 3acrop yield 3adeep tillage 3adurability 3ainfiltration rate 3ameta-analysis 3aresearch 3aresistance to penetration 3asoil compaction 3asoil density 3asoil penetration resistance 3asoybeans 3atraffic 3aArgentina 0aNo tillage 0aDeep non-inversion tillage 0aSoil physical properties 0aCrop yield1 aAlvarez, Carina Rosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4590-79011 aTaboada, Miguel Ángel0 tSoil & tillage research.g2021 July, v. 211 p.105022-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.1050223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245009100170300001600261520125100277592002801528650002101556650001601577650002001593650001201613650001901625650001901644650001901663650001401682650002001696653003001716653003801746653001701784653001901801653002001820700001901840700001701859700002201876700002001898773011201918856008302030852000902113655001202122IND60087544820221121200837.0161023e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008754482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Luong N.10aRemoval of emerging trace organic contaminants by MBR-based hybrid treatment processes  ap. 474-482.  aThe aim of this study was to demonstrate the complementarity of combining membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment with UV oxidation or high pressure membrane filtration processes such as nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) for the removal of trace organic contaminants (TrOC). The results suggest that the removal mechanisms of TrOC by either UV oxidation or NF/RO membrane filtration differ significantly from those of an MBR system. Thus, they can complement MBR treatment very well to significantly improve the removal of TrOC. MBR treatment can effectively remove hydrophobic and readily biodegradable hydrophilic TrOC. The remaining hydrophilic and biologically persistent TrOC were shown to be effectively removed by either UV oxidation or NF/RO membrane filtration. The combination of MBR with UV oxidation or NF/RO membrane filtration resulted in a removal ranging from 85% to complete removal (or removal to below the analytical detection limit) of all 22 TrOC selected in this study. In particular, it is noteworthy that although MBR treatment and direct UV oxidation separately achieved low removal of carbamazepine (a widely reported problematic compound), the combination of these two processes resulted in more than 96% removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3abioreactors 3adetection limit 3ahybrids 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ananofiltration 3aoxidation 3areverse osmosis 0aMembrane bioreactor (MBR) 0aTrace organic contaminants (TrOC) 0aUV oxidation 0aNanofiltration 0aReverse osmosis1 aHai, Faisal I.1 aKang, Jinguo1 aPrice, William E.1 aNghiem, Long D.0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Nov., v. 85 p.474-482dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245012600164500001400290520144100304592002801745650001601773650001801789650001101807650002201818650002801840650001601868650001501884650001501899650001101914650001201925650001301937650002101950650001001971650001401981650001601995651001202011700002102023700001802044700002402062700002502086700002002111773012002131856007902251852000902330655001202339IND60729316320221121050406.0210228e20210219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072931632DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120201802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMöth, Stefan 10aUnexpected Effects of Local Management and Landscape Composition on Predatory Mites and Their Food Resources in Vineyards  aNAL-light  aViticultural practices and landscape composition are the main drivers influencing biological pest control in vineyards. Predatory mites, mainly phytoseiid (Phytoseiidae) and tydeoid mites (Tydeidae), are important to control phytophagous mites (Tetranychidae and Eriophyidae) on vines. In the absence of arthropod prey, pollen is an important food source for predatory mites. In 32 paired vineyards located in Burgenland/Austria, we examined the effect of landscape composition, management type (organic/integrated), pesticide use, and cover crop diversity of the inter-row on the densities of phytoseiid, tydeoid, and phytophagous mites. In addition, we sampled pollen on vine leaves. Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten was the main phytoseiid mite species and Tydeus goetzi Schruft the main tydeoid species. Interestingly, the area-related acute pesticide toxicity loading was higher in organic than in integrated vineyards. The densities of phytoseiid and tydeoid mites was higher in integrated vineyards and in vineyards with spontaneous vegetation. Their population also profited from an increased viticultural area at the landscape scale. Eriophyoid mite densities were extremely low across all vineyards and spider mites were absent. Biological pest control of phytophagous mites benefits from less intensive pesticide use and spontaneous vegetation cover in vineyard inter-rows, which should be considered in agri-environmental schemes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEriophyidae 3aTetranychidae 3aTydeus 3aTyphlodromus pyri 3abiological pest control 3acover crops 3alandscapes 3apesticides 3apollen 3aspiders 3atoxicity 3avegetation cover 3avines 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3aAustria1 aWalzer, Andreas 1 aRedl, Markus 1 aPetrović, Božana 1 aHoffmann, Christoph 1 aWinter, Silvia 0 tInsects.g2021 Feb. 19, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120201803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100004300150245014300193300001600336500001500352520155900367592002801926650003801954650001101992650001102003650002602014650001402040650001602054650001002070651001102080651001102091653001302102653001702115653001602132653003502148653000902183653002802192700002502220700003302245700002302278773011302301856005102414852000902465655001202474IND50087079020221120185953.0140412e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008707902DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2012.7183632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Oliveira-Carvalho, Maria De Fátima10aPhylogenetic analysis of Codium species from Brazil, with the description of the new species C. pernambucensis (Bryopsidales, Chlorophyta)  ap. 355-365.  a2019-12-05  aThe genus Codium comprises c. 125 species widely distributed in marine coastal environments throughout the world. Due to morphological plasticity, the taxonomic delimitation of Codium species can be difficult. Sequences of the first exon of the large subunit of RUBISCO (rbcL) have been used in the molecular delimitation of species and for phylogenetic purposes. In the present study, we complement previous morphological work on Brazilian Codium species with molecular systematics. Based on the partial rbcL sequences, seven species are recognized along the Brazilian coast: C. decorticatum, C. intertextum, C. isthmocladum, C. profundum, C. spongiosum, C. taylorii and the new species Codium pernambucensis. Ten unique sequences were obtained among the samples examined, which we used in combination with previously published sequences to infer molecular phylogenies using various methods. The resulting trees showed three principal monophyletic groupings: Clade A with species having a prostrate habit, not branched, and mostly with small, grouped utricles; Clade B primarily consisting of upright species with cylindrical branches and large individual utricles; and Clade C composed of upright species with cylindrical branches that are slightly flattened, and have intermediate-sized individual utricles. The Brazilian species grouped with morphologically similar taxa from other geographic localities, and are present in all three main clades. A new sprawling species, Codium pernambucensis is described based on morphology and molecular analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3afruits 3aCodium 3amolecular systematics 3amonophyly 3anew species 3aexons 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0ataxonomy 0aBryopsidales 0aChlorophyta 0aCodium pernambucensis sp. nov. 0arbcL 0amolecular phylogenetics1 aOliveira, Mariana C.1 aPereira, Sonia Maria Barreto1 aVerbruggen, Heroen0 tEuropean journal of phycology.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 47, no. 4 p.355-365dTaylor & Francis Groupx1469-44337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2012.718363  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015400167300001800321520171700339592002802056650001602084650002702100650002402127650001402151650001602165650002002181650002002201650001502221650001102236650001602247650002302263650000902286651001802295700002202313700002202335700001702357773010502374856008102479990002302560852000902583655001202592IND60096195020221121075334.0141104e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009619502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csr.2011.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, J.M.10aComposition and daytime vertical distribution of the ichthyoplankton assemblage in the Central Cantabrian Sea shelf, during summer: An Eulerian study  ap. 1462-1473.  aDuring summer, wind driven coastal upwelling dominates in the Central Cantabrian Sea (southern Bay of Biscay). Nevertheless, atmospheric forcing is highly variable and wind pulses may cause noticeable and fast hydrographic responses in the shelf region. In this paper, the composition and vertical distribution of the summer ichthyoplankton assemblage during the daytime at a fixed station, located on the Central Cantabrian Sea shelf, are documented. Also, the impact of a short-time scale hydrographic event on the abundance and structure of the larval fish assemblage is examined. Significant small-scale temporal hydrographic variability was observed. Currents showed changes in speed and direction and significant changes in thermocline depth were also observed. A total of 34 taxa of fish larvae were identified. Engraulis encrasicolus eggs and larvae of the shelf-dwelling species Trachurus trachurus, Capros aper and E. encrasicolus dominated the ichthyoplankton assemblage. The distribution of E. encrasicolus eggs and fish larvae was vertically structured. E. encrasicolus egg concentration increased exponentially towards the surface. Fish larvae showed a subsurface peak of concentration and their vertical distribution was not conditioned by thermocline depths. The short term hydrographic event did not affect the vertical distribution of fish larvae but it accounted for significant temporal changes in larval fish assemblage structure and abundance. Results suggest that temperature and light intensity are important factors in the vertical distribution of fish larvae. They also indicate that the temporal monitoring of the larval fish assemblage in this region requires multiple sampling sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapros aper 3aEngraulis encrasicolus 3aTrachurus trachurus 3afish eggs 3afish larvae 3aichthyoplankton 3alight intensity 3amonitoring 3asummer 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3awind 3aBay of Biscay1 aGonzalez-Pola, C.1 aLopez-Urrutia, A.1 aNogueira, E.0 tContinental shelf research.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 31, no. 14 p.1462-1473dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2011.06.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012000165300001200285500001900297520168300316592002801999596008602027596008602113596007202199596005702271596005702328596006902385650002202454650001302476650001802489650001902507650002202526650001702548650003302565650001102598650002202609650001202631700002002643700002402663700001802687700002102705700001702726700005902743773011002802856008302912852000902995655001203004IND60702409320221116163325.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070240932DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-020-01357-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSha, Tim Wai10aInfluenza A virus NS1 optimises virus infectivity by enhancing genome packaging in a dsRNA-binding dependent manner  ap. 107.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBACKGROUND: The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A virus (IAV) is a key player in inhibiting antiviral response in host cells, thereby facilitating its replication. However, other roles of NS1, which are independent of antagonising host cells’ antiviral response, are less characterised. METHODS: To investigate these unidentified roles, we used a recombinant virus, which lacks NS1 expression, and observed its phenotypes during the infection of antiviral defective cells (RIG-I KO cells) in the presence or absence of exogeneous NS1. Moreover, we used virus-like particle (VLP) production system to further support our findings. RESULTS: Our experiments demonstrated that IAV deficient in NS1 replicates less efficiently than wild-type IAV in RIG-I KO cells and this replication defect was complemented by ectopic expression of NS1. As suggested previously, NS1 is incorporated in the virion and participates in the regulation of viral transcription and translation. Using the VLP production system, in which minigenome transcription or viral protein production was unaffected by NS1, we demonstrated that NS1 facilitates viral genome packaging into VLP, leading to efficient minigenome transfer by VLP. Furthermore, the incorporation of NS1 and the minigenome into VLP were impaired by introducing a point mutation (R38A) in the double stranded RNA-binding domain of NS1. CONCLUSION: These results suggest a novel function of NS1 in improving genome packaging in a dsRNA binding-dependent manner. Taken together, NS1 acts as an essential pro-viral regulator, not only by antagonizing host immunity but also by facilitating viral replication and genome packaging.  aPublisher supplied data  a24115004cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan  a19H04831cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan  a19fk0108081h1001cJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development  a18H02344cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a19K22529cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a18KK0232cFund for the Promotion of Joint International Research 3aInfluenza A virus 3aimmunity 3apathogenicity 3apoint mutation 3aprotein synthesis 3aviral genome 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3avirion 3avirus replication 3aviruses1 aWeber, Michaela1 aKasumba, Dacquin M.1 aNoda, Takeshi1 aNakano, Masahiro1 aKato, Hiroki1 aFujita, Takashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9961-05350 tVirology journal.g2020 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.107-107dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01357-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002100191245010400212300001400316500001900330506007600349520096400425592002801389506003701417650002601454650001501480650002001495650001601515653001501531653001801546653001401564653001901578653001601597653001501613700002101628700002401649700002401673700002201697773008801719856008501807852000901892655001201901IND60568181720221207110731.0200607e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056818172DNAL7 a286165052pmid7 aPMC54541462pmcid7 a10.1016/j.onehlt.2017.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngelos, John A.10aOne Health in food safety and security education: Subject matter outline for a curricular framework  ap. 56-65.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEducating students in the range of subjects encompassing food safety and security as approached from a One Health perspective requires consideration of a variety of different disciplines and the interrelationships among disciplines.

This subject matter outline should help guide curriculum development and education in One Health in food safety and security and provides useful information for educators, researchers, students, and public policy-makers facing the inherent challenges of maintaining and/or developing safe and secure food supplies without destroying Earth's natural resources.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOne Health initiative 3acurriculum 3afood production 3afood safety 0aOne Health 0aFood security 0aEducation 0aSubject matter 0aEnvironment 0aEcosystems1 aArens, Amanda L.1 aJohnson, Heather A.1 aCadriel, Jessica L.1 aOsburn, Bennie I.0 tOne health.g2017 June, v. 3 p.56-65dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23485x2352-77147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2017.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245015100167520119800318592002801516650002901544650001301573650002401586650001601610650001701626650001001643650001401653650001201667650001801679650001601697650003901713650001201752650001001764700001801774700001401792700001901806700001801825700001701843700001901860773012201879856008102001852000902082655001202091IND60783931420221120061142.0220726e20220713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078393142DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120716732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Chengzhi 10aCharacterization of a Wheat-Dasypyrum breviaristatum Chromosome Addition and Its Derived Progenies Carrying Novel Dasypyrum-Specific Gliadin Genes  aThe construction of the 28-chromosome karyotype of Dasypyrum breviaristatum was undertaken using multicolor non-denaturing fluorescent in situ hybridization (ND-FISH) and Oligo-FISH painting protocols. A novel wheat-D. breviaristatum line D2138 contained 44 chromosomes including a pair of D. breviaristatum 6VᵇS.2VᵇL translocation chromosomes. Individual F₂ and F₃ progenies of a cross between D2138 with wheat lines CM62, MY11 and JM22, respectively, were characterized using ND-FISH and molecular markers. A relatively high chromosome alteration rate within wheat and D. breviaristatum 6VᵇS and 2VᵇL was observed in the three progeny populations, suggesting that chromosome 6VᵇS.2VᵇL has a gametocidal-like gene. The different types of translocation and deletion lines allowed localization of D. breviaristatum-specific gliadin coding genes on sub-telomeric regions of 6VᵇS by PCR and acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The positive effect of the D. breviaristatum 6VᵇS on agronomic and quality characters was also demonstrated. The new wheat-D. breviaristatum 6VᵇS and 2VᵇL translocation lines will be useful as novel germplasm for breeding purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDasypyrum breviaristatum 3aagronomy 3achromosome addition 3achromosomes 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agermplasm 3agliadin 3ahybridization 3akaryotyping 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprogeny 3awheat1 aJiang, Wenxi 1 aLiu, Min 1 aWang, Hongjin 1 aYang, Ennian 1 aYang, Zujun 1 aLi, Guangrong 0 tAgronomy.g2022 July 13, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120716733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245010300166500001400269520148200283592002801765650001801793650001501811650000801826650002301834650002501857650001201882650001101894650001501905650001801920650001901938650002601957651001001983700002801993700002902021700002902050700002402079700002102103700002802124700002102152700002302173773012002196856007902316852000902395655001202404IND60729316620221121050441.0210228e20210221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072931662DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120201832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuarez, Jose  G.14aThe Eco-Bio-Social Factors That Modulate Aedes aegypti Abundance in South Texas Border Communities  aNAL-light  aAedes aegypti control requires dedicated resources that are usually scarce, limiting the reach and sustainability of vector control programs. This generates a need to focus on areas at risk of disease transmission and also understand the factors that might modulate local mosquito abundance. We evaluated the eco-bio-social factors that modulate indoor and outdoor relative abundance of female Ae. aegypti in communities of South Texas. We conducted housing quality and Knowledge Attitudes and Practices surveys in households that were part of a weekly mosquito surveillance program in November of 2017 and 2018. Our results showed widespread knowledge of mosquitoes and Zika virus by our participants. However, less than 35% considered them as serious problems in this region. The presence of window-mounted air conditioning units increased the risk of female mosquito relative abundance indoors. An increase in outdoor relative abundance was associated with larger properties and a higher number of children between 6 to 17 years of age. Interestingly, we observed that an increasing number of children <5 years of age modulated both indoor and outdoor relative abundance, with a 52% increase indoors and 30% decrease outdoors. The low perception of mosquito and disease risk highlights engagement needs for vector-borne disease prevention in this region. The identified risk factors can help guide public health officials in their efforts to reduce human and vector contact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aZika virus 3aair 3adisease prevention 3adisease transmission 3afemales 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3avector control 3avector-borne diseases 3aTexas1 aGarcia-Luna, Selene  M.1 aMedeiros, Matthew  C.

We conducted a study to determine the effectiveness of BFCI in changing knowledge and attitudes towards exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and increasing the rates among HIV negative and HIV positive women in rural Kenya. METHODS: A community-based cluster-randomized controlled trial was implemented from April 2015 to December 2016 among 901 women enrolled across 13 clusters. The intervention groups received a minimum of 12 personalized home-based counselling sessions on infant feeding by trained community health volunteers from their first or second trimester of pregnancy until 6 months postpartum. Other interventions included education sessions at maternal child clinics, mother-to-mother support group meetings and bi-monthly baby-friendly gatherings targeting influencers. The control group received standard health education at the facility and during monthly routine home visits by community health volunteers not trained on BFCI. Primary outcome measures were the rates of EBF at week 1, months 2, 4 and 6 postpartum. Secondary outcomes included knowledge and attitudes regarding breastfeeding for HIV-exposed infants. Statistical methods included analysis of covariance and logistic regression. RESULTS: At 6 months, EBF rates among HIV negative mothers were significantly higher in the BFCI intervention arm compared to the control arm (81.7% versus 42.2% p = 0.001). HIV positive mothers in the intervention arm had higher EBF rates at 6 months than the control but the difference was not statistically significant (81.8% versus 58.4%; p = 0.504). In HIV negative group, there was greater knowledge regarding EBF for HIV-exposed infants in the intervention arm than in the control (92.1% versus 60.7% p = 0.001). Among HIV positive mothers, such knowledge was high among both the intervention and control groups (96% versus 100%, p > 0.1). HIV negative and positive mothers in the intervention arm had more favourable attitudes regarding EBF for HIV-exposed infants than the control (84.5% versus 62.1%, p = 0.001) and (94.6% versus 53.8% to p = 0.001) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: BFCI interventions can complement facility-based interventions to improve exclusive and continued breastfeeding knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours among HIV negative and positive women.  aPublisher supplied data  a(Grant # PGA2000003677/8cNIH and the USAID through the Partnership for Enhanced Engagement in Research (PEER) Health Program, administered by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to Kenyatta University and the African Population and Health Research Center 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aanalysis of covariance 3aattitudes and opinions 3abreast feeding 3achildren 3acommunity health 3acounseling 3ahealth education 3ainfant feeding 3ainfants 3amothers 3apregnancy 3arandomized clinical trials 3aregression analysis 3avolunteers 3awomen 3aKenya1 aYoung, Sera Lewise1 aWekesah, Frederick Murunga1 aWanjohi, Milkah Njeri1 aKimiywe, Judith1 aMuriuki, Peter1 aGriffiths, Paula L.1 aMcGarvey, Stephen T.1 aMadise, Nyovani Janet1 aKimani-Murage, Elizabeth W.0 tInternational breastfeeding journal.g2020 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.62-62dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001833x1746-43587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13006-020-00299-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245016700170300001600337520158300353592002801936653002701964653002501991653001702016653001602033700002302049700002102072700002102093700002302114773012202137856008402259852000902343655001202352IND60126645820221119064955.0151107e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012664582DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-95.2.2502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrbaneja, Alberto10aEffect of Temperature on Life History of Cirrospilus vittatus (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), an Ectoparasitoid of Phyllocnistis citrella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae)  ap. 250-255.  aCirrospilus vittatus is a generalist parasitoid detected on the invading Phyllocnistis citrella 1 yr after the introduction of this pest into Spain in 1993. In this study, the influence of temperature on parasitoid development, survival, and some selected life history parameters was determined. Development times shortened as the temperature increased from 15 to 30°°C, but increased between 30 and 35°°C. Larval development times varied the greatest over the range of temperatures, whereas egg development varied the least. The estimated upper and lower development thresholds were 38.2 and 8.2°°C, respectively, and the maximal developmental rate (8.75 d⁻⁻¹) occurred at 31.5°°C. The thermal constant was 275.1 ±± 4.6 degree-days. Cirrospilus vittatus appeared to be a synovigenic species. Mean fecundity at 25°°C was 39.17 eggs per female, and the oviposition rate fluctuated around five eggs per day. Superparasitism was quite common (42.8%), but fertility was high (85.6%). Immature C. vittatus survival was 58.1%. From these results, an intrinsic rate of increase of 0.126 females per female per day was estimated. Although under typical Mediterranean climatic conditions, development of C. vittatus could continue throughout the year, its reproductive fitness at 25°°C is lower than other leafminer parasitoids attacking P. citrella in Spain. These results could account for the progressive displacement observed in field populations occurring between C. vittatus and the predominant indigenous parasitoids of P. citrella, Cirrospilus sp. near lyncus.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPhyllocnistis citrella 0aCirrospilus vittatus 0alife history 0atemperature1 aHinarejos, Raúúl1 aLláácer, Elena1 aGarrido, Antonio1 aJacas, Josep-Anton0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2002 Apr., v. 95, no. 2 p.250-255dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0022-0493-95.2.2503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008000170300001600250520109600266592002801362650003201390650002201422650001601444650002101460650002101481653002601502653001301528653003201541653001601573653001401589653001701603700002201620700002501642700002001667700002401687700002001711773011601731856008301847852000901930655001201939IND60597571620221118125012.0180911e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059757162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2018.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaturvedi, Madhu10aEmerging Paradigm of Intracellular Targeting of G Protein-Coupled Receptors  ap. 533-546.  aG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) recognize a diverse array of extracellular stimuli, and they mediate a broad repertoire of signaling events involved in human physiology. Although the major effort on targeting GPCRs has typically been focused on their extracellular surface, a series of recent developments now unfold the possibility of targeting them from the intracellular side as well. Allosteric modulators binding to the cytoplasmic surface of GPCRs have now been described, and their structural mechanisms are elucidated by high-resolution crystal structures. Furthermore, pepducins, aptamers, and intrabodies targeting the intracellular face of GPCRs have also been successfully utilized to modulate receptor signaling. Moreover, small molecule compounds, aptamers, and synthetic intrabodies targeting β-arrestins have also been discovered to modulate GPCR endocytosis and signaling. Here, we discuss the emerging paradigm of intracellular targeting of GPCRs, and outline the current challenges, potential opportunities, and future outlook in this particular area of GPCR biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3acrystal structure 3aendocytosis 3ahuman physiology 3aoligonucleotides 0aallosteric modulators 0abarbadin 0aG protein-coupled receptors 0aintrabodies 0apepducins 0aβ-arrestins1 aSchilling, Justin1 aBeautrait, Alexandre1 aBouvier, Michel1 aBenovic, Jeffrey L.1 aShukla, Arun K.0 tTrends in biochemical sciences.g2018 July, v. 43, no. 7 p.533-546dElsevier LtdwJournal:6328x0968-00047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2018.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245011200163500001900275520134000294592002801634650001201662650001901674650001601693650000901709650001201718650001501730700002701745700002301772700002201795700002701817700002501844700002301869700002501892773011801917856007602035852000902111655001202120IND60729316820221121055635.0210228e20210122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072931682DNAL7 a10.3390/land100201012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLytkin, Vasylii 10aInfluence of Permafrost Landscapes Degradation on Livelihoods of Sakha Republic (Yakutia) Rural Communities  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aClimate change and the degradation of permafrost prove to be severe challenges for humanity. At present, the northern communities and those living in rural areas are already facing the consequences. This article is based on field research conducted in the Yunkyur, Olyokminsky, and Amginsky Districts of Sakha Republic (Yakutia) during 2018–2020. These settlements have one of the richest agricultural traditions in the region; however, the inhabitants of these villages now face serious consequences of permafrost degradation. The authors rely on a mixed set of methods and approaches, including sociological surveys, expert and in-depth interviewing, and appropriate archival and museum materials. Methodology of remote sensing and landscape–geocryological research was integrated. The resulting studies made it possible to demonstrate increasingly widespread thermokarst processes in the key areas studied. The authors determined that the degradation of permafrost has led to problems with the safety and development of the housing stock, especially deformation of houses and outbuildings, and reduction of areas suitable for construction. Territories affected by thermokarst also drop out of agricultural use. Finally, the authors identify some adaptation mechanisms to mitigate the effects of changes in permafrost landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSiberia 3aclimate change 3adeformation 3aland 3amuseums 3apermafrost1 aSuleymanov, Alexander 1 aVinokurova, Lilia 1 aGrigorev, Stepan 1 aGolomareva, Victoriya 1 aFedorov, Svyatoslav 1 aKuzmina, Aitalina 1 aSyromyatnikov, Igor 0 tLand.g2021 Jan. 22, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100201013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003500150245016700185300001600352520194400368592002802312650001402340650001402354650001102368650001102379650001402390650001602404650002502420650001202445650001202457651001402469651001102483651001602494653001402510653001402524653002402538653002302562653002402585653002302609653001102632653001702643653001602660653000902676653001402685653001502699653001302714700002402727700003302751700002102784700002302805773011302828856005102941852000902992655001203001IND50087079520221120185905.0140412e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008707952DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2012.7337342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Kantún, Jazmín J.10aBranched Halymenia species (Halymeniaceae, Rhodophyta) in the Indo-Pacific region, including descriptions of Halymenia hawaiiana sp. nov. and H. tondoana sp. nov.  ap. 421-432.  aSeveral species in the red algal genus Halymenia from the Indo-Pacific have been described with branched thalli, toothed margins, spinose proliferations on the blade, and a firm gelatinous texture. Previous works have synonymized many of these morphologically similar species with H. durvillei. Our increased taxon sampling and molecular data indicate that the taxonomy of the Indo-Pacific Halymenia species is in need of revision, and that several aspects of taxonomies proposed by previous authors now seem unlikely. Thus, the aim of the present work was to analyse species delimitation in branched Halymenia species. Molecular and morphological data for specimens from the coral triangle and peripheral Indo-Pacific localities (East African coast, Hawaii) were used to understand species delimitation for selected branched Halymenia spp. Phylogenetic analyses based on 29 rbcL gene sequences grouped the specimens in four well-supported clusters at the species level with high p-distances (2.7–5.3%). After the morphological analysis, five features were retained as diagnostic to identify the four species studied. Our analyses led to the recognition and description of two new species, H. hawaiiana from the Hawaiian Islands (previously erroneously called H. formosa) and H. tondoana from the Philippines. In addition, H. harveyana (currently treated as a subspecies of H. floresii in Australia) is reassessed and recognized at the species level. Specimens with seven orders of branching and a thick cortex (70–150 µm) formed a monophyletic group, including sequences from previous work, with mostly well-supported branches and with high p-distances at the species level. We propose to call this group the H. durvillei complex until further reassessment is completed. None of the sequences studied here grouped with H. floresii from the Mediterranean, suggesting that previous Indo-Pacific reports of the species were erroneous.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalymenia 3abranching 3acorals 3acortex 3amonophyly 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3atexture 3athallus 3aAustralia 3aHawaii 3aPhilippines 0aAustralia 0aHalymenia 0aHalymenia durvillei 0aHalymenia floresii 0aHalymenia hawaiiana 0aHalymenia tondoana 0aHawaii 0aIndo-Pacific 0aPhilippines 0arbcL 0ared algae 0aRhodophyta 0ataxonomy1 aSherwood, Alison R.1 aRiosmena-Rodríguez, Rafael,1 aHuisman, John M.1 aDe Clerck, Olivier0 tEuropean journal of phycology.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 47, no. 4 p.421-432dTaylor & Francis Groupx1469-44337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2012.733734  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245013500173300001400308520196400322592002802286653003902314653003602353653002902389653002202418653002702440700002702467700002002494700003302514700002802547700001502575700002102590773008502611856008202696852000902778655001202787IND60568182220221119111029.0170515e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056818222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apmt.2017.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTchalala, Mohamed R.10aHybrid electrolytes based on ionic liquids and amorphous porous silicon nanoparticles: Organization and electrochemical properties  ap. 10-20.  aIonic liquids (ILs) and ionic liquid-nanoparticle (IL-NP) hybrid electrolytes have garnered a lot of interest due to their unique properties that stimulate their use in various applications. Herein, we investigate the electrochemical and photo-physical properties of organic-inorganic hybrid electrolytes based on three imidazolium-based ionic liquids, i.e., 1-buthyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate ([bmim] [SCN]), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([emim] [BF4]) and 1-buthyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([bmim] [Ac]) that are covalently tethered to amorphous porous silicon nanoparticles (ap-Si NPs). We found that the addition of ap-Si NPs confer to the ILs a pronounced boost in the electrocatalytic activity, and in mixtures of ap-Si NPs and [bmim] [SCN], the room-temperature current transport is enhanced by more than 5 times compared to bare [bmim] [SCN]. A detailed structural investigation by transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed that the ap-Si NPs were well dispersed, stabilized and highly aggregated in [bmim] [SCN], [emim] [BF4] and [bmim] [Ac] ILs, respectively. These observations correlate well with the enhanced current transport observed in ap-Si NPs/[bmim] [SCN] evidenced by electrochemical measurements. We interpreted these observations by the use of UV–vis absorbance, photoluminescence (PL), FTIR and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. We found that the ap-Si NPs/[bmim] [SCN] hybrid stands out due to its stability and optical transparency. This behavior is attributed to the iron(III) thiocyanate complexion as per the experimental findings. Furthermore, we found that the addition of NPs to [emim] [BF4] alters the equilibrium of the IL, which consequently improved the stability of the NPs through intermolecular interactions with the two ionic layers (anionic and cationic layers) of the IL. While in the case of [bmim] [Ac], the dispersion of ap-Si NPs was restrained because of the high viscosity of this IL.  aPublisher supplied data 0aIonic liquid-nanoparticles hybrids 0aImidazolium-based ionic liquids 0aElectrochemical activity 0aCurrent transport 0aNanoparticle stability1 aEl-Demellawi, Jehad K.1 aAbou-Hamad, Edy1 aRetamal, José Ramón Durán1 aVaradhan, Purushothaman1 aHe, Jr-Hau1 aChaieb, Sahraoui0 tApplied Materials Today.g2017 Dec., v. 9 p.10-20dElsevier Ltdx2352-94077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apmt.2017.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01393naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245004300171300001600214520042100230592002800651650001700679650001400696650002800710650002300738653002800761653002400789653003400813700002400847773011600871856008300987852000901070655001201079IND60597571820221118125010.0180911e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059757182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2018.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEldeeb, Mohamed A.10aDoes Too Much MAGIC Lead to Mitophagy?  ap. 485-487.  aNeurodegeneration-associated hallmarks include an abundance of protein aggregates and amelioration of mitochondrial function.

Part 1 of this series offered a heat and mass transfer model developed for calculating the particles and drying gas conditions in a fluidized bed dryer. In this part, an algorithm was developed based on this model. The variation of parameters along the height of the dryer and versus drying time can be calculated. The results of the simulation have been validated by using experimental data from a pilot plant fluidized bed dryer with agricultural seeds. We found that the method of determining the logarithmic temperature difference greatly influences the values of the drying parameters and thus the drying time and the height of the desorption zone.  aThis work was supported by Hungarian Ministry of Human Capacities (NTP-NFTÖ-20-B-0015).

Thermal drying is energy intensive due to the unavoidable thermodynamic constraint of supplying sufficient energy to provide the latent heat of evaporation (> 2000 kJ kg⁻¹) for the removal of water vapor. There is a critical need to reduce the overall energy consumption in drying, and several methods to do so have been explored. Most energy saving approaches for convective drying are based on heat recovery from the exhaust stream, because a significant amount of heat used in drying appears in the exhaust stream. Different techniques have been attempted to reduce energy consumption in different types of dryers (gas-fired, electrical, and heat pump dryers). This paper focuses on the literature addressing drying theory and the underlying mass, species, and heat transfer phenomena, identification of the most energy-consuming steps in the process, assessment of the potential for energy savings, and the energy saving techniques considered in the literature. Insights gained from this study are used to identify the optimal techniques to minimize energy consumption and drying time for a variety of drying scenarios.  aThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this research from Alliance Laundry Systems, LLC, Ripon, WI, USA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclothing 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3afabrics 3aheat pumps 3aheat recovery 3alatent heat 3apharmaceutical industry 3awater vapor 0aDrying process 0awaste heat recovery 0atextile drying 0aheat pump dryer 0aair-vented dryers1 aGarimella, Srinivas0 tDrying technology.g2022 Aug. 1, v. 40, no. 11 p.2235-2250dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2021.19385993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014700167300001600314520134300330592002801673650001001701650001101711650001301722650001801735650002701753650001701780650001401797651001201811651001101823653002301834653002901857653001301886653002101899653002001920653002001940653001501960653002101975653001201996700002102008700002302029700002802052700002402080700002202104773011302126856005102239852000902290655001202299IND50087079820221120185936.0140412e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008707982DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2012.7365362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeiva, João10aFucus cottonii (Fucales, Phaeophyceae) is not a single genetic entity but a convergent salt-marsh morphotype with multiple independent origins  ap. 461-468.  aIn low-energy salt-marsh environments, Fucus spp. frequently exhibit an atypical morphology that is characterized by the absence of an anchoring holdfast and a trend towards reduced size and buoyancy, enhanced vegetative proliferation, and often the loss of sexual reproduction. Such forms, often referred to as ecads, presumably derive from typical attached forms, but their affinities are normally difficult to establish with confidence due to their simplified and largely convergent morphology. Minute salt-marsh forms growing partially embedded in the sediment occur on Atlantic and Pacific coasts and have traditionally been recognized as an independent entity, Fucus cottonii. In this study we analyse with four microsatellite loci two F. cottonii populations from salt-marshes of Oregon (NE Pacific) and Ireland (Europe, near the species type locality), as well as local populations of other Fucus spp. that could be considered potential source populations, either directly or via hybridization. Our results show that the F. cottonii from Oregon derive from F. gardneri whereas the Irish population is closer to F. spiralis. We conclude that F. cottonii is not a coherent genetic entity, but an artificial grouping of evolutionarily independent populations that converged into similar morphologies in different salt-marsh habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFucus 3acoasts 3ahabitats 3ahybridization 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asalt marshes 3asediments 3aIreland 3aOregon 0aclonal propagation 0aevolutionary convergence 0aFucaceae 0agenetic entities 0ahigh-intertidal 0amicrosatellites 0amorphotype 0asalt-marsh ecads 0aseaweed1 aHansen, Gayle I.1 aPearson, Gareth A.1 aVliet, Mirjam S.

Clarifying the response of LUCC to the GGP and its driving forces are basic premises to implement the GGP more effectively for alleviating soil erosion in this region. This study analyzed the spatio-temporal characteristics of conversion of cultivated land to forest land and grassland in two study periods of 2000–2010 and 2010–2018. The transition matrix model and the dynamic degree model were utilized to explore changes among cultivated land, forest land, and grassland based on the remote sensing (RS) and monitoring data of land use in 2000, 2010, and 2018. Secondly, further detection on driving forces of increase of forest land and grassland was conducted through the logistic regression model. Fourteen driving factors were selected: the GGP, elevation, slope, population density, GDP per land area, distance to city, distance to residential area, etc. The results revealed that: (1) Area of cultivated land was mainly transferred to forest land and grassland during two study periods. The conversion of cultivated land to forest land and grassland occupied 21.48% and 68.01% of outward-transferring area of cultivated land from 2000 to 2010, and accounted for 13.26% and 74.3% from 2010 to 2018; (2) From the results of the logistic regression model, elevation, the GGP, annual mean temperature, slope III (6–15°), and GDP per land area were the main driving forces from 2000 to 2010. Moreover, the most prominent driving forces were the GGP, elevation, rural population density, slope III (6–15°), and soil pH from 2010 to 2018. The findings of this study can help us better understand the conversion of cultivated land to forest land and grassland under the GGP and provide a scientific basis to facilitate sustainable development of land resources in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aforest land 3agrasslands 3aland use change 3aloess 3amodels 3apopulation density 3aregression analysis 3aresidential areas 3arural population 3asoil erosion 3asoil pH 3asustainable development 3atemperature1 aDeng, Yuanjie 1 aHou, Mengyang 1 aYao, Shunbo 0 tLand.g2021 Feb. 14, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100201943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245010600159500001900265520132000284592002801604650001901632650001401651650000901665650001601674650002201690650000901712650001501721650001601736650001701752650002201769700002201791773011801813856007601931852000902007655001202016IND60729317520221122061804.0210228e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072931752DNAL7 a10.3390/land100201962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jiawei 10aIntegrating Microclimate into Landscape Architecture for Outdoor Thermal Comfort: A Systematic Review  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGlobal climate change and urban heat island intensification are making many cities dangerously hot during heat waves and uncomfortably hot much of the time. Research has identified ways that urban environments can be designed to reduce the heat, but much of the information is too technical or has not been interpreted or communicated so as to be available to landscape architects. This study identifies ways that landscape architecture researchers have applied microclimate information in design to proactively create more thermally comfortable outdoor environments. A systematic review that assessed the growing recognition of microclimatic factors in design revealed four main approaches: principles and guidelines, strategies, mapping, and evaluation. The advantages and limitations of each have been noted, and a diagram has been developed that matches each approach with specific steps in the landscape architectural design process. The study also identified four areas where microclimate has potential for use in landscape architecture but that are currently not being very actively studied: education, modeling and visualization, policy, and ideation. Microclimatic design has the potential to enhance the health and well-being of the public through the design of thermally comfortable outdoor environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aeducation 3aheat 3aheat island 3aissues and policy 3aland 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3amicroclimate 3asystematic review1 aBrown, Robert D.,0 tLand.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100201963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245022900174300001600403520175000419592002802169650001602197650001902213650001702232650001702249650001802266650002202284650001402306653001602320653001002336653001602346653000902362653001902371653001602390653001702406653001002423653000902433700002202442773011302464856005102577852000902628655001202637IND50087080120221120200027.0140412e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008708012DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2012.7421402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeblond, Jeffrey D.10aMono- and digalactosyldiacylglycerol composition of dinoflagellates. V. The galactolipid profile of Alexandrium tamarense (Dinophyceae) during the course of infection by the parasitic syndinian dinoflagellate Amoebophrya sp.  ap. 490-497.  aAmoebophrya is a parasitic, syndinian dinoflagellate genus that must infect another host dinoflagellate in order to reproduce. Work by Park et al. [Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser., 227: 281–292 (2002)] has led to the hypothesis that Amoebophrya's development within a host cell nucleus disrupts the flow of genetic information involved in plastidial function. The possibility that genetic disruption by this parasite could lead to alterations in plastidial lipid composition during the course of an infection has not yet been elucidated. Our primary objective in this lipidomic study was to examine the chloroplast membrane galactolipid composition of Alexandrium tamarense infected by an Amoebophrya species in order to determine whether infection of A. tamarense causes a phenotypic alteration in the composition of mono- and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG and DGDG, respectively), two galactolipids that comprise the majority of photosynthetic membranes. Our secondary objective was to determine if non-photosynthetic Amoebophrya sp. either incorporated host cell MGDG and DGDG, and/or itself produced forms of MGDG and DGDG, as has been observed previously in heterotrophic apicomplexan parasites distantly related to Amoebophrya. We found that, despite development of Amoebophrya sp. within the nucleus, the composition of A. tamarense MGDG and DGDG did not change throughout the infection process. The predominant forms of these galactolipids were 18:5/18:4 (sn − 1/sn−2) and 20:5/18:4 DGDG, which were present at similar abundances in both an uninfected host and a host late in the infection process just prior to release of Amoebophrya sp. dinospores. Amoebophrya sp. did not possess appreciable amounts of any forms of MGDG and DGDG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlexandrium 3acell membranes 3acell nucleus 3achloroplasts 3agalactolipids 3alipid composition 3aparasites 0aAlexandrium 0aalgae 0aAmoebophrya 0aDGDG 0adinoflagellate 0aDinophyceae 0agalactolipid 0alipid 0aMGDG1 aDahmen, Jeremy L.0 tEuropean journal of phycology.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 47, no. 4 p.490-497dTaylor & Francis Groupx1469-44337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2012.742140  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012400175300001400299520176000313592002802073650002102101650001802122650002402140650001102164650001802175650001102193650002402204650003102228650001202259650000902271650001702280653001302297653000902310653001802319653002102337700002402358700002902382700002202411773015802433856008502591852000902676655001202685IND60568182920221119111131.0180907e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056818292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2017.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMollahosseini, Mehdi10aEffect of whey protein supplementation on long and short term appetite: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials  ap. 34-40.  aSpecific components of dairy, such as whey proteins may have beneficial effects on body composition by suppressing appetite, although the findings of existing studies have been inconsistent. Therefore, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed to investigate effect of whey protein supplementation on long and short term appetite. A systematic search was conducted to identify eligible publications. Means and SDs for hunger, fullness, satiety, desire to eat and prospective consumption of food, before and after intervention, were extracted and then composite appetite score (CAS) calculated. To pool data, either a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model and for assessing heterogeneity, Cochran's Q and I² tests were used. Eight publications met inclusion criteria that 5 records were on short term and 3 records on long term appetite. The meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in long term appetite by 4.13 mm in combined appetite score (CAS) (95% Confidence interval (CI): −6.57, −1.96; p = 0.001). No significant reduction in short term appetite was also seen (Mean difference (MD) = −0.39 95% CI = −2.07, 1.30; p = 0.653). Subgroup analyses by time showed that compared with carbohydrate, the reduction in appetite following consumption of whey consumption was not significant (MD = −0.39, 95% CI = −2.07, 1.3, p = 0.65, I² = 0.0%.)A significant reduction in prospective food consumption was seen (MD = −2.17, 95% CI = −3.86, −0.48). The results of our meta-analysis showed that whey protein may reduce the long and short term appetite, but our finding did not show any significant difference in appetite reduction between whey protein and carbohydrate in short duration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody composition 3acarbohydrates 3aconfidence interval 3ahunger 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aprotein supplements 3arandomized clinical trials 3asatiety 3awhey 3awhey protein 0aAppetite 0aWhey 0aMeta-analysis 0aBody composition1 aShab-Bidar, Sakineh1 aRahimi, Mohammad Hossein1 aDjafarian, Kurosh0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2017 Aug., v. 20 p.34-40dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2017.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03638naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245016900210300001400379520203800393592002802431650001602459650001902475650001302494650002102507650003302528650002102561650001602582650003302598650001502631650001202646650001902658651001302677653002702690653000802717653000702725653003102732653001302763700001902776700003202795700001802827700001902845700001702864700005602881700001602937773008502953856008503038852000903123655001203132IND60597572320221118125014.0200210e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059757232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2018.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Syed Nasar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9002-611012aA light and scanning electron microscopic diagnosis of leaf epidermal morphology and its systematic implications in Dryopteridaceae: Investigating 12 Pakistani taxa  ap. 36-49.  aDryopteris and Polystichum are the 2 complex taxonomic genera of Dryopteridaceae. The comparative foliar epidermal anatomy of 12 species of both genera from Pakistan were studied using standard protocols of light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The objective of which was systematic comparison and investigation to elucidate the taxonomic importance of foliar micromorphology, which may be useful to taxonomists for identifying complex Dryopteridaceae taxa. Principal component analysis and UPGMA clustering analysis were performed to test the validity of leaf anatomical features as method of separating species and genera. The foliar epidermal anatomy described here is a good source of taxonomic characters in both groups that can help genera and species delimitation. This is the first report on leaf micromorphology in most of these species. Observation of foliar anatomy showed that stomata are only present on the abaxial surface; i.e., leaves of all species are hypostomatic. The shapes of epidermal cells in all studied species are irregular. The anticlinal walls are strongly lobed, irregular wavy and elongated wavy. However, substantial variation in epidermal cell size and other stomatal features were observed on both upper and lower surfaces in all investigated species. Two types of stomata were observed in all studied species. The presence of polocytic stomata in Dryopteris and staurocytic stomata in Polystichum are the important characters for the segregation of these genera. Elongate elliptic stomatal shape, narrow kidney shaped guard cells and broad elliptic shaped stomatal pores are diagnostic for all five species of Dryopteris selected. On the other hand, size and number of epidermal cells, lobes per cell, stomatal size, subsidiary cell size, stomatal pore size and stomatal index are the key features for species differentiation in Polystichum. An identification key was developed in order to apply the foliar anatomical characters in the discrimination of the species studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aguard cells 3amicrostructure 3aporosity 3acluster analysis 3aprincipal component analysis 3alight microscopy 3aPolystichum 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aDryopteris 3astomata 3ataxonomic keys 3aPakistan 0aFoliar micromorphology 0aSEM 0aLM 0aDryopteris and Polystichum 0aPakistan1 aAhmad, Mushtaq1 aIqbāl, Muḥammad Z̤afar,1 aMalik, Khafsa1 aRashid, Neelam1 aUllah, Fazal1 aZaman, Wajid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6864-23661 aAli, Maroof0 tMicron.g2018 Aug., v. 111 p.36-49dElsevier LtdwJournal:12416x0968-43287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2018.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03914naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012300171300001800294520229400312536033702606592002802943650002302971650000802994650002103002650001103023650001803034650001803052650001103070650002503081650001603106650002203122653001103144653002603155653002103181700001703202700001903219700001503238700001903253773011303272856008603385852000903471655001203480IND60786062420221119013811.0220802e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078606242DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2021.19436692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei-Peng14aThe influence mechanism and control strategy of relative humidity on hot air drying of fruits and vegetables: a review  ap. 2217-2234.  aDrying temperature, air velocity, material thickness during hot air drying usually have a significant influence on drying kinetics and quality attributes of fruits and vegetables. However, under constant drying temperature, the influence of relative humidity (RH) of hot air on heat and mass transfer is often ignored in drying practice. On the other hand, the current literature about the influence of relative humidity of drying medium on drying kinetics and quality of fruits and vegetables are inconsistent or even contradictory. Usually, the relative humidity is roughly controlled based on experience. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize and reveal the influence mechanism of relative humidity of drying medium on drying kinetics and quality of fruits and vegetables. The RH effect mechanism on drying kinetics is analyzed in two aspects including heat transfer and mass transfer. Increasing RH intensifies heat transfer process while decreasing RH intensifies mass transfer process. Applied high RH in the initial drying stage and then decreasing RH can improve drying efficiency compared to the continuous dehumidification RH drying method. Additionally, step-down RH drying strategy method helps to mitigate the formation of casehardening on product surface and promote pore network, which is benefit for moisture transfer and diffusion. High RH during hot air has the potential to improve the pore network of materials, which is helpful for rehydration ratio. Additionally, low RH increases drying rate so that material surface generates a rigid crust or shell that fixes the volume. Low temperature but high RH drying medium can preheat the sample as soon as possible so as the energy which was used to heat the drying air can be saved. The applicable of step-down RH drying strategy is suitable for those food materials drying, whose β value is more than 1 in Weibull distribution model and Bi value in Bi-Di model is more than 0.1. In other circumstances, continuous dehumidification drying is suitable for food material drying. The auto RH control adjustment drying strategy has been investigated based on material temperature. Such RH control drying strategy provides theoretical foundation for enhancing drying efficiency and quality of fruits and vegetable materials.  aThis research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Beijing (No. 6204035) and the Excellent Youth Program of the Beijing Organization Department (2018000020124G034), and the 2115 Talent Development Program of China Agricultural University, Scientific Research Project of Higher Education in Hebei Province (No. QN2021054).  aPublisher supplied data 3aWeibull statistics 3aair 3adehumidification 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3amass transfer 3amodels 3amoisture diffusivity 3arehydration 3arelative humidity 0aDrying 0adehydration mechanism 0acontrol strategy1 aYang, Xu-Hai1 aMujumdar, A.S.1 aJu, Hao-Yu1 aXiao, Hong-Wei0 tDrying technology.g2022 Aug. 1, v. 40, no. 11 p.2217-2234dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2021.19436693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001500189245014000204500002200344520135200366592002801718653001201746653002601758653002901784653003101813653001701844700002201861700002001883700001301903700001601916700001701932700002201949700002001971700002101991700001502012700002202027700002002049773009102069856008202160852000902242655001202251IND60568183120221119111010.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056818312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ctro.2017.04.0012doi7 aPMC58339182pmcid7 a295942012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Jinbo10aAssociation of lung fluorodeoxyglucose uptake with radiation pneumonitis after concurrent chemoradiation for non-small cell lung cancer  aPre-press version  aIncreased uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) by lung tissue could reflect inflammatory changes related to radiation pneumonitis (RP). In this secondary analysis of a clinical trial, we examined potential associations between posttreatment lung FDG uptake and RP severity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for up to 12months after concurrent chemoradiation (CRT).Subjects were 152 patients with NSCLC who had received concurrent CRT as part of the prospective trial NCT00915005. The following lung FDG variables were evaluated after CRT: maximum, mean, and peak standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak) and global lung glycolysis (GLG; lung SUVmean×lung volume). RP severity was scored with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0.Significant associations were noted between PET findings and RP severity at 1–6months (all P<0.05), but not at 7–12months after therapy (all P>0.05). Lung FDG uptake at 1–3months after treatment predicted later development of grade ≥2 RP (all P<0.05), with cutoff values as follows: 4.54 for SUVmax, 3.69 for SUVpeak, 0.78 for SUVmean, and 2295 for GLG.Lung FDG uptake correlated significantly with RP severity during the first 6months after CRT. The cutoff values seem clinically meaningful for identifying patients at risk of developing RP after such therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFDG PET 0aRadiation pneumonitis 0aClinician-rated toxicity 0aNon-small cell lung cancer 0aRadiotherapy1 aMcKeever, Matthew1 aSio, Terence T.1 aXu, Ting1 aHuo, Jinhai1 aShi, Qiuling1 aNguyen, Quynh-Nhu1 aKomaki, Ritsuko1 aGomez, Daniel R.1 aPan, Tinsu1 aWang, Xin Shelley1 aLiao, Zhongxing0 tClinical and Translational Radiation Oncology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x2405-63087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctro.2017.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245018300169300001600352520191400368592002802282650001702310650001602327650001002343650001402353650002802367650001002395650002302405650002402428650001802452650003502470650001402505650001902519650001802538650001502556650002702571650002802598650000902626650002102635653002702656653002502683653001002708653002302718653002002741700002102761700002202782700002202804700002202826700002302848773010402871856008202975852000903057655001203066IND60526301520221117233221.0190403e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052630152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2016.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUddin, Md.

The panicle weight (PW), PW/total plant weight (PW/TW), number of fertile spikelets (FS), and FS/total number of spikelets per panicle (FS/TS) of the INLs increased, while the culm weight (CW) and panicle number (PN) decreased. Most INLs produced more dry matter in the UP than in the IL culture. The INLs were clustered into three groups (A–C) according to their traits in the UP culture, and four groups (I–IV) according to their traits in the IL culture. They were then sorted into six groups (A-I, A-II, B-II, B-III, C-III, and C-IV) according to the relationships between culture conditions. The INLs of group A-II had increased panicle length (PL), PW, PW/TW, FS, and TS, and these traits were stable in both IL and UP culture. In the other groups, the trait values changed with the conditions and season. Association analyses using trait phenotype and genotype data of SSR markers detected 166 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 10 traits, distributed on all chromosomes except 3 and 10. Of these, 81 QTLs for DH, CL, PL, CW, PW, PW/TW, PN, FS, TS, and FS/TS were newly detected. The INLs were characterized under different conditions, and dramatic trait modifications in IR64 rice were associated with these QTLs, through introgression from the donor cultivars. Thus, these INLs and QTLs will be useful in genetic studies to identify the gene(s) that modified IR64, and as breeding materials for genetic improvement of Indica-type cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3achromosomes 3aculms 3acultivars 3adry matter accumulation 3agenes 3agenetic background 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic lines 3agenotype-phenotype correlation 3ahighlands 3ainflorescences 3aintrogression 3airrigation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3ayield components 0aRice (Oryza sativa L.) 0aIndica-type cultivar 0aIR 64 0aIntrogression line 0aYield component1 aObara, Mitsuhiro1 aYanagihara, Seiji1 aIshimaru, Tsutomu1 aKobayashi, Nobuya1 aFukuta, Yoshimichi0 tField crops research.g2016 May, v. 191 p.168-175dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2016.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245009200159300001600251500002000267520137000287592002801657650001601685650001701701650002301718650001001741650001301751650001601764650002301780650002301803650001101826650002301837650001801860650001101878650002001889650000901909650001401918650002101932700001601953700002001969700005001989700001102039700001902050700005602069773011602125856008002241852000902321655001202330IND60767436320221120180616.0220216e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076743632DNAL7 a10.1111/1744-7917.129282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Lang10aTwo dehydroecdysone reductases act as fat body‐specific 20E catalyzers in Bombyx mori  ap. 100-110.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPeriodic post‐embryonic changes in insects, including growth, development and metamorphosis, are strictly controlled by many compounds, including steroid hormones. The biosynthesis and clearance of 20‐hydroxyecdysone (20E), the major active form of the insect steroid hormone ecdysone, result in titer fluctuations that help control insect development. The inactivation of 20E in the silkworm Bombyx mori is highly tissue‐specific, with CYP18A1 and ecdysone oxidase controlling 20E inactivation specifically in the mid‐silk gland and midgut, respectively. Here, we characterized silkworm 3‐dehydroecdysone 3α reductase (Bm3DE3α) and 3‐dehydroecdysone 3β reductase (Bm3DE3β), two enzymes involved predominantly in the C‐3‐mediated catalysis of 20E in fat bodies. The ubiquitous and silk gland‐specific overexpression of Bm3DE3α decreased the 20E titer, resulting in larval lethality and larval–pupal transition failure, respectively. In contrast, the ubiquitous and mid‐silk gland‐specific overexpression of Bm3DE3β increased the 20E titer, resulting in larval growth delays and lethality at the mid‐fifth larval stage, respectively. Thus, Bm3DE3α and Bm3DE3β mediate fat body‐specific steroid hormone metabolism in B. mori, indicating that highly diversified 20E metabolism‐related mechanisms exist in different insect species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3adeath 3aecdysone 3aecdysterone 3ahormone metabolism 3ainsect development 3alarvae 3alarval development 3ametamorphosis 3amidgut 3aoxidoreductases 3asilk 3asilkworms 3asteroid hormones1 aLi, Zhiqian1 aZhang, Zhongjie1 aHu, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3749-32461 aYu, Ye1 aYang, Fangying1 aTan, Anjiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2431-61680 tInsect science.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 1 p.100-110dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3869360x1672-96097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.129283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245008400163500001400247520174100261592002802002650001102030650001302041650002002054650001102074650002402085650002002109650000902129700001802138700002202156700002202178700001902200700002702219773012002246856007502366852000902441655001202450IND60707791820221121063612.0200821e20200730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070779182DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100813212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelch, Morgan  J.10aSocial Experience of Captive Livingstone’s Fruit Bats (Pteropus livingstonii)  aNAL-light  aSocial network analysis has been highlighted as a powerful tool to enhance the evidence-based management of captive-housed species through its ability to quantify the social experience of individuals. We apply this technique to explore the social structure and social roles of 50 Livingstone’s fruit bats (Pteropus livingstonii) housed at Jersey Zoo, Channel Islands, through the observation of associative, affiliative, and aggressive interactions over two data collection periods. We implement binomial mixture modelling and characteristic-based assortment quantification to describe the complexity and organisation of social networks, as well as a multiple regression quadratic assignment procedural (MRQAP) test to analyse the relationship between network types. We examine the effects of individual characteristics (i.e., sex, age, and dominance rank) on social role by fitting models to explain the magnitude of node metrics. Additionally, we utilize a quadratic assignment procedural (QAP) test to assess the temporal stability of social roles over two seasons. Our results indicate that P. livingstonii display a non-random network structure. Observed social networks are positively assorted by age, as well as dominance rank. The frequency of association between individuals correlates with a higher frequency of behavioural interactions, both affiliative and aggressive. Individual social roles remain consistent over ten months. We recommend that, to improve welfare and captive breeding success, relationships between individuals of similar ages and dominance levels should be allowed to persist in this group where possible, and separating individuals that interact frequently in an affiliative context should be avoided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJersey 3aPteropus 3adata collection 3afruits 3aregression analysis 3asocial networks 3azoos1 aSmith, Tessa 1 aHosie, Charlotte 1 aWormell, Dominic 1 aPrice, Eluned 1 aStanley, Christina  R.0 tAnimals.g2020 July 30, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100813213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012200166300001600288500001900304520176900323592002802092596005002120596005902170596010402229650001902333650001902352650001302371650001602384650001102400650001702411650001902428650001102447650001102458650000902469650001702478650002002495650001102515650001102526650002502537650001502562650001302577651001002590651001802600700001202618700001602630700001602646700001602662700001602678773012502694856008202819852000902901655001202910IND60709018120221119134730.0200902e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070901812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10933-020-00132-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yunxia10aMiddle to late Holocene changes in climate, hydrology, vegetation and culture on the Hangjiahu Plain, southeast China  ap. 211-223.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aClimate evolution and hydrological conditions have been crucial factors for cultural development on the east coast of China. The Hangjiahu Plain, given its unique geographic and bioclimatic location, and plentiful Neolithic sites, is an ideal area in which to examine the relationship between environmental change and cultural development along the Lower Yangtze River. We report high-resolution pollen, algae, spore, charcoal, total organic carbon and grain size data from core BHQ2, collected from the Beihu Wetland on the Hangjiahu Plain. The record spans the period from 6300 to 400 cal yr BP. We infer that the climate shifted from warm and wet during the middle Holocene to dry in the late Holocene. Warm and stable hydrological conditions in the Beihu Wetland area during the intervals 6300–6000 and 5300–4250 cal yr BP were optimal for the development of the Majiabang and Liangzhu Cultures. Turbulent, brackish-water conditions in the Beihu Wetland area from 6000 to 5300 cal yr BP, however, led people of the Songze Culture to abandon the area. Collapse of the Neolithic culture and abandonment of the site at Liangzhu City could have been linked to climate drying in the interval 4250–3500 cal yr BP. Dry climate and the turbulent, saltwater environment that prevailed from 3800 to 3600 cal yr BP made conditions difficult for the Maqiao Culture. After 3600 cal yr BP, brackish water gradually receded and local rice agriculture expanded. Persistent warfare during the Warring States Period and the Qin-Han Dynasties may have been a response to colder climate from 2300 to 2000 cal yr BP. The decrease in monsoon precipitation in the Hangjiahu Plain region was influenced by summer solar radiation during the middle to late Holocene.  aPublisher supplied data  a41371206cNatural Science Foundation of China  a41671196cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFA0600501cGlobal Change Program of the National Key Research and Development Program of China 3aHolocene epoch 3abrackish water 3acharcoal 3aclimatology 3acoasts 3adry climates 3amonsoon season 3apeople 3apollen 3arice 3asaline water 3asolar radiation 3aspores 3asummer 3atotal organic carbon 3avegetation 3awetlands 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aYe, Wei1 aMa, Chunmei1 aLi, Yanling1 aLi, Chunhai1 aZhu, Lidong0 tJournal of paleolimnology.g2020 Oct., v. 64, no. 3 p.211-223dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000474x0921-27287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-020-00132-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010200171300001600273520123100289592002801520650002701548650001301575650001701588650003001605653001901635653003101654653001701685653001701702653001601719653002201735700002001757700002101777700001701798700001901815700002301834700002401857700002101881700002601902773011201928856008302040852000902123655001202132IND60087542020221120180625.0161023e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008754202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTroiano, Federica10aSuccessful combination of chemical and biological treatments for the cleaning of stone artworks  ap. 294-304.  aThe removal of sulphate-based crusts from stone artworks using sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) has been proven to be an effective cleaning procedure. However, some concerns still remain: it is a time-consuming process when the crust is thick, and it is not clear how the biotechnological approach can fit within a complex conservation treatment. To address these challenges, the effects of an SRB strain (Desulfovibrio vulgaris subsp. vulgaris ATCC 29579) coupled with a non-ionic detergent pre-treatment was studied on a stone column affected by black crusts. The coupling of the two treatments removed the black crust without affecting the original sound marble, with 38% reduction in cleaning time. The combined method was later applied to a one-century-old artistic marble statue weathered by sulphate-based crusts and grey deposits. The detergent used alone effectively removed the grey deposit, but not the black crust. However the co-treatment synergy resulted in the complete removal of the black crust layers, with the added advantages, compared to the biocleaning alone, of fewer biological applications and a 70% reduction in total cleaning time, but still retaining all the advantages of the biocleaning approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfovibrio vulgaris 3acleaning 3apretreatment 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 0aArtistic stone 0aSulphate-reducing bacteria 0aBlack crusts 0aGrey deposit 0aBiocleaning 0aSynergic cleaning1 aGulotta, Davide1 aBalloi, Annalisa1 aPolo, Andrea1 aToniolo, Lucia1 aLombardi, Emanuela1 aDaffonchio, Daniele1 aSorlini, Claudia1 aCappitelli, Francesca0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Nov., v. 85 p.294-304dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04163naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245015300174300001600327500001900343520258200362592002802944650001602972650000802988650001802996650001903014650001103033650001703044650001203061650002403073650001303097650001503110650002303125650001003148650001503158650001303173650001303186650002403199651001803223700001803241700002303259700002203282700001703304700002103321700001803342700006903360773012503429856008203554852000903636655001203645IND60709018320221119134552.0200902e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070901832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10933-020-00133-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Stanley S.

Arctic lakes have different origins and include the predominant thermokarst lakes, which are small, young and highly dynamic, as well as large, old and stable glacial lakes. Freshwater diatoms dominate the primary producer community in these lakes and can be used to detect biotic responses to climate and environmental change. We used specific diatom metabarcoding on sedimentary DNA, combined with next-generation sequencing and diatom morphology, to assess diatom diversity in five glacial and 15 thermokarst lakes within the easternmost expanse of the Siberian treeline ecotone in Chukotka, Russia. We obtained 163 verified diatom sequence types and identified 176 diatom species morphologically. Although there were large differences in taxonomic assignment using the two approaches, they showed similar high abundances and diversity of Fragilariceae and Aulacoseiraceae. In particular, the genetic approach detected hidden within-lake variations of fragilarioids in glacial lakes and dominance of centric Aulacoseira species, whereas Lindavia ocellata was predominant using morphology. In thermokarst lakes, sequence types and valve counts also detected high diversity of Fragilariaceae, which followed the vegetation gradient along the treeline. Ordination analyses of the genetic data from glacial and thermokarst lakes suggest that concentrations of sulfate (SO₄²⁻), an indicator of the activity of sulfate-reducing microbes under anoxic conditions, and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻), which relates to surrounding vegetation, have a significant influence on diatom community composition. For thermokarst lakes, we also identified lake depth as an important variable, but SO₄²⁻ best explains diatom diversity derived from genetic data, whereas HCO₃⁻ best explains the data from valve counts. Higher diatom diversity was detected in glacial lakes, most likely related to greater lake age and different edaphic settings, which gave rise to diversification and endemism. In contrast, small, dynamic thermokarst lakes are inhabited by stress-tolerant fragilarioids and are related to different vegetation types along the treeline ecotone. Our study demonstrated that genetic investigations of lake sediments can be used to interpret climate and environmental responses of diatoms. It also showed how lake type affects diatom diversity, and that such genetic analyses can be used to track diatom community changes under ongoing warming in the Arctic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAulacoseira 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aFragilariaceae 3aRussia 3abicarbonates 3aclimate 3acommunity structure 3aecotones 3afreshwater 3aindigenous species 3alakes 3alandscapes 3asulfates 3atreeline 3avegetation gradient 3aArctic region1 aHerzschuh, U.1 aPestryakova, L.

However, cultivation of Caesar’s mushrooms has not yet been successful due to the difficulties involved in establishing pure cultures. In this study, we established pure cultures of four Asian Caesar’s mushroom species, i.e., A. caesareoides, Amanita javanica, Amanita esculenta, and Amanita similis, which were identified by sequence analysis of their rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Five selected isolates in A. caesareoides, A. javanica, and A. esculenta were tested for ectomycorrhizal syntheses with axenic Pinus densiflora seedlings in vitro. Ectomycorrhizal tips of each fungal isolate tested were observed on pine lateral roots within 5 months of inoculation. Seventeen pine seedlings that formed ectomycorrhizas in vitro with these three Amanita species were acclimatized under non-sterile conditions. Seven months following acclimatization, ectomycorrhizal colonization by A. caesareoides was observed on newly grown root tips, which was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the fungal rDNA ITS region. Two other Amanita species also survived during ectomycorrhizal acclimatization. These results suggest that the cultivation of A. caesareoides and its relatives can be attempted through mycorrhizal synthesis using P. densiflora as a host. This is the first report of in vitro mycorrhization of Asian Caesar’s mushrooms and their acclimatization under non-sterile conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmanita 3aPinus densiflora 3aacclimation 3aectomycorrhizae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amushrooms 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal DNA 3aroot tips 3aseedlings 3asequence analysis 2aAcclimatization 2aAmanitaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycorrhizaexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aPhylogeny 2aPinusxmicrobiology1 aGisusi, Seiki1 aFukuda, Masaki1 aYamada, Akiyoshi0 tMycorrhiza.g2013 May, v. 23, no. 4 p.303-315dSpringer-Verlagx0940-63607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-012-0471-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002300169245009800192300001800290520102300308592002801331650002701359650002201386650001401408650002001422650000901442650002001451650000901471650001401480650002701494650001201521650005901533650003901592650002001631650005701651650005001708650003101758650003101789650000901820650004501829650004601874650000901920650002501929700001801954773009201972856008602064852000902150655001202159IND4465333420221118023002.0141111e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446533342DNAL7 a234426372pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.03.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheu, Shyang-Chwen10aComposition analysis and immuno-modulatory effect of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.) extract  ap. 1906-1911.  aThe aim of this study was to analyse the composition of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.) extract and investigate the effect of A. esculentus L. polysaccharides (AE-PS) on the maturation and function of dendritic cells (DCs) derived from rat bone marrow hematopoietic cells (BMHCs) in vitro. BMHC-derived immature DCs (BMHC-imDCs) were extracted from rats and treated with AE-PS. The hydrolysed okra extract contained 0.6% β-1, 3-d-glucan. AE-PS induced the presence of polymorphic nuclei and elongated protrusion in the BHMC-imDCs, indicating DC activation. Treatment with100μg/mL of AE-PS increased the MHC class II and CD80/86 expression levels by 41% and 42%, respectively. Treated cells had reduced endocytosis activity. The secretion of IL-12 and IFN-γ increased significantly by 120% and 75%, respectively, when treated with 100μg/mL of AE-PS. Moreover, IL-10 production was reduced by 66%. In conclusion, AE-PS exhibits stimulatory effects on rat dendritic cells and promotes the secretion of TH1 cytokines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3abone marrow cells 3acytokines 3adendritic cells 3aokra 3apolysaccharides 3arats 3asecretion 2aAbelmoschusxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aBone Marrow Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aCell Differentiationxdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aDendritic Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aImmunologic Factorsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aInterleukin-10ximmunology 2aInterleukin-12ximmunology 2aMale 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPolysaccharidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley1 aLai, Mei-Huei0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 134, no. 4 p.1906-1911dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.03.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011100160300001600271500002000287520164500307592002801952596005701980596005702037650002102094650001602115650002802131650001702159650001302176650001202189650003002201650001102231700002102242700005702263773011502320856007502435852000902510655001202519IND60767437620221118032404.0220216e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076743762DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.162242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdegawa, Satomi14aThe base and root of domain II loops of Cry toxins contribute to binding to Bombyx mori ABC transporter C2  ap. 965-984.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLittle information is available regarding the region of Cry toxins involved in binding to their major receptors, the ATP‐binding cassette (ABC) transporters. We analyzed which Cry1Aa amino acid residues contribute to binding to Bombyx mori ABC transporter C2 (BmABCC2). Several two oxidized double‐cysteine substitution mutant toxins were made. In these, two amino acids at distant positions on toxin loop α8 and loop 2 or loop 2 and loop 3 were substituted with cysteine residues and crosslinked. These mutants exhibited a marked reduction in binding affinity to BmABCC2, suggesting that the binding site comprises complex cavities formed by loops α8, 2, and 3. Loop swapping between Cry1Aa and other BmABCC2‐incompatible toxins indicated that loop 2 acts as a binding affinity‐generating part of Cry1Aa toxin. Using single amino acid substitution mutants, the results of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis and response assays with BmABCC2‐expressing Sf9 cells indicated that Y366, R367, R368, and L447 in the Cry1Aa root and base region of loops 2 and 3 play important roles in binding. Furthermore, SPR analyses of these mutants suggested that a two‐state binding model fits best the data obtained. Moreover, complex cavities and the above‐mentioned amino acid residues contribute to the generation of multiple binding points and high‐affinity binding. Finally, we found that the binding site of B. mori cadherin‐like protein consists of complex cavities comprising loops 1, 2, and 3, partially overlapping that of BmABCC2, suggesting that the loop region of Cry1Aa toxin acts as a promiscuous binding site.  aPublisher supplied data  a17J01066cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a18H03397cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aABC transporters 3aBombyx mori 3aamino acid substitution 3acrosslinking 3acysteine 3amutants 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atoxins1 aYamaguchi, Naomi1 aSato, Ryoichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6783-48060 tFEBS journal.g2022 Feb., v. 289, no. 4 p.965-984dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.162243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011700166300001600283520160000299592002801899650002101927650001201948650001301960650002001973650001001993650001202003650001302015650001502028650001102043650001702054650001502071650000902086650001102095651001202106700002202118700002202140700002502162773011102187856004802298852000902346655001202355IND50059734320221118023003.0121102e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005973432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00334-012-0372-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroves, Jon A.10aLong-term development of a cultural landscape: the origins and dynamics of lowland heathland in southern England  ap. 453-470.  aThe lowland heathlands of southern England comprise ca. 14 % of the total area of this habitat in Europe yet their history is poorly understood. This paper presents the first detailed palaeoecological evidence (combining palynological, microscopic charcoal and radiocarbon data) relating to the origin and long-term dynamics of heathland vegetation in southern England. Valley peat sites, situated on the Lower Greensand Group (coarse-grained sandstones) at Conford (Hampshire) and Hurston Warren (West Sussex) have been investigated. The sequence from Conford indicates the unusually late survival of Pinus sylvestris (to as late as ca. 6050 cal. B.P.) in southern England. This is attributed to edaphic factors and, after ca. 7050 cal. B.P., to frequent fires. After intervening phases of dominance by deciduous woodland, heathland vegetation became established in the proximity of both sites in the Late Bronze Age (ca. 3000 cal. B.P.) with increases in indicators of grazing and burning demonstrating an association between the development of heathland and human activity. Thereafter, the pollen and charcoal records show that the vegetation remained in a dynamic state as the scale and nature of human activity varied through time. Major expansions in the extent of heathland occurred relatively recently; after ca. 1450 cal. B.P. at Hurston Warren and after ca. 850 cal. B.P. at Conford. A review of the palaeoecological evidence suggests that the most intense use and greatest coverage of heathland in southern England probably occurred during the medieval to post-medieval periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aburning 3acharcoal 3aedaphic factors 3afires 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3aheathlands 3ahumans 3apaleoecology 3apalynology 3apeat 3apollen 3aEngland1 aWaller, Martyn P.1 aGrant, Michael J.1 aSchofield, J.

How much the primary somatosensory cortices (SIs) participate in processing the pleasantness of such social touch remains unclear. Although ample empirical evidence supports the role of the insula in affective processing of touch, here we argue that SI might be more involved in affective processing than previously thought by showing that the response in SI to a sensual caress is modified by the perceived sex of the caresser. In a functional MRI study, we manipulated the perceived affective quality of a caress independently of the sensory properties at the skin: heterosexual males believed they were sensually caressed by either a man or woman, although the caress was in fact invariantly delivered by a female blind to condition type. Independent analyses showed that SI encoded, and was modulated by, the visual sex of the caress, and that this effect is unlikely to originate from the insula. This suggests that current models may underestimate the role played by SI in the affective processing of social touch.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acortex 3afemales 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amales 3amodels 3asensory properties 3awomen 0aaffective touch 0asexual selection 0agender 0acrossmodal perception 0ahot cognition1 aSpezio, Michael L.1 aEtzel, Joset A.1 aCastelli, Fulvia1 aAdolphs, Ralph1 aKeysers, Christian0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 June 19, v. 109, no. 25 p.E1657-E1666dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11132111093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014100162300001800303520147800321592002801799650001201827650002101839651002001860700001701880700001601897773010401913856008102017990002302098852000902121655001202130IND60096193020221122052934.0141104e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009619302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csr.2011.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiexin10aVariation of Froude number versus depth during the passage of internal solitary waves from the in-situ observation and a numerical model  ap. 1318-1323.  aThere are few studies on the variation of Froude number versus depth during the passage of internal solitary waves (ISWs). In this paper, according to the limited observational data of the ISWs near the Dongsha Islands in the northern South China Sea (SCS), it is found that, during the passage of an ISW, the local Froude number near the main thermocline gets maximum and the flow is supercritical, with the Froude number decreasing gradually upward and downward, whilst before and after the passage of the ISW, the local Froude number is less than 1 and the flow is subcritical in the entire water column. Since the observational current data are only available in the upper ocean, a two-dimensional continuously stratified nonlinear model is employed here to study the variation of Froude number versus depth during the passage of an ISW. The modeled ISW induced current field agrees well with that observed during the passage of the observational ISW. It is found that, even during the passage of the ISW, although the Froude number is larger than 1 in the upper layer, it is less than 1 in the lower layer, and the duration when the Froude number is larger than 1 also changes with depth. Thus, it is suggested that, once the Froude number near the main thermocline is larger than 1, the passage of ISWs could be identified. Moreover, it would be better to choose a sampling interval of no more than 1/4 passage period of the ISW during an in-situ observation of ISWs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aislands 3anonlinear models 3aSouth China Sea1 aXie, Jieshuo1 aCai, Shuqun0 tContinental shelf research.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 31, no. 12 p.1318-1323dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2011.05.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245007400161520096200235592002801197650004701225650003801272650002501310650001901335650001801354650001301372650001701385650001001402650001301412650001501425650001601440650002301456650002401479700001701503700002101520700001701541700001301558773012201571856008101693852000901774655001201783IND60783929820221121052510.0220726e20220712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078392982DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120716592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiaqi 10aMode of Action of a Novel Synthetic Auxin Herbicide Halauxifen-Methyl  aHalauxifen-methyl is a new auxin herbicide developed by Corteva Agriscience (Wilmington, DE, USA). It has been suggested that ABF5 may be the target of halauxifen-methyl, as AFB5 mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana are resistant to halauxifen-methyl, which preferentially binds to AFB5. However, the mode of action of halauxifen-methyl has not yet been reported. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to reveal the mode of action of halauxifen-methyl by exploring its influence on indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) homeostasis and the biosynthesis of ethylene and Abscisic Acid (ABA) in Galium aparine. The results showed that halauxifen-methyl could disrupt the homeostasis of IAA and stimulate the overproduction of ethylene and ABA by inducing the overexpression of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) genes involved in ethylene and ABA biosynthesis, finally leading to senescence and plant death.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 3a9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aGalium aparine 3aabscisic acid 3aagronomy 3abiosynthesis 3adeath 3aethylene 3aherbicides 3ahomeostasis 3aindole acetic acid 3amechanism of action1 aLiu, Xudong 1 aNapier, Richard 1 aDong, Liyao 1 aLi, Jun 0 tAgronomy.g2022 July 12, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120716593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245013200176300001600308520167900324592002802003650001302031650001302044650001402057650002202071650001102093650001102104651001802115651001402133651001202147651002302159651001602182651001802198653001402216653001702230653000902247653001802256653001202274653001302286653001902299653002402318653001202342653000902354653001502363653002202378653001302400653001502413700002702428700001802455700002102473700002902494700002802523700001902551773013202570856008502702852000902787655001202796IND50087077320221118101952.0180605e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008707732DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2012.6666782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMols-Mortensen, Agnes10aNew insights into the biodiversity and generic relationships of foliose Bangiales (Rhodophyta) in Iceland and the Faroe Islands  ap. 146-159.  aFoliose species of the Bangiales (Porphyra sensu lato) have a long history of study in the N Atlantic, but there are still regions, especially in the northern parts of the N Atlantic that need more attention. A molecular study using rbcL and cox1 sequences was undertaken to assess the diversity of foliose Bangiales species in Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Herbarium collections from the intertidal and subtidal of Iceland (summer and winter) and the Faroe Islands (all seasons) revealed a total of 13 species (11 common to both areas), which were referred to four of the genera recognized in a recent two-gene global phylogeny. Boreophyllum birdiae, Porphyra dioica, P. linearis, P. purpurea, P. umbilicalis, Pyropia ‘leucosticta’ A, Pyropia njordii Mols-Mortensen, J. Brodie & Neefus, sp. nov., Wildemania amplissima and W. miniata were common to both areas, while Pyropia thulaea and Wildemania abyssicola (Kjellman) A. Mols-Mortensen & J. Brodie, comb. nov. (=Porphyra abyssicola Kjellman) were reported from Iceland but not from the Faroe Islands; Porphyra sp. FO and Pyropia elongata were reported from the Faroe Islands but not from Iceland. Boreophyllum birdiae is reported for the first time for Iceland and Porphyra sp. FO is reported for the first time for the Faroe Islands. Pyropia njordii is described from the Faroe Islands and is also recorded for Iceland, Greenland, New England, USA and Nova Scotia, Canada. A total of 25 foliose Bangiales species are now reported from the N Atlantic and these results demonstrate the importance of investigating as many areas as possible to reach a more complete understanding of species diversity and distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorphyra 3aherbaria 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3awinter 3aFaroe Islands 3aGreenland 3aIceland 3aNew England region 3aNova Scotia 3aUnited States 0aBangiales 0aBoreophyllum 0acox1 0aFaroe Islands 0aIceland 0anew taxa 0aNorth Atlantic 0aPorphyra sensu lato 0aPyropia 0arbcL 0aRhodophyta 0aspecies diversity 0ataxonomy 0aWildemania1 aNeefus, Christopher D.1 aNielsen, Ruth1 aGunnarsson, Karl1 aEgilsdóttir, Svanhildur1 aMøller Pedersen, Poul,1 aBrodie, Juliet0 tEuropean journal of phycology.g2012 May 1, v. 47, no. 2 p.146-159dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:J000000069x1469-44337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2012.6666783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245011200159500001400271520159500285592002801880650002301908650002501931650001301956650001201969650001101981650001601992650001002008650001902018651001002037700001702047700001302064700001702077700001802094700001702112700002002129700001602149700001402165773012002179856007902299852000902378655001202387IND60729314820221120165615.0210228e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072931482DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120201662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yan 10aAntennal and Behavioral Responses of Drosophila suzukii to Volatiles from a Non-Crop Host, Osyris wightiana  aNAL-light  aDrosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae) infests a variety of commercial fruits, including cherries and other soft-skinned fruits. After the cropping season of most cultivated crop hosts, it heavily infests the fruit of a wild host-plant, Osyris wightiana in southwest China. Here, we employ gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) together with behavioral bioassays and a trapping experiment to identify volatile semiochemicals emitted by O. wightiana that are involved in D. suzukii attraction. GC-EAD recordings of D. suzukii antenna showed responses to 13 compounds, including α-pinene, 3-methylbutyl acetate, 2-hexanol, E-β-ocimene, Z-3-hexenol, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and six unidentified compounds. The flies were attracted by seven individual EAD-active compounds at low doses (0.01 and 0.1 μg), but were repelled at high doses (10 and 100 μg). In a similar manner, a blend of seven EAD-active compounds at low doses (0.1 and 1 μg) was attractive to female flies, but became repulsive at high doses (10 μg). The low dose of the blend was as attractive as the fruit volatiles, although both were less attractive than the fruits. The blend attracted both female and male D. suzukii and other Drosophila flies. The percentage of D. suzukii out of all flies captured by the blend was significantly greater than that captured by the control. These results indicate that the EAD-active volatile compounds emitted by fruits of O. wightiana play an important role in D. suzukii attraction, and have the potential to be used for management of D. suzukii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila suzukii 3aOsyris quadripartita 3aacetates 3afemales 3afruits 3ahost plants 3amales 3asemiochemicals 3aChina1 aCui, Zhihao 1 aShi, Mi 1 aKenis, Marc 1 aDong, Wenxia 1 aZhang, Feng 1 aZhang, Jinping 1 aXiao, Chun 1 aChen, Li 0 tInsects.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120201663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04048naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012900166300001200295520216700307592002802474596005902502596005902561596004802620596009102668596009102759650002502850650001902875650002002894650001702914650001402931650001402945650001202959650001302971650002602984650001903010650001603029650001603045650003403061650002203095650000903117650003203126700001603158700001603174700001803190700001703208700001503225700001503240700001803255773012903273856008303402852000903485655001203494IND60702407020221116163108.0220709e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070240702DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-020-03009-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhiguo12aA circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network plays a role in the protective effect of diosgenin on alveolar bone loss in ovariectomized rats  ap. 220.  aBACKGROUND: The present study aimed to assess the perturbation in circular RNA (circRNA)/mRNA expression profiles and a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA coexpression network involved in the potential protective effect of diosgenin (DIO) on alveolar bone loss in rats subjected to ovariectomy (OVX). METHODS: The Wistar rats (female) manipulated with sham operation were classified as the SHAM group and the grouping of OVX rats administered with DIO, estradiol valerate or vehicle for 12 weeks was DIO group, EV group and OVX group respectively. Following treatments, the plasmatic levels of osteocalcin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and the microstructure of alveolar bone were assayed. Based on microarray analyses, we identified differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs and mRNAs in alveolar bone of rats in both OVX and DIO group. The DE circRNAs and DE mRNAs involved in the bone metabolism pathway validated by RT-qPCR were considered key circRNAs/mRNAs. On the basis of these key circRNAs/mRNAs, we predicted the overlapping relative miRNAs of key circRNAs/mRNAs, and a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was built. RESULTS: DIO showed an anti-osteopenic effect on the rat alveolar bone loss induced by OVX. In total, we found 10 DE circRNAs (6 downregulated and 4 upregulated) and 614 DE mRNAs (314 downregulated and 300 upregulated) in samples of the DIO group compared with those of the OVX group. However, only one circRNA (rno_circRNA_016717) and seven mRNAs (Sfrp1, Csf1, Il1rl1, Nfatc4, Tnfrsf1a, Pik3c2g, and Wnt9b) were validated by qRT-PCR and therefore considered key circRNA/mRNAs. According to these key circRNA/mRNAs and overlapping predicted miRNAs, a coexpression network was constructed. After network analysis, one circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis (circRNA_016717/miR-501-5p/Sfrp1) was identified. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of DIO inhibiting alveolar bone loss after OVX is possibly relevant to the simultaneous inhibition of osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis by mediating the expression of important molecules in the Wnt, PI3K, RANK/RANKL or osteoclastogenic cytokine pathways. The circRNA_016717/miR-501-5p/Sfrp1 axis may play important roles in these processes.  aPublisher supplied data  a81473450cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81302960cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a7172148cBeijing Natural Science Foundation  aBUCM-2019-JCRC007cTop Young Scientist Funds of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine  aYZ-1780cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Public Welfare Research Institutes 3aalternative medicine 3abone formation 3abone resorption 3acircular RNA 3adiosgenin 3aestradiol 3afemales 3amicroRNA 3amicroarray technology 3amicrostructure 3aosteocalcin 3aovariectomy 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aprotective effect 3arats 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aYue, Lifeng1 aWang, Yuhan1 aJiang, Yanhua1 aXiang, Lihua1 aCheng, Yin1 aJu, Dahong1 aChen, Yanjing0 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.220-220dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-020-03009-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245012900174520123700303592002801540650001301568650001501581650003701596650001401633650002901647650001401676650001601690650001501706650002001721650001301741651001201754700001901766700002101785700002101806700002501827700001701852700001901869700002301888700003501911773012201946856008102068852000902149655001202158IND60783929920221121052459.0220726e20220712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078392992DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120716602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadou el hadj, Dahmane 10aEvaluation of Adaptability of Different Faba Bean Landraces under Mediterranean Field Conditions of Central-Northern Algeria  aThe Multi-Trait selection index (MTSI) has been used to select highly productive and stable faba bean landraces across various traits. Fifteen productive, morphological, and phenological traits with desired and undesired selection gains (SGs) were evaluated in fifteen faba bean landraces under Mediterranean field conditions between 2019–2021. According to our results, most of the faba bean traits are influenced by the genotype × environment interaction (GEI) effects. Banner length (BL), seed yield (SY), diameter (D), number of flowers per inflorescence (NFI), branch number (BRN), and 100 seed weight (HSW) were found to be highly influenced by the environment, the proportions of variance explained by environmental factors were arranged between 83.21% and 74.08%, and only seed number per pod (SNP) was the highest genotypic effect (54.02%). According to the MTSI index, only three landraces (Gaada Mascara (G4), Oued zentai (G13), and Khmakhem (G15)) were considered to be highly yield-productive and to have a broad adaptability across Mediterranean environments. When numerous traits were evaluated, the MTSI index provided a strong and powerful tool for developing improved selection techniques for Faba bean studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3afaba beans 3agenotype-environment interaction 3alandraces 3amultiple trait selection 3aphenology 3aseed weight 3aseed yield 3aselection index 3avariance 3aAlgeria1 aTellah, Sihem 1 aGoumeida, Kenza 1 aAitouakli, Sara 1 aTifest, Chamseddine 1 aAmmi, Nihal 1 aRatet, Pascal 1 aPulvento, Cataldo 1 aSellami, Mohamed Houssemeddine0 tAgronomy.g2022 July 12, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120716603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04077naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012900166300001200295520188200307592002802189596005102217596005002268596005002318596005102368596005102419596005102470596007602521596007602597596007602673650002502749650001602774650001102790650002102801650001002822650002002832650001102852650001402863650001402877650002202891650000902913650001102922651001102933700001802944700002002962700001402982700001502996700002203011700002003033700002003053700001803073700001903091700002003110700001203130700002003142700005603162773012903218856008303347852000903430655001203439IND60702407120221116163111.0220709e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070240712DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-020-03010-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, Fuu-Jen10aDecreased overall mortality rate with Chinese herbal medicine usage in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis in Taiwan  ap. 221.  aBACKGROUND: Liver cirrhosis is one of the main causes of the morbidity and mortality in liver diseases. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has long been used for the clinical treatment of liver diseases. This study was designed to explore the usage frequency and prescription patterns of CHM for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and to evaluate the long-term effects of CHM on overall mortality. METHODS: Two thousand four hundred sixty-seven patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis (ICD-9-CM code: 571.2, 571.5, and 571.6) diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 in Taiwan were identified from the registry for catastrophic illness patients. Of these, 149 CHM users and 298 CHM non-users were matched for age, gender, and Charlson comorbidity index score. The chi-squared test, paired Student’s t-test, Cox proportional hazard model, and Kaplan–Meier method were applied for various comparisons between these groups of patients. RESULTS: CHM-treated patients showed a lower overall mortality risk compared with non-treated patients (Multivariable: p < 0.0001; HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.42–0.69). The cumulative incidence of overall mortality was lower in the CHM-treated group (stratified log-rank test, p = 0.0002). The strongest CHM co-prescription pattern- Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang (YCHT) → Long-Dan-Xie-Gan-Tang (LDXGT) had the highest support, followed by Zhi-Zi (ZZ) → Yin-Chen-Wu-Ling-San (YCWLS) and Bai-Hua-She-She-Cao (BHSSC) → Da-Huang (DaH). CONCLUSION: CHM, as adjunct therapy, might decrease the risk of overall mortality in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. CHM co-prescription patterns and network analysis showed that comprehensive herbal medicines have a protective role against liver fibrosis. Further studies are required to enhance the knowledge of safety and efficacy of CHM in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.  aPublisher supplied data  aCMU108-MF-32cChina Medical University, Taiwan  aCMU108-S-15cChina Medical University, Taiwan  aCMU108-S-17cChina Medical University, Taiwan  aDMR-109-145cChina Medical University Hospital  aDMR-109-188cChina Medical University Hospital  aDMR-109-192cChina Medical University Hospital  aMOST 109-2320-B-039-035-MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan  aMOST 106-2320-B-039-017-MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan  aMOST 108-2314-B-039-044-MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan 3aalternative medicine 3acomorbidity 3agender 3aherbal medicines 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3amodels 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aprotective effect 3arisk 3at-test 3aTaiwan1 aYang, Pei-Yuu1 aChen, Chao-Jung1 aLi, Ju-Pi1 aLi, Demao,1 aChiou, Jian-Shiun1 aCheng, Chi-Fung1 aChuang, Po-Heng1 aLin, Ting-Hsu1 aLiao, Chiu-Chu1 aHuang, Shao-Mei1 aBan, Bo1 aLiang, Wen-Miin1 aLin, Ying-Ju1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2267-70580 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.221-221dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-020-03010-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245013100166520105900297592002801356650002001384650001301404650001101417650001601428650001901444650001201463650002201475650001601497650001801513650001401531650001301545650000901558650001601567650001701583651001001600700001901610700001701629700002001646700001601666700001801682700001801700773012201718856008101840852000901921655001201930IND60783930120221123045108.0220726e20220623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078393012DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120715002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wenying 10aTrait Selection for Yield Improvement in Foxtail Millet (Setaria italica Beauv.) under Climate Change in the North China Plain  aWeather factors and drought could impact the yield of foxtail millet, and varieties with traits that could alleviate the negative effects of deteriorating weather factors in the future should be developed. A total of 25 foxtail millet varieties were evaluated in experiments from 2016 to 2020 under well-watered (WW) and water-stressed (WS) treatments. Future climate change might favor an increased temperature that impedes grain yield, so varieties with characters that are less sensitive to temperature change are preferred. Varieties with a high panicle dry-weight per plant, thousand grain weight, leaf area and water productivity in deep soil layer usually gave better grain production under both water treatments. Under the WW treatment, low grain abortion rate, optimal chlorophyll and canopy temperature and more roots in the upper soil layer could favor a high yield and drought resistance. Under the WS treatment, varieties with a high harvest index, low rate of water loss and more roots in the upper soil layer usually produced a high yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSetaria italica 3aagronomy 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3aleaf area 3apanicles 3asoil 3atemperature 3awater stress 3aChina1 aWang, Bianyin 1 aLiu, Binhui 1 aChen, Zhaoyang 1 aLu, Guanli 1 aGe, Yaoxiang 1 aBai, Caihong 0 tAgronomy.g2022 June 23, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120715003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03707naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013400172300001600306520213800322592002802460650001802488650001802506650001502524650001702539650001302556650003302569650001402602650002002616650001602636650001802652650002402670650002402694653001802718653001802736653001602754653002202770653001502792653002402807653001902831653002602850653002002876653001602896700002402912700002402936700002302960773011302983856008403096852000903180655001203189IND50087077820221118101929.0170724e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008707782DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2012.6783882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemchenko, Eduard10aGeneric and species concepts in Microglena (previously the Chlamydomonas monadina group) revised using an integrative approach†  ap. 264-290.  aTraditionally the genus Microglena Ehrenberg has been used to contain species that belong to the Chrysophyceae; however, the type species of Microglena , M. monadina , represents a green alga, which was later transferred to the genus Chlamydomonas . The taxonomic status of the genus has therefore remained unclear. We investigated 15 strains previously assigned to C. monadina and two marine species (C. reginae and C. uva-maris) using an integrative approach. Phylogenetic analyses of SSU and ITS rDNA sequences revealed that all strains form a monophyletic lineage within the Chlorophyceae containing species from different habitats. The strains studied showed similar morphology with respect to cell shape and size, but showed differences in chloroplast and pyrenoid structures. Some representatives of this group have the same type of sexual reproduction (homothallic advanced anisogamy). Three different morphotypes could be recognized. Strains belonging to type I have a cup-shaped chloroplast with a massive basal part, in which a large, single, ellipsoidal pyrenoid is located. The members of type II also have a cup-shaped chloroplast, which is partly lobed and has a thinner basal part than type I; here the pyrenoid is half-ring or horseshoe-shaped and occupies different positions in the chloroplast depending on the strain. The strains of type III have multiple pyrenoids, which appear to have developed from the subdivision of a single ring-shaped pyrenoid into several parts. We compared the results of our morphological investigations with the literature and found that 15 strains could be identified with existing species. Two strains did not fit with any described species. As a result of our study, we transfer all strains to the genus Microglena , propose 11 new combinations, and describe two new species. Comparison of the ITS-1 and ITS-2 secondary structures confirmed the species delineations. All species have characteristic compensatory base changes in their ITS secondary structures and are supported by ITS-2 DNA barcodes. †Molecular phylogeny and taxonomic revision of Chlamydomonas (Chlorophyta).

Three long-term tillage experiments based on cereal production were initiated in 1987, 1990 and 1992, at three different locations in the Ebro river valley (NE Spain): El Canós, Selvanera and Agramunt, with an increasing degree of aridity. Different tillage intensities were compared in each experiment using different implements: no tillage (NT), minimum tillage (MT), chisel (Ch), subsoiler up to 25cm depth (Sub-25) and up to 50cm (Sub-50), and mouldboard plough (Mb). Soil water content (SWC) up to 100cm, soil water storage (SWS), precipitation storage efficiency (PSE) and crop yield were quantified during 8 (El Canós) and 19 years (Selvanera and Agramunt). The use of MT (at Selvanera) and NT (at El Canós and Agramunt) led to the highest SWC after the storage period (i.e., from previous harvest to crop tillering), with a major role played by the storage of water at deep soil layers. At Agramunt, Mb presented the lowest SWS when compared to Ch, Sub-50 and NT, and, consequently, the lowest post-tillering evapotranspiration. On the contrary, no differences were found between tillage systems on SWS at El Canós or at Selvanera. Significant yield differences were found at Agramunt being: NT>Sub-50>Ch=Mb. These differences were especially important in years with mean yield below 2000kgha−1, in which NT obtained the highest productions. At Selvanera yield was greater under conservation tillage (NT, MT) than under intensive tillage (Sub-50). Contrarily, no yield differences were found between tillage systems at El Canós, the site with the lowest water deficit, where crop residues were removed. A strong linear relationship was found between SWS and yield at Agramunt and Selvanera. At Agramunt the relationship presented a greater slope under Mb. In this site, in years with previous harvest-to-tillering SWS below 100mm and with precipitation over 100mm between tillering and anthesis, yields were, as an average, 1245kgha−1 higher than in standard years. This study demonstrates that under semiarid rainfed conditions, soil water storage increases with the use of conservation tillage systems, being amplified with the degree of aridity of the site. The relationship between water stored in the soil and crop yield and its reliability is site-specific. Once determined, it could be used to predict yield at the end of the vegetative phase of the crop to help take management decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3aconventional tillage 3acrop residues 3acrop yield 3adry environmental conditions 3aevapotranspiration 3aflowering 3aminimum tillage 3ano-tillage 3aplows 3arivers 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoil water storage 3astorage time 3atillering 3awater conservation 3aSpain 0aSoil water storage 0aNo-tillage 0aConservation tillage 0aIntensive tillage 0aSemiarid dryland1 aPlaza-Bonilla, Daniel1 aÁlvaro-Fuentes, Jorge1 aCantero-Martínez, Carlos0 tField crops research.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 189 p.59-67dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2016.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245007700171300001300248520126800261592002801529650002001557650001901577650002901596650001101625650001501636650001401651650001901665650000901684650001801693650002501711650002301736650001701759700002101776700001801797700002301815773011501838856008301953852000902036655001202045IND60568180520221119111210.0200607e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056818052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mran.2016.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoller, Jeffrey A.10aEvaluation of microbiological risks associated with direct potable reuse  ap. 3-14.  aThis work evaluates the potential microbial risks associated with various direct potable reuse (DPR) treatment train combinations for recycled water. The assessment methodology leverages readily available peer-reviewed pathogen density and treatment process removal data and extends a previously published statistical approach. The results illustrate clear quantitative human health-based advantages for DPR projects in which product water is introduced into the raw water supply upstream of a conventional drinking water treatment facility, compared to those in which product water is introduced directly into a potable water supply distribution system. The results also indicate that a single day can drive annual risks, highlighting the need for robust and reliable on-line monitoring of unit treatment processes within DPR facilities. The methodology is adaptable to other DPR treatment trains and could be iteratively refined as additional data become available. This work will be useful to federal and state regulators considering DPR as source water, state and local decision makers as they consider whether to permit a particular DPR project, and design engineers as they consider which unit treatment processes should be employed for particular projects.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3adrinking water 3adrinking water treatment 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3arecycled water 3arisk 3arisk analysis 3astatistical analysis 3awater distribution 3awater supply1 aEftim, Sorina E.1 aWarren, Isaac1 aNappier, Sharon P.0 tMicrobial risk analysis.g2017 Apr., v. 5 p.3-14dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:23482x2352-35227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2016.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03729naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009300166300001200259520205900271592002802330596007702358650003302435650002802468650001902496650002502515650002002540650001002560650001302570650001302583650001202596650002102608650001902629650001602648650001002664650001402674650001302688650003702701650000902738650001802747650001102765650002402776650001802800650001502818650001502833651001402848700001902862700005602881700001702937773012902954856008303083852000903166655001203175IND60702407520221116163236.0220709e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070240752DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-020-02998-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jungbin10aSafety evaluation of root extract of Pueraria lobata and Scutellaria baicalensis in rats  ap. 226.  aBACKGROUND: The roots of Pueraria lobata and Scutellaria baicalensis, herbal medicines with a long history of widespread use, have been traditionally prescribed in combination to treat stroke, diabetes, and acute infectious diarrhea in East Asia. Nevertheless, toxicological data on these herbs and their combination are limited. This study investigated the acute and 13-week subchronic toxicity of root extract of P. lobata and S. baicalensis (HT047) for stroke treatment in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. METHODS: In the acute toxicity study, HT047 was administered orally at a single dose of 5000 mg/kg. In the subchronic toxicity study, HT047 was administered orally at repeated daily doses of 800, 2000, and 5000 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks, followed by a 4-week recovery period. RESULTS: In the acute toxicity study, there were no deaths or toxicologically significant changes in clinical signs, body weight, and necropsy findings. In the subchronic toxicity study, HT047 at all doses caused no death and no treatment-related adverse effects on food consumption; organ weight; ophthalmologic, urinalysis, and hematological parameters; and necropsy findings of both rat sexes. There were some treatment-related alterations in clinical signs, body weight, and serum biochemistry and histopathological parameters; however, these changes were not considered toxicologically significant because they were resolved during the recovery period or resulted from the pharmacological effects of P. lobata and S. baicalensis. CONCLUSIONS: The oral approximate lethal dose (the lowest dose that causes mortality) of HT047 was greater than 5000 mg/kg in male and female rats. The oral no-observed-adverse-effect level of HT047 was greater than 5000 mg/kg/day in rats of both sexes, and no target organs were identified. The present findings support the safety of an herbal extract of P. lobata and S. baicalensis as a therapeutic agent for stroke and further confirm the safety of the combined use of P. lobata and S. baicalensis in clinical practice.  aPublisher supplied data  aHI11C2138 & HI15C0051cMinistry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea 3aPueraria montana var. lobata 3aScutellaria baicalensis 3aacute toxicity 3aalternative medicine 3ablood chemistry 3adeath 3adiabetes 3adiarrhea 3afemales 3afood consumption 3ahistopathology 3alethal dose 3amales 3amortality 3anecropsy 3ano observed adverse effect level 3arats 3aroot extracts 3astroke 3asubchronic toxicity 3atissue weight 3atoxicology 3aurinalysis 3aEast Asia1 aKim, Young-Sik1 aLee, Donghun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1075-07131 aKim, Hocheol0 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.226-226dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-020-02998-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015900170300001600329520146400345592002801809650002501837650003001862650002201892650002001914650004501934650000701979650001301986653002501999653002202024653001702046653003002063653001602093653002002109653000902129653002202138653002202160653001002182653001202192653002102204700002402225700002102249700001902270700001802289700002202307773011302329856008402442852000902526655001202535IND50087078020221120185849.0170724e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008707802DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2012.6874592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvilan, Luisana10aRegulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the eustigmatophyte Pseudocharaciopsis ovalis is intermediate between a chlorophyte and a diatom  ap. 207-215.  aThe regulation of NADPH-dependent GAPDH was analysed in the chromalveolate (eustigmatophyte) Pseudocharaciopsis ovalis and compared with the well-studied chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and with another chromalveolate (diatom), Asterionella formosa. Optimal pH for GAPDH activity in P. ovalis and C. reinhardtii ranged between 8 and 9, but in A. formosa ranged between 6.2 and 8.1. Assuming dark pH values of about 7 in the plastids of all three species, GAPDH would be down-regulated in the dark in C. reinhardtii and P. ovalis , but fully active in A. formosa . The time required for half-maximal GAPDH activity on transfer to reducing conditions, was significantly different in each species: 1.4, 4.0 and 5.9 min in A. formosa , P. ovalis and C. reinhardtii respectively. Under oxidized conditions in P. ovalis and A. formosa , NADPH caused a large inhibition in GAPDH activity even at very low concentrations (10 to 20 µM) unlike in C. reinhardtii . This inhibition was relieved by addition of a reducing agent suggesting that NADPH can control GAPDH activity under dark-light transitions. A small increase of GAPDH activity with NADP at concentrations higher than 0.5 mM was observed with P. ovalis and C. reinhardtii , while a greater than 1.5-fold stimulation was observed in A. formosa . Regulation of GAPDH in P. ovalis was intermediate between the diatom and the chlorophyte and the possible evolutionary reasons for this are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsterionella formosa 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aEustigmatophyceae 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3apH 3aplastids 0aAsterionella formosa 0aBacillariophyceae 0aCalvin cycle 0aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 0aChlorophyta 0achromalveolates 0aCP12 0aenzyme regulation 0aEustigmatophyceae 0aGAPDH 0aPlantae 0aregulation by pH1 aMaberly, Stephen C.1 aMekhalfi, Malika1 aPlateau, Julia1 aPuppo, Carine1 aGontero, Brigitte0 tEuropean journal of phycology.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 47, no. 3 p.207-215dTaylor & Francis Groupx1469-44337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2012.6874593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245012000203300001200323520135300335592002801688650002201716650002501738650001501763650001301778650001801791650001901809650000901828650001301837650001301850650001901863650002201882700001701904700002001921700001801941700002001959700001201979773012901991856008302120852000902203655001202212IND60702407620221116163241.0220709e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070240762DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-020-02985-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Ganpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9327-538510aEffectiveness of Boswellia and Boswellia extract for osteoarthritis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 225.  aBACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the commonest form of inflammatory joint disease. Unfortunately, to date, there is no appropriate treatment for OA. Boswellia serrata was considered as a potent anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic and analgesic agent that may be a drug for OA. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, data from randomized controlled trials were obtained to assess the effects of Boswellia or its extract versus placebo or western medicine in patients with OA. The primary outcomes included visual analogue score (VAS), WOMAC pain, WOMAC stiffness, WOMAC function and lequesne index. RESULT: Seven trials involving 545 patients were included. Compared with the control group, Boswellia and its extract may relieve the pain [VAS: (WMD -8.33; 95% CI -11.19, − 5.46; P<0.00001); WOMAC pain: (WMD -14.22; 95% CI -22.34, − 6.09; P = 0. 0006)] and stiffness [WOMAC stiffness: (WMD -10.04; 95% CI -15.86, − 4.22; P = 0. 0007)], and improve the joint’s function [WOMAC function: (WMD -10.75; 95% CI -15.06, − 6.43; P<0. 00001); lequesne index: (WMD -2.27; 95% CI -3.08, − 1.45; P<0. 00001)]. CONCLUSION: Based on current evidence, Boswellia and its extract may be an effective and safe treatment option for patient with OA, and the recommended duration of treatment with Boswellia and its extract is at least 4 weeks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoswellia serrata 3aalternative medicine 3aanalgesics 3amedicine 3ameta-analysis 3aosteoarthritis 3apain 3apatients 3aplacebos 3aquestionnaires 3asystematic review1 aWang, Xiang,1 aZhang, Tianqing1 aZeng, Liuting1 aYang, Kathleen,1 aLi, Jun0 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.225-225dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-020-02985-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04337naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245018900167300001600356520264800372592002803020650001703048650001803065650002203083650001703105650002503122650001703147650001303164650001403177650000903191650001003200650001603210650001903226650001703245650001403262650001103276650001503287650001303302650002003315650002103335650002503356650002903381650002603410650002003436653000903456653001703465653001303482653001503495653001603510653002003526700002703546773009203573856008503665852000903750655001203759IND60568180820221119111230.0180905e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056818082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plgene.2017.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Saikat10aSeed priming with spermine and spermidine regulates the expression of diverse groups of abiotic stress-responsive genes during salinity stress in the seedlings of indica rice varieties  ap. 124-132.  aSeed priming with polyamines (PAs) is one of the most desirable techniques to enhance stress tolerance, since it provides prolonged and potential protection to multiple stresses with minimal application cost. In the present study, the main aim was to analyze the effect of seed priming with spermine (Spm) and spermidine (Spd) in salt stressed IR-64 (salt-sensitive) and Nonabokra (salt-tolerant) seedlings with respect to the regulation of genes controlling multiple metabolic pathways governing salt tolerance. The transcriptome profiling of key genes, encoding non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants (ANS, CAT, SOD, APX, GR), osmolyte (P5CS, PDH, BADH1), ABA biosynthetic enzyme (NCED3), transcription factors (TRAB1, WRKY71), LEA (Osem), ion transporter (NHX1), PA-metabolic enzymes (SAMDC, SPDS, SPMS, DAO, PAO) and content of endogenous PAs, responsible for stress tolerance were studied in the shoots and roots of both the cultivars. Our data showed that both Spm and Spd priming enhanced the expression of antioxidant genes in shoots and roots with respect to non-primed stressed seedlings; however, the expression was enhanced more with Spm priming in the salt-sensitive cultivar during stress. Priming with Spm and Spd also increased the expression of osmolyte biosynthetic genes. In addition, both the PAs significantly enhanced the expression of ABA biosynthesis gene, along with increased expression of ABA-inducible transcription factors and LEA gene in both shoots and roots; Spm application triggered better expression. Seed priming with Spd also altered the expression of ion transporter like NHX1 under stress in the shoots of both the cultivars, with better effect in IR-64. Salinization increased (Spm+Spd)/Put ratio more in the tolerant cultivar. Priming with both PAs increased (Spm+Spd) to Put ratio in the two cultivars; however, with Spm, the (Spm+Spd)/Put ratio was increased more in IR-64 together with the coordinated expression of PA biosynthesis and catabolic genes. The down regulation of RbcS expression as a result of salt stress was significantly restored in primed seedlings due to coordinated regulation of the defense pathway. The current results suggest that seed pretreatment with Spm or Spd affects several metabolic pathways to overcome salt stress, with more pronounced effect of Spm in the salt-sensitive cultivar. Spm and Spd could therefore act as nodal regulators of salt stress response by initiating a well-organized crosstalk with multiple metabolic pathways governing salt tolerance. Our observation clearly highlights the intricate interaction of PAs with different stress-related pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aabscisic acid 3aantioxidant genes 3aantioxidants 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acatalase 3acultivars 3arice 3aroots 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseed priming 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 0aRice 0aSeed priming 0aSpermine 0aSpermidine 0aSalt stress 0aGene expression1 aRoychoudhury, Aryadeep0 tPlant gene.g2017 Sept., v. 11 p.124-132dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23305x2352-40737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plgene.2017.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03648naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245017100172300001600343520182100359592002802180650003002208650001502238650001802253650001702271650001502288650001002303650001502313650001102328650001302339650001502352650001302367650001902380650002202399650002202421650001502443650001702458650001502475650002502490653002802515653002802543653001602571653003002587653001602617653002002633653001702653653001502670653001702685700001602702700001902718700002202737700002702759700002502786700001702811773011302828856008402941852000903025655001203034IND50087078220221120200034.0170724e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008707822DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2012.6928162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCouso, Inmaculada10aSynthesis of carotenoids and regulation of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in response to high light stress in the unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ap. 223-232.  aThe carotenoid biosynthesis pathway catalyses the synthesis of essential pigments that are crucial for light harvesting and photoprotection in photosynthetic organisms. It allows the production of several commercially important compounds and is the target of many herbicides. In the present work we studied the influence of light on the carotenoid composition and the expression of genes encoding the main steps of the pathway in the freshwater microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . We observed that there is an activation of the xanthophyll cycle in response to high light, but also in response to other stress conditions, such as nitrogen starvation, which has not been reported previously. We analysed the expression level of (1) genes encoding the two first enzymes of the pathway, phytoene synthase and phytoene desaturase; (2) the enzymes responsible for the cyclization of lycopene, lycopene β-cyclase and lycopene ε-cyclase; (3) zeaxanthin epoxidase, which catalyses the epoxidation of zeaxanthin; and (4) the three known carotene hydroxylases, directly involved in the synthesis of xanthophylls from α and β-carotene. Measurements of carotenoid content in the presence of inhibitors of protein and carotenoid synthesis suggest that only one of the two possible routes for the synthesis of zeaxanthin upon transference to high light, either the de novo synthesis of carotenoids or the interconversion of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin, is dependent on protein synthesis. The high increase in the transcript levels of the cytochrome-dependent carotene β- and ε-hydroxylases in response to high light suggests an important role of these enzymes in regulation of xanthophyll synthesis upon light stress. These conclusions may be of high interest if efficient engineering of the pathway is to be accomplished.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aautotrophs 3abeta-carotene 3abiosynthesis 3afreshwater 3agenes 3aherbicides 3alutein 3alycopene 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aphotostability 3aphytoene synthase 3aprotein synthesis 3astarvation 3aviolaxanthin 3azeaxanthin 3azeaxanthin epoxidase 0acarotene β-hydroxylase 0acarotene ε-hydroxylase 0acarotenoids 0aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 0aChlorophyta 0agene expression 0alight stress 0amicroalgae 0axanthophylls1 aVila, Marta1 aVigara, Javier1 aCordero, Baldo F.1 aVargas, Maria Ángeles1 aRodríguez, Herminia1 aLeón, Rosa,0 tEuropean journal of phycology.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 47, no. 3 p.223-232dTaylor & Francis Groupx1469-44337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2012.6928163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012600169300001400295520125700309592002801566653001901594653001401613653002201627653001601649653001401665653001601679700001801695700001901713700002001732700001501752773012001767856008301887852000901970655001201979IND60126644820221119065445.0151107e200202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012664482DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-95.1.282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaarmann, Timothy10aEffects of Fluvalinate and Coumaphos on Queen Honey Bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in Two Commercial Queen Rearing Operations  ap. 28-35.  aWe conducted research on the potential impacts of fluvalinate and coumaphos on honey bee, Apis mellifera L., queen viability and health. Queens were reared in colonies that had been treated with differing amounts of both fluvalinate and coumaphos. Pre- and posttreatment samples of both wax and bees were collected from all of the colonies and analyzed for total concentrations of fluvalinate and coumaphos. All queens were measured for queen weight, ovarial weight, and number of sperm in the spermathecae. The queens treated with high doses of fluvalinate weighed significantly less than low-dose or control queens, but otherwise appeared to develop normally. The highest fluvalinate concentrations were observed in the wax and queen cells of the high-dose group. The developing queens in colonies treated with as little as one coumaphos-impregnated strip for more than 24 h suffered a high mortality rate. Several of the queens showed sublethal effects from the coumaphos, including physical abnormalities and atypical behavior. The queens exposed to coumaphos weighed significantly less and had lower ovary weights than the control group queens.

We designed four irrigation-level treatments: 100% ET₀ (T1), 85% ET₀ (T2), 70% ET₀ (T3), and 55% ET₀ (T4), and conducted a two-vegetation-season tomato planting trial under drip irrigation conditions in a solar greenhouse. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient method analyzed the intrinsic linkage and influence between soil–crop–environment and tomatoes’ water demand patterns. Indicators suitable for irrigation decision making in greenhouse tomatoes were selected, and regression functions were constructed for environmental and crop physiological parameters by combining path analysis and multiple regression methods. Finally, a fusion irrigation decision-making model was constructed by introducing a distance function in the Dempster–Shafer (D–S) theory primary probability assignment (BPA) synthesis algorithm and combining it with a triangular affiliation function. The results showed that: (1) the soil coefficient of variation was shallow > middle > deep, and tomatoes absorbed water mainly in the 0–60 cm soil layer; (2) the crop stem flow rate, net photosynthetic rate, and transpiration rate were positively correlated with irrigation water and had the highest correlation with net radiation, relative humidity, and relative humidity, with correlation coefficients of 0.9441, 0.9441, and 0.7679, respectively; (3) the constructed decision model had a significantly lower value of uncertainty than other methods, while the highest decision value could reach over 0.99, which achieved the best decision accuracy compared to other algorithms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3aalgorithms 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3agreenhouses 3airrigation water 3amicroirrigation 3amodels 3anet radiation 3apath analysis 3aphotosynthesis 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3asoil 3astemflow 3atomatoes 3atranspiration 3auncertainty 3awater conservation 3awater use efficiency1 aYang, Fuxin 1 aYang, Yingru 1 aHuang, Yuan 1 aZhangzhong, Lili 1 aWei, Xiaoming 1 aYu, Jingxin 0 tAgronomy.g2022 July 13, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120716683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01453naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245006800171300001600239520037600255592002800631650001300659650002100672650001400693650001000707650001400717653002400731653001400755653001700769653001400786653001700800653002300817700006000840773010100900856008101001852000901082655001201091IND60597570920221118125302.0180624e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059757092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2018.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Costa, Rafael R.10aMixed-Mode Transmission Shapes Termite Gut Community Assemblies  ap. 557-559.  aUnderstanding how microbial symbiont community assemblies are shaped over evolutionary time is challenging.

This study provides a detailed description of wave transformation processes across a shore platform near Gisborne, New Zealand. A field experiment was conducted on an intertidal, 250m-wide platform that is characterised by a sharp seaward edge. Mean platform elevation is 0.7m below mean sea-level (MSL) and platform gradient is 0.3°. Four nearly equally spaced pressure gauges were deployed over a 24-h period during fair-weather swell conditions characterised by a mean wave height of 0.4–0.5m and wave period of 7s. Wave energy at the seaward edge of the platform was dominated by incident swell waves with peak frequency at 0.09Hz. At all tidal stages waves broke at the seaward edge of the platform, but changing tidal stage exerted a strong control on the rate of wave energy attenuation across the platform. The relative importance of waves at wind-wave frequencies increased in the centre of the platform as the tidal stage and water level increased, whereas infragravity waves became dominant toward the cliff toe. Three different hydrodynamic zones were distinguished across the shore platform; (i) a breaker zone close to the seaward edge; (ii) a propagation/shoaling zone in the central region of the platform; and (iii) a zone of energy dissipation across the inner part of the platform. The spatial dimensions of the three zones varied with changing tidal stage, enabling different wave processes to operate across different parts of the platform at different times. The experiment showed that wave-height attenuation is strongly controlled by tidal stage, ranging between 93% attenuation of wave height during the initial flooding stage to 44% attenuation at high tide. Wave height was found to be depth-limited, with the ratios of Hₘₐₓ and Hₘ₀ to water depth calculated as 0.7 and 0.4, respectively. The findings imply that platform geometry has an important influence on wave processes on shore platforms. The geomorphic implications of gravity and infragravity waves are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3acontinental shelf 3aenergy 3afield experimentation 3agravity 3ahydrodynamics 3apressure gauges 3asea level 3awater power 3awater waves 3aNew Zealand1 aDickson, M.E.1 aKench, P.S.0 tContinental shelf research.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 31, no. 14 p.1409-1419dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2011.05.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011700174500001900291520117700310592002801487650000801515650002001523650000801543650001201551650001001563650001601573650002001589650002201609650001301631650001101644650002901655653002501684653003301709653002101742700005501763700002801818700006701846700002901913700002901942773012101971856008802092852000902180655001202189IND60736065720221119073120.0210610e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073606572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1044792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamantara, Kajal12aA comprehensive review on epigenetic mechanisms and application of epigenetic modifications for crop improvement  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aErosion of genetic diversity due to excessive breeding applications is a major threat to crop species. Plants should be genetically diverse to cope with repercussions of changing climate. Of late, diversity made available through epigenetic changes now appearing to be a novel source for crop improvement. Epigenetics is a phenomenon that alters heritable gene expression without implicating any variation in the genomic DNA sequences. The mechanism of epigenetics involves three important events viz., DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications and RNA directed DNA methylation. These epigenetic modifications involve creation of memory marks which help plants to survive various stresses through physiological regulation based on their epigenetic history. Here, we represent a comprehensive review on the understanding of epigenetic mechanisms that contributes to plant responses towards several biotic and abiotic stresses. Moreover, we have also detailed about various epigenetic approaches that has improved several desirable agronomic traits. Hence, epigenetics is a potential research area that can be exploited for development of climate smart crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aRNA 3aclimate 3acrops 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agenetic variation 3ahistones 3amemory 3aphysiological regulation 0aHistone modification 0aRNA directed DNA methylation 0aCrop improvement1 aShiv, Aalok1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2064-92321 ade Sousa, Lorenna Lopes1 aSandhu, Karansher Singh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9395-26461 aPriyadarshini, Parichita1 aMohapatra, Sourav Ranjan0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2021 Aug., v. 188 p.104479-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1044793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245015000159500001400309520138100323592002801704650002401732650001201756650001501768650002001783650001301803700002201816700002501838700002201863773012001885856007502005852000902080655001202089IND60707790320221120214408.0200821e20200730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070779032DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100813062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerger, Anne 10aMoving in the Dark—Evidence for an Influence of Artificial Light at Night on the Movement Behaviour of European Hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus)  aNAL-light  aWith urban areas growing worldwide comes an increase in artificial light at night (ALAN), causing a significant impact on wildlife behaviour and its ecological relationships. The effects of ALAN on nocturnal and protected European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are unknown but their identification is important for sustainable species conservation and management. In a pilot study, we investigated the influence of ALAN on the natural movement behaviour of 22 hedgehogs (nine females, 13 males) in urban environments. Over the course of four years, we equipped hedgehogs at three different study locations in Berlin with biologgers to record their behaviour for several weeks. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) tags to monitor their spatial behaviour, very high-frequency (VHF) loggers to locate their nests during daytime, and accelerometers to distinguish between active and passive behaviours. We compared the mean light intensity of the locations recorded when the hedgehogs were active with the mean light intensity of simulated locations randomly distributed in the individual’s home range. We were able to show that the ALAN intensity of the hedgehogs’ habitations was significantly lower compared to the simulated values, regardless of the animal’s sex. This ALAN-related avoidance in the movement behaviour can be used for applied hedgehog conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErinaceus europaeus 3aanimals 3ahome range 3alight intensity 3awildlife1 aLozano, Briseida 1 aBarthel, Leon  M.

In this work twenty-eight Aspergillus niger mutants were screened for peptidases and keratinases production on a basal medium containing chicken feathers (1%). Four strains were selected after preliminary assays: 3T5B8, 9D40, 9D80, and 11D40. The keratinase production was higher when the A. niger strains were cultivated in a solid-state condition rather than a submerged condition: the keratinolytic activity of 3T5B8 strain was 7 times greater when cultivated by solid-state fermentation (SSF). A. niger 3T5B8 had the highest keratinase activity (172.7 U/ml) after seven days at pH 5.0 from solid-state fermentation, whereas the lowest activity was given by A. niger 9D40 after four days (21.3 U/ml) from submerged fermentation. Zymography of culture supernatant showed multiple bands migrating at 40–130, 14–130, displaying activity towards keratin and gelatin substrates, respectively. This is the first study to report production of high molecular mass peptidases using a feather-degrading Aspergillus. Peptidases from strains 3T5B8, 9D40, 9D80, and 11D40 were inhibited by PMSF, except the approximately 40-kDa peptidase, which was inhibited by phenanthroline, indicating the presence of serine and metallopeptidases. The results therefore suggest that the isolates are promising keratinase producers for biotechnological purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3achickens 3aculture media 3afeathers 3agelatin 3akeratin 3ametalloproteinases 3amicroorganisms 3amolecular weight 3amutants 3apH 3aserine 3asolid state fermentation 3asubmerged fermentation 3awastes 0aAspergillus niger 0aKeratinase 0aPeptidase 0aSolid-state fermentation 0aSubmerged fermentation1 aCouri, Sonia1 aDamaso, Mônica C.T.1 aVermelho, Alane Beatriz0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Nov., v. 85 p.189-195dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245005700171300002000228500001900248520165000267592002801917596006001945650002202005650001502027650001202042650001402054650001502068650002402083650001102107650001902118650002802137650001502165650001902180650001702199700006302216773012402279856008202403852000902485655001202494IND60709016020221119135109.0200902e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070901602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-05106-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrivastava, Vipul10aConsequences of Bi3+ introduction for Pr3+ in PrAlO3  ap. 15415-15425.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWith the intent to comprehend the structure and hence the property changes in the PrAlO₃ system, the substitution of Bi³⁺ for Pr³⁺ has been attempted. The samples were synthesized by solution combustion synthesis and characterized extensively. X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the rhombohedral perovskite structure was preserved up to 20 mol% substitution of bismuth, beyond which diffraction peaks of the secondary phase of α-Bi₂O₃emerged. The structural refinements indicated the increment of both a and c lattice dimensions with an increase in bismuth content. The samples had porous morphology, and a mean pore diameter of 22.4 nm, along with a surface area of 100 m²/g, was deduced from BET measurements for the 20 mol% bismuth-substituted sample. FTIR, Raman spectroscopic and electron microscopic analysis reinforced the perovskite structure adopted by the bismuth-substituted samples. Both Pr and Bi in Pr₀.₈₀Bi₀.₂₀AlO₃ existed in the + 3 oxidation state as established from the XPS analysis. The inclusion of bismuth introduced intermediate energy levels within the bandgap, as suggested by the redshift of the absorption edge for the bismuth-substituted samples. As the optical bandgap values were in the semiconductor regime, the application of bismuth-replaced samples as a catalyst for the photodegradation of crystal violet dye solution was demonstrated. The amount of dye degraded increased with an increase in the amount of bismuth in the sample. Additionally, Pr₀.₈₀Bi₀.₂₀AlO₃ catalyzed the reduction of nitroaromatics promoted possibly by the Bi³⁺/Bi(0) redox couple.  aPublisher supplied data  aEMR/2016/006131cScience and Engineering Research Board 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3abismuth 3acatalysts 3acombustion 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy 3agentian violet 3anitroaromatic compounds 3aphotolysis 3asemiconductors 3asurface area1 aNagarajan, Rajamani1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0983-78140 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Nov., v. 55, no. 32 p.15415-15425dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-05106-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245007400167300001600241520107900257592002801336650002401364650002101388650001101409650001401420650000901434650001701443650001001460650001901470650001501489650002301504650001501527650003101542650001301573650001801586650001001604653002401614653001601638653001501654653002601669700002601695700002101721700002201742700001701764700002001781773011201801856008301913852000901996655001202005IND60087540320221120031842.0161023e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008754032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSara, Panseri10aEffect of veterinary antibiotics on biogas and bio-methane production  ap. 205-209.  aThis work studied the effect of three classes of veterinary antibiotics (Ceftiofur, Danofloxacin and Micospectone: a combination of Spectinomycin and Lincomycin) that are used to treat the respiratory diseases of cows and pigs on anaerobic digestion. Three different doses of antibiotics were added to a pig slurry and tested in combination with two patterns of thermal treatment performed over various times.During the anaerobic tests, such parameters as total biogas production and methane concentration in biogas were monitored. At the end of the anaerobic tests, antibiotic concentrations left in the slurries were detected. The results showed that Ceftiofur was the most degradable drug (approximately 70% of the initial content was degraded), while Danofloxacin and Lincomycin were less degradable (30–34% of the total initial content). The greatest inhibition of anaerobic digestion was observed with the drug association of Lincomycin and Spectinomycin (Micospectone), which presented the least physical degradability (heat treatment) and biological degradability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradability 3abiogas 3aceftiofur 3acows 3adanofloxacin 3adrugs 3aheat treatment 3alincomycin 3amethane production 3apig manure 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aslurries 3aspectinomycin 3aswine 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aAntibiotics 0aInhibition 0aThermal pre-treatment1 aGiuliana, D'Imporzano1 aMichele, Pognani1 aMaurizio, Cavalli1 aLuca, Chiesa1 aFabrizio, Adani0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Nov., v. 85 p.205-209dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245007100172300001600243500001500259520113600274592002801410650001201438650002101450650001701471650001301488650002501501650001001526650002101536650002201557650002201579650001801601650002501619650001001644653002001654653002101674653001701695653001901712653002201731653000901753653001001762700002401772700002401796700003001820773011201850856008301962852000902045655001202054IND60087540520221120041004.0161023e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008754052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Filpo, Giovanni10aPreventing fungal growth in wood by titanium dioxide nanoparticles  ap. 217-222.  a2019-12-06  aFungi play a considerable role in the deterioration of cultural heritage, as their contamination favours the decay of the materials used for historical art objects. Fungus prevention, the treatment of contaminated objects and their successive conservation are important items to restorers. Over the past decade, nanotechnology has been applied in several fields of cultural heritage conservation in order to prevent, for example, the chemical degradation of mural paintings and paper acidity. Nevertheless, nanomaterials have not been yet used as antifungal and biocidal agents for wood handworks. In this work we have treated eight different types of wood, some of which are commonly used in the field of cultural heritage, with a solution of titanium dioxide nanoparticles and placed them in contact with two species of fungi, Hypocrea lixii (white-rot) and Mucor circinelloides (brown-rot), which are known to be responsible for a fast decay of wood. Results show that the photo-catalytic activity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles prevents the fungal colonization of wood samples over long time when compared to untreated ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3atitanium dioxide 3adecayed wood 3abiocides 3aMucor circinelloides 3apaper 3amicrobial growth 3acultural heritage 3aTrichoderma lixii 3ananoparticles 3achemical degradation 3afungi 0aPhoto-catalysis 0aTitanium dioxide 0aNanoparticle 0aHypocrea lixii 0aCultural heritage 0aWood 0aFungi1 aPalermo, Anna Maria1 aRachiele, Francesca1 aNicoletta, Fiore Pasquale0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Nov., v. 85 p.217-222dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002900145245012500174300001600299500001100315520166800326592002801994650005702022650000802079650002202087650005202109650001002161650001402171650001002185650002002195650001202215650001802227650001502245650001802260650001802278650002202296650001702318650002002335650001202355700002102367700001302388700002002401700006102421773011602482856008002598852000902678655001202687IND60767435420221120165853.0220216e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076743542DNAL7 a10.1111/1744-7917.129132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLlopis‐Giménez, Angel12aA proctolin‐like peptide is regulated after baculovirus infection and mediates in caterpillar locomotion and digestion  ap. 230-244.  aREVIEW  aBaculoviruses constitute a large group of invertebrate DNA viruses, predominantly infecting larvae of the insect order Lepidoptera. During a baculovirus infection, the virus spreads throughout the insect body producing a systemic infection in multiple larval tissues, included the central nervous system (CNS). As a main component of the CNS, neuropeptides are small protein‐like molecules functioning as neurohormones, neurotransmitters, or neuromodulators. These peptides are involved in regulating animal physiology and behavior and could be altered after baculovirus infection. In this study, we have investigated the effect of Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) infection on expression of Spodoptera exigua neuropeptides and neuropeptide‐like genes. Expression of the gene encoding a polypeptide that resembles the well‐known insect neuropeptide proctolin and named as proctolin‐like peptide (PLP), was downregulated in the larval brain following infection and was chosen for further analysis. A recombinant Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) overexpressing the C‐terminal part of the PLP was generated and used in bioassays using S. exigua larvae to study its influence on the viral infection and insect behavior. AcMNPV‐PLP‐infected larvae showed less locomotion activity and a reduction in growth compared to larvae infected with wild type AcMNPV or mock‐infected larvae. These results are indicative of this new peptide as a neuromodulator that regulates visceral and skeletal muscle contractions and offers a novel effector involved in the behavioral changes during baculovirus infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAutographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aDNA 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aSpodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 3abrain 3adigestion 3agenes 3ainsect behavior 3ainsects 3ainvertebrates 3alocomotion 3aneurohormones 3aneuropeptides 3aneurotransmitters 3apolypeptides 3askeletal muscle 3aviruses1 aParenti, Stefano1 aHan, Yue1 aRos, Vera I.

Pedigree information for 64,917 individuals were used to assess inbreeding level, effective population size (Ne), and effective numbers of founders and ancestors (fₐ/fₑ). Genotypic information from SNP markers were available for 267 individuals of both sexes, and it allowed estimating genomic inbreeding in two methods (observed versus expected homozygosity and from ROH) to study the breed genomic structure and possible selection signatures. Pedigree and genomic inbreeding were greatly correlated (0.65 on average). The inbreeding trend increased over time, apart from periods in which the base population enlarged, when Ne increased also. Recent bottlenecks did not occur in the genome, as fₐ/fₑ have shown. The observed homozygosity results were on average lower than expected, which was probably due to the use of French Breton stallions to support the breed genetic variability. High homozygous regions suggested that inbreeding increased in different periods. Two subpopulations were distinguished, which was probably due to the different inclusion of French animals by breeders. Few selection signatures were found at the population level, with possible associations to disease resistance. The almost low inbreeding rate suggested that despite the small breed size, conservation actions are not yet required.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease resistance 3adraft horses 3aeffective population size 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenomics 3ahomozygosity 3apedigree1 aAblondi, Michela 1 aMantovani, Roberto 1 aPigozzi, Giuseppe 1 aSabbioni, Alberto 1 aSartori, Cristina 0 tAnimals.g2020 July 30, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100813103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013100163300002000294500001900314520100100333592002801334650001501362650003001377650001401407700001601421700001901437700003101456700001801487700001901505700001701524773012401541856008201665852000901747655001201756IND60709016520221119134937.0200902e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070901652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-05114-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fubin10aNovel three-dimensional TiO2-Fe3O4@polypyrrole composites with tunable microwave absorption in the 2–40 GHz frequency range  ap. 15493-15509.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEnormous research effort is currently being directed toward the development of low-cost electromagnetic wave absorbing (EMWA) materials that operate at microwave frequencies. Herein, we report the successful fabrication of novel three-dimensional TiO₂-Fe₃O₄@Polypyrrole (T-F-P) composites with excellent microwave absorption properties between 2 and 40 GHz. By varying the thickness of the T-F-P absorber from 1.5 to 2.5 mm, an effective absorption bandwidth (EAB, reflection loss (RL) ≤ − 10 dB) of 28.12 GHz (11.88–40 GHz) was realized. At a thickness of 2.5 mm, the minimum reflection loss (RLₘᵢₙ) was − 37.49 dB (13.84 GHz) in the frequency range 2–18 GHz; − 41.30 dB (25.30 GHz) in the frequency range 18–26.5 GHz and − 42.65 dB (34.1 GHz) in the frequency range 26.5–40 GHz. Multiple reflections, interfacial polarization, conductive losses and magnetic losses all contribute to the excellent EMWA properties of the T-F-P composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3amagnetism1 aLi, Cuiping1 aJiang, Xiaohui1 aWaterhouse, Geoffrey I.

In order to be used in outdoor conditions, non-durable material must be protected. Non-biocidal solutions for wood protection have been attracting a lot of attention, particularly in class 2 and 3 applications. One non-biocidal technique is treatment of wood with water repellents, such as wax emulsions and oils. Linseed oil and tung oil are frequently used water repellents. This research reports on the performance of linseed- and tung-oil-treated Norway spruce and beech wood against wood-decay fungi. Additionally, short-term hydrophobic properties were determined (with a tensiometer), as well as long-term hydrophobic properties (by soaking in water) in laboratory and outdoor conditions (electrical resistance measurements). Wood treated with tung oil and linseed oil is protected against brown- and white-rot fungi; however, tung oil was found more effective. Not only did the oils tested prove efficacious against wood-decay fungi, but also they worked against short-, medium-, and long-term water uptake as well. Oil treated wood takes up less water during laboratory tests, as well as during outdoor testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aPicea abies 3aelectrical resistance 3aemulsions 3ahydrophobicity 3alaboratory techniques 3alinseed oil 3arepellents 3asoaking 3atung oil 3awater uptake 3awhite-rot fungi 3awood 3awood treatment 0aTung oil 0aNorway spruce 0aCommon beech 0aWood-decay fungi 0aMoisture content 0aDecay1 aLesar, Boštjan0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Nov., v. 85 p.223-227dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245007500164500001400239520129800253592002801551650001901579650002401598650002501622650001001647650000901657650001401666650001601680650002001696650001001716650000901726650001201735650002001747650002201767650001301789651001201802700002401814700002001838773012001858856007501978852000902053655001202062IND60707790820221120204544.0200821e20200730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070779082DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100813122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzendrő, Katalin 10aConsumer Acceptance of Meat from Animals Reared on Insect Meal as Feed  aNAL-light  aInsect protein production requires much less land, feed, and water, and thus has a much smaller ecological footprint than animal protein production, which is important for reducing global warming. Poultry, pigs, and fish consume insects in nature, so insect meal could be a good substitute for soybean and fishmeal as a protein source in diets. The aim of this study was to examine consumer opinion on meat that originated from animals whose diet contained insect meal. The study was conducted in Hungary in 2020 (N = 414). On a scale of 1–7, respondents gave much lower scores (3.96) to this product than that which originated from a free-range system (5.11; p < 0.001). Male, more highly educated, and 30–39 year-old respondents gave significantly higher scores than other groups. The most important factor in accepting insect meal in animal feed was “no risk”, while the least important factor was “replacement of Genetically Modified (GM) soybeans”. Since free-range animals also consume insects, the difference in the attitude of respondents was based on their aversion to insects, while accepting free-range as the best animal welfare system. Thus, more emphasis should be placed on the benefits of insect meal in animal feed in order to bring about awareness and acceptance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aconsumer acceptance 3aecological footprint 3afeeds 3afish 3afish meal 3ainsect meal 3ainsect proteins 3amales 3ameat 3apoultry 3aprotein sources 3aprotein synthesis 3asoybeans 3aHungary1 aNagy, Mónika  Zita1 aTóth, Katalin,0 tAnimals.g2020 July 30, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100813123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245016600160300001600326500002000342520217200362592002802534650002802562650001602590650001102606650001202617650001702629650001002646650001602656650001802672650002202690650001402712650001302726650001902739700001402758700001302772700005402785700001902839773011602858856008002974852000903054655001203063IND60767435620221120180550.0220216e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076743562DNAL7 a10.1111/1744-7917.129192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qian14aThe Adelphocoris lineolatus OBP4: Support for evolutionary and functional divergence of a mirid pheromone‐binding protein from that found in lepidopteran moths  ap. 151-161.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPheromone‐binding proteins (PBPs) have been extensively investigated in lepidopteran moths, but their evolution and function in hemipteran species remain unclear. Our previous study demonstrated that an odorant‐binding protein, OBP4, of the mirid bug Adelphocoris lineolatus functions as a candidate hemipteran PBP but clustered with lepidopteran antennae‐binding proteins (ABPs) rather than in the PBP/general odorant‐binding protein (GOBP) clade. In this study, we hypothesized that origin and function of PBPs in hemipteran bugs may differ from those of lepidopteran moths. To test this hypothesis, we first constructed a phylogenetic tree using insect OBPs from sister hemipteran and holometabolous lineages, and the results indicated that neither OBP4 nor other types of candidate PBPs of mirid bugs clustered with the lepidopteran PBP/GOBP clade. Then, a fluorescence competitive binding assay was employed to determine binding affinities of recombinant OBP4 protein to host plant volatiles, with functional groups different from A. lineolatus sex pheromone components. The results revealed that OBP4 highly bound the female adult attractant 3‐hexanone and 15 other mirid bug biologically active plant volatiles. Finally, we examined cellular expression profiles of OBP4 in putative antennal sensilla that are related to female A. lineolatus host plant location. The fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical labeling assay showed that the OBP4 gene was highly expressed in the multiporous olfactory sensilla medium‐long sensilla basiconica rather than in the short sensilla basiconica or uniporous sensilla chaetica. These results, together with those of our previous studies, indicate that OBP4 not only functions in recognition of bug‐produced sex pheromones in males, but is probably involved in detection of host plant volatiles in both A. lineolatus sexes. Our findings support the hypothesis that the origin and function of PBPs in hemipteran bugs differ from those of well‐known PBPs in lepidopteran moths, which provides a novel perspective on evolutionary mechanisms of sex pheromone communication across insect orders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdelphocoris lineolatus 3aLepidoptera 3aadults 3afemales 3afluorescence 3agenes 3ahost plants 3ahybridization 3aodorant receptors 3aphylogeny 3asensilla 3asex pheromones1 aLi, Yujie1 aWang, Qi1 aSun, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8196-82371 aZhang, Yongjun0 tInsect science.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 1 p.151-161dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3869360x1672-96097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.129193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245011000167520174400277592002802021650002402049650001802073650001702091650002102108650001902129650002002148650001302168650000902181650001402190650001302204650001802217651001002235653002702245653002502272653004402297700001602341700001602357773010902373856008802482852000902570655001202579IND60736066820221119072837.0210729e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073606682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.1053482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Ling10aStudy on the dinoflagellate cysts in ballast tank sediments of international vessels in Chinese shipyards  aThe problem of aquatic invasive species caused by discharge of ballast water and sediments from ships’ ballast tanks has become extremely prominent. Seventeen sediment samples taken from ballast tanks of different ships docked in two Chinese shipyards were examined to identify the variety of resting dinoflagellate cysts. Twenty-two dinoflagellate cyst taxa were identified in these samples, including 11 photosynthetic and eleven heterotrophic species. These species represent 10 genera with the dominating assemblages of Alexandrium minutum, Scrippsiella acuminata, Lingulodinium polyedra, Protoperidinium sp. and Protoperidinium conicum. The total abundance of the dinoflagellate cysts ranged from 36 to 448 cysts g⁻¹ dry weight, which demonstrated a wide range of diversity for different ships. It was observed that the number of taxa and concentrations of cysts in ballast tank sediments were slightly greater for ships performing short voyage than ships performing longer voyage. The compositions of dinoflagellate cysts in sediments from ships sailing diverse routes were more variable than those sailing same routes. Sediment moisture content proved to be well correlated to the total cyst abundance (r = 0.7422, P < 0.01). Furthermore, nine toxic and harmful species were observed from all sediment samples, which indicated a wide range of distribution and potential risk of harmful algal blooms if being discharged to Chinese waters. As a result, full attention should be drawn to the studies on dinoflagellate cysts in the ballast tank sediments from ships arriving at China, this is of great significance for preventing introduction of toxic and harmful dinoflagellate cysts and protecting native marine biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlexandrium minutum 3aballast water 3abiodiversity 3ainvasive species 3aphotosynthesis 3apoisonous algae 3aresearch 3arisk 3asediments 3atoxicity 3awater content 3aChina 0aBallast tank sediments 0aDinoflagellate cysts 0aToxic and harmful dinoflagellates cysts1 aWang, Qiong1 aWu, Huixian0 tMarine environmental research.g2021 July, v. 169 p.105348-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.1053483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03780naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245012100189300001800310500001500328520182900343592002802172650003902200650001802239650001802257650001802275650001202293650001002305650002302315650001302338650001802351650001602369650001902385650001102404650001402415650001002429650002502439650001502464650001202479650003902491650004002530650002402570650003602594650004002630650002502670650001402695650002902709650004702738650002802785653002602813700001902839700001902858700002102877700002002898700001502918700002202933773011102955856005503066852000903121655001203130IND4465778220221118022936.0120423e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446577822DNAL7 a223643532pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02714.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadax, Regina10aMetatranscriptomics of the marine sponge Geodia barretti: tackling phylogeny and function of its microbial community  ap. 1308-1324.  a2019-12-05  aGeodia barretti is a marine cold‐water sponge harbouring high numbers of microorganisms. Significant rates of nitrification have been observed in this sponge, indicating a substantial contribution to nitrogen turnover in marine environments with high sponge cover. In order to get closer insights into the phylogeny and function of the active microbial community and the interaction with its host G. barretti, a metatranscriptomic approach was employed, using the simultaneous analysis of rRNA and mRNA. Of the 262 298 RNA‐tags obtained by pyrosequencing, 92% were assigned to ribosomal RNA (ribo‐tags). A total of 109 325 SSU rRNA ribo‐tags revealed a detailed picture of the community, dominated by group SAR202 of Chloroflexi, candidate phylum Poribacteria and Acidobacteria, which was different in its composition from that obtained in clone libraries prepared form the same samples. Optimized assembly strategies allowed the reconstruction of full‐length rRNA sequences from the short ribo‐tags for more detailed phylogenetic studies of the dominant taxa. Cells of several phyla were visualized by FISH analyses for confirmation. Of the remaining 21 325 RNA‐tags, 10 023 were assigned to mRNA‐tags, based on similarities to genes in the databases. A wide range of putative functional gene transcripts from over 10 different phyla were identified among the bacterial mRNA‐tags. The most abundant mRNAs were those encoding key metabolic enzymes of nitrification from ammonia‐oxidizing archaea as well as candidate genes involved in related processes. Our analysis demonstrates the potential and limits of using a combined rRNA and mRNA approach to explore the microbial community profile, phylogenetic assignments and metabolic activities of a complex, but little explored microbial community.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3amessenger RNA 3aribosomal RNA 3aAcidobacteria 3aenzymes 3ahosts 3amarine environment 3anitrogen 3anitrification 3aChloroflexi 3amicroorganisms 3aclones 3aphylogeny 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3agene banks 2aAnimals 2aArchaeaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aEukaryotaxgenetics 2aGeodiaxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aMetagenomexgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscriptomexgenetics 0aChloroflexaceae group1 aRattei, Thomas1 aLanzen, Anders1 aBayer, Christoph1 aRapp, Hans Tore1 aUrich, Tim1 aSchleper, Christa0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2012 May, v. 14, no. 5 p.1308-1324dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02714.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009900165300002000264500001900284520100200303592002801305596008201333596008201415596006401497596006301561596005501624596010501679650002101784650001701805650002101822650001501843650001901858650001601877650001001893650001701903650001101920650002301931700001801954700001501972700001501987700005602002700001702058700001302075700001502088773012402103856008202227852000902309655001202318IND60709017120221119134656.0200902e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070901712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-05108-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dingding10aAssembly of Janus complex with low-cost and salt rejection for solar-thermal water evaporation  ap. 15551-15561.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInterfacial solar-thermal water evaporation (STWE) shows considerable potential in terms of harvesting freshwater from the ocean; thereinto, the design of an efficient floatable material with low-cost and salt deposition resistance is always one of the most concerned issues. In this work, we prepared an economical Janus complex for STWE by assembling commercial carbon nanotubes and porous cotton fiber paper, functionalized by silanization and combination of polyelectrolyte. Because of the synergy of efficient photothermal conversion, localized hot layer and fast transmission of water and vapor, the Janus complex displayed a superior evaporation rate of 3.443 kg m⁻² h⁻¹ under 5 suns (5 kW m⁻²) in saltwater. Moreover, almost no salt was detected in the used Janus complex, and the salt deposition was rejected at the source due to the strong ionic strength of polyelectrolyte. These results indicated that the Janus complex has potential applications for water purification.  aPublisher supplied data  a19JK0861cScientific Research Fund of Shaanxi Provincial Education Department  a20JK0945cScientific Research Fund of Shaanxi Provincial Education Department  a51873134cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  a2018JQ5058cNatural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province  a2020M673461cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a2019ZDLGY16-09cIndustrial Innovation China of Key Research, Development Project of Shaanxi Province 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrolytes 3aevaporation rate 3afreshwater 3aionic strength 3alint cotton 3apaper 3asaline water 3avapors 3awater purification1 aZhou, Qingxin1 aWang, Gang1 aZhao, Hang1 aMa, Shenghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7995-33621 aLeng, Kunyue1 aWang, Yi1 aBai, Jinbo0 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Nov., v. 55, no. 32 p.15551-15561dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-05108-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03814naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012800169300002000297500001900317520227600336592002802612650002202640650000802662650001502670650002002685650001002705650001202715650001502727650001402742650004402756650001202800650002902812650001402841650001202855650001302867650001602880650002402896650001202920700001702932700002202949700001802971700006202989700002403051700001803075773012403093856008203217852000903299655001203308IND60709017220221119134719.0200902e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070901722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-05033-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarmakar, Gourab10aAccessing photoresponsive copper selenide nanomaterials and thin films through tetranuclear Cu(I) pyridylselenolate cluster  ap. 15439-15453.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe development of single-source molecular precursor for the synthesis of nanomaterials with controlled size and morphology has led to important scientific discoveries in past few decades. Herein, we describe the synthesis of air and moisture stable copper cluster complex with 5-methyl-2-pyridylselenolate, [Cu{2-SeC₅H₃(Me-5)N}]₄ as molecular precursor for copper selenide nanomaterials and thin films. The complex was obtained in good yield, and the purity of the complex was evaluated through multi-nuclear NMR spectroscopy. The complex upon recrystallization in chloroform and toluene produces different polymorphs whose molecular structures were unambiguously established from single-crystal X-ray diffraction technique. Thermolysis of the complex in selected high-boiling solvents afforded phase-pure Cu₁.₈Se nanostructures. Thin films of phase-pure Cu₅Se₄ were also deposited by AACVD employing [Cu{2-SeC₅H₃(Me-5)N}]₄ on glass and silicon substrates at different temperatures. The effect of higher temperature is perceived in drastic morphology change from nanosheets to a mixture of nanosheets and nanowires of Cu₅Se₄ on glass substrate. The nanostructures and thin films were characterized by pXRD, EDS, SEM and TEM techniques. The direct band gaps of the nanomaterials as deduced from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy are in the range 2.74–2.86 eV. The profound effect of solvent on phase purity, morphology and band gap of the nanostructures has also been investigated thoroughly. The nanostructures demonstrated prompt photoresponse which make them suitable candidate for non-toxic and low-cost photon absorber material. A tetranuclear Cu(I) complex with 5-methyl-2-pyridylselenolate ligand has been prepared and crystallized in two polymorphic forms, namely monoclinic [Cu{2-SeC₅H₃(Me-5)N}]₄·C₆H₅CH₃ and triclinic [Cu{2-SeC₅H₃(Me-5)N}]₄. The complex was subjected to undergo thermolysis and AACVD to prepare Cu₁.₈Se nanomaterials and Cu₅Se₄ thin films, respectively. The nanomaterials and thin films were characterized using pXRD, SEM and TEM techniques to understand the phase purity and morphology.

Here, we present a combination of ex situ measurements of enzyme-released oligosaccharide fragments using MALDI-TOF MS and in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging through PeakForce quantitative nanomechanical mapping of tip-functionalized single-molecule enzyme-polysaccharide substrate recognition and the nanoscale dissolution kinetics of individual cellulose microfibrils of living rice (Oryza sativa) cells following silicate cross-linking of cell wall xyloglucan. We find that xyloglucan-bound silicon enhances the resistance to degradation by cellulase and improves the wall nanomechanical properties in the elastic modulus at the single-cell level. The findings establish a direct link between an inorganic element of silicon and the nanoscale architecture of plant cell wall materials for sustainable utilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aatomic force microscopy 3acell walls 3acellulose microfibrils 3acrosslinking 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3amodulus of elasticity 3aoligosaccharides 3arice 3asilicates 3asilicon 3axyloglucans 0aXyloglucan 0aSilicon 0aSingle-molecule enzyme-substrate recognition 0aNanomechanical properties 0aCell wall 0aLiving cells1 aWang, Lijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7125-94801 aZhang, Wenjun1 aMa, Jie1 aZhang, Xiuqing1 aPutnis, Christine V.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 266 p.118057-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1180573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009400159300001600253520145700269592002801726650002401754650001701778650000901795650001301804650001501817650002601832650001301858650001701871650002201888650000901910650001101919650002001930651001801950773011801968856007402086852000902160655001202169IND60118023520221116221058.0141126e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011802352DNAL7 a10.1093/icb/ics0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonnet, Xavier10aLong-term Field Study of Sea Kraits in New Caledonia: Fundamental Issues and Conservation  ap. 281-295.  aThis short review focuses on the findings associated with a long-term field study on two species of sea kraits in New Caledonia. Since 2002, more than 30 sites in the lagoon have been sampled, and in most places mark-recapture was implemented. We collected detailed data on more than 14,000 marked individuals (>6000 recaptures) and used different techniques (stable isotopes, bio-logging, analyses of diet). The objective was fundamental: to examine how amphibious snakes cope with both terrestrial and aquatic environments. As access to abundant food is likely the main evolutionary driver for the return transition toward the sea in marine tetrapods, foraging ecology was an important part of the research and novel information was obtained on this subject. Rapidly however, field observations revealed the potential interest of sea kraits for conservation issues. Our results show that these snakes are useful bio-indicators of marine biodiversity; they also provide a useful signal to monitor levels of contamination by heavy metals in the lagoon, and more generally as a means of studying the functioning of reef ecosystems. Importantly, anecdotal observations (e.g., a krait drinking during rain) provided unsuspected physiological insights of general importance to fundamental problems and conservation. One of the lessons of this long-term study is that key results emerged in an unexpected way, but all were dependent on intensive field work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3abiodiversity 3adiet 3adrinking 3aecosystems 3afield experimentation 3aforaging 3aheavy metals 3aindicator species 3arain 3asnakes 3astable isotopes 3aNew Caledonia0 tIntegrative and comparative biology.g2012 Aug., v. 52, no. 2 p.281-295dOxford University Pressx1540-70637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/ics0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245014000167300001400307520141100321592002801732650001501760650001801775650001601793650001501809650001601824650002401840650000901864651001001873653001001883653001801893653001901911653002101930653001901951653003201970700001702002700001402019700001402033773011002047856008302157852000902240655001202249IND60087538320221118174824.0161023e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008753832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacchioni, N.10aGrading the decay of waterlogged archaeological wood according to anatomical characterisation. The case of the Fiavé site (N-E Italy)  ap. 54-64.  aThe grading of the anatomical preservation of cells inside waterlogged archaeological wood can be obtained by linking qualitative information obtained by microscopes with quantitative results inferred from physical characterisation. This study shows an approach to grading based on the microscopic analyses of 81 cores coming from poles of the pile-dwelling of Fiavè (IV–II millennia B.C.). Observations and physical analyses were undertaken on three different sectors of each core, taking into account their different state of preservation. In total 239 samples were analysed. The analyses identified 38 cores of larch (Larix decidua Mill.), 24 of spruce (Picea abies Karst.) and 19 of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). Based on the morphology of decay, clear signs of biological attacks were identified: soft rot cavities, pointed ended, moving along the micro-fibrillar orientation of the cell wall, and “V”-shaped notches of eroded cell wall beyond the granular aspect in cross sections of heavily degraded cells. Results of classification (5 classes) according to micromorphological observations were compared to MWC values, for validation. This way we could verify an increase of average MWC with increasing micromorphological decay class, thus proving the reliability of the grading process. However, the micromorphological grading appeared more informative about the first stages of the attack.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aLarix decidua 3aPicea abies 3acell walls 3amicroscopes 3aphysical properties 3awood 3aItaly 0aPiles 0aPile-dwelling 0aSoft rot fungi 0aErosion bacteria 0aClassification 0aMaximum Water Content (MWC)1 aCapretti, C.1 aSozzi, L.1 aPizzo, B.0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Oct., v. 84 p.54-64dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009500157300001600252500001500268520188200283592002802165650001602193650001502209650002402224650001102248650001202259650001102271650000902282650001102291651001102302653001802313700001802331700002602349700001902375773011802394856007402512852000902586655001202595IND60118023720221116221109.0141126e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011802372DNAL7 a10.1093/icb/ics0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuling,10aHabitat Selection by Sea Kraits (Laticauda spp.) at Coastal Sites of Orchid Island, Taiwan  ap. 274-280.  a2019-12-04  aThree species of amphibious sea kraits (Laticauda spp.) spend variable time at sea and require fresh water for water balance. Both the rate of cutaneous evaporative water loss and the extent of terrestriality are known to differ among them. Laticauda semifasciata has the greatest rate of water loss and the least extent of terrestriality, whereas L. colubrina exhibits the reverse and L. laticaudata is intermediate. These sea kraits tend to be more abundant at places where there are sources of fresh water, but other factors also influence their distribution. To further clarify the habitat requirements, we investigated the abundance of each species of sea krait at six different habitats and the availability of each type of habitat on Orchid Island, Taiwan. The six habitats were high coral reef without fresh water (HR) and with fresh water (HRF); low coral reef without fresh water (LR) and with fresh water (LRF); sand or gravel coast, which has no coral reef, without fresh water (NR) and with fresh water (NRF). The extent of safety judged from the relative availability of retreat sites, from high to low, was HR, LR, and NR among these habitats. More than 75% of individuals counted for each species were found in HRF. We found no sea kraits in NRF and NR. The most available habitat was LR, but no L. laticaudata or L. semifasciata were found in this habitat. We found 3.3% and 16.7% of L. colubrina in LR and HR, respectively. For L. colubrina, the second abundant habitat was HR, whereas for L. laticaudata and L. semifasciata, the second abundant habitat was LRF. We conclude that both safety (availability of retreat sites) and fresh water are important to the habitat selection of sea kraits. Compared with other species, L. colubrina is characterized by a greater extent of terrestrial habit and possibly greater variety of access to sources of fresh water.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoral reefs 3afreshwater 3ahabitat preferences 3agravel 3aislands 3acoasts 3asand 3asnakes 3aTaiwan 0awater balance1 aChen, Yi-Huei1 aLillywhite, Harvey B.1 aTu, Ming-Chung0 tIntegrative and comparative biology.g2012 Aug., v. 52, no. 2 p.274-280dOxford University Pressx1540-70637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/ics0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03697naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245013200174500001900306520193400325592002802259650001602287650001602303650001802319650001502337650001502352650001102367650001502378650001402393650001002407650000902417650002602426650001102452650001302463650002002476650001202496650001602508650001402524653002002538653001402558653003002572653002202602653001502624700001402639700001902653700001902672700001302691700001902704700001702723700001802740700002002758700001402778700002002792700001602812700001602828700001602844773010002860856009002960852000903050655001203059IND60736064520221119073050.0210608e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073606452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7368522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSissener, N.H.10aCan improved nutrition for Atlantic salmon in freshwater increase fish robustness, survival and growth after seawater transfer?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe loss of fish in the seawater (SW) phase of Atlantic salmon farming is high, and a major proportion of this loss occurs in the period just after SW transfer. In the current study, we hypothesize that improvements made to the diet during the freshwater (FW) stage affect fish growth, survival and robustness later in the SW stage. To test this, salmon parr were fed five experimental diets in FW at 12 °C. In addition to a commercial-like control diet, fish were fed a diet with changed FA composition aimed to be more like the natural feed of salmon in FW, a diet with increased concentrations of selected AA/N-compounds (methionine, lysine, threonine and taurine), a diet with increased concentrations of methionine and certain B-vitamins (folate, B₁₂ and B₆) and a final diet combining all of these potential improvements. At the time of SW transfer, the robustness of fish fed the different diets was tested by direct transfer to SW at three different temperatures (8, 12 and 16 °C, without prior acclimation), as well as transfer into open net pens, while fed on a common commercial diet. Growth and proximate composition of the fish did not differ between the diet groups. All diet groups seemed to handle transfer to SW well, and while SW transfer elicited a stress response in the fish, this was not significantly different between diet groups. Fish transferred to SW at 8 °C had higher mortality, reduced mucus layer and increased prevalence of scale loss and wounds, but this applied to all diet groups. Hence, direct transfer to SW at a lower temperature than the fish has been acclimated to cannot be recommended. At the two highest temperatures, there were some differences between the groups in the severity of cataracts. Apart from this, none of the health- or welfare related parameters measured showed any difference between the diet groups, indicating that the control diet was already sufficient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aacclimation 3aanimal growth 3afolic acid 3afreshwater 3alysine 3amethionine 3amortality 3amucus 3aparr 3aproximate composition 3asalmon 3aseawater 3astress response 3ataurine 3atemperature 3athreonine 0aAtlantic salmon 0aNutrition 0aParr smolt transformation 0aSeawater transfer 0aRobustness1 aHamre, K.1 aFjelldal, P.G.1 aPhilip, A.J.P.1 aEspe, M.1 aMiao, Lusheng,1 aHøglund, E.1 aSørensen, C.1 aSkjærven, K.H.1 aHolen, E.1 aSubramanian, S.1 aVikeså, V.1 aNorberg, B.1 aRemø, S.C.0 tAquaculture.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 542 p.736852-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7368523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245009400170500001900264520145300283592002801736650000801764650001601772650002401788650001901812650001301831650001601844650002601860650001601886650001901902650001401921650001301935650000901948650001001957650001501967650001501982650001201997650001102009650001402020650001402034650002202048650001702070650001702087650001402104650001402118651001002132651001902142653002902161653001802190653001602208700001502224700001602239700001902255700001702274700001402291700001702305700001402322700001502336773010002351856009002451852000902541655001202550IND60736064720221119073352.0210608e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073606472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7368542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Liting12aA novel vibriophage vB_VhaS_PcB-1G capable of inhibiting virulent Vibrio harveyi pathogen  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVibrio harveyi is a common aquaculture pathogen causing diseases in a variety of aquatic animals. The extensive use of antibiotics for managing V. harveyi has led to the ban of import of fish in many countries due to the presence of antibiotic residues and the concern of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This study aimed to investigate the phenotypic characterization and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 54 V. harveyi collected from Larimichthys crocea in China. All isolates were resistant to colistin sulfate, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and amoxicillin. More than 92.6% were resistant to ceftiofur, streptomycin, and amikacin. The frequency of the virulence gene toxR reached up to 75.9%, while 63% strains carried at least four virulence genes. A novel V. harveyi–specific phage vB_VhaS_PcB-1G was isolated from Larimichthys crocea in the East China Sea. The sequence analysis revealed that the phage vB_VhaS_PcB-1G genome was 48,719 bp of double-stranded DNA with 80 open reading frames. The phage vB_VhaS_PcB-1G exhibited large burst sizes (210 PFU/cell) and a broad host range against V. harveyi (33/54). With the zebrafish model, vB_VhaS_PcB-1G could effectively prevent (93.33%) and control (86.67%) V. harveyi infection. Phage efficacy indicated its potential use as an antibacterial agent to control virulent V. harveyi infection in Larimichthys crocea and vibriosis in aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDanio rerio 3aLarimichthys crocea 3aVibrio harveyi 3aamikacin 3aamoxicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaquaculture 3abacteriophages 3aceftiofur 3acolistin 3afish 3agenes 3agentamicin 3ahost range 3aimports 3amodels 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3asequence analysis 3astreptomycin 3atetracycline 3avibriosis 3avirulence 3aChina 3aEast China Sea 0aAntimicrobial resistance 0aPhage therapy 0aVibriophage1 aTian, Yuan1 aPang, Maoda1 aYang, Zhenquan1 aBao, Hongduo1 aZhou, Yan1 aSun, Lichang1 aWang, Ran1 aZhang, Hui0 tAquaculture.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 542 p.736854-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7368543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010000172300001500272520112900287592002801416650002101444650001901465650001201484650001501496650001501511650001701526650001701543650002001560650003301580650001701613650001601630653000901646653001601655653001901671653001201690653001901702700002001721700003101741773011101772856008301883852000901966655001201975IND60087539020221118174739.0161023e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008753902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2012.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichert, Agnieszka14aThe influence of modified polyhexamethylene guanidine PHMG on the biodegradation of polylactide  ap. 97-103.  aThe present study involved the addition of several potentially biocidal PHMG derivatives into polylactide (PLA) for the subsequent assessment of the changes in physical properties and properties important for the practical application of the prepared composites. In addition, biofilm formation on the surface of the PLA composites as well as their biodegradability were also evaluated. As can be seen from the results the addition of PHMG derivatives whose content did not exceed 0.6% in the polylactide matrix did not considerably affect the durability of the new composites, whereas water vapour permeability was significantly altered even with the content of 0.4% of PHMG derivatives in the polylactide matrix. Introducing PHMG stearate and PHMG granular polyethylene wax into PLA significantly decreased its biodegradability whereas introducing PHMG salt of sulfanilic acid had a positive effect on this process. The analysis of the surface of the PLA composites with the use of SEM method reveals that the introduction of PHMG stearate as well as PHMG granular polyethylene wax into PLA inhibited the biofilm formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3adurability 3aguanidines 3apermeability 3apolyethylene 3apolylactic acid 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astearic acid 3awater vapor 0aPHMG 0aPolylactide 0aBiodegradation 0aBiofilm 0aOxiTop Control1 aWalczak, Maciej1 aBrzezinska, Maria Swiontek0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Oct., v. 84 p.97-103dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2012.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012200165300001800287500001100305520159300316592002801909596003401937650001401971650001401985650001901999650002202018650000902040650002402049650001402073650002002087650001802107650001402125650002402139650001402163650000902177650001702186650001002203700002102213700001802234773013602252856008202388852000902470655001202479IND60709014620221119134310.0200902e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070901462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-020-00961-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Mohar10aBuckwheat (Fagopyrum sp.) genetic resources: What can they contribute towards nutritional security of changing world?  ap. 1639-1658.  aReview  aThe global population depends on fairly a small number of crops including wheat, rice and maize for food and nutrition, leaving a wealth of genetic resources neglected. Owing to ever increasing demands of the growing world, food production must be increased but research evidences suggests that climate change has adversely affected crop yields, thereby impacting whole agriculture. Exploring the potential reservoir of underutilized crops would provide a highly diversified agricultural production system in sustaining food and nutritional security under climate change. Buckwheat (Fagopyrum sp.) is one such crop representing a broad gene pool harboring diverse genetic resources for future agriculture due to their suitability to marginalized environments. Research advancements suggest that buckwheat has immense potential of commercialization due to presence of essential nutrients and therapeutics. With a balance of bioactive components and nutraceuticals, it has the ability to withstand various environmental stresses to make it a suitable candidate crop for future nutritional security initiatives. Despite such potential, efforts pertaining to genetic improvement, including breeding and molecular techniques are not exemplary. In this review, we present a comprehensive coverage of buckwheat germplasm research done till date along with a tangible perspective of integrating breeding and omics-driven approaches to accelerate higher genetic gains. The implementation of this strategy could enhance the nutritional benefits and adaptation to changing climates for future needs.  aPublisher supplied data  aPDF/2018/001159cSERB-DST-GOI 3aFagopyrum 3abuckwheat 3aclimate change 3acommercialization 3acorn 3adietary supplements 3aevolution 3afood production 3afood security 3agene pool 3agenetic improvement 3agermplasm 3arice 3atherapeutics 3awheat1 aMalhotra, Nikhil1 aSharma, Kriti0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2020 Oct., v. 67, no. 7 p.1639-1658dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49569x0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-020-00961-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245014400176300001600320520148300336592002801819650002501847650001601872650002501888650001901913650001601932650001301948650001801961650001101979650003701990650001202027650001002039650001502049650002202064650000902086650002302095650002002118650001302138650001202151650003302163650001702196650001102213650001302224650002502237651001002262653001802272653002502290653002102315653001102336653001902347653000702366653000802373653000802381653000802389653000702397653000802404653000802412653000802420653000902428700002402437700002602461773011202487856008302599852000902682655001202691IND60087539120221118174713.0161023e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008753912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2012.05.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Shatarupa10aBiochemical characterization of a lead-tolerant strain of Aspergillus foetidus: An implication of bioremediation of lead from liquid media  ap. 134-142.  aThe fungus Aspergillus foetidus isolated from wastewater treatment center, Kalyani was identified primarily as a lead (Pb+2) tolerant strain by supplementation experiments with high concentrations of Pb and confirmed the fungal strain as, A. foetidus MTCC 8876 after identification from the Microbial Type Culture Collection and Gene Bank (MTCC), Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), Chandigarh, India. Growth studies in liquid Czapek-Dox (CD) media with different Pb treatments showed an initial growth increase up to 200 mg L−1 Pb treatment followed by gradual decrease at higher Pb doses. Protein and thiol leakage during growth experiments in CD broth containing Pb+2 may be due to disturbance in membrane structure as was further evident from lipid peroxidation induced by Pb. The strain was efficient in removing Pb from the liquid growth medium by mycelial biosorption. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) analysis confirmed the presence of tightly bound Pb as insoluble crystals outside fungal mycelia. Intracellular proline level and activities of the antioxidative enzymes increased up to a certain level to detoxify malondialdehyde and H2O2 produced by Pb toxicity. These data indicate that the test strain has some inherent mechanisms to tolerate unusually high Pb doses and high Pb uptake potential, pre-requisite for acting as a suitable candidate for Pb bioremediation from contaminated aqua-environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus foetidus 3aX-radiation 3aantioxidant activity 3abioremediation 3abiosorption 3acrystals 3aculture media 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aenzymes 3afungi 3agene banks 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alead 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amycelium 3aproline 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectroscopy 3athiols 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment 3aIndia 0aLead tolerant 0aAspergillus foetidus 0aOxidative stress 0aThiols 0aBioremediation 0aCD 0aCAT 0aGPX 0aSPX 0aGR 0aLPO 0aACP 0aALP 0aDTNB1 aMukherjee, Abhishek1 aDāsa, Tapanakumāra,0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Oct., v. 84 p.134-142dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2012.05.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245006200169300001800231500001100249520153400260592002801794650001401822650001301836650001401849650001901863650001301882650000901895650001601904650001401920650001801934650001101952650002001963651001001983700002001993700001902013700001702032773013602049856008202185852000902267655001202276IND60709014820221119134412.0200902e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070901482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-020-00986-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSreekumar, V.

This paper reviews the ethnobotanical knowledge on wild edible fruits traditionally used by the tribal and rural peoples of the Western Ghats, India. There are 237 wild fruiting plants belonging to 136 genera, comes under 65 families used by tribal community for edible purpose, which includes 37 endemic and 11 red listed plants. Among 237 species majority were trees (107), followed by shrubs (75), climbers (42) and herbs (13). The highest numbers of species in the families are Malvaceae, Myrtaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Moraceae, Rutaceae etc. The wild edible plants are integral part of food sources of the tribals and rural peoples and are considered as the oldest food stuff of peoples and provide primary dietary constituents of their daily life. Moreover, it plays a vital role in combating food security also. Most of the wild edible plants have additional usages, some of them have medicinal properties while some others having anti-nutritional factors and are poisonous too. The uses of wild edibles are now mainly confined to tribal or allied community. Scientific research on suitable species is suggested to identify the competent species to replace/improve/substitute the common cultivated species in chemical constitutent, nutritional value and also to explore the possibilities of wild edible plants to provide food security for the growing population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalvaceae 3aMoraceae 3aMyrtaceae 3aPhyllanthaceae 3aRutaceae 3adiet 3aethnobotany 3aevolution 3afood security 3ahumans 3anutritive value 3aIndia1 aSreejith, K.

The purpose of this study is to discover the enrichment characteristics of cadmium (Cd) in soil of Gongga Mt. and probe into its provenance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three soil profiles were hand-dug and totally 114 soil samples were collected from different altitude and vegetation zone. Meanwhile seven samples of glacial debris at the foreland of Hailuogou glacier were collected to be used to determine the background of Cd. Cd and other element contents in soil samples were measured using ICP-AES and ICP-MS after acid digested. Enrichment factor (EF) together with the Cd content in precipitation samples were used to determine the source of Cd. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Four soil units were divided according to the primary aspect in the field. In the surface A0 soil horizon, the Cd content varied between 0.2 and 7.86Â mg/kg while in A soil horizon, it was between 0.11 and 5.61Â mg/kg. The background value of Cd in Gongga Mt. was estimated at 0.22Â mg/kg according to the Cd content in the deeper layer of soil profiles and glacial debris at the foreland of Hailuogou glacier. The EF of Cd was hence calculated to determine the state of Cd enrichment and its provenance. The Cd content in precipitation, relationship between Cd content and soil grain-size component, relationship between Cd content and soil organic carbon content, together with Cd EF indicated that the atmospheric deposition is the major source of soil Cd. CONCLUSIONS: As EF revealed, the Cd contamination in the surface soil of Gongga Mt. area has reached a serious level, especially in the coniferous zone. The atmospheric deposition is the major source of soil Cd.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric deposition 3acadmium 3aglacial soils 3aglaciers 3aheavy metals 3amountains 3aplateaus 3aprovenance 3asoil horizons 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pollution 3asoil profiles 3asoil sampling 3avegetation 3aChina1 aBin, Haijian1 aZhou, Jun1 aLuo, Ji1 aYu, Dong1 aSun, Shouqin1 aLi, Wei0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2011 Sept., v. 11, no. 6 p.940-946dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-011-0387-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005900138245012300197300001600320500002000336520165100356592002802007596002502035650001302060650001002073650001302083650002102096650001302117650000902130650001102139650001902150650001702169650002402186650001902210650001702229650002302246650002802269650001502297651001302312700005502325700005602380700001902436700006802455700002202523700001602545700002002561700005802581773013402639856007302773852000902846655001202855IND60767434220221120165943.0220216e20220228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076743422DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.41442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssaye, Habtamu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2252-898410aEvent‐based run‐off and sediment yield dynamics and controls in the subhumid headwaters of the Blue Nile, Ethiopia  ap. 565-580.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLand degradation due to soil erosion presents a major challenge for sustainable development. We investigated run‐off and sediment yield (SY) dynamics in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. The study area included 14 zero‐order catchments with a surface area ranging from 324 to 1715 m². V‐notch weirs produced from plastic jars were introduced as measuring alternatives that met local constraints. Run‐off (RO) depth at the weir was registered manually at 5‐min intervals during two rainy seasons in 2018 and 2019, and a total of 618 events were monitored. Rainfall was measured using tipping‐bucket rain gauges. RO samples were collected in 1‐L bottles, and suspended sediment concentration was determined. The mean event RO coefficient ranged from 3% for forests to 56% for badlands. Similarly, the mean annual SY was lowest for forests (0.8 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) and highest for badlands (43.4 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹), with significant differences among land‐use types (14.8 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in cropland, 5.7 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in grazing land, and 2.9 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in plantations). Soil organic matter (SOM) reduced RO and SY, necessitating the consideration of agronomic and land management practices that enhance SOM. Annual SY decreased exponentially with the rock fragment cover (RFC). In fields where RFC was less than 20%, collecting rock fragments for installing stone bunds resulted in a net increase in SY. Rehabilitating badlands and enhancing SOM content in croplands can substantially reduce catchment SY and hence contribute to the sustainability of land uses in the subhumid highlands.  aPublisher supplied data  cBahir Dar University 3abadlands 3abunds 3acropland 3aland degradation 3aland use 3arain 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asoil erosion 3asoil organic matter 3asubhumid zones 3asurface area 3asuspended sediment 3asustainable development 3awatersheds 3aEthiopia1 aNyssen, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2666-38601 aPoesen, Jean1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6218-89671 aLemma, Hanibal1 aMeshesha, Derege Tsegaye1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6465-07721 aWassie, Alemayehu1 aAdgo, Enyew1 aFentie, Deribew1 aFrankl, Amaury1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1685-27800 tLand degradation & development.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 33, no. 4 p.565-580dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.41443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009700168300001200265520134900277592002801626650001701654650001201671650001601683650001601699650000901715650002601724650001901750650001201769650001201781650001701793650001001810650001301820650002601833650001101859650001401870650001901884650001301903650001101916650001501927650003301942650001101975651001301986653002101999653002602020653002302046653001302069653001302082653002102095700001602116700001802132700002302150700002502173773010802198856008302306852000902389655001202398IND60087539520221118174817.0161023e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008753952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosado, Tânia10aOxalate biofilm formation in mural paintings due to microorganisms – A comprehensive study  ap. 1-7.  aOxalate film formation is a pathology that often occurs in mural paintings and may result from the concomitant action of microorganisms and environmental conditions.Low Choir of the Convent of Nossa Senhora da Saudação (Portugal) has mural paintings with an extraordinary beauty, which over time have been suffered polychromy degradation and biofilm formation, presenting an ideal case study to investigate the role and impact of microorganisms in the biodeterioration process.Bacterial populations, filamentous fungi belonging to the genera Cladosporium, Penicillium, Nectria and yeast strain of the genera Rhodotorula were isolated from these wall paintings. The penetration of fungal hyphae in the microstructure of mortars, observed by scanning electron microscopy, seems to be responsible for cracking and detachments in some areas of the painting. The study revealed that the veils on the surface of the paintings are essentially oxalates and that these biofilms are caused by metabolic activity of bacterial communities. Furthermore, the colour alteration of green areas due to microorganisms was detected by Raman microscopy, in real samples and under in vitro conditions, being the result of the metabolic activity of microorganisms present on the paintings, which promote calcium oxalates formation over the malachite paint layers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladosporium 3aNectria 3aPenicillium 3aRhodotorula 3aarts 3abacterial communities 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3acalcium 3acase studies 3acolor 3acracking 3aenvironmental factors 3ahyphae 3amalachite 3amicrostructure 3aoxalates 3apaints 3apopulation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ayeasts 3aPortugal 0aBiodeterioration 0aMicrobial communities 0aMetabolic activity 0aBiofilms 0aOxalates 0aRaman microscopy1 aGil, Milene1 aMirão, José1 aCandeias, António1 aCaldeira, Ana Teresa0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Nov., v. 85 p.1-7dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011700172300001800289520154400307592002801851596021901879650001902098650001502117650001402132650001302146650001402159650001502173650002602188650002202214650001002236650001402246651002802260651001202288700001802300700003402318700002702352700001902379700002702398773013602425856008202561852000902643655001202652IND60709015120221119135000.0200902e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070901512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-020-00937-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKocsisné, Gitta M.10aGenetic diversity and similarity of pear (Pyrus communis L.) cultivars in Central Europe revealed by SSR markers  ap. 1755-1763.  aThe Hungarian pear gene bank, located and founded in Keszthely in 1981, contains 210 pear cultivars including regional cultivars, cultivars of foreign origin and standard commercial cultivars. There are some cultivars with synonym names in the pear gene bank and in other pear growing areas within the Hungary. The aim of our work was to systematically analyse the genotypes of Hungarian cultivars in the pear gene bank and to set up a robust protocol for molecular identification and the interpretation of data. Eighty-eight cultivars were analysed employing eight SSR primers resulting in a total of 216 alleles. Seventy-seven cultivars were thoroughly analysed. Among the samples 29 were considered to be diploids and 59 triploids. A genetic diversity analysis was computed based on a Neighbour-Joining algorithm and combined with a PCA indicating close genetic relationship and an overall high amount of genetic diversity among the samples tested. Similarities and very close relations were verified in our studies between different pear cultivar variants: 'Korai szagos' A and B, which were planted with the same name in the gene bank. Six different 'Császár körte' and three 'Köcsög körte' cultivars were compared. It was important to establish how close their relationship was. Some cultivars originating from the same regions were compared. The 'Mezőkövesdi 2′ and '3′ are in the same main branch, however their distance is larger, the number of common alleles is less than those of the two 'Erdélyi körte' cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data  aGINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00054cthe Hungarian Government and the European Union, with the co-funding of the European Regional Development Fund in the frame of Széchenyi 2020 Programme GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00054 project. 3aPyrus communis 3aalgorithms 3acultivars 3adiploidy 3aevolution 3agene banks 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3apears 3atriploidy 3aCentral European region 3aHungary1 aBolla, Dávid1 aAnhalt-Brüderl, Ulrike C.

It is necessary to know the behaviour of wood species under different environmental conditions and their durability class before the timber or timber product is put into use. The degree of wood deterioration is dependent on conditions such as soil, rainfall, altitude, temperature, and other environmental conditions under which the timber is put to use. Natural durability refers to the ability of wood species to resist attack by different agents, especially biological ones. This paper describes the natural resistance of important imported timber species of India against termites in different agro-eco zones. Field experiments were carried out at six locations falling under five Indian agro-eco zones with the aim of evaluating the natural resistance of 20 species of imported woods. Wood stakes measuring 30.5 × 3.8 × 3.8 cm as per IS:401-1982 standards were implanted in the soil and observed for a period of 4 yr, and visual damage assessment was done. The termites active in the test yard and on the test stakes were collected, preserved in 70% ethanol, and identified using taxonomic keys. Results revealed significant variation in rate of degradation of wood species with climatic zones producing significant variation as well. The tested timbers were categorized into three groups: susceptible, resistant, and moderately resistant. Termites collected belonged to nine species under four genera and the single family Termitidae. Odontotermes obesus was the dominant species in most of the locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdontotermes obesus 3aaltitude 3aclimatic zones 3adecayed wood 3adurability 3aethanol 3afield experimentation 3anew variety 3arain 3asoil 3ataxonomic keys 3atemperature 3aIndia 0aNatural resistance 0aTermites 0aTropical and temperate timbers 0aAgro-eco zones 0aTermitidae 0aOdontotermes obesus1 aSundararaj, R.0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Nov., v. 85 p.16-22dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100001700153245007000170300001600240520146100256592002801717650002001745650001101765650002101776650001501797650002401812650002201836650001001858650001701868650001601885650001601901650001301917650001601930650001401946650002601960650002801986650002402014650002302038650001002061650001702071773010302088856008902191852000902280655001202289IND4479293120221118023309.0150812e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447929312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2012.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNotter, D.R.10aGenetic improvement of reproductive efficiency of sheep and goats  ap. 147-151.  aSheep and goats are produced in a wide range of production systems and climatic conditions and possess great genetic diversity in reproductive potentials. Mean litter sizes range from near 1 to 3 or more, and patterns of seasonal reproduction are often strongly synchronised to local conditions. Thus, optimisation, rather than maximisation, of reproductive potentials is required, and optimum reproductive rates are often well below those which could be achieved. However, changing employment patterns, increasing urbanisation, and emergence of new markets provide corresponding opportunities for sustainable intensification of small ruminant production, potentially requiring enhancements in reproductive potentials. Heritabilities for most reproductive traits are less than those for many other traits, usually ranging from 0.05 to 0.15, and opportunities for within-breed selection are therefore limited. Substantial changes in litter size or major changes in seasonal breeding patterns are thus best achieved by crossing of divergent breeds to rapidly reset genetic potentials for these traits, followed by within-breed selection to optimise reproductive potentials. Various mutations influencing ovulation rate and litter size in sheep provide additional opportunities to rapidly adjust genetic potentials, but require careful breeding management. Comparable major genes have not yet been found in goats or for traits associated with breeding season.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding season 3abreeds 3aclimatic factors 3aemployment 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agoats 3aheritability 3alitter size 3amajor genes 3amutation 3anew markets 3aovulation 3aproduction technology 3areproductive efficiency 3areproductive traits 3aseasonal variation 3asheep 3aurbanization0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2012 Feb., v. 130, no. 3-4 p.147-151dElsevier B.V.x0378-43207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2012.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245008700168300001500255520144800270592002801718650001801746650001601764650001901780650001301799650001001812650002601822650001601848650001901864650000701883650001801890650002901908650001601937650002501953653001601978653002701994653003302021700001602054700001502070700001802085700001502103700001702118700001302135700002002148773011102168856008302279852000902362655001202371IND60087539720221118174814.0161023e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008753972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Hongxing10aBiodegradation of acetamiprid by Pigmentiphaga sp.

In this study, we aimed to isolate high-efficient acetamiprid-degrading strains and to investigate the biodegradation pathway of acetamiprid in such microorganisms. An acetamiprid-degrading strain D-2 was isolated from a wastewater-treatment pool in an acetamiprid-manufacturing factory. Strain D-2 was identified as Pigmentiphaga sp. based on its morphological, physiological, and biochemical properties, as well as 16S rRNA gene analysis. Strain D-2 was shown to be highly effective in biodegrading of acetamiprid, degrading 0.22 mM acetamiprid to a non-detectable level within 72 h in a liquid culture. This bacterial strain efficiently degraded acetamiprid at temperatures ranging from 30 °C to 45 °C and pH values ranging from 5 to 10. During the degradation of acetamiprid, three metabolites 1-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)-N-methylmethanamine, N′-[(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)methyl]-N-methylacetamide, and N′-cyano-N-methyl-N-(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)ethanimidamide were detected and identified based on tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.

Infestation of commercial blueberries by the blueberry maggot, R. mendax, is a serious problem in many areas where blueberries are grown. In the past 10––20 yr, commercial highbush blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum L., production has expanded into places such as southern Ontario and southern Quebec where blueberry maggot had not previously been reported. In the mid-1990s, isolated infestations of commercial highbush blueberry were reported in southern Ontario. Because R. mendax was not considered endemic to that area, it was widely assumed that the pests had come into the fields via movement from exotic localities. Here we present an alternative hypothesis, that the blueberry maggots infesting newly established highbush plantations are derived from native blueberries growing in the vicinity. To test this hypothesis, in 1997––1999, we sampled potential native hosts for R. mendax (Vaccinium spp. and Gaylussacia spp.) from 31 localities in the Great Lakes region, primarily in Michigan and Ontario. R. mendax was reared from fruits of native hosts collected at four sites in Michigan and one site each in Ontario, Indiana, and Ohio. V. corymbosum was the predominant host infested, with infestation of this host observed at five of the seven sites. However, two huckleberry species [[Gaylussacia baccata (Wangenheim) K. Koch, and Gaylussacia dumosa (Andersson) Torrey & Gray]] had the highest rates of infestation that we observed (25.4 and 17.6%, respectively). These data represent the first published reports of R. mendax infesting native host plants in the Great Lakes region, and support the hypothesis that infestations observed in commercial fields may have originated from infested native host plants.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRhagoletis mendax 0ablueberry maggot 0aVaccinium spp. 0aGaylussacia spp. 0ageographic distribution 0ahost plants1 aGavrilovic, Vesna1 aSmitley, David R.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2001 Dec., v. 94, no. 6 p.1378-1385dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0022-0493-94.6.13783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245010800165500001400273520142400287592002801711650001601739650001101755650001601766650001501782650001501797650001801812650001001830650001901840650001101859700001901870700002001889773012001909856007902029852000902108655001202117IND60729312720221120032023.0210228e20210208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072931272DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120201472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen-Zvi, Gilad 10aAnt Guild Identity Determines Seed Fate at the Post-Removal Seed Dispersal Stages of a Desert Perennial  aNAL-light  aAnts play a dual role in their interaction with plant seeds. In deserts, the consumption of seeds by granivorous ants is common, whereas mutualistic seed dispersal, often associated with scavenging ants, is rarely documented. We evaluated the contribution of both ant guilds to efficient seed dispersal of an ant-dispersed plant, Sternbergia clusiana, in a desert ecosystem. We presented seed to colonies of three species of desert ants from the Cataglyphis (scavengers) and Messor (granivorous) genera. We recorded seed consumption, ejection from the nest, and seed transportation to potentially beneficial microhabitats. We evaluated microhabitat quality by testing the association between habitat types and the plant at various life stages. As expected, granivores mainly consumed the seeds, whereas scavengers consumed the elaiosome (seed appendage serving as a reward), but left the seeds intact. Moreover, scavenging ants relocated the seeds much further than granivores, mainly to shrub patches. The disproportional distribution of the plant under shrubs at several life stages suggests that this microhabitat is beneficial for the plant. Overall, while granivores seem to mainly harm seed dispersal, we provide the first evidence for the beneficial contribution of scavenging ants in deserts, showing they exhibit the same suite of characteristics that render them efficient seed dispersers in other ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCataglyphis 3aMessor 3aSternbergia 3aecosystems 3agranivores 3amicrohabitats 3anests 3aseed dispersal 3ashrubs1 aSeifan, Merav 1 aGiladi, Itamar 0 tInsects.g2021 Feb. 08, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120201473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007100157300001800228520112200246592002801368650001601396650002101412650001801433650002101451650001601472650001601488650001001504650002001514650000901534650001401543650001201557650001501569650001801584650001201602650002101614650001201635700001901647700001501666700001801681700001601699773009801715856007301813852000901886655001201895IND60135881220221120154827.0150522e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013588122DNAL7 a10.1111/are.122692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuerol, Pablo10aGrowth and feed efficiency of Octopus vulgaris fed on dry pelleted  ap. 1132-1138.  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of two dry extruded diets on growth and nutritional composition of digestive gland (DG) and muscle of Octopus vulgaris. Both artificial diets (FMK and 3FMK) were composed of gelatin, maltodextrin, yolk, fish and krill meal. The 3FMK diet contained more fishmeal (3×) than the FMK diet. These diets were compared with a control frozen diet consisting of golden grey mullet (Liza aurata) and crab (Liocarcinus depurator). The 3FMK diet promoted higher intakes and feed efficiency than FMK diet, resulting in larger growths (296 respect to 158 g in 42 days; 0.81% vs. 0.78% body weight/day). There was significantly lower moisture, protein and ash content in digestive glands of animals fed pellets (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed on nutritional composition of muscle among the three groups. Even though the results were still below those of the control group (increase of 1258 g), the good performance in terms of acceptance and growth showed that this extruded diet can be the starting point to develop a commercial feed for this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLiza aurata 3aOctopus vulgaris 3aanimal glands 3aartificial diets 3aash content 3abody weight 3acrabs 3afeed conversion 3afish 3afish meal 3agelatin 3akrill meal 3amaltodextrins 3amuscles 3anutrient content 3apellets1 aGairin, Ignasi1 aGuerao, G.1 aJover, Miguel1 aTomás, Ana0 tAquaculture research.g2015 May, v. 46, no. 5 p.1132-1138dBlackwell Sciencex1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.122693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245012400165520161600289592002801905650001601933650002301949650001301972650001501985650002002000650003202020650002802052650001402080650001302094650001802107650001302125650001302138650001902151650001502170650001402185650001302199650001102212651001702223700001502240700001802255773012202273856008102395852000902476655001202485IND60783928020221120043959.0220726e20220708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078392802DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120716422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Daqing 10aResponse of Nitrifier and Denitrifier Abundance to Salinity Gradients in Agricultural Soils at the Yellow River Estuary  aSalinization is considered a threat to agricultural soil and decreases crop yield worldwide. Nitrification and denitrification are the core processes of soil N-cycle. However, the response of nitrifiers and denitrifiers to salinity in agricultural soils remains ambiguous. The study aimed to explore the effect of salinity on nitrifiers and denitrifiers communities in agricultural soils along a naturally occurring salinity gradient. The effects of salinity on the abundance, composition, and interactions of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in surface soils were investigated. The abundance of nitrifiers significantly decreased in response to the increase in salinity. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were more susceptible to salinity elevation than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Nitrospira and Nitrobacter showed a similar trend to the salinity gradient, but the relative abundance of Nitrobacter was increased in the saline soils. High salinity decreased the abundance of napA and nirK, but had no significant effect on other marker genes for denitrification. Besides electrical conductivity, total sulfur (TS)+available potassium (AK) and TN+TS+C/N+total phosphorus (TP)+AK significantly explained the variation in denitrifier and nitrifier communities. We also found that high salinity decreased the connections between different N functional genes. These results implied the alteration of the nitrogen cycling community by high salinity mainly through decreasing AOA, NOB, and some denitrifiers with nitrate or nitrite reduction potentials and weakening the connectivity between nitrogen cycling drivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitrobacter 3aagricultural soils 3aagronomy 3acrop yield 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aelectrical conductivity 3aestuaries 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asalinity 3asulfur 3aYellow River1 aLi, Xiang 1 aLuo, Xuesong 0 tAgronomy.g2022 July 08, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120716423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
