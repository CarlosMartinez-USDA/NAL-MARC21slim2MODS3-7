Johan10aPervasive reactive melt migration through fast-spreading lower oceanic crust (Hess Deep, equatorial Pacific Ocean)  ap. 436-447.  aMid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) is the most abundant magma on Earth, and provides a geochemical window into the mantle. Deriving mantle composition and melting processes from the erupted lavas requires correction to be made for their evolution as they pass through and generate the oceanic crust. This is typically done by assuming that modification of melts in crustal magma chambers occurs exclusively by fractional crystallisation. However, extensive mineral major- and trace element data from a full section of fast-spread lower crustal rocks exposed in Hess Deep (equatorial Pacific Ocean) demonstrate that their evolution is instead controlled by reactive porous flow. These reactions lead to a strong enrichment in, and fractionation of, incompatible trace elements in the melt (as recorded by clinopyroxene compositions), leading to melt compositions far outside of the compositional realm of MORB both in terms of trace element abundances and ratios. The reactive signature increases in strength up section, peaking in varitextured gabbros interpreted to represent the fossilised axial melt lens, indicating that reactive porous flow occurred on the scale of the entire lower crust. The enrichment of the melt is coupled with a strong trace element depletion of plagioclase, olivine, and, to a lesser extent, clinopyroxene cores, suggesting that these phases represent the residues of the reactions from which trace elements have been removed. The dominant role of reactive porous flow, and the resulting deviations from fractional crystallisation predictions, suggest that the lower oceanic crust plays a much more complex and significant role in modifying the compositions of MORB than previously expected, with consequent implications for models of mantle processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3acrystallization 3afractionation 3alava 3amelting 3amodels 3aplagioclase 3aprediction 3atrace elements 3aPacific Ocean1 aMacLeod, Christopher J.1 aHoward, Kerry A.1 aGodard, Marguerite0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 361 p.436-447dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.11.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007700168300001400245520108800259592002801347650002201375650001201397650001001409650001601419650003801435700001801473700002001491700001701511700001801528700002001546773010201566856008201668990002301750852000901773655001201782IND60095239120221117230708.0141104e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009523912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2012.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishi, Masayuki10aSlow Si–Al interdiffusion in garnet and stagnation of subducting slabs  ap. 44-49.  aSi⁴⁺+M²⁺↔2Al³⁺ (M=Mg+Fe+Ca) interdiffusion rates in majoritic garnet have been determined at pressure of 17GPa and temperatures of 1550–1700°C using a Kawai-type high-pressure apparatus. The diffusion profiles were measured across the interface between pyropic garnet and majoritic garnet samples by an analytical transmission electron microscope, and the rate of the Si⁴⁺+M²⁺↔2Al³⁺ interdiffusion was determined to be a DSᵢ–Aₗ (m²s⁻¹)=2×10⁻¹⁰exp [−364 (kJmol⁻¹)/RT]. We found that the diffusion rate is low compared to the Si diffusion rate in other silicate minerals relevant to the deep mantle. Slow kinetics of the pyroxene–garnet transformation due to the low diffusion rate indicates that large low-density metastable regions may exist in the slab, greatly contributing to the slab stagnation around the transition region. Stagnant slabs possibly stay in this region over 10⁸yr because of the sluggish pyroxene–garnet transformation, but may eventually fall into the lower mantle after the completion of the transformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3asilicate minerals 3asilicon 3aslabs 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aKubo, Tomoaki1 aOhfuji, Hiroaki1 aKato, Takumi1 aNishihara, Yu1 aIrifune, Tetsuo0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 361 p.44-49dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.11.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01805naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245014300170300001400313500001400327520062500341592002800966650001400994650002201008650000901030650001601039650001601055650001501071651001001086653001301096653001401109653001601123653001301139653001301152700001701165700001301182700001701195773009301212856008101305852000901386655001201395IND60698929520221122080856.0210116e20160607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069892952DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.596.59452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPujade-Villar, Juli10aRevision on Palaearctic species of Periclistus Förster with description of a new species and its host plant gall (Hymenoptera, Cynipidae)  ap. 65-75.  aNAL-light  aPalaearctic species of Periclistus Förster has been systematically described, but a new inquiline gall-wasp, Periclistus qinghainensis sp. n., is described from China.

We assess the consequences of achieving this target in 2100 for the impacts that are avoided, using several indicators of impact (exposure to drought, river flooding, heat waves and demands for heating and cooling energy). The proportion of impacts that are avoided is not simply equal to the proportional reduction in temperature. At the global scale, the median proportion of projected impacts avoided by the 1.5 °C target relative to a rise of 4 °C ranges between 62 and 95% across sectors: the greatest reduction is for heat wave impacts. The 1.5 °C target results in impacts that would be between 27 and 62% lower than with the 2 °C target. For each indicator, there are differences in the proportions of impacts avoided between regions depending on exposure and the regional changes in climate (particularly precipitation). Uncertainty in the proportion of impacts that are avoided for a specific sector depends on the range in the shape of the relationship between global temperature change and impact, and this varies between sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aenergy 3aheat 3arivers 3auncertainty1 aLowe, JasonA.1 aLloyd-Hughes, Ben1 aOsborn, TimothyJ.0 tClimatic change.g2018 Mar., v. 147, no. 1-2 p.61-76dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-2115-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010500165300001400270520122000284592002801504650001901532650002401551650002201575650002001597650001901617650001901636650001901655650001301674650001501687650001401702653002501716653002801741700001601769700001801785700005801803700001801861700001901879700001501898700001601913700005501929700001501984773010001999856008302099852000902182655001202191IND60751796920221118144625.0220328e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075179692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Junhui10aSingle-Atom Fe-N4 sites promote the triplet-energy transfer process of g-C3N4 for the photooxidation  ap. 89-95.  aPolymeric carbon nitride materials show intriguing prospects in numerous light-to-energy conversion applications, but seldom studies focus on their triplet energy transfer, leading to the insufficient lifetime for the photochemical process. Inspired by the porphyrin molecular photocatalyst, single-atom sites (Fe-N₄) as triplet sensitizing sites were fabricated in g-C₃N₄ for the preparation of Fe-g-C₃N₄, which processes a long-lived triplet emissive state (τPH = 4.93 μs). But under realistic condition for the large-scale production of catalyst, single atoms are inevitable to sinter, resulting in the formation of other metal species. Therefore, the photooxidation of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene (1,5-DHN) and the photocatalytic E-Z Isomerization of stilbene were selected as the model reactions to evaluate the influence of various Fe species on the triplet energy transfer. It was found that Fe-N₄ sites promote the triplet energy transfer process, while Fe nanoclusters (Fe⁰) promote the electron transfer and inhibit triplet energy transfer. This finding provides guidance for the rational design of photocatalysts to efficiently improve triplet energy transfer process and its application.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nitride 3acis-trans isomerism 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy transfer 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotooxidation 3apolymers 3aporphyrins 3astilbenes 0aSingle-atom catalyst 0aTriplet energy transfer1 aYin, Shimin1 aZhang, Qinhua1 aCao, Fengliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1032-82081 aXing, Yicheng1 aZhao, Qingshan1 aWang, Yang1 aXu, Wengang1 aWu, Wenting1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8380-79041 aWu, Mingbo0 tJournal of catalysis.g2021 Dec., v. 404 p.89-95dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245015700164300001500321500001400336520136200350592002801712650001501740650001001755650002701765650001501792650001901807650001601826650001601842650001901858653001701877653002301894653002501917653001801942700002201960700001901982773009402001856008102095852000902176655001202185IND60698929720221122061049.0210116e20160608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069892972DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.596.87252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Hee-Wook10aRevision of the Gonioctena nivosa species-group (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae, Chrysomelinae) in the Holarctic region, with descriptions of two new species  ap. 87-128.  aNAL-light  aThe Gonioctena nivosa species-group of the genus Gonioctena Chevrolat, 1836 is defined and reviewed.

In these regards, catalysts based on 3d transition metals have recently attracted much attention, yet further development is required. Here, we present a new type of heterostructure catalyst in which CoO nanowire arrays are hybridized with tungsten nanoparticles (W-CoO), and are self-supported on conductive carbon cloth (CC). Electronic coupling effects at the W-CoO heterointerface promote electron transfer and OER kinetics to expedite the formation of oxyhydroxide species, which are the active sites for OER processes. A variety of in situ and ex situ characterization methods are employed to reveal deep insights into surface transformations and investigate the relationship between the conversion to oxyhydroxide moieties and OER performance. This report presents new understanding of the rational design and synthesis of catalysts that exhibit outstanding performance as electrochemical water splitting electrode for OER.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt oxide 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy conversion 3ananowires 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3atungsten 0aMetallic tungsten 0aHeterostructure 0aElectronic coupling effect 0aOxygen evolution reaction 0aIn-situ RAMAN spectroscopy1 aKim, Kwanwoo1 aKim, Myeongjin1 aKim, Jooheon0 tJournal of catalysis.g2021 Dec., v. 404 p.80-88dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011900163300001600282520192300298592002802221596005802249650001602307650003502323650001402358650002602372650001202398650001102410650001802421650000902439650002002448650001102468650001402479650001802493650001502511650002002526650001502546651001002561700001602571700001202587700001802599700001802617773014202635856008102777852000902858655001202867IND60601039220221121064856.0180705e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060103922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00244-017-0482-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Ruijie10aTypical Endocrine Disrupting Compounds in Rivers of Northeast China: Occurrence, Partitioning, and Risk Assessment  ap. 213-223.  aLiao River Basin (LRB), located in northeast China, is one of seven largest river basins in China. The Daliao River Watershed (DLRW) is severely disturbed by human activities in the LRB. In this study, three rivers within the DLRW—Xi River (XR), Hun River (HR), and Daliao River (DLR)—were selected as sampling locations. The distribution, partitioning, and risk assessment of four endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), e.g., bisphenol A (BPA), 17β-estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), and 17α-ethinyl estradiol (EE2), in the rivers were investigated. The results showed that the concentration of BPA was generally higher than those of the other three steroidal estrogens in the sampling locations. The estrogen levels in the XR were greater than those in the HR and DLR. As a result of a decreasing river flow rate during the frozen season and irregular wastewater discharge from human domestic activities and manufacture processing, the total concentration of selected EDCs in the frozen season was much greater than those in nonfrozen season with the highest concentration in surface water of the XR at 1131.0 ng/L for BPA, 1235.0 ng/L for E1, 1253.5 ng/L for E2, and 17,111.5 ng/L for EE2, respectively. Based on the field-measured BPA concentrations in the sediment and water, the organic carbon-normalized partition coefficient (K ₒc) of BPA were calculated with the values of 2884–45,031 L/kg; the concentration of BPA in sediment was positive correlated with the content of OC (R ² = 0.932). The risk assessment made by estradiol equivalent (EEQ) and risk quotient (RQ) showed that 64.7% of sampling sites were exposed to high estrogenic activity (∑EEQ > 1) and high risk in surface water, whereas the RQ values of all selected estrogens in sediment were in medium or minimal risk. Both EE2 and E1 were the major contributors to the total estrogenic activity and risk quotient in surface water.  aPublisher supplied data  a21277133cNational Nature Science Foundation of China 3abisphenol A 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestradiol 3aestrogenic properties 3aestrone 3ahumans 3amanufacturing 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asediments 3asurface water 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aLiu, Ruixia1 aLi, Bin1 aLiu, Xiaoling1 aLi, Zongsheng0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2018 Aug., v. 75, no. 2 p.213-223dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3984x0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-017-0482-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245011700207300001800324520170600342592002802048650001002076650001302086650001802099650001802117650002502135650001402160650001102174650001402185650001002199700002002209700002902229773009902258856008102357990002302438852000902461655001202470IND60091379920221121184810.0141103e20120919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009137992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2012.08.0212doi7 aPMC34466782pmcid7 a229955112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelf, Erik S.12aA Spatial Model for Integrin Clustering as a Result of Feedback between Integrin Activation and Integrin Binding  ap. 1379-1389.  aIntegrins are transmembrane adhesion receptors that bind extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and signal bidirectionally to regulate cell adhesion and migration. In many cell types, integrins cluster at cell-ECM contacts to create the foundation for adhesion complexes that transfer force between the cell and the ECM. Even though the temporal and spatial regulation of these integrin clusters is essential for cell migration, how cells regulate their formation is currently unknown. It has been shown that integrin cluster formation is independent of actin stress fiber formation, but requires active (high-affinity) integrins, phosphoinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), talin, and immobile ECM ligand. Based on these observations, we propose a minimal model for initial formation of integrin clusters, facilitated by localized activation and binding of integrins to ECM ligands as a result of biochemical feedback between integrin binding and integrin activation. By employing a diffusion-reaction framework for modeling these reactions, we show how spatial organization of bound integrins into clusters may be achieved by a local source of active integrins, namely protein complexes formed on the cytoplasmic tails of bound integrins. Further, we show how such a mechanism can turn small local increases in the concentration of active talin or active integrin into integrin clusters via positive feedback. Our results suggest that the formation of integrin clusters by the proposed mechanism depends on the relationships between production and diffusion of integrin-activating species, and that changes to the relative rates of these processes may affect the resulting properties of integrin clusters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aadhesion 3acell adhesion 3acell movement 3aextracellular matrix 3aintegrins 3amodels 3areceptors 3atalin1 aNaik, Ulhas P.1 aOgunnaike, Babatunde A.0 tBiophysical journal.g2012 Sept. 19, v. 103, no. 6 p.1379-1389dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.08.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245007100205300001600276520109100292592002801383650002301411650001101434650002001445650001301465650002201478650001701500653001801517653003101535653002301566653002101589653002401610700002501634700005401659773010201713856008301815852000901898655001201907IND60751797320221118145125.0220328e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075179732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarin, Guy B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6733-121310aKinetics of chemical processes: From molecular to industrial scale  ap. 745-759.  aCombining spectroscopic and transient kinetic techniques provides access to the identification and quantification of active sites and corresponding turnover frequencies of catalyzed reactions [1]. Ab initio calculated rate coefficients combined with network generation codes allow so-called microkinetic models accounting for all relevant elementary steps of complex reaction networks. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) account for the scale-dependent transport of mass, energy and momentum and, hence, renders the design of an industrial process based on the intrinsic chemical kinetics possible. These theoretical and experimental achievements cannot be a substitute for the insights provided by the analysis of a catalytic cycle in terms of a limited number of kinetically significant steps [2]. We analyse the kinetics of a single-path reaction represented as a closed sequence of two steps [3]. We discuss some examples of chemical looping processes providing, in contrast to catalytic technology, the possibility to perform the steps of a closed sequence at different conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3afluid mechanics 3amomentum 3areaction kinetics 3aspectroscopy 0aMicrokinetics 0aSteady-state approximation 0aTurnover frequency 0aChemical looping 0aMultiscale modeling1 aGalvita, Vladimir V.1 aI︠A︡blonskiĭ, G.

However, how migratory insects distribute energy between migration and reproduction as an adaptive strategy to confront temporary low temperatures remains unclear. Here, we used Mythimna separata, a migratory cereal crop pest, to explore the effects of low temperature on reproductive performance, behavior, and energy allocation. We found that the influence of low temperatures on reproduction was not absolutely negative, but instead depended on the intensity, duration, and age of exposure to low temperature. Exposure to 6°C for 24 h significantly accelerated the onset of oviposition and ovarian development, and increased the synchrony of egg-laying and lifetime fecundity in 1-day-old adults compared to the control, while female's flight capacity decreased significantly on the first and second day after moths were exposed to 6°C. Furthermore, the abdominal and total triglycerides levels of females decreased significantly from exposure to low temperature, but their thoracic triglyceride content was significantly higher than the control on the third and fourth day. These results indicated that low temperatures induced M. separata to reduce energy investment for the development of flight system. This resulted in the shifting of moths from being migrants to residents during the environmental sensitive period (first day post-emergence). This expands our understanding of the adaptive strategy employed by migratory insects to deal with low temperatures and aids in the management of this pest species in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMythimna separata 3aenergy 3afecundity 3afemales 3aflight 3amigratory behavior 3aovarian development 3aoviposition 3aplant pests 3areproductive performance 3aresearch 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols 3aChina 0aEnergy trade-off 0alow temperature 0amigration 0areproduction 0atriglyceride1 aLv, Weixiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4505-31870 tBulletin of entomological research.g20222022 Aug. 13,  Jan. 13, v. 112, no. 4 p.546-556dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853210011393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02312naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245011900177300001600296520108900312592002801401650001001429650001101439650002201450650002401472650001601496650001601512650001601528650000901544650001201553650001401565650001901579700001701598700001601615700001501631700001801646700002201664700002101686773009301707856008101800852000901881655001201890IND60724787520221122165026.0210124e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072478752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.10.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones-Paris, Celestial R.10aBasement membrane ultrastructure and component localization data from uterine tissues during early mouse pregnancy  ap. 931-939.  aBasement membranes (BMs) are specialized extracellular scaffolds that provide architecture and modulate cell behaviors in tissues, such as fat, muscle, endothelium, endometrium, and decidua. Properties of BMs are maintained in homeostasis for most adult tissues. However, BM ultrastructure, composition, and localization are rapidly altered in select uterine tissues that are reprogrammed during pregnancy to enable early maternal-embryo interactions. Here, our data exhibit both static and dynamic BMs that were tracked in mouse uterine tissues during pre-, peri-, and postimplantation periods of pregnancy. The data exhibit spatial-temporal patterns of BM property regulation that coincide with the progression of adapted physiology. Further interpretation and discussion of these data in this article are described in the associated research article titled, “Embryo implantation triggers dynamic spatiotemporal expression of the basement membrane toolkit during uterine reprogramming” (C.R.

Results showed that increased dietary ARA concentration caused a significant non-linear rise to a plateau in survival rate, final body weight and thermal growth coefficient, and the maximum values occurred with the 1·42 % ARA treatment. As dietary ARA increased to 1·07 or 1·42 %, activities of trypsin, leucine aminopeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels increased, but they decreased with higher ARA concentrations. The fatty acid composition of tongue sole larvae was almost well correlated with their dietary fatty acid profiles, and the EPA content of the larvae decreased with increasing dietary ARA. Meanwhile, the partial sequences of COX-1a (cyclo-oxygenase-1a), COX-1b (cyclo-oxygenase-1b), COX-2 (cyclo-oxygenase-2), 5-LOX (5-lipoxygenase) and CYP2J6-like (cytochrome P450 2J6-like) were also obtained. Both COX-2 and 5-LOX mRNA expression levels significantly increased to a plateau in an ‘L’-shaped manner as dietary ARA increased to 1·07 or 1·42 %, but no significant differences were found in the gene expression of COX-1a, COX-1b or CYP2J6-like. These results suggest that 1·07–1·42 % dietary ARA was beneficial to the growth performance of larval tongue sole, and the regulation of dietary ARA on the growth performance of larvae was probably involved in altering the mRNA expression of COX-2 and 5-LOX.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynoglossus semilaevis 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aarachidonic acid 3abody weight 3acytochrome P-450 3adietary fat 3afatty acid composition 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth performance 3ahatching 3alarvae 3aleucyl aminopeptidase 3amessenger RNA 3asatiety 3asurvival rate 3atrypsin 0aArachidonic acid 0aGrowth 0aFatty acid composition 0aDigestive enzyme activity 0aGene expression 0aLarvae 0aCynoglossus semilaevis1 aLi, Songlin1 aMai, Kangsen1 aXu, Wei1 aZhang, Yanjiao1 aAi, Qinghui0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2015 May 28, v. 113, no. 10 p.1518-1530dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150007813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03701naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245017000169300001400339520229600353592002802649650001202677650002602689650001102715650001102726650001602737650001102753650001302764650002002777650001902797650001502816650001502831651001802846651001102864700002102875700002502896700001602921700002402937700001702961700001802978700001902996773010203015856008203117990002303199852000903222655001203231IND60095240220221117230558.0141104e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009524022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2012.11.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambelet, Myriam10aIsotopic analysis of Cd in the mixing zone of Siberian rivers with the Arctic Ocean—New constraints on marine Cd cycling and the isotope composition of riverine Cd  ap. 64-73.  aThe Cd concentrations and isotopic compositions were determined for 19 water samples which cover the mixing zones of four major rivers with the coastal seas of the Siberian Shelf. The waters span salinities from about 1–32, with Cd concentrations of about 0.02–0.46nmol/kg and small but resolvable Cd isotope fractionations, with ε¹¹⁴/¹¹⁰Cd values of between +1.4 and +5.7. The data for the majority of the samples are in accord with the systematics expected for quasi-binary mixing of Arctic seawater (ε¹¹⁴/¹¹⁰Cd≈5.5±0.5 and Cd concentration between 0.1 and 0.25nmol/kg) with river waters characterized by ε¹¹⁴/¹¹⁰Cd≈+2±1 and low pristine Cd contents of about 0.02–0.06nmol/kg. The river values are similar to the inferred composition of the continental crust, which implies that weathering produces no or only limited Cd isotope fractionation. The results for five samples provide clear evidence for non-conservative behaviour of Cd, as the element is released from suspended riverine particles during mixing with seawater. The isotopic data furthermore show that the desorbed Cd is characterized by ε¹¹⁴/¹¹⁰Cd≈+3, in accord with a natural origin. This implies that the (natural) net riverine Cd fluxes of the Siberian rivers to seawater are also likely to be characterized by ε¹¹⁴/¹¹⁰Cd≈+2±1, a value that is either identical to or intermediate between the composition of the continental crust and marine deep waters. Additional data for the boreal Kalix River in Sweden contrasts with the results obtained for the Siberian rivers, as the former exhibits a much lighter Cd isotope composition of ε¹¹⁴/¹¹⁰Cd=–3.8 coupled with a much higher Cd content of ∼0.24nmol/kg. These characteristics appear to be a consequence of the distinct hydro-geological setting of the Kalix drainage basin, which suggests that the riverine input of Cd isotopes to the oceans might display significant regional variability. In summary, our study underlines the important role that stable isotope analyses can play in biogeochemical investigations of trace metals. Here, the Cd isotope results provide important constraints, which are not available from concentration data alone, on the cycling of Cd in riverine and shelf environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3aisotope fractionation 3amixing 3aoceans 3ariver water 3arivers 3aseawater 3astable isotopes 3atrace elements 3awatersheds 3aweathering 3aArctic region 3aSweden1 aRehkämper, Mark1 avan de Flierdt, Tina1 aXue, Zichen1 aKreissig, Katharina1 aColes, Barry1 aPorcelli, Don1 aAndersson, Per0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 361 p.64-73dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.11.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03590naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245010700210300001800317520180300335592002802138650001202166650002802178650002302206650001402229650001202243650001802255650002402273650003002297650001902327650001202346651001102358651001002369651001302379651001502392651001602407651001402423651001802437651001102455651000902466653001502475653001402490653002702504700006402531700003202595700006602627700002502693700002002718700002102738700002802759773014602787856008202933852000903015655001203024IND60781299820221116161903.0220628e20210625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078129982DNAL7 a10.1017/S13689800210024572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazariegos, Mónica1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2250-368310aEducational inequalities in obesity: a multilevel analysis of survey data from cities in Latin America  ap. 1790-1798.  aUsing newly harmonised individual-level data on health and socio-economic environments in Latin American cities (from the Salud Urbana en América Latina (SALURBAL) study), we assessed the association between obesity and education levels and explored potential effect modification of this association by city-level socio-economic development. This cross-sectional study used survey data collected between 2002 and 2017. Absolute and relative educational inequalities in obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m², derived from measured weight and height) were calculated first. Then, a two-level mixed-effects logistic regression was run to test for effect modification of the education–obesity association by city-level socio-economic development. All analyses were stratified by sex. One hundred seventy-six Latin American cities within eight countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru). 53 186 adults aged >18 years old. Among women, 25 % were living with obesity and obesity was negatively associated with educational level (higher education–lower obesity) and this pattern was consistent across city-level socio-economic development. Among men, 18 % were living with obesity and there was a positive association between education and obesity (higher education–higher obesity) for men living in cities with lower levels of development, whereas for those living in cities with higher levels of development, the pattern was inverted and university education was protective of obesity. Among women, education was protective of obesity regardless, whereas among men, it was only protective in cities with higher levels of development. These divergent results suggest the need for sex- and city-specific interventions to reduce obesity prevalence and inequalities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLatinos 3across-sectional studies 3aeducational status 3anutrition 3aobesity 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomic development 3asocioeconomics 3asurveys 3aBrazil 3aChile 3aColombia 3aCosta Rica 3aEl Salvador 3aGuatemala 3aLatin America 3aMexico 3aPeru 0aInequities 0aEducation 0aSocio-economic factors1 aAuchincloss, Amy H.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5844-67211 aBraverman-Bronstein, Ariela1 aKroker-Lobos, María F1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8631-31011 aRamírez-Zea, Manuel1 aHessel, Philipp1 aMiranda, J Jaime1 aPérez-Ferrer, Carolina0 tPublic health nutrition.g20222021 July 25,  June 25, v. 25, no. 7 p.1790-1798dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800210024573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03903naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013200169506010400301520244100405592002802846506003702874650001702911650002202928650001302950650002802963650001102991650001503002650002503017650001303042651001103055653003503066653001803101653001803119653001903137653001103156700002103167700003003188700002203218700001903240773010403259856008503363852000903448655001203457IND60751791420221207141117.0220314e20211205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075179142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2021.1063842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranco, Andrea10aTriggers and consequences of landslide-induced impulse waves – 3D dynamic reconstruction of the Taan Fiord 2015 tsunami event  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aNatural multi-hazards as landslide-induced tsunamis require a multi-disciplinary approach to analyze the cascade effects that pose a significant threat to mountain communities and the surrounding territory. This paper comprises a detailed study of both the landslide evolution and the wave dynamics of the October 2015 Taan Fiord (Alaska) tsunami event, which represents a highly valuable case study for generic methodology development of single code applications using the numerical software Flow3D and testing its applicability for cascading wave hazard evaluation. First, a geomorphological analysis of the unstable slope is performed by elaborating diverse digital elevation models, where a significant vertical displacement of −90 m is observed before the final collapse, and the influence of listric faults within the slide body results in a bulging of the glacier at the toe. Data from time-series analyses suggests that the glacier retreat (and the reduction of local buttresses) critically destabilized the slope leading to the October 2015 catastrophic failure. The reconstructed landslide volume is estimated to be 49.4 Mm³, where 26 Mm³ entered the fiord and triggered the tsunami. Second, wave dynamics are recreated with Flow3D. Both dense fluid and granular media models are used and compared to verify their performance in initiating the impulse wave, where a measured impact speed ranging between 32 and 49 ms⁻¹ triggers a maximum wave amplitude of about 95–99 m. the maximum run-up of 193 m at the Hoof Hill Fan is recreated with both approaches, but general overestimations (about 9–12%) compared to the observations, in the impact area, are computed for the inundation process. A good approximation of the observed run-up along the entire length of the fiord is found for wave propagation models using the granular media approach. Beyond the Taan-Fiord case study and for evaluation of cascading landslide-induced hydraulic hazard in other settings, this work points out (i) the necessity of using a high temporal resolution of digital elevation models to analyze the multi-stage slope failure and to properly estimate the landslide volume, (ii) the applicability of the applied numerical models to reproduce the wave dynamics of a landslide-induced tsunami event on one code only, and (iii) how these models can be adopted to develop hazard maps related to potential wave hazards in natural basins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3aglaciers 3ahazard characterization 3ahooves 3alandslides 3atime series analysis 3atsunamis 3aAlaska 0aLandslide-induced impulse wave 0aMulti-hazards 0aWave dynamics 0aGranular media 0aFlow3D1 aMoernaut, Jasper1 aSchneider-Muntau, Barbara1 aStrasser, Michael1 aGems, Bernhard0 tEngineering geology.g2021 Dec. 05, v. 294 p.106384-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2021.1063843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245009800204300001600302520174300318592002802061650001902089650002002108650002002128650001302148650002102161650001202182650001002194650001002204650002102214650001902235650001602254650001302270650002102283650002602304650001502330650001302345650001002358650000902368650000902377650001502386650002502401650001102426650001102437650001602448650001702464650001002481650001102491651003102502700002402533700002002557700001602577700001902593700001802612700002202630700002402652700002302676773011502699856008202814961002802896852000902924655001202933IND60589910920221119220502.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058991092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-017-2109-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolfe, DavidW.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3131-383010aUnique challenges and opportunities for northeastern US crop production in a changing climate  ap. 231-245.  aClimate change may both exacerbate the vulnerabilities and open up new opportunities for farming in the Northeastern USA. Among the opportunities are double-cropping and new crop options that may come with warmer temperatures and a longer frost-free period. However, prolonged periods of spring rains in recent years have delayed planting and offset the potentially beneficial longer frost-free period. Water management will be a serious challenge for Northeast farmers in the future, with projections for increased frequency of heavy rainfall events, as well as projections for more frequent summer water deficits than this historically humid region has experienced in the past. Adaptations to increase resilience to such changes include expanded irrigation capacity, modernized water monitoring and irrigation scheduling, farm drainage systems that collect excess rain into ponds for use as a water source during dry periods, and improved soil water holding capacity and drainage. Among the greatest vulnerabilities over the next several decades for the economically important perennial fruit crop industry of the region is an extended period of spring frost risk associated with warmer winter and early spring temperatures. Improved real-time frost warning systems, careful site selection for new plantings, and use of misting, wind machine, or other frost protection measures will be important adaptation strategies. Increased weed and pest pressure associated with longer growing seasons and warmer winters is another increasingly important challenge. Pro-active development of non-chemical control strategies, improved regional monitoring, and rapid-response plans for targeted control of invasive weeds and pests will be necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3adouble cropping 3adrainage 3adrainage systems 3afarmers 3afarms 3afrost 3afrost protection 3agrowing season 3ahumid zones 3aindustry 3ainvasive species 3airrigation scheduling 3amonitoring 3aplanting 3aponds 3arain 3arisk 3asoil water 3asoil water retention 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3aweed control 3aweeds 3awinter 3aNortheastern United States1 aDeGaetano, ArthurT.1 aPeck, GregoryM.1 aCarey, Mary1 aZiska, LewisH.1 aLea-Cox, John1 aKemanian, ArmenR.1 aHoffmann, MichaelP.1 aHollinger, DavidY.0 tClimatic change.g2018 Jan., v. 146, no. 1-2 p.231-245dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-2109-73Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FSUSDA/ARSUSDA/FSA  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245012600211300001800337520180700355592002802162650001102190650000902201650002302210650001802233651001102251653001702262653002802279653002102307700003002328700003802358700006602396700002202462700002702484700003702511773014602548856008202694852000902776655001202785IND60781300020221119072612.0220628e20210625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078130002DNAL7 a10.1017/S13689800210027062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, Mariana Souza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3128-795910aSpatial inequalities of retail food stores may determine availability of healthful food choices in a Brazilian metropolis  ap. 1807-1818.  aTo examine the association between economic residential segregation and food environment. Ecological: Food stores categorised according to the NOVA classification were geocoded, and absolute availability was calculated for each neighbourhood. Segregation was measured using local Gᵢ * statistic, a measure of the sd between the economic composition of a neighbourhood (the proportion of heads of households in neighbourhoods earn monthly income of 0 to 3 minimum wages) and larger metropolitan area, weighted by the economic composition of surrounding neighbourhoods. Segregation was categorised as high (most segregated), medium (integrated) and low (less segregated or integrated). A proportional odds models were used to model the association between segregation and food environment. Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Food stores. After adjustment for covariates, neighbourhoods characterised by high economic segregation had fewer food stores overall compared with neighbourhoods characterised by low segregation (OR = 0·56; 95 % CI (0·45, 0·69)). In addition, high segregated neighbourhoods were 49 % (OR = 0·51; 95 % CI (0·42, 0·61)) and 45 % (OR = 0·55; 95 % CI (0·45, 0·67)) less likely to have a high number of food stores that predominantly marketed ultra-processed foods and mixed food stores, respectively, as compared with their counterparts. Economic segregation is associated with differences in the distribution of food stores. Both low and high segregation territories should be prioritised by public policies to ensure healthy and adequate nutrition as a right for all communities. The former must continue to be protected from access to unhealthy commercial food outlets, while the latter must be the locus of actions that limit the availability of unhealthy commercial food store.  aPublisher supplied data 3aincome 3aloci 3ametropolitan areas 3apublic health 3aBrazil 0aUrban Health 0aResidential segregation 0aFood Environment1 aCaiaffa, Waleska Teixeira1 aAndrade, Amanda Cristina de Souza1 ado Carmo, Ariene Silva1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3421-94951 aBarber, Sharrelle1 aMendes, Larissa Loures1 aFriche, Amélia Augusta de Lima,0 tPublic health nutrition.g20222021 July 25,  June 25, v. 25, no. 7 p.1807-1818dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800210027063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245014100184300001800325500001500343520173400358592002802092650002502120650000902145650002302154650001502177650002402192650002202216650001002238650002602248650002502274650001502299650002502314651001002339651001002349653002702359653001602386653001002402653001502412653002702427700001802454700001702472700001602489700001802505700001902523773013802542856008202680852000902762655001202771IND60516322820221116145326.0190726e20150414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051632282DNAL7 a257722602pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150003312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Wei-Ping10aHigh consumption of vegetable and fruit colour groups is inversely associated with the risk of colorectal cancer: a case–control study  ap. 1129-1138.  a2019-12-06  aThe colour of the edible portion of vegetables and fruit reflects the presence of specific micronutrients and phytochemicals. No existing studies have examined the relationship between the intake of vegetable and fruit colour groups and the risk of colorectal cancer. The present study, therefore, aimed to investigate these associations in a Chinese population. A case–control study was conducted between July 2010 and July 2014 in Guangzhou, China, in which 1057 consecutively recruited cases of colorectal cancer were frequency-matched to 1057 controls by age (5-year interval), sex and residence (rural/urban). A validated FFQ was used to collect dietary information during face-to-face interviews. Vegetables and fruit were classified into four groups according to the colour of their primarily edible parts: green; orange/yellow; red/purple; white. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the OR and 95 % CI. A higher consumption of orange/yellow, red/purple and white vegetables and fruit was inversely associated with the risk of colorectal cancer, with adjusted OR of 0·16 (95 % CI 0·12, 0·22) for orange/yellow, 0·23 (95 % CI 0·17, 0·31) for red/purple and 0·53 (95 % CI 0·40, 0·70) for white vegetables and fruit when the highest and lowest quartiles were compared. Total vegetable intake and total fruit intake have also been found to be inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk. However, the intake of green vegetable and fruit was not associated with colorectal cancer risk. The results of the present study, therefore, suggest that a greater intake of orange/yellow, red/purple and white vegetables and fruit is inversely associated with the risk of colorectal cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase-control studies 3arisk 3aat-risk population 3ainterviews 3aregression analysis 3afruit consumption 3acolor 3avegetable consumption 3acolorectal neoplasms 3avegetables 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3aChina 0aChina 0aCase–control studies 0arisk groups 0aFruit 0aVegetables 0aColorectal cancer risk1 aFang, Yu-Jing1 aLu, Min-Shan1 aZhong, Xiao1 aChen, Yu-Ming1 aZhang, Cai-Xia0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2015 Apr. 14, v. 113, no. 7 p.1129-1138dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150003313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013600165520124200301592002801543650001401571650002501585650001101610650002601621650002601647650001401673650002501687650001801712653002701730653002401757653002201781653001801803653001901821700001601840700001701856700001601873700001601889700001901905700001401924773010401938856008502042852000902127655001202136IND60751791620221118141814.0220314e20211205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075179162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2021.1063862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hongru10aEffect of water on mechanical behavior and acoustic emission response of sandstone during loading process: phenomenon and mechanism  aIn this paper, a series of uniaxial compression experiments were carried out on sandstone with varying water contents, and acoustic emission (AE) signals were synchronously collected in the experimental process. It reveals that water content has a significant effect on the mechanical behavior and AE signals of sandstone. As the water content increases, both the uniaxial compression strength and the elastic modulus decrease while the peak strain and energy dissipation increase. In the perspective of AE signals, both the peak and the cumulative AE energy drop with the water content, and an exponential empirical function was proposed to describe their relationships. Multi-fractal analyses of AE signals were also performed. The uniformity of signal distribution (∆a) and the difference between frequencies of largest and smallest signals (∆f) also decrease with the increase of water content. All these phenomena can be explained by the fact that more and more intergranular fractures occur at the higher water content condition. Moreover, a sudden increase of ∆a and a sudden decrease of ∆f in time series can be used as the precursor of rock destabilization and failure which have potential engineering application value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3acompression strength 3aenergy 3amechanical properties 3amodulus of elasticity 3asandstone 3atime series analysis 3awater content 0aWater-rock interaction 0aMechanical behavior 0aAcoustic emission 0aMulti-fractal 0aMicro-fracture1 aQiao, Yafei1 aShen, Rongxi1 aHe, Manchao1 aZheng, Dai,1 aXiao, Yingming1 aTang, Jie0 tEngineering geology.g2021 Dec. 05, v. 294 p.106386-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2021.1063863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01260naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245008400169300001400253500001400267520028000281592002800561650001500589650000900604650001600613651001300629653001300642653001800655653002700673653001300700700002600713773009300739856008100832852000900913655001200922IND60698924320221119120106.0210116e20160510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069892432DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.587.75572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPostle, Anthony C.12aA new termite (Isoptera, Termitidae, Syntermitinae, Macuxitermes) from Colombia  ap. 21-35.  aNAL-light  aA new species of termite, Macuxitermes colombicus Postle & Scheffrahn is described from soldiers and workers collected from Departamento Magdalena, Colombia.

To investigate the work performance of piles under different boundary conditions, we introduce two physical modelings of a pile-reinforced landslide with the same pile parameters and soil conditions but different load conditions and analyze the consequent differences in the responses of the soil and piles and their interactions in these two physical modelings. Results show that piles in the same landslide/pile systems may have different reinforcement effects; this phenomenon has been explained by quantitatively describing the role of piles and analyzing the processes of soil–pile interactions in the physical modelings. Further, the dynamic responses between the excess pore pressure and the soil–pile interaction are investigated and the excess pore pressure-dependent mechanisms of soil–pile interactions are revealed. The generation of excess pore pressure and its accumulation around piles leads internally to a mechanism in which the arching effect is weakened and externally to a phenomenon in which the progressive failure of pile-reinforced landslides is accelerated. Eventually, we calculate the effective stress in the soil around piles, and the results reveal that a sharp reduction in effective stress in the soil around piles causes failure of the pile reinforcement. In addition, for a pile-reinforced landslide with a strong soil–pile interaction, an imbalance of soil arch footholds is the main failure macro-mechanism. Based on the analysis results, we present some feasible suggestions for the installation of rowed pile and their monitoring to ensure the long-term stability of a pile-reinforced landslide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3aengineers 3aexhibitions 3alandslides 3amonitoring 3aphysical models 3asoil 3asoil quality 0aLandslide 0aStabilizing pile 0aSoil–pile interaction 0aArching effect 0aFailure mechanisms 0aPhysical modeling1 aLiu, Dongzi1 aNiu, Lifei1 aLiu, Chang1 aWang, Xuan1 aFu, Ru0 tEngineering geology.g2021 Dec. 05, v. 294 p.106389-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2021.1063893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245011300206300001800319520097100337592002801308650001901336650001601355650001301371700001801384700001601402700001501418700002101433700002201454773009801476856008101574990002301655852000901678655001201687IND60091375020221121231656.0141103e20120905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009137502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2012.08.0092doi7 aPMC34336002pmcid7 a230098502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillip, Yael10aContrasting Factors on the Kinetic Path to Protein Complex Formation Diminish the Effects of Crowding Agents  ap. 1011-1019.  aThe crowded environment of cells poses a challenge for rapid protein-protein association. Yet, it has been established that the rates of association are similar in crowded and in dilute solutions. Here we probe the pathway leading to fast association between TEM1 β-lactamase and its inhibitor protein BLIP in crowded solutions. We show that the affinity of the encounter complex, the rate of final complex formation, and the structure of the transition state are similar in crowded solutions and in buffer. The experimental results were reproduced by calculations based on the transient-complex theory for protein association. Both experiments and calculations suggest that while crowding agents decrease the diffusion constant of the associating proteins, they also induce an effective excluded-volume attraction between them. The combination of the two opposing effects thus results in nearly identical overall association rates in diluted and crowded solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-lactamase 3adiffusivity 3aproteins1 aHarel, Michal1 aKhait, Ruth1 aQin, Sanbo1 aZhou, Huan-Xiang1 aSchreiber, Gideon0 tBiophysical journal.g2012 Sept. 5, v. 103, no. 5 p.1011-1019dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.08.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01671naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009500171300001600266520073700282592002801019650001201047650001301059650001801072650001301090650001001103653002501113653001401138700002201152773009301174856008101267852000901348655001201357IND60724781020221120123017.0210124e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072478102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevenage, Sarah V.10aData from a fingerprint matching task with experts, trained students and untrained novices  ap. 621-624.  aThe data described here provide standard performance measures following administration of a fingerprint matching task to expert analysts, trained students and novice control participants.

Under the context of the GRECO (Greek Childhood Obesity) study, data from a total of 4547 children aged 10–12 years and 2318 parents were included in the analysis. Anthropometric, lifestyle and parental characteristics plus psychological concerns were investigated in relation to the prevalence of energy misreporting. Of the included children, 36 % were classified as energy under-reporters and 16 % as over-reporters. Multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that the most important predictors of energy under-reporting (URP) were children's BMI (OR 1·11, 95 % CI 1·09, 1·14) and weight satisfaction (OR 0·87, 95 % CI 0·78, 0·97). In the case of energy over-reporting (ORP), children's BMI (OR 0·87, 95 % CI 0·84, 0·90), meal and snack consumption frequency (OR 1·52, 95 % CI 1·32, 1·75), female sex (OR 0·65, 95 % CI 0·45, 0·90), and maternal education (OR 0·95, 95 % CI 0·91, 0·99) remained as significant predictors. Additionally, parental perception that the body weight of their children was normal reduced the odds of URP (OR 0·69, 95 % CI 0·48, 0·99) and ORP (OR 0·53, 95 % CI 0·31, 0·93). In conclusion, the present study confirms that the issue of URP and ORP in childhood populations is evident and quite serious. Although there are no definite guidelines on how to use data obtained from misreporters in an epidemiological dataset, validity of reported energy intake seems to be influenced by children's BMI and weight satisfaction, as well as by parental perceptions regarding their children's weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3achildhood 3achildhood obesity 3adata collection 3aeducation 3aenergy intake 3afemales 3aguidelines 3alifestyle 3aparents 3aregression analysis 3aschool children 0aUnder-reporting 0aOver-reporting 0aChildren 0aParental perceptions1 aBountziouka, Vassiliki1 aRisvas, Grigoris1 aPanagiotakos, Demosthenes B.1 aZampelas, Antonis0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2015 Apr. 14, v. 113, no. 7 p.1120-1128dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150004583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245015000181300001600331520131800347592002801665650001401693650002001707650001101727650002601738650001301764650001801777650001201795650003301807650000901840650002401849650001101873650001001884650000901894650001001903700002001913700002201933700002001955700002501975700002102000700002202021773009302043856004802136852000902184655001202193IND4486654420221119083315.0120517e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448665442DNAL7 a225807532pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-012-0916-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgri, Ádám10aNew kind of polarotaxis governed by degree of polarization: attraction of tabanid flies to differently polarizing host animals and water surfaces  ap. 407-416.  aAquatic insects find their habitat from a remote distance by means of horizontal polarization of light reflected from the water surface. This kind of positive polarotaxis is governed by the horizontal direction of polarization (E-vector). Tabanid flies also detect water by this kind of polarotaxis. The host choice of blood-sucking female tabanids is partly governed by the linear polarization of light reflected from the host’s coat. Since the coat-reflected light is not always horizontally polarized, host finding by female tabanids may be different from the established horizontal E-vector polarotaxis. To reveal the optical cue of the former polarotaxis, we performed choice experiments in the field with tabanid flies using aerial and ground-based visual targets with different degrees and directions of polarization. We observed a new kind of polarotaxis being governed by the degree of polarization rather than the E-vector direction of reflected light. We show here that female and male tabanids use polarotaxis governed by the horizontal E-vector to find water, while polarotaxis based on the degree of polarization serves host finding by female tabanids. As a practical by-product of our studies, we explain the enigmatic attractiveness of shiny black spheres used in canopy traps to catch tabanids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTabanidae 3aaquatic insects 3acanopy 3afield experimentation 3ahabitats 3asurface water 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aCues 2aDipteraxphysiology 2aFemale 2aLight 2aMale 2aWater1 aBlahó, Miklós1 aSándor, András,1 aKriska, György1 aGyurkovszky, Mónika1 aFarkas, Róbert,1 aHorváth, Gábor,0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2012 May, v. 99, no. 5 p.407-416dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-012-0916-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245011100166300002000277520134800297592002801645650001501673650001901688650002301707650002601730650001101756650001601767650001801783650001201801650001101813650001701824700002101841773013601862856008201998852000902080655001202089IND60538363220221117234822.0160815e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053836322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.5b034542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIliuță, Ion.,10aCO2 Removal in Packed-Bed Columns and Hollow-Fiber Membrane Reactors. Investigation of Reactor Performance  ap. 12455-12465.  aThe CO₂ absorption performance of hollow-fiber membranes and conventional packed-bed column reactors under similar operating conditions was evaluated. Two-scale, nonisothermal, steady-state models were used to simulate the reactors behavior. The membrane reactor model accounts for CO₂ diffusion in gas-filled membrane pores, CO₂ and amine diffusion accompanied by chemical reaction in liquid-filled membrane pores, and CO₂ and amine diffusion accompanied by chemical reaction in the liquid film zone surrounding the inside membrane wall. The packed-bed column reactor model interconnects a two-fluid 2D hydrodynamic platform with 2D mass and energy transport equations in the gas and liquid phases and nonlinear differential equations governing diffusion and reaction in the liquid film. In the absence of membrane wetting, the hollow-fiber membrane reactor outperforms the packed-bed column reactor with similar volume and specific surface area. This is not the case under membrane wetting conditions, when at low specific surface areas the packed-bed column reactor can outperform the membrane reactor. However, as the hollow-fiber membrane reactors can be stacked with very high specific surface areas in the same reactor volume, the performance of this type of reactor remains better even under partial wetted membrane conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical reactions 3adifferential equation 3aenergy 3aengineering 3ahydrodynamics 3aliquids 3amodels 3asurface area1 aIliuta, Maria C.0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 54, no. 49 p.12455-12465dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.5b034543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014700167300001800314520163000332592002801962650001201990650002802002650002202030650001102052650002302063650001402086650002002100650001202120650001802132650000902150653000802159653002402167700001702191700005802208773014702266856008202413852000902495655001202504IND60781300820221119074004.0220628e20210906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078130082DNAL7 a10.1017/S13689800210038032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Sung Keun14aThe association between insulin resistance and the consumption of nut including peanut, pine nut and almonds in working-aged Korean population  ap. 1904-1911.  aStudies have reported that nuts intake is potentially beneficial to cardiometabolic health. However, there have been heterogeneous results regarding the association between nut intake/consumption and the risk of diabetes mellitus (DM). Insulin resistance (IR) is a major pathophysiology of DM. Thus, this study was to assess the association between nuts consumption and IR. A retrospective cross-sectional study. Multivariable-adjusted OR and 95 % CI for increased IR (adjusted OR (95 % CI)) were calculated according to the frequency of consuming one serving dose (15 g) of nuts including peanut, pine nut and almond (< 1/month, 1/month–1/week, 1–3/week, 3–5/week, ≥ 5/week). Elevated IR was defined in homoeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance corresponding to the fourth quartile levels within each study group. Subgroup analysis was conducted for gender, glycaemic status (normal, prediabetes and DM) and age (≥ and < 40 years). 379 310 Koreans who received health check-up. Compared with nut consumption < 1/month (reference), nuts consumption ≥ 1/month had the lower OR and 95 % CI for elevated IR (1/month–1/week: 0·90 (95 % CI 0·89, 0·92), 1–3/week: 0·90 (95 % CI 0·87, 0·92), 3–5/week: 0·94 (95 % CI 0·89, 0·98) and ≥ 5/week: 0·90 (95 % CI 0·86, 0·94)). This association was more remarkable in women, normal glycaemic group and young age group (< 40 years). However, men, prediabetes, DM and old age group did not show the significant association. Nuts consumption ≥ 1/month was less associated with elevated IR. Increased nuts consumption may have a favourable effect on IR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalmonds 3across-sectional studies 3adiabetes mellitus 3agender 3ainsulin resistance 3anutrition 3apathophysiology 3apeanuts 3apublic health 3arisk 0aNut 0aInsulin sensitivity1 aOh, Chang-Mo1 aJung, Ju Young1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7921-65490 tPublic health nutrition.g20222021 July 06,  Sept. 06, v. 25, no. 7 p.1904-1911dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800210038033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245016300169300001400332500001400346520093100360592002801291650001401319650001701333650002001350650001501370650001001385650001401395650001501409650001401424650001601438650001101454651001301465651000901478651001301487651001201500653002001512653001601532653001801548653001901566653001301585653001301598653001201611700002101623700002601644700002301670700001901693773009301712856008101805852000901886655001201895IND60698925120221121203912.0210116e20160516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069892512DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.589.79332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInkhavilay, Khamla14aThe first revision of the carnivorous land snail family Streptaxidae in Laos, with description of three new species (Pulmonata, Stylommatophora, Streptaxidae)  ap. 23-53.  aNAL-light  aThe family Streptaxidae in Laos is revised.

In particular, a two-city study provides evidence that PM₂.₅ contributes to the timing and severity of the epidemic, without adjustment for confounders. The publicly available data of deaths between March and October 2020, updated it on May 30, 2021, and the average seasonal concentrations of PM₂.₅ pollution over the previous years in Thessaloniki, the second-largest city of Greece, were investigated. It was found that changes in coronavirus-related deaths follow changes in air pollution and that the correlation between the two data sets is maximized at the lag time of one month. Similar data from Tehran were gathered for comparison. The results of this study underscore that it is possible, if not likely, that pollution nanoparticles are related to COVID-19 fatalities (Granger causality, p < 0.05), contributing to the understanding of the environmental impact on pandemics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aair pollution 3aenvironmental impact 3amagnetism 3aresearch 3aGreece 3aIran 0aParticulate matter 0aIron-bearing nanoparticles 0aAirborne 0aCOVID-19 0aPandemics1 aSimeonidis, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9804-46900 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Mar., v. 204 p.112054-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1120543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01978naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245009300172300001400265500001400279520072500293592002801018650001701046650001001063650001401073650003001087650001501117650001601132650001401148650001601162650001701178650001001195651001101205653001001216653001301226653001301239653001401252653001201266653001301278700002601291700002001317773009301337856008101430852000901511655001201520IND60698925320221121223520.0210116e20160516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069892532DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.589.79512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrescovit, Antonio D.10aThree new species of Misionella from northern Brazil (Araneae, Haplogynae, Filistatidae)  ap. 71-96.  aNAL-light  aThree new species of the genus Misionella are described from Brazil: Misionella carajas sp. n. and Misionella aikewara sp. n. from caves in the states of Pará and Tocantins and Misionella pallida sp. n. from natural and synanthropic dry areas in the states of Piauí, Maranhão, Rio Grande do Norte and Bahia.

In the present study, we investigated whether serving healthy school meals influenced concentration and school performance of 8- to 11-year-old Danish children. The OPUS (Optimal well-being, development and health for Danish children through a healthy New Nordic Diet) School Meal Study was a cluster-randomised, controlled, cross-over trial comparing a healthy school meal programme with the usual packed lunch from home (control) each for 3 months (NCT 01457794). The d2 test of attention, the Learning Rating Scale (LRS) and standard tests on reading and mathematics proficiency were administered at baseline and at the end of each study period. Intervention effects were evaluated using hierarchical mixed models. The school meal intervention did not influence concentration performance (CP; primary outcome, n 693) or processing speed; however, the decrease in error percentage was 0·18 points smaller (P< 0·001) in the intervention period than in the control period (medians: baseline 2·03 %; intervention 1·46 %; control 1·37 %). In contrast, the intervention increased reading speed (0·7 sentence, P= 0·009) and the number of correct sentences (1·8 sentences, P< 0·001), which corresponded to 11 and 25 %, respectively, of the effect of one school year. The percentage of correct sentences also improved (P< 0·001), indicating that the number correct improved relatively more than reading speed. There was no effect on overall math performance or outcomes from the LRS. In conclusion, school meals did not affect CP, but improved reading performance, which is a complex cognitive activity that involves inference, and increased errors related to impulsivity and inattention. These findings are worth examining in future trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacademic achievement 3achildren 3acognition 3across-over studies 3adiet 3alearning 3alunch 3amathematics 3amodels 3areading 3aschool meals 0aSchool meals 0aNutrition 0aCognition 0aSchool performance1 aDyssegaard, Camilla B.1 aDamsgaard, Camilla T.1 aPetersen, Rikke A.1 aDalskov, Stine-Mathilde1 aHjorth, Mads F.1 aAndersen, Rikke1 aTetens, Inge1 aRitz, Christian1 aAstrup, Arne1 aLauritzen, Lotte1 aMichaelsen, Kim F.1 aEgelund, Niels0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2015 Apr. 28, v. 113, no. 8 p.1280-1291dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150000333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010600163300002000269520088300289592002801172650001201200650001401212650001101226650001601237650001201253650001801265650002101283650001601304650002201320650002101342650001701363650001401380700002501394700002201419700002001441773013601461856008201597852000901679655001201688IND60538363820221117234826.0160815e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053836382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.5b037072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonfa, Girma10aEvaluation of Thermophysical Properties of Functionalized Imidazolium Thiocyanate Based Ionic Liquids  ap. 12428-12437.  aNew cyano-based ionic liquids with thiocyanate anion and nitrile, ally, benzyl, and hydroxyl functionalized imidazolium cations were prepared, and some of their important thermophysical properties were measured.

The two main hypotheses for the origin of the archetypal Hawaiian swell are thermal lithospheric thinning, and dynamic support by an ascending plume. Any successful model would have to be able to simultaneously explain the swell topography and the corresponding geoid anomaly. In simple models of isostatic compensation, the geoid-to-topography ratio (GTR) is linearly related to the depth of the compensating mass; therefore it is often considered a fundamental parameter to assess swell support mechanisms. Previous estimates for the geoid-to-topography ratio (GTR) of the Hawaiian swell however are biased towards low values by incomplete removal of the effects of volcanic loading and lithospheric flexure. In order to resolve these issues, we here apply a continuous wavelet transform, which allows resolution of lateral variations of the GTR at various spatial scales. In a series of synthetic tests, the robustness of this approach and its power to identify the origin of hotspot swells are established. With 8m/km on the youngest part of the chain, the recovered GTR agrees well with the predictions for dynamic support, therefore ruling out thermal rejuvenation as an important mechanism. We also find that the depth of the compensating mass decays by 20km over a distance of 500km from Hawaii to Kauai, and identify sublithospheric erosion by small-scale convection in the ponded plume material as a viable mechanism to support this decay.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aprediction 3atopography 3avolcanic activity 3awavelet 3aKauai1 aBallmer, Maxim D.1 aPanet, Isabelle1 aDiament, Michel1 aRibe, Neil0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2012 Dec. 15, v. 359-360 p.40-54dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.10.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245012300209300001600332520103700348592002801385650001601413650001901429650000901448650001201457650001601469773009601485856008101581990002301662852000901685655001201694IND60091376120221120024656.0141103e20120905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009137612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2012.07.0102doi7 aPMC34336202pmcid7 a230098412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeimburg, Thomas14aThe Capacitance and Electromechanical Coupling of Lipid Membranes Close to Transitions: The Effect of Electrostriction  ap. 918-929.  aBiomembranes are thin capacitors with the unique feature of displaying phase transitions in a physiologically relevant regime. We investigate the voltage and lateral pressure dependence of their capacitance close to their chain melting transition. Because the gel and the fluid membrane have different area and thickness, the capacitance of the two membrane phases is different. In the presence of external fields, charges exert forces that can influence the state of the membrane, thereby influencing the transition temperature. This phenomenon is called “electrostriction”. We show that this effect allows us to introduce a capacitive susceptibility that assumes a maximum in the melting transition with an associated excess charge. As a consequence, voltage regimes exist in which a small change in voltage can lead to a large uptake of charge and a large capacitive current. Furthermore, we consider electromechanical behavior such as pressure-induced changes in capacitance, and the application of such concepts in biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acell membranes 3agels 3amelting 3atemperature0 tBiophysical journal.g2012 Sept. 5, v. 103, no. 5 p.918-929dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.07.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245011700159300001400276520104600290592002801336596005901364650001101423650001901434650001201453650001601465650001301481650001601494650000901510650001501519650000901534650001901543650002501562650001301587700001501600700001801615700001801633700001901651700001301670700001401683700001501697700001301712773014201725856008101867852000901948655001201957IND60601035620221121092212.0180705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060103562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-018-2373-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yue10aEffects of Complex Pollution of Pb and B[a]P on the Growth and Physiological and Biochemical Indexes of Ryegrass  ap. 86-91.  aEffects of complex pollution of Pb and B[a]P on the growth and physiological and biochemical indexes of ryegrass were investigated in a potted soil. The results showed that under single Pb treatment condition, low-concentration (0–100 mg kg⁻¹) Pb stimulated the increase of ryegrass biomass while high-concentration (200–400 mg kg⁻¹) Pb obviously inhibited ryegrass growth. Under single B[a]P pollution condition, low-concentration (0–30 mg kg⁻¹) B[a]P facilitated the growth of ryegrass while high-concentration (50–100 mg kg⁻¹) B[a]P had toxic effect on ryegrass. Under joint impacts of Pb and B[a]P at low concentrations, biomass, chlorophyll content and carotenoid content as well as POD and CAT activities of ryegrass presented firstly rising and then descending trends, SOD accumulation increased slightly and MDA didn’t experience obvious change. Under co-existence of Pb and B[a]P, Pb was the main toxic factor for ryegrass growth and it controlled the variation trend of whole growth cycle of ryegrass.  aPublisher supplied data  a31600311cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aLolium 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3abiomass 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3alead 3aperoxidase 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity1 aDu, Wenwen1 aZhang, Zhuang1 aZhang, Lihong1 aChen, Zhonglin1 aHou, Wei1 aXu, Sunan1 aJiang, Lei1 aYu, Ning0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2018 July, v. 101, no. 1 p.86-91dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-018-2373-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01830naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245011800171300001300289500001400302520080900316592002801125650001401153650001601167651000901183653001301192653001201205653001101217653001501228653001401243700002101257700002001278773009201298856008101390852000901471655001201480IND60698926020221121233715.0210116e20160525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069892602DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.592.81182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPáll-Gergely, Barna14aThe family Plectopylidae (Gastropoda, Pulmonata) in Laos with the description of two new genera and a new species  ap. 1-26.  aNAL-light  aPreviously only a single plectopylid species, Helix laomontana L.

In this article, a novel mixture canonical variate analysis (MCVA) model is proposed to model and monitor multimode dynamic processes. First, the augmented process data are assumed to be many different clusters, each of which corresponds to an operating mode and can be characterized by a Gaussian component. Then, singular value decomposition of the covariance matrices is implemented in each Gaussian cluster and the corresponding canonical variates are obtained. For process monitoring purposes, the local statistics in each cluster are calculated and the integrated monitoring indices are obtained in a probabilistic manner. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed monitoring approach are illustrated through two examples: a numerical process and the Tennessee Eastman challenge problem. The comparison of monitoring results demonstrates that the proposed approach is superior to conventional CVA and Gaussian mixture models (GMM).  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3anormal distribution 3aprocess monitoring1 aGe, Zhiqiang1 aSong, Zhihuan0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2015 Feb. 11, v. 54, no. 5 p.1605-1614dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie503324g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245012300189300001800312520164800330592002801978650001602006650001502022650002002037650001602057650002002073650001402093650002302107650001002130650001202140650000902152650001802161650001402179650001202193650001302205650001202218650003102230650001102261650002002272650001002292650001302302650001202315650001202327650005202339650001102391650002702402650002402429650000902453650002402462650003102486651001402517651001402531700002902545700002102574700002302595700002102618773009002639856004802729852000902777655001202786IND50067998320221121002459.0130720e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006799832DNAL7 a237932952pmid7 a10.1007/s10646-013-1094-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFogel, Marilina N.10aImpact of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid on immature stages of the predator Eriopis connexa (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)  ap. 1063-1071.  aEriopis connexa is a native coccinelid predator in the Neotropical Region. In Argentina it is commonly found associated to sucking pests in several crops and among them aphids and whiteflies. These pests are usually controlled with newly developed systemic insecticides, such as the neonicotinoids. However, the compatibility between selective pesticides and natural enemies is required before incorporating them in integrated pest management (IPM) packages. Within this frame, the objective of this study was to evaluate the side effect of various concentrations/doses of one commonly used neonicotinoid in vegetal crops, acetamiprid, on immature stages of E. connexa by dipping or topical exposure for eggs and larvae, respectively. Acetamiprid reduced egg hatching from 34 to 100 %. Moreover, the embryogenesis was disrupted by insecticide at early embryo stage at all tested concentrations. Second larval instar was more susceptible to acetamiprid than the fourth one and this susceptibility was positively related with the tested concentrations. On the other hand, the survival reduction at larval stage reached 100 % from 20 mg a.i./L (10 % of maximum field concentration). Besides, the reproduction of the females developed from topical bioassays on fourth instar larvae was strongly affected, with reduction in fecundity and fertility from 22 to 44 % and from 37 to 45 %, respectively. Overall the results showed a high toxicity of acetamiprid on immature stages of E. connexa, demonstrating that this broadly used insecticide could reduce biocontrol services provided by this predator and could also likely disturb IPM programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAleyrodidae 3aAphidoidea 3aEriopis connexa 3aacetamiprid 3aadverse effects 3abioassays 3abiological control 3acrops 3adipping 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3afecundity 3afemales 3ahatching 3ainstars 3aintegrated pest management 3alarvae 3anatural enemies 3apests 3atoxicity 3atropics 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aFemale 2aInsecticidesxtoxicity 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aMale 2aPyridinesxtoxicity 2aReproductionxdrug effects 3aArgentina 0aArgentina1 aSchneider, Marcela Inés1 aDesneux, Nicolas1 aGonzález, Belén,1 aRonco, Alicia E.0 tEcotoxicology.g2013 Aug., v. 22, no. 6 p.1063-1071dSpringer-Verlagx0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-013-1094-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245010900209300001800318520196600336592002802302650001302330650004602343650002802389650000902417650001402426650000902440650001802449650003002467651001502497653003002512653003002542653002602572653002302598700001702621700004302638700001802681700006402699773014602763856008202909852000902991655001203000IND60781301920221119073926.0220628e20220110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078130192DNAL7 a10.1017/S13689800220000392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Hannah R1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0214-500310aLimited implementation of California’s Healthy Default Beverage law for children’s meals sold online  ap. 2001-2010.  aTo reduce children’s sugar-sweetened beverage intake, California’s Healthy-By-Default Beverage law (SB1192) mandates only unflavoured dairy/non-dairy milk or water be the default drinks with restaurant children’s meals. The objective of this study is to examine consistency with this law for meals sold through online platforms from restaurants in low-income California neighbourhoods. This observational, cross-sectional study examines beverage availability, upcharges (additional cost) and presentation of beverage options consistent with SB1192 (using four increasingly restrictive criteria) within a random sample of quick-service restaurants (QSR) in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education eligible census tracts selling children’s meals online from November 2020 to April 2021. Low-income California neighbourhoods (n 226 census tracts). QSR that sold children’s meals online via a restaurant-specific platform, DoorDash, GrubHub and/or UberEats (n 631 observations from 254 QSR). Seventy percent of observations offered water; 63 % offered unflavoured milk. Among all beverages, water was most likely to have an upcharge; among observations offering water (n 445), 41 % had an upcharge (average $0·51). Among observations offering unflavoured milk (n 396), 11 % had an upcharge (average $0·38). No observations upcharged for soda (regular or diet). Implementation consistency with SB1192 ranged from 40·5 % (using the least restrictive criteria) to 5·6 % (most restrictive) of observations. Based on observations from restaurant websites and three of the most popular online ordering platforms, most California QSR located in low-income neighbourhoods are not offering children’s meal beverages consistent with the state’s Healthy-By-Default Beverage law. As the popularity of online ordering increases, further work to ensure restaurants offering healthy default beverages with children’s meals sold online is necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 3across-sectional studies 3adiet 3aeducation 3amilk 3apublic health 3asugar sweetened beverages 3aCalifornia 0aSugar-sweetened beverages 0aHealthy default beverages 0aFast food restaurants 0aChildren’s meals1 aMartin, Anna1 aStrochlic, Ronald S.q(Ronald Steven),1 aSingh, Sonali1 aWoodward-Lopez, Gail1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2745-10770 tPublic health nutrition.g20222022 July 10,  Jan. 10, v. 25, no. 7 p.2001-2010dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800220000393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01794naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245009200213300001600305520081800321592002801139650001101167650002201178651001801200700001801218700002101236773010901257856008201366990002301448852000901471655001201480IND60095235620221122191250.0141104e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009523562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2012.10.0042doi7 aPMC36177272pmcid7 a235649662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinkler, Stephan R.10aBomb fall-out ²³⁶U as a global oceanic tracer using an annually resolved coral core  ap. 124-130.  aAnthropogenic ²³⁶U (t½=23.4My) is an emerging isotopic ocean tracer with interesting oceanographic properties, but only with recent advances in accelerator mass spectrometry techniques is it now possible to detect the levels from global fall-out of nuclear weapons testing across the water column. To make full use of this tracer, an assessment of its input into the ocean over the past decades is required. We captured the bomb-pulse of ²³⁶U in an annually resolved coral core record from the Caribbean Sea. We thereby establish a concept which gives ²³⁶U great advantage – the presence of reliable, well-resolved chronological archives.

However, empirical evidence of this possibility is limited. The present cross-sectional study compared the relationships of 24 h urine-derived and self-reported intakes of Na, K and protein with obesity. A total of 1043 Japanese women aged 18–22 years completed a 24 h urine collection and a self-administered diet history questionnaire. After adjustment for potential confounders, 24 h urine-derived Na intake was associated with a higher risk of general obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) and abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥ 80 cm; both P for trend = 0·04). For 24 h urine-derived protein intake, positive associations with general and abdominal obesity were observed (P for trend = 0·02 and 0·053, respectively). For 24 h urine-derived K intake, there was an inverse association with abdominal obesity (P for trend = 0·01). Conversely, when self-reported dietary information was used, only inverse associations between K intake and general and abdominal obesity were observed (P for trend = 0·04 and 0·02, respectively), with no associations of Na or protein intake. In conclusion, we found positive associations of Na and protein intakes and inverse associations of K intake with obesity when using 24 h urinary excretion for estimating dietary intakes. However, no association was observed based on using self-reported dietary intakes, except for inverse association of K intake, suggesting that the ability of self-reported dietary information using the diet history questionnaire for investigating diet–obesity relationships is limited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapanese people 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3adietary surveys 3aexcretion 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3aobesity 3apotassium 3aprotein intake 3arisk 3asodium 3aurine 3awaist circumference 3awomen 0a24 h Urine 0aSodium 0aProtein 0aObesity1 aLivingstone, M.

The present study assessed metal accumulation strategies of three dominant emergent plants [Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott, Scirpus grossus (L.) f., and Typha latifolia L.] growing in a wetland contaminated with coke-oven effluent. Metals concentration (mg kg⁻¹) in wetland sediment followed the order Mn (408) > Cu (97) > Co (14.2) > Cr (14) > Cd (2.7). Plant tissues (root and shoot) showed metal-specific accumulation at different extents due to plant response against metal utility or toxicity. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) and translocation factor (TF) of metals in plants revealed Cd and Mn pollution could be remediated through phytoextraction (BCF > 1 and TF > 1); however, Co, Cu, and Cr pollution could be remediated through phytostabilization (BCF > 1 and TF < 1).  aPublisher supplied data  aIIT (ISM) JRF reg no. 2014DR0276cMinistry of Human Resource Development 3aColocasia esculenta 3aScirpus 3aTypha latifolia 3abioaccumulation factor 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aecosystems 3aemergent plants 3aindustrial effluents 3amanganese 3aphytoaccumulation 3aplant response 3aplant tissues 3apollution 3aroots 3asediments 3ashoots 3atoxicity 3awetlands1 aMaiti, Subodh Kumar0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2018 July, v. 101, no. 1 p.55-60dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-018-2354-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010500169300001300274520113800287592002801425650002001453650001501473650003201488650001201520650001001532650002201542650001601564650001301580650001101593651001601604653001501620653001601635653002701651653001601678653001201694700002301706700002601729700002201755773009201777856008101869852000901950655001201959IND60698926720221122005326.0210116e20160526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069892672DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.593.85112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSitnikova, Tatiana12aA new, genetically divergent species of Pseudobaikalia Lindholm, 1909 (Caenogastropoda, Baicaliidae)  ap. 1-14.  aA new gastropod species, Pseudobaikalia michelae Sitnikoiva & Kovalenkova, sp. n., (family Baicaliidae) is described from Lake Baikal. This is the first new species from the Baicaliidae for forty years. The new species is distinguished from its sister taxa by means of comparative morphology as well as analyses of DNA sequences (mtDNA and an intron of alpha-subunit gene of ATP-synthase). It was found in the southern and central-eastern parts of the lake where it occurs sympatrically with three other baicaliid species. Characters of the female reproductive system (i.e., a long oviduct loop with 2–3 narrow tube-like evaginations) and the aperture (i.e., oval shape with a simple outer lip) place these snails in the genus Pseudobaikalia Lindholm, 1909. The new species is most similar in its shell morphology to the northern Baikal species Pseudobaikalia jentteriana (smooth elongated shape) but differs by a more oval aperture that is slightly angled to the columella. Combined mitochondrial and nuclear sequences in a Bayesian analysis showed that all specimens of Pseudobaikalia michelae sp. n. form a well-supported clade.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aGastropoda 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aintrons 3alakes 3amitochondrial DNA 3anew species 3aoviducts 3asnails 3aLake Baikal 0aGastropoda 0anew species 0aPseudobaikaliamichelae 0aLake Baikal 0aSiberia1 aKovalenkova, Maria1 aPeretolchina, Tatiana1 aSherbakov, Dmitry0 tZooKeys.g2016 May 26, v. 593 p.1-14dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.593.85113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007700165300001600242520211500258592002802373650001302401650001602414650001102430650001302441650001202454650001502466650001202481650001202493651001102505700001502516700001702531700001602548773010902564856008202673990002302755852000902778655001202787IND60095236120221122191259.0141104e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009523612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2012.09.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRecanati, A.10aHelium distribution in a mantle shear zone from the Josephine Peridotite  ap. 162-172.  aA previous study of oceanic mylonites suggested that peridotite helium concentrations are correlated with the degree of high-temperature ductile deformation in the mantle. In order to test this result, this study combines helium measurements with characterization of the deformation state of harzburgite samples in a small (6m width) ductile mantle shear zone from the Josephine Peridotite, Oregon, USA. All measurements were made by coupled in vacuo crushing and melting, demonstrating that most of the helium (>80%) resides within the solid phases rather than fluid or melt inclusions. The present study confirms the influence of deformation on helium contents, but only at the highest shear strain (γ>20) are helium contents significantly higher. The highest helium concentration, by roughly a factor of two, is found in the center-most sample, which also has grain size reduction by a factor of ∼4. Dislocations and sub-grain boundaries are present in all samples and do not correlate with helium concentrations. Mineralogy also appears to have a negligible influence in this shear zone, as modal mineralogy is relatively homogeneous, with all samples being harzburgites. These observations suggest that the increase in helium concentration is related to grain size reduction, with grain boundaries proposed as an additional storage site for helium in the mantle. The present data also characterize the isotopic composition of the Josephine Peridotite: ³He/⁴He=6.7±0.2Ra (n=33, between 6.3 and 7.1Ra). The presence of cosmogenic ³He in the matrix is indicated by the helium isotopic composition released by melting: ³He/⁴He=8.5±0.3Ra (n=10; from 7.9 to 10.9). This corresponds to an exposure age of 10Kyr, which is approximately concordant with the end of the last glacial maximum. Very little radiogenic helium is present in the samples, suggesting extremely low uranium and thorium contents ([U]<0.3ppb). Helium isotope measurements in four samples outside the shear zone suggest that mineralogy and melt infiltration are also important factors for understanding helium storage in the mantle.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrushing 3adeformation 3ahelium 3aisotopes 3amelting 3amineralogy 3athorium 3auranium 3aOregon1 aKurz, M.D.1 aWarren, J.M.1 aCurtice, J.0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2012 Dec. 15, v. 359-360 p.162-172dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.09.0463Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245010300205300001800308520104100326592002801367650003101395650001701426650002501443650002401468650004401492650002501536700001601561700001901577700002401596700001901620700002001639700001701659773009801676856008101774990002301855852000901878655001201887IND60091377120221120024714.0141103e20120905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009137712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2012.08.0062doi7 aPMC34336192pmcid7 a230098532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Jackwee10aRigidifying Acyl Carrier Protein Domain in Iterative Type I PKS CalE8 Does Not Affect Its Function  ap. 1037-1044.  aAcyl carrier protein (ACP) domains shuttle acyl intermediates among the catalytic domains of multidomain type I fatty acid synthase and polyketide synthase (PKS) systems. It is believed that the unique function of ACPs is associated with their dynamic property, but it remains to be fully elucidated what type of protein dynamics is critical for the shuttling domain. Using NMR techniques, we found that the ACP domain of iterative type I PKS CalE8 from Micromonospora echinospora is highly dynamic on the millisecond-second timescale. Introduction of an interhelical disulfide linkage in the ACP domain suppresses the dynamics on the millisecond-second timescale and reduces the mobility on the picosecond-nanosecond timescale. We demonstrate that the full-length PKS is fully functional upon rigidification of the ACP domain, suggesting that although the flexibility of the disordered terminal linkers may be important for the function of the ACP domain, the internal dynamics of the helical regions is not critical for that function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicromonospora echinospora 3aactive sites 3aacyl carrier protein 3afatty-acid synthase 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyketide synthases1 aSun, Huihua1 aFan, Jing-Song1 aHameed, Iman Fahim,1 aLescar, Julien1 aLiang, Zhao-Xun1 aYang, Daiwen0 tBiophysical journal.g2012 Sept. 5, v. 103, no. 5 p.1037-1044dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.08.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01323naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245011900167300001400286500001400300520027300314592002800587650001500615650001900630651001400649651001300663653001400676653003100690653002000721653001200741653001300753653002400766773009300790856008100883852000900964655001200973IND60698926920221122005357.0210116e20160526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069892692DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.593.79952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArimoto, Kôichi10aRediscovery and redescription of Dilobitarsus pendleburyi (Coleoptera, Elateridae, Agrypninae) from Southeast Asia  ap. 37-48.  aNAL-light  aDilobitarsus pendleburyi Fleutiaux, 1934 is recorded for the first time after its original description and is redescribed.

Despite this, little is known about their concentrations in outdoor air in the African continent. To address this knowledge gap, concentrations of BFRs, NFRs, and PCBs were measured in outdoor air at 8 sites located within the metropolitan area of Lagos, Nigeria. Concentrations of ∑₈BDEs, ∑HBCDD, ∑₇NFRs and ∑₈PCBs were: 21–750 (median = 100) pg/m³, <12–180 (median = < 12) pg/m³, 34–900 (median = 300) pg/m³ and 85–460 (median = 300) pg/m³, respectively. Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209, range: <16–620 pg/m³, median = 71 pg/m³) and DBDPE (range: <37–890 pg/m³, median = 280 pg/m³) were the dominant BFRs detected, while the non-Arochlor PCB 11 (range: 49–220 pg/m³, median = 100 pg/m³) was the dominant PCB. To the authors’ knowledge, these are the first data on the non-Arochlor PCB 11 in outdoor air in Africa. In general, concentrations of all target contaminants in this study were within the range reported elsewhere in Africa and worldwide. Likely due to the tropical climate of Lagos, no seasonal variation in concentrations was discernible for any of the target contaminants. While concentrations of PBDEs and some NFRs were correlated with population density, concentrations of PCBs appear more impacted by leaks from electrical transformers and for PCB 11 to proximity to activities like textile factories that produce and use dyes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiphenyl 3abromination 3adecabromodiphenyl ethane 3adecabromodiphenyl ether 3afabrics 3ahexabromocyclododecane 3ametropolitan areas 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apopulation density 3aresearch 3aseasonal variation 3atropics 3aNigeria 0aPCBs 0aBFRs 0aPBDEs 0aHBCDD 0aDBDPE 0aUrban air 0aAfrica1 aStubbings, William A.1 aAbdallah, Mohamed Abou-Elwafa1 aAyejuyo, Olusegun1 aAlani, Rose1 aHarrad, Stuart1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4650-05640 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Mar., v. 204 p.112091-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1120913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012700159300001800286520117200304592002801476650001501504650001901519650001401538650002301552650001101575650001601586650001101602650001901613650001201632650001601644650001901660700001801679700002101697700001601718773013301734856007501867852000901942655001201951IND60538365320221117234850.0160815e20150211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053836532DNAL7 a10.1021/ie503982t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chih-Chun10aConversion of CO2 and C2H6 to Propanoic Acid on an Iridium-Modified Graphene Oxide Surface: Quantum-Chemical Investigation  ap. 1539-1546.  aUsing density-functional theory, we performed calculations on a single-atom catalyst (SAC) comprising an iridium atom on a modified graphene oxide (Ir₁-GO) surface to investigate the conversion of CO₂ and C₂H₆ molecules to propanoic acid. The great catalytic activity of this surface is due to the strong adsorption of C₂H₆ and CO₂ (−0.92 and −0.56 eV adsorption energies, respectively). First, C₂H₆ is dehydrogenated at an oxide site of the surface to form C₂H₅ + OH with a barrier of height 0.63 eV; the adsorbed CO₂ then reacts with ethyl to form C₂H₅COO or COOC₂H₅ with barriers of 0.95 and 1.70 eV, respectively. Less likely, the adsorbed CO₂ might be hydrogenated by hydroxyl to form HCOO or COOH, with energy barriers of 1.34 and 1.49 eV, respectively. We predict that the most likely path for the conversion of the adsorbed CO₂ and ethane molecules on the Ir₁-graphene oxide surface would involve the formation of propanoic acid (C₂H₅COOH). To understand the interaction between adsorbates and surfaces, we calculated and analyzed the local densities of states (LDOS) and the electron localization function (ELF).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3aengineering 3aethane 3agraphene oxide 3airidium 3amethodology 3apropionic acid1 aYeh, Chen-Hao1 aChang, Chun-Chih1 aHo, Jia-Jen0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2015 Feb. 11, v. 54, no. 5 p.1539-1546dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie503982t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245008800203300001600291520205300307592002802360650001402388650001402402650001902416650002102435650001902456650000902475650001502484650001002499650001102509650002702520650001302547650001302560650000902573650001502582650001302597650001402610650001602624650001202640650002202652650001002674651001102684651001802695700001902713700001902732700002102751700001702772773011502789856008202904852000902986655001202995IND60589913720221119220142.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058991372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-016-1654-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevis, Samuel1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4684-699510aCLMcrop yields and water requirements: avoided impacts by choosing RCP 4.5 over 8.5  ap. 501-515.  aWe perform CLMcrop simulations of the 20th and 21st centuries to assess potential avoided impacts in (a) crop yield losses and (b) water demand increases if humanity were to choose the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 instead of 8.5. RCP 8.5 imposes more extreme climatic changes on CLMcrop, while simultaneously exposing the crops to higher CO₂ fertilization than RCP 4.5. As a result CLMcrop simulates global to regional scale changes in yield and water requirements for RCP 8.5 that exceed and sometimes more than double the RCP 4.5 changes relative to today. Under RCP 4.5 then, human societies may confront easier adaptation to changes in crop yields and water requirements. Under both RCPs, CLMcrop projects declining global yields for C3 crops (e.g., wheat, soybean, rice) without CO₂ fertilization and C4 crops (corn, sugarcane) without irrigation. Yield declines of 3 t ha⁻¹ stand out in parts of tropical and subtropical Africa and South America (presently areas of rapid agricultural expansion) and are due to increasing plant respiration and decreasing soil moisture, both due to rising temperatures. Irrigation and CO₂ fertilization mitigate yield losses and in some cases lead to gains, so irrigation may help maintain or increase current yields through the 21st century. However, simulated global irrigation requirements increase: as much as 23 % for C4 crops without CO₂ fertilization under RCP 8.5 and as little as 3 % for C4 crops with CO₂ fertilization under RCP4.5. Nitrogen fertilized crops display greater vulnerability to climate and environmental change than unfertilized crops in our simulations; still relative to unfertilized crops, they deliver significantly higher yields and remain indispensable in supporting a more populous and affluent humanity. These CLMcrop results broadly agree with previously published outcomes for the 21st century. We describe in this article a new version of CLMcrop that represents prognostic crop behavior not only in the mid-latitudes but also the tropics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC3 plants 3aC4 plants 3acarbon dioxide 3acell respiration 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acrop yield 3acrops 3ahumans 3airrigation requirement 3alatitude 3anitrogen 3arice 3asoil water 3asoybeans 3asugarcane 3atemperature 3atropics 3awater requirement 3awheat 3aAfrica 3aSouth America1 aBadger, Andrew1 aDrewniak, Beth1 aNevison, Cynthia1 aRen, Xiaolin0 tClimatic change.g2018 Feb., v. 146, no. 3-4 p.501-515dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-016-1654-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245010100201300001600302520150200318592002801820650002001848650001701868650002901885650001501914650002301929650001501952650002101967650002901988650001102017650003002028650001402058650001402072650002202086650001802108650001202126651001002138700006102148700001802209700001902227773012702246856008202373852000902455655001202464IND60589908020221119215938.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058990802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-017-1469-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, D.S.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6031-007610aAnthropogenic disturbance induces opposing population trends in spotted hyenas and African lions  ap. 871-889.  aLarge carnivore populations are declining worldwide due to direct and indirect conflicts with humans. Protected areas are critical for conserving large carnivores, but increasing human-wildlife conflict, tourism, and human population growth near these sanctuaries may have negative effects on the carnivores within sanctuary borders. Our goals were to investigate how anthropogenic disturbance along the edge of the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, influences the demography and space-use of two large carnivore species that engage in intense interspecific competition. Here we document, in one disturbed region of the Reserve, a rapid increase in the population size of one large predator, the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), but a striking concurrent decline in numbers of another, the African lion (Panthera leo). Anthropogenic disturbances negatively affected lion populations, and decreasing lion numbers appear to have a positive effect on hyena populations, indicated here by an increase in juvenile survivorship. We also saw an increase in the number of livestock consumed by hyenas. Our results suggest human population growth and indirect effects of human activity along Reserve boundaries may be effecting a trophic cascade inside the Reserve itself. These results indicate both top-down and bottom-up processes are causing a shift in the carnivore community, and a major disruption of guild structure, inside the boundaries of one of the most spectacular protected areas in Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocuta crocuta 3aPanthera leo 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarnivores 3aconservation areas 3ademography 3ahuman population 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3ahumans 3ainterspecific competition 3ajuveniles 3alivestock 3apopulation growth 3asurvival rate 3atourism 3aKenya1 aJohnson-Ulrich, L.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5604-59351 aCouraud, H.E.1 aHolekamp, K.E.0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2018 Mar., v. 27, no. 4 p.871-889dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl50341x0960-31157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-017-1469-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012800166300001600294520184200310592002802152650001802180650002002198650002502218650002902243650001302272650001102285650002002296650001102316650001802327650002102345650002402366650001302390650002602403653000802429653001202437653001102449700002502460700002502485700001802510700002302528700002402551700002102575700001902596773009302615856008102708852000902789655001202798IND60724776720221120124638.0210124e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072477672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.08.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, Julie M.10aExpression and methylation data from SLE patient and healthy control blood samples subdivided with respect to ARID3a levels  ap. 213-219.  aPreviously published studies revealed that variation in expression of the DNA-binding protein ARID3a in B lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) correlated with levels of disease activity (“Disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus correlates with expression of the transcription factor AT-rich-interactive domain 3A” (J.M. Ward, K. Rose, C. Montgomery, I. Adrianto, J.A. James, J.T. Merrill et al., 2014) [1]). The data presented here compare DNA methylation patterns from SLE peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from samples with high numbers of ARID3a expressing B cells (ARID3aᴴ) versus SLE samples with normal numbers of ARID3a⁺ B cells (ARID3aᴺ). The methylation data is available at the gene expression omnibus (GEO) repository, “Gene Expression Omnibus: NCBI gene expression and hybridization array data repository” (R. Edgar, M. Domrachev, A.E. Lash, 2002) [2]. Isolated B cells from SLE ARID3aᴴ and ARID3aᴺ B samples were also evaluated via qRT-PCR for Type I interferon (IFN) signature and pathway gene expression levels by qRT-PCR. Similarly, healthy control B cells and B cells stimulated to express ARID3a with the TLR agonist, CpG, were also compared via qRT-PCR. Primers designed to detect 6 IFNa subtype mRNAs were tested in 4 IFNa, Epstein-Barr Virus-transformed B cell lines (“Reduced interferon-alpha production by Epstein-Barr virus transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and lectin-stimulated lymphocytes in congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I” (S.H.

The disease is caused by Echinococcus multilocularis – the fox tapeworm. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are currently counted as the most important carriers (reservoirs) of E. multilocularis in the Northern Hemisphere. The possible routes of infection of E. multilocularis to humans are complex and still require research. Until now, it has been unknown whether E. multilocularis eggs can be moved by wind at all. This analysis shows, based on calculations, that E. multilocularis eggs can be transported by wind. Using a mathematical model, flight distances depending on wind speed and take-off heights are calculated for dense and less dense (coniferous) forest areas. The results – differentiated for seasons and as overall average – are based on mean values of wind speeds which were measured over a ten-year period in an experimental forest stand in the Solling (Germany). Due to their rate of descent, wind-related spreading of E. multilocularis eggs is possible. The average flight distance covered by E. multilocularis eggs in forest areas, depending on their starting altitude and wind speed, is between approximately 1.3 m and approximately 17 m. From the mathematical point of view, the wind factor can definitely be seen as one of the multiple vectors associated with environmental contamination by E. multilocularis eggs. Consequently, the possible wind-borne spread of E. multilocularis eggs poses an infection risk to humans that should be considered and requires further research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinococcus multilocularis 3aVulpes vulpes 3aaltitude 3aechinococcosis 3aflight 3aforest stands 3aforests 3afoxes 3amathematical models 3apollution 3arisk 3atapeworms 3awind speed 3azoonoses 3aGermany 0aE. multilocularis eggs 0azoonotic disease 0aAlveolar echinococcosis 0aAlveolar hydatid disease 0adispersion 0awind-borne dispersion 0amathematical model 0arisk management 0aflight model 0aparameters of E. multilocularis eggs 0arate ofdecent1 aNeumann, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8392-00930 tJournal of helminthology.g2022 June 28, v. 96 p.e45-dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X220003603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01742naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006400166300001600230520073200246592002800978650003201006650001601038650002501054650001401079650001301093650002201106650001201128653002601140653001301166700001601179700001401195773009301209856008101302852000901383655001201392IND60724777020221120145820.0210124e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072477702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.08.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Mridula10aData on meq gene sequence analysis of Ludhiana MDV isolates  ap. 231-235.  aThe data described are related to the article entitled “Sequence Analysis of Meq oncogene among Indian isolates of Marek׳s Disease Herpesvirus” M.

Estimates of the magnitude and rate of CO₂ injection in the ocean–atmosphere system are compatible with a scenario of ocean acidification. Many carbonate platforms drowned in the Pliensbachian, well before the early Toarcian event. In this paper we test the hypothesis of surface water ocean acidification by presenting data from a resilient carbonate platform: the Apennine Carbonate Platform of southern Italy. The studied sections document a dramatic shift of the carbonate factory from massive biocalcification to chemical precipitation. Lithiotis bivalves and calcareous algae (Palaeodasycladus mediterraneus), which were the most prolific carbonate producers of Pliensbachian carbonate platforms, disappear during the first phase of the early Toarcian CIE, before the most depleted values are reached. We discuss the local versus supraregional significance of this shift and propose a scenario involving abrupt decline of carbonate saturation, forced by CO₂ release at the beginning of the early Toarcian CIE, followed by a calcification overshoot, driven by the recovery of ocean alkalinity. Attribution of the demise of carbonate platform hypercalcifiers to ocean acidification is supported by palaeophysiology and reinforced by experimental data on the detrimental effects of ocean acidification on recent shellfishes and calcareous algae.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aacidification 3aisotopes 3achemical precipitation 3ashellfish 3acarbon 3aseawater 3aalkalinity 3acalcification 3asurface water 3aBivalvia 3aItaly 0aAlgae1 aSpangenberg, Jorge1 aAdatte, Thierry1 aFöllmi, Karl B.1 aParente, Mariano0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 357-358 p.214-225dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.09.0433Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245016500163300002000328520158100348592002801929650001201957650001401969650001401983650001101997650002102008650001402029650002402043650001102067650002002078650001402098650001102112650001502123650001902138650001402157650001802171650001302189650001402202650002002216650001302236653001702249653001802266653001702284653001602301653001502317700002102332700002102353700002102374700001602395700002002411700001702431700002602448773012902474856007802603852000902681655001202690IND60538359920170818000000.0160815e20160810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053835992DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b072912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKostiv, Uliana10aRGDS- and TAT-Conjugated Upconversion of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2 Nanoparticles: In Vitro Human Epithelioid Cervix Carcinoma Cellular Uptake, Imaging, and Targeting  ap. 20422-20431.  aStarting NaYF₄:Yb³⁺/Er³⁺ nanoparticles with size tuned from 24 to 33 nm were prepared by high-temperature coprecipitation of lanthanide chlorides in high-boiling organic solvents. To enhance colloidal stability in aqueous medium, an aminosilica shell was introduced on the surface by hydrolysis and condensation of tetramethyl orthosilicate and (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane using a reverse microemulsion technique; to form alkyne groups, reaction with 4-pentynoic acid followed. Finally, the cell adhesive and cell penetrating azidopentanoyl-GGGRGDSGGGY-NH₂ (RGDS) and azidopentanoyl-GGGRKKRRQRRR-NH₂ (TAT) peptides were conjugated to the upconversion particles via Cu(I)-catalyzed alkyne–azide cycloaddition. The concentrations of the peptides bound to the nanoparticle surfaces and amount of adsorbed residual Cu(I) catalyst were determined using an ¹²⁵I-radiolabeled RGDS peptide and a ⁶⁴Cu(I)-doped catalyst, respectively. Targeting and uptake of the RGDS- and TAT-conjugated NaYF₄:Yb³⁺/Er³⁺&SiO₂ nanoparticles by human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells were monitored by confocal microscopy. RGDS-conjugated nanoparticle probes were mainly localized on the cell plasma membrane due to specific binding of the peptide to the corresponding integrins. In contrast, the TAT-conjugated nanoparticles were able to cross the cell membrane and accumulate in the cell cytoplasm. Thus, this new peptide bioconjugation approach supported both extra- and intracellular nanoparticle uptake, enabling targeting and imaging of the specific tumor phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3acarcinoma 3acatalysts 3acervix 3achemical bonding 3achlorides 3aconfocal microscopy 3acopper 3acoprecipitation 3acytoplasm 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3aimage analysis 3aintegrins 3ananoparticles 3apeptides 3aphenotype 3aplasma membrane 3asolvents 0aupconversion 0ananoparticles 0aRGDS peptide 0aTAT peptide 0aHeLa cells1 aKotelnikov, Ilya1 aProks, Vladimír1 aŠlouf, Miroslav1 aKučka, Jan1 aEngstová, Hana1 aJežek, Petr1 aHorák, D.q(Daniel),0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Aug. 10, v. 8, no. 31 p.20422-20431dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b072913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011500164300001600279520134800295592002801643650000801671650000901679650002301688650001001711650002601721650001301747650001501760650001501775650000901790650001401799650001301813650001101826651002101837651001001858651001001868653001901878653001901897653002101916653001901937653003201956653001001988700002701998700002202025700002602047700002302073700001802096773009602114856008102210852000902291655001202300IND60698921820221119115849.0210116e20160421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069892182DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.582.59662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChetri, Madhu10aAncient Himalayan wolf (Canis lupus chanco) lineage in Upper Mustang of the Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal  ap. 143-156.  aThe taxonomic status of the wolf (Canis lupus) in Nepal’s Trans-Himalaya is poorly understood. Recent genetic studies have revealed the existence of three lineages of wolves in the Indian sub-continent. Of these, the Himalayan wolf, Canis lupus chanco, has been reported to be the most ancient lineage historically distributed within the Nepal Himalaya. These wolves residing in the Trans-Himalayan region have been suggested to be smaller and very different from the European wolf. During October 2011, six fecal samples suspected to have originated from wolves were collected from Upper Mustang in the Annapurna Conservation Area of Nepal. DNA extraction and amplification of the mitochondrial (mt) control region (CR) locus yielded sequences from five out of six samples. One sample matched domestic dog sequences in GenBank, while the remaining four samples were aligned within the monophyletic and ancient Himalayan wolf clade. These four sequences which matched each other, were new and represented a novel Himalayan wolf haplotype. This result confirms that the endangered ancient Himalayan wolf is extant in Nepal. Detailed genomic study covering Nepal’s entire Himalayan landscape is recommended in order to understand their distribution, taxonomy and, genetic relatedness with other wolves potentially sharing the same landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3adogs 3aendangered species 3afeces 3agenetic relationships 3agenomics 3ahaplotypes 3alandscapes 3aloci 3amonophyly 3ataxonomy 3awolves 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 3aNepal 0aHimalayan wolf 0awolf-dog clade 0aCanislupuschanco 0aTrans-Himalaya 0aAnnapurna Conservation Area 0aNepal1 aJhala, Yadvendradev V.1 aJnawali, Shant R.1 aSubedi, N.q(Naresh),1 aDhakal, Maheshwor,1 aYumnam, Bibek0 tZooKeys.g2016 Apr. 21, v. 582 p.143-156dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.582.59663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013900168300001600307520085600323592002801179650002101207650002401228650001001252650001401262650002001276650001601296650002001312650001401332650001201346653004001358653001001398653001201408653000801420653003301428653001001461653001301471653002101484700002101505773017101526856008201697852000901779655001201788IND60751788620220217000000.0211017e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075178862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cnd.2021.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyrolles, Anaël14aLes troubles du comportement alimentaire restrictifs chez l’enfant: anorexie mentale, “petits mangeurs”, phobies et autres ARFID  ap. 272-279.  aEarly-onset restrictive food intake disorders (FID) are a group of heterogenous food intake disorders that include both pre-pubertal anorexia nervosa and Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorders (ARFID).

It will also discuss other concerns adolescents have, which may influence their food choices and eating habits. Adolescence represents a period of rapid physical, mental and social development, and many health-related habits developed during adolescence tend to persist into adulthood, making the teenage years an optimal time to encourage healthy eating and health-promoting behaviours. Adolescents are concerned about the health impact of their diet, but their understanding of health is often seen in the context of their physical appearance or body image. Body image concerns are prevalent in adolescents, and this can affect their food choices. Taste, price and convenience are commonly noted factors influencing adolescents' food choices, and as they grow, their level of independence increases and spending more time with their peers means that social desirability and social norms about food become increasingly important factors in adolescent food choice. However, their limited autonomy means their supporting food environment also plays an important role. When developing more targeted interventions in adolescent populations, information on adolescent nutrition needs, their concerns for health and body image, and the barriers and motivations for healthy eating and food choice should be considered. Such a holistic approach should help support healthy eating and the prevention of overweight and obesity in the population, whilst also supporting a healthy relationship with food and their bodies.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Agriculture, Food and the Marinedhttps://doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001584 3aadolescence 3aadolescent nutrition 3aadolescents 3aadulthood 3abody image 3afood choices 3ahealthy diet 3aobesity 3aprices 3ataste 0aAdolescent food choice 0aAdolescent health1 aO'Sullivan, Elizabeth J.1 aKearney, John M.0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g20222021 Mar. 29,  Nov. 29, v. 81, no. 1 p.75-86dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45480x1475-27197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651210038273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01739naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245014500165300001400310500002900324520074400353592002801097650001501125650002001140650001301160653001201173653001501185653002501200653001601225773009401241856008101335852000901416655001201425IND60698922020221119115759.0210116e20160425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069892202DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.583.70842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBousquet, Yves10aLitteratura Coleopterologica (1758–1900): a guide to selected books related to the taxonomy of Coleoptera with publication dates and notes  ap. 1-776.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aBibliographic references to works pertaining to the taxonomy of Coleoptera published between 1758 and 1900 in the non-periodical literature are listed.

Impedance spectroscopy was performed for both hydrogen-doped and -undoped samples in a frequency range from 0.1Hz to 1MHz to examine the effect of water on conductivity. Two conduction mechanisms were identified for hydrogen-undoped samples at temperature of 1000–1723K and for hydrogen-doped samples at relatively lower temperature range of 500–900K to minimize dehydration of samples. For the hydrogen-undoped samples, the activation enthalpy is around 1.9eV at the higher temperatures range (>1300K) suggesting that the dominant charge transfer mechanism is Fe²⁺−Fe³⁺ hopping (small polaron) conduction. For the hydrogen-doped samples measured below 900K, the activation enthalpy decreases from 1.11 to 0.70eV, and the conductivity values systematically increase with increasing water content, suggesting that proton conduction is the dominant conduction mechanism. Taking hopping conduction and water content dependence of activation enthalpy for proton conduction into account, all electrical conductivity data were fitted to the formula σ=σ₀ₕexp(−Hₕ/kT)+σ₀ₚCwexp[−(Hₚ ⁰−αCw ¹/³)/kT], where σ₀ is pre-exponential factor, Cw is the water content in weight percent, H is the activation enthalpy, Hₚ ⁰ is the activation enthalpy for proton conduction at very low water concentration, α is the geometrical factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is absolution temperature and subscripts h and p represent hopping and proton conductions, respectively. Using the present results, a laboratory-based conductivity-depth profile in the Earth's upper mantle has been constructed as a function of water content. Comparison of our model with the currently available geophysical observations beneath the Eastern Pacific Rise indicates that hydrous aluminous enstatite cannot account for the high conductivity anomaly at the top of the asthenosphere as well as hydrous olivine.  aPublisher supplied data 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenthalpy 3ageophysics 3amodels 3atemperature 3awater content1 aYoshino, T.q(Takashi),1 aWu, Xiaoping1 aMatsuzaki, Takuya1 aShan, Shuangming1 aKatsura, Tomoo0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 357-358 p.11-20dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.09.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01441naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245012100205300001300326500002200339520040300361592002800764650002500792650001100817650001100828650002800839700006400867773012900931856008201060852000901142655001201151IND60589909120221119220054.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058990912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-018-1511-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuzzon, Filippo1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5305-225910aCorrection to: Could taxonomic misnaming threaten the ex situ conservation and the usage of plant genetic resources?  ap. 1289.  aPublished Erratum  aIn the original publication of this article, some letters within the caption of Fig. 1 were misplaced.

Such systems can reduce potential toxicity and enhance patient compliance compared to traditional therapies. Accordingly, we designed a mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN)-based glucose-sensitive and self-regulated drug release system to achieve the goal of long circulation and “touch switch” in vivo. In this system, carboxyphenylboronic acid (CPBA) was first modified on the surface of MSN using amidation reaction. Insulin (INS) was then loaded in the channels of MSN (CPBA-MSN/INS) through physical adsorption, and sodium alginate (SA) was introduced onto the surface of the CPBA-MSN/INS nanoparticles as the gatekeeper via amidation reaction (SA/CPBA-MSN/INS). We found the drug loading capacity of INS was 261 mg/g. In the normal range of blood glucose, INS was scarcely released due to the reversible covalent interaction between 1,2-diols of SA and CPBA. Within the high concentration of glucose, the boronate esters could be dissociated, which results in the mesoporous channels opening and the release of INS. In vivo experiments on diabetic mice showed SA/CPBA-MSN/INS sustained a normal blood glucose level for up to 12 h with a single dose. Moreover, the lipid metabolism disorder and organ damage of diabetic mice were alleviated after treatment with SA/CPBA-MSN/INS. Therefore, SA/CPBA-MSN/INS characterized by an “on–off” regulated drug release property and high biosafety shows promise for applications in diabetes treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanimal disease models 3abiosafety 3ablood glucose 3adiabetes 3adrugs 3aesters 3aglucose 3ain vivo studies 3ainsulin 3alipid metabolism disorders 3amice 3ananoparticles 3apatient compliance 3aporous media 3asilica 3asodium alginate 3atoxicity 0adiabetes 0aglucose response 0acompetitive binding 0aself-regulated release 0a“touch switch”1 aZheng, Yazhen1 aWang, Yongchao1 aHu, Yurong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0354-79391 aShi, Jinjin1 aLiu, Qi1 aZhang, Huijuan1 aZhang, Zhenzhong0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 June 22, v. 10, no. 26 p.21927-21938dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b069983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245019700164300001400361500001400375520167300389592002802062650001502090650001702105650001602122650001002138650001402148650001402162650002002176650001102196650001402207651001002221651002002231653001502251653001502266653001302281653001302294653001202307653002402319700001402343700002002357700001802377700002002395700002002415700001602435773009402451856008102545852000902626655001202635IND60698922220221119115700.0210116e20160425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069892222DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.584.71732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Hong-Li10aRevision of sinistral land snails of the genus Camaena (Stylommatophora, Camaenidae) from China based on morphological and molecular data, with description of a new species from Guangxi, China  ap. 25-48.  aNAL-light  aThe camaenid land snail genus Camaena is widely distributed throughout Southeast Asia. Thirteen species are found in China alone. Among these, Camaena cicatricosa (Müller, 1774) is the most widely distributed species, including four subspecies, Camaena cicatricosa ducalis (Ancey, 1885), Camaena cicatricosa inflata (Möllendorff, 1885), Camaena cicatricosa obtecta (Fischer, 1898) and Camaena cicatricosa connectens (Dautzenberg & Fischer, 1906). The systematics of these taxa is revised herein based on comparative shell morphology and anatomy as well as analyses of DNA sequences of two mitochondrial genes (COI, 16S rRNA) and one nuclear marker, ITS2. We found that all subspecies form well-supported clades in a molecular phylogeny and are well-differentiated from each other by genetic distances that are consistent with amounts of interspecific differentiation. In addition, they clearly differ from each other in reproductive features. Based on these observations, we elevate all four subspecies to the rank of full species. Moreover, based on morphological and mitochdondrial differentiation, we describe a new species, Camaena poyuensis sp. n. from Guangxi, China. The new species conspicuously differs from its sibling species Camaena cicatricosa in having a larger and more depressed shell, a completely covered umbilicus, more or less purplish peristome, an obtuse angle at the junction of the basal and columellar lip, longer pedunculus of the bursa copulatrix, thicker epiphallus and penis, and short conic verge. Previous named species are also redescribed on their shell and anatomical characters, because the original descriptions are uninformative.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamaenidae 3amitochondria 3anew species 3apenis 3aperistome 3aphylogeny 3asibling species 3asnails 3aumbilicus 3aChina 3aSouth East Asia 0aLand snail 0aGastropoda 0acamaenid 0ataxonomy 0aanatomy 0amolecular phylogeny1 aWang, Pei1 aQian, Zhou-Xing1 aLin, Jun-Hong1 aZhou, Wei-Chuan1 aHuang, Chongqi,1 aAi, Hong-Mu0 tZooKeys.g2016 Apr. 25, v. 584 p.25-48dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.584.71733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010900174300001600283520108900299592002801388650001901416650000801435650002501443650002701468650002501495650001301520650001401533650002901547653001901576653001801595653002001613653002301633653000901656653000901665653001901674653001601693653002301709653002001732700001901752700006001771700002801831700002601859700006301885773009301948856008102041852000902122655001202131IND60724778220221120145835.0210124e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072477822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.08.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngelaccio, Sebastiana10aData from computational analysis of the peptide linkers in the MocR bacterial transcriptional regulators  ap. 292-313.  aDetailed data from statistical analyses of the structural properties of the inter-domain linker peptides of the bacterial regulators of the family MocR are herein reported. MocR regulators are a recently discovered subfamily of bacterial regulators possessing an N-terminal domain, 60 residue long on average, folded as the winged-helix-turn-helix architecture responsible for DNA recognition and binding, and a large C-terminal domain (350 residue on average) that belongs to the fold type-I pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes such aspartate aminotransferase. Data show the distribution of several structural characteristics of the linkers taken from bacterial species from five different phyla, namely Actinobacteria, Alpha-, Beta-, Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes.Interpretation and discussion of reported data refer to the article “Structural properties of the linkers connecting the N- and C- terminal domains in the MocR bacterial transcriptional regulators” (T.

The new data reveal variable enrichments of s- and r-process isotopes and demonstrate that several isotopically diverse presolar components are present in Murchison. The insoluble residue is enriched in s-process Mo and W, evidently due to the enrichment of presolar SiC grains. In contrast, Mo and W released by leaching with weak acids are depleted in s-process isotopes, most likely reflecting the isotope composition of the homogenized portion of the protosolar nebula. The Mo and W isotope compositions of the different leach steps are broadly correlated as expected from s-process nucleosynthesis theory, indicating that Mo and W are presumably hosted in the same carriers. However, at the bulk meteorite scale, no nucleosynthetic W isotope anomalies have been identified (except for IVB iron meteorites) in spite of large Mo isotope heterogeneities among the same samples. This decoupling of Mo and W isotopes in bulk meteorites may reflect physical mixing of varying proportions of isotopically diverse presolar components with a “normal” solar nebula component. Due to the high W/Mo ratio and near-terrestrial W isotope composition of the latter, such mixing has no measurable effect on W isotopes, but results in large Mo isotope variations. Alternatively, thermal processes within the solar nebula imparted Mo isotope heterogeneity on an initially homogeneous mixture of presolar dust, while W was not affected. Removal of volatile Mo oxides during the thermal destruction of fragile presolar components would have created isotopically heterogeneous reservoirs of nebular dust. Accretion of meteorite parent bodies from such variably processed dust would thus result in Mo isotope heterogeneities at the bulk meteorite scale. Other elements such as Os and W were not or only slightly affected because they were more refractory during thermal processing and, therefore, remained isotopically homogeneous. Thermal processing of presolar dust within the solar nebula can thus account for both isotope heterogeneities observed for some elements and the lack of such isotopic heterogeneity for other elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3agrains 3aheat treatment 3aisotopes 3aleachates 3aleaching 3amixing 3amolybdenum 3aoxides1 aKleine, Thorsten1 aDauphas, Nicolas1 aWieler, Rainer0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 357-358 p.298-307dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.09.0483Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01781naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245004900205300001600254520088300270592002801153650001801181650001701199650001101216700001401227700001701241773009601258856008101354990002301435852000901458655001201467IND60091372720221120051029.0141103e20120822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009137272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2012.07.0092doi7 aPMC34437872pmcid7 a229479242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Y.-N.10aDynamics of the Primary Cilium in Shear Flow  ap. 629-639.  aIn this work, the equilibrium shape and dynamics of a primary cilium under flow are investigated by using both theoretical modeling and experiment. The cilium is modeled as an elastic beam that may undergo large deflection due to the hydrodynamic load. Equilibrium results show that the anchoring effects of the basal body on the cilium axoneme behave as a nonlinear rotational spring. Details of the rotational spring are elucidated by coupling the elastic beam with an elastic shell. We further study the dynamics of cilium under shear flow with the cilium base angle determined from the nonlinear rotational spring, and obtain good agreement in cilium bending and relaxing dynamics when comparing between modeling and experimental results. These results potentially shed light on the physics underlying the mechanosensitive ion channel transport through the ciliary membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrodynamics 3aion channels 3amodels1 aDowns, M.1 aJacobs, C.R.0 tBiophysical journal.g2012 Aug. 22, v. 103, no. 4 p.629-639dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.07.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01388naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245009100167300001400258520039500272592002800667650001400695650001600709651001000725653001700735653001400752653001200766653001300778653001600791653001000807700001700817700002000834773009400854856008100948852000901029655001201038IND60698922520221119115846.0210116e20160425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069892252DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.584.81292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Xiang-Xiang10aDescription of three new species of Arescon Walker (Hymenoptera, Mymaridae) from China  ap. 83-94.  aThree new species of Arescon Walker, 1846, Arescon gaoligongensis Jin & Li, sp. n., Arescon sparsiciliatus Jin & Li, sp. n. and Arescon stenopterus Jin & Li, sp. n. are described.

However, in CNTs reinforced Cu matrix composites, poor interface bonding due to the lack of wettability between CNTs and Cu matrix has become a bottleneck problem restricting the load-transfer capacity of CNTs. Different from the conventional thoughts of producing interfacial carbides by in-situ reaction with CNTs which will lead to deterioration of structural integrity of CNTs, a novel strategy is used by forming TiC on the surface of intact CNTs through solid phase reaction between the pre-milled CNTs and the Ti powders. The mechanical properties of the composites can be regulated by tailoring the morphology and amount of TiC decorated at the interface. Strong interfacial bonding achieved due to the specially designed interface structure which contributes to the dramatic improvement of strengthening efficiency of CNTs and benefits the plastic deformation of Cu matrix. Consequently, a simultaneous enhancement of tensile strength (281 MPa) and tensile elongation (20.1%) is achieved in the composite with TiC decorated at the interface, and a super high strengthening efficiency (135.8) is realized. The tactic used in our study can provide a reference for the preparation of other CNTs/MMCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrical conductivity 3aplastic deformation 3atensile strength 3awettability 0aCu matrix composite 0aInterface decoration 0aMechanical properties1 aTao, Jingmei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8533-33271 aLiu, Yichun1 aHu, Yong1 aBao, Rui1 aLi, Fengxian1 aFang, Dong1 aLi, Caiju1 aYi, Jianhong0 tCarbon.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 185 p.428-441dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.09.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245006900206300001600275520126900291592002801560650002001588650000901608650001601617650001501633650001401648650001901662650001101681650002001692650001201712651001301724653001001737653001301747653001601760653001001776653001601786653002001802700006901822700005701891700005701948773012202005856008202127852000902209655001202218IND60781298420221116161948.0220628e20210914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078129842DNAL7 a10.1017/S00306053210000772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaitae, Apinya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0086-250010aProtection of elephants and sustainable use of ivory in Thailand  ap. 601-608.  aThe Asian elephant Elephas maximus is of cultural significance for the Thai people. The development of legal protection for elephants in Thailand dates back to the 17th century, reflecting concerns about both human livelihoods and elephant conservation. The legal status of privately owned, captive elephants differs from that of wild individuals, with consequences for the lawful use of ivory from captive animals. Prior to 2015, the lack of comprehensive measures to control the Thai ivory market enabled the laundering of illegally sourced ivory in the country. The Thai government introduced legal reforms in 2015, imposing strict controls over the possession and domestic trade of ivory from captive Asian elephants, and aligning the protection of African elephants and their ivory with CITES regulations. Nonetheless, the sustainable use of Thai ivory remains disputed, and international pressure to close the commercial trade in domestic ivory persists. Here we review this complex situation, aiming to inform future reforms. Consolidation of laws related to elephants and ivory would facilitate law enforcement and compliance. Use of an electronic database would improve the monitoring of ivory movements and aid the implementation and enforcement of laws.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephas maximus 3aOryx 3aThai people 3acompliance 3adatabases 3adomestic trade 3ahumans 3alaw enforcement 3amarkets 3aThailand 0aCITES 0aelephant 0aenforcement 0aivory 0alivelihoods 0asustainable use1 aGordon, I.

However, the lack of practical synthesis techniques for enabling highly efficient ORR performance hinders the go-ahead of robust carbocatalysts. Here, we design and synthesize nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (N–CN-Fd) with abundant activate sites from Sterculia lychnophora via a brief freeze-drying technology. This universal route promotes the specific surface areas, strengthens the degree of graphitization and increases the atom ratio of electron-donating groups of N–CN-Fd. The obtained N–CN-Fd displays an onset potential of 0.91 V, a half-wave potential of 0.79 V, and a limited-diffusion current density of 3.6 mA/cm² for ORR under alkaline conditions, comparable to commercial Pt/C. Meanwhile, a four-electron ORR pathway is revealed and N–CN-Fd maintains higher stability than Pt/C in chronoamperometric response. Moreover, the advantage of the N–CN-Fd catalyst in increasing the discharge-charge capacity and improving the cycling stability of the Li–O₂ battery is demonstrated. The theoretical calculation result illustrates that the abundant electron-donating surface groups on the samples able to accomplish the activation of ortho-C atoms, which endow N–CN-Fd the excellent ORR activity. Our findings provide guidelines for designing various carbon-based electrocatalysts with multiple active sites through freeze-drying crafts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLychnophora 3aSterculia 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3afreeze drying 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 0aCarbon nanosheets 0aSterculia lychnophora 0aFunctional group 0aFreeze-drying 0aOxygen reduction reaction1 aGuo, Huanhuan1 aWang, Zeming1 aBao, Hong1 aGao, Guanhui1 aHu, Bingjie1 aCi, Lijie1 aWang, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3771-46271 aWu, Minghong0 tCarbon.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 185 p.395-403dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.09.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245018100170300001600351520189100367592002802258650002002286650001802306650001002324650000802334650002002342650001202362650001002374650001402384650002202398650001002420651001202430700001702442700001702459700002002476700003002496700002402526773010802550856008202658990002302740852000902763655001202772IND60095231420221120174335.0141104e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009523142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2012.09.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPortnyagin, Maxim10aH₂O-rich melt inclusions in fayalitic olivine from Hekla volcano: Implications for phase relationships in silicic systems and driving forces of explosive volcanism on Iceland  ap. 337-346.  aSilicic Icelandic magmas are widely believed to contain low to moderate H₂O content prior to degassing, and that their high explosivity mostly results from the interaction of the magmas with ice or meteoric water. Here we report the compositions of glass inclusions (SiO₂=57–72wt%, K₂O=1.3–2.6wt%) in Fe-rich olivines (Fo₂–₄₂) from the largest Holocene eruptions of Hekla volcano (H3 and H4) on Iceland, which preserved quenched melts with very high primary H₂O contents (3.3–6.2wt%). The silicic Hekla melts originate primarily by extensive (∼90%) crystal fractionation of H₂O-poor (∼0.6wt%) basalts and represent an end member in the systematics of terrestrial magmas because they originate at low fO₂ (ΔQFM ∼−0.1 to −0.4) and have as high H₂O contents as significantly more oxidized island-arc magmas (ΔQFM≥1). This demonstrates that H₂O and ΔQFM do not correlate in silicic magmas from different tectonic settings, and that fO₂, not H₂O content, shows a major difference between silicic ocean-island (e.g., Icelandic) and island-arc magmas. Analysis of available experimental data suggests that high H₂O activity and low fO₂ expand the field of olivine stability in silicic melts. Low fO₂ and low MgO content could also suppress crystallization of amphibole. On the basis of these results we propose that an anhydrous mineral assemblage bearing Fe-rich olivine in evolved volcanic and Skaergaard-type intrusive rocks does not imply low H₂O in magmas prior to degassing but, in contrast to the commonly held view, is an indicator of H₂O-rich silicic parental magmas crystallized at low fO₂. Finally, the high H₂O content in magma was a major driving force of the largest explosive eruptions of Hekla volcano and must be at least as important for driving silicic explosive volcanism on Iceland as magma–ice interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3afractionation 3aglass 3aice 3amagnesium oxide 3amelting 3arocks 3atectonics 3avolcanic activity 3awater 3aIceland1 aHoernle, Kaj1 aStorm, Sonja1 aMironov, Nikita1 avan den Bogaard, Christel1 aBotcharnikov, Roman0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 357-358 p.337-346dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.09.0473Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01604naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245007800172300001600250520062300266592002800889650002100917650001100938650001800949650001000967653001700977653002200994653002701016700002501043700002701068773009301095856008101188852000901269655001201278IND60724778820221122230026.0210124e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072477882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.08.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandanamudi, Anudeep10aData for chitin binding activity of Moringa seed resistant protein (MSRP)  ap. 335-337.  aChitin binding activity of moringa seed resistant protein (MSRP) isolated from defatted moringa seed flour was investigated in the present study “Characterization of soluble dietary fiber from Moringa oleifera seeds and its immunomodulatory effects” (S.

If an IDP could somehow be divided into smaller fragments and reconstructed later, theoretical and spectroscopic studies could probe its conformational variability in detail. Here, we used replica molecular-dynamics simulations and network theory to explore whether such a divide-and-conquer strategy is feasible for α-synuclein, a prototypical IDP. We characterized the conformational variability of α-synuclein by conducting >100 unbiased all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations, for a total of >10 μs of trajectories. In these simulations, α-synuclein formed a heterogeneous ensemble of collapsed coil states in an aqueous environment. These states were stabilized by heterogeneous contacts between sequentially distant regions. We find that α-synuclein contains residual secondary structures in the collapsed states, and the heterogeneity in the collapsed state makes it feasible to split α-synuclein into sequentially contiguous minimally interacting fragments. This study reveals previously unknown characteristics of α-synuclein and provides a new (to our knowledge) approach for studying other IDPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3amolecular dynamics 3aproteins 3aspectroscopy1 aTian, Jianhui1 aVu, Dung M.1 aGnanakaran, S.0 tBiophysical journal.g2012 Aug. 22, v. 103, no. 4 p.748-757dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.06.0523Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013800166300001600304520074000320592002801060650001401088650003401102650002001136650000901156650003001165650001301195650000901208650002601217650001101243650002601254650001701280650002901297650001801326653001101344653002701355653001301382653001101395653002301406653001701429700001801446700002201464700001701486700002201503700001901525700001401544700001701558700002201575700002301597773009301620856008101713852000901794655001201803IND60724779020221122230124.0210124e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072477902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBildsoe, Heidi10aDataset of TWIST1-regulated genes in the cranial mesoderm and a transcriptome comparison of cranial mesoderm and cranial neural crest  ap. 372-375.  aThis article contains data related to the research article entitled “Transcriptional targets of TWIST1 in the cranial mesoderm regulate cell-matrix interactions and mesenchyme maintenance” by Bildsoe et al.

We present an efficient new method that allows for robust characterization of metalloproteins. It combines quantum mechanical (QM) description of the metal-containing active site, and extensive dynamics of the protein captured by discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) (QM/DMD). DMD samples the entire protein, including the backbone, and most of the active site, except for the immediate coordination region of the metal. QM operates on the part of the protein of electronic and chemical significance, which may include tens to hundreds of atoms. The breathing quantum-classical boundary provides a continuous mutual feedback between the two machineries. We test QM/DMD using the Fe-containing electron transporter protein, rubredoxin, and its three mutants as a model. QM/DMD can provide a reliable balanced description of metalloproteins’ structure, dynamics, and electronic structure in a reasonable amount of time. As an illustration of QM/DMD capabilities, we then predict the structure of the Ca²⁺ form of the enzyme catechol O-methyl transferase, which, unlike the native Mg²⁺ form, is catalytically inactive. The Mg²⁺ site is ochtahedral, but the Ca²⁺ is 7-coordinate and features the misalignment of the reacting parts of the system. The change is facilitated by the backbone adjustment. QM/DMD is ideal and fast for providing this level of structural insight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acalcium 3acatechol 3amagnesium 3ametalloproteins 3amethodology 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants1 aShirvanyants, David1 aDing, Feng1 aDokholyan, Nikolay V.,1 aAlexandrova, Anastassia N.0 tBiophysical journal.g2012 Aug. 22, v. 103, no. 4 p.767-776dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.06.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006300167300001600230520140700246592002801653650001501681650000901696650002401705650001001729650001401739651001001753700001801763773010801781856008201889990002301971852000901994655001202003IND60095231720221120174401.0141104e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009523172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2012.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWirth, Erin A.10aSmall-scale convection in the subduction zone mantle wedge  ap. 111-118.  aSmall-scale convection in the upper mantle can appreciably influence large-scale mantle dynamics and has important implications for geophysical observables such as seismic anisotropy and surface heat flow. We develop numerical models to evaluate the likelihood of small-scale convection in the mantle wedge above subducting slabs. The characteristics of small-scale convection are analyzed using the 3-D single-mode approximation, in which one characteristic wavenumber represents small-scale convective motions with rotational axes parallel to the convergence direction. Numerical simulations are run for a range of characteristic wavenumbers, Rayleigh numbers, and subduction parameters (e.g., slab dip angle, convergence velocity, and downgoing plate age). For each simulation, we quantify the excitation due to small-scale convection and determine under what conditions and characteristic wavenumbers this excitation is maximized. We find that of the parameters examined, mantle wedge viscosity plays the most significant role in dictating the occurrence and strength of small-scale convective motions in the mantle wedge. Numerical models run with subduction parameters similar to that of northeast Japan, where it has been proposed that small-scale convection may be occurring in the mantle wedge, require a mantle wedge viscosity of ∼10¹⁸Pas for significant small-scale convection to occur.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageophysics 3aheat 3amathematical models 3aslabs 3aviscosity 3aJapan1 aKorenaga, Jun0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 357-358 p.111-118dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.09.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245012200194300001800316500001500334520173400349592002802083650001202111650001002123650001002133650001602143650002002159650001502179650001602194650001002210650001402220650002602234650001902260650002002279650001902299650002302318650002602341650001002367650001802377650001302395650001502408650000902423650001802432653001402450653002002464653002502484653000902509653002702518700002302545700001602568700001702584700001802601700001702619773013802636856008202774852000902856655001202865IND60516321920221116145322.0190726e20150414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051632192DNAL7 a257165332pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145140044492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCantalapiedra-Hijar, G.10aDiet–animal fractionation of nitrogen stable isotopes reflects the efficiency of nitrogen assimilation in ruminants  ap. 1158-1169.  a2019-12-06  aThe natural abundance of ¹⁵N in animal proteins (δ¹⁵Nₐₙᵢₘₐₗ) is greater than that in the diet consumed by the animals (δ¹⁵Ndᵢₑₜ), with a discrimination factor (Δ¹⁵N = δ¹⁵Nₐₙᵢₘₐₗ− δ¹⁵Ndᵢₑₜ) that is known to vary according to nutritional conditions. The objectives of the present study were to test the hypothesis that Δ¹⁵N variations depend on the efficiency of nitrogen utilisation (ENU) in growing beef cattle, and to identify some of the physiological mechanisms responsible for this N isotopic fractionation in ruminants. Thus, we performed the regression of the Δ¹⁵N of plasma proteins obtained from thirty-five finishing beef cattle fed standard and non-conventional diets against different feed efficiency indices, including ENU. We also performed the regression of the Δ¹⁵N of different ruminant N pools (plasma and milk proteins, urine and faeces) against different splanchnic N fluxes obtained from multi-catheterised lactating dairy cows. The Δ¹⁵N of plasma proteins was negatively correlated with feed efficiency indices in beef cattle, especially ENU (body protein gain/N intake) and efficiency of metabolisable protein (MP) utilisation (body protein gain/MP intake). Although Δ¹⁵N obtained from different N pools in dairy cows were all negatively correlated with ENU, the highest correlation was found when Δ¹⁵N was calculated from plasma proteins. Δ¹⁵N showed no correlation with urea-N recycling or rumen NH₃ absorption, but exhibited a strong correlation with liver urea synthesis and splanchnic amino acid metabolism, which points to a dominant role of splanchnic tissues in the present N isotopic fractionation study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3arumen 3aurine 3abeef cattle 3astable isotopes 3adairy cows 3acorrelation 3afeces 3afinishing 3aamino acid metabolism 3ablood proteins 3afeed conversion 3aprotein bodies 3asplanchnic tissues 3aisotope fractionation 3aliver 3amilk proteins 3anitrogen 3aabsorption 3aurea 3aurea nitrogen 0aRuminants 0aFeed efficiency 0aNitrogen utilisation 0adiet 0aIsotopic fractionation1 aOrtigues-Marty, I.1 aSepchat, B.1 aAgabriel, J.1 aHuneau, J.

Using 15 microsatellite loci, we analyzed parentage and population structure in 220 farmer selections of cacao from the Huallaga valley in Peruvian Amazon. A high level of allele richness and heterozygosity were detected in these selections. Coordination analysis showed that these farmer selections are mainly comprised of hybrids derived from Trinitario and Upper Amazon Forastero germplasm. Bayesian clustering analysis assigned 54 selections as Trinitario and 166 as Upper Amazon Forastero hybrids. Parentage analysis identified 15 international clones as probable parents for 96 farmer selections, which corresponded to a fraction of the known hybrid families disseminated in this region in the late 1980s. Combined analysis of demographic and molecular data revealed a significant spatial autocorrelation (r=0.235; P= 0.006) at short geographical distances (<5.0 km). This patch-like distribution of spatial heterogeneity suggests a significant “neighborhood effects” in seeds distribution or variety adoption, where closely related hybrid progenies were adopted in the neighboring farms or villages. The outcomes of this study indicate that in spite of the introgressions of exotic germplasm in the past, Upper Amazon Forastero is still the dominant component in the Huallaga valley of Peru. The high level of on-farm diversity can offer needed variability for participatory selection of superior clones in this low input, small-scale production system, where adaptability to specific environment is more preferred than in a high input, large scale production system. 3aBayesian theory 3aTheobroma bicolor 3aTheobroma cacao 3aalleles 3aautocorrelation 3aclones 3afarmers 3afarms 3agenetic variation 3ageographical variation 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3aheterozygosity 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aon-farm research 3aparentage 3aparents 3aplanning 3apopulation structure 3aseeds 3avillages 3aAmazonia 3aPeru1 aGardini, Enrique Arevalo1 aMotilal, Lambert A.1 aBaligar, Virupax1 aBailey, Bryan1 aZuñiga-Cernades, Luiz1 aArevalo-Arevalo, Carlos E.1 aMeinhardt, Lyndel0 tTropical plant biology.g2011 June, v. 4, no. 2 p.106-116wJournal:J000000159x1935-97567nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/589903Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12042-010-9064-z  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/262.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03618naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010200164300001600266520246000282592002802742650001102770650001202781650001102793650001902804650001602823650002002839650002402859650002302883650001002906651001702916651001802933700001502951700001602966700001602982773010802998856008203106990002303188852000903211655001203220IND60095231920221120174431.0141104e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009523192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2012.09.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChavrit, D.10aInfluence of magma ascent rate on carbon dioxide degassing at oceanic ridges: Message in a bubble  ap. 376-385.  aIn order to quantify the magma ascent rate beneath oceanic ridges, we propose a new method based on vesicle size distribution (VSD) and volatiles measurements (CO₂ and H₂O) on 65 fresh glasses from the global Mid-Ocean Ridge system. Comparisons of VSD between the main oceanic basins reveal that Mid-Ocean-Ridge-Basalts (MORB) from the Pacific Ocean have significantly higher bubble densities (148₋₁₂₄ ⁺⁷³⁹ bubbles/cm²) and initial population densities ln(n₀)=19.6±2.8cm⁻⁴ but lower vesicularities (∼0.1%). We determine the residence time of bubbles in the magma using the linear relationship between the logarithm of the density population and the vesicle diameters. Assuming a constant bubble growth rate (G=1.5×10⁻⁷cm/s), we suggest that the transit times of the magmas through the oceanic crust are shorter beneath Pacific ridges (∼2 h) than elsewhere (∼15 h). In addition, the CO₂ and H₂O contents of the studied glasses allow the carbon saturation pressure to be calculated. Pacific MORB display a significantly lower carbon dioxide saturation pressure (Pₛₐₜ=843₋₂₂₁ ⁺³⁰⁰bars) than Atlantic and Indian MORB (Pₛₐₜ=1898₋₈₂₇ ⁺¹⁴⁶⁶bars) but identical pressures of eruption (Pₑ∼310bars). Consequently, the distance traveled by bubbles from the vesiculation depth to the seafloor is shorter for the Pacific (∼1.9km) than for the Atlantic and Indian oceans (∼5.2km): the longer the transit time, the longer the distance traveled. A closer inspection of the data revealed that the decompression rate (dP/dt) varied from 5.0×10² to 2.3×10⁴Pa/s and correlated positively with the measured bubble densities (nb/m³) as expected from experimental data and numerical modeling. At the global scale, most of the Pacific samples are characterized by high ascent rates (0.25₋₀.₁₃ ⁺⁰.²⁶m/s) relative to those from the Atlantic (0.11₋₀.₀₆ ⁺⁰.¹⁵m/s) and the Indian samples (0.09₋₀.₀₃ ⁺⁰.⁰⁵m/s). However, at the local scale some samples from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 37 °N (where the reflections of seismic waves from crustal magma chamber have been observed) are not distinguishable from the Pacific data set having high ascent rates and large bubble densities. We suggest that the method presented in this study could be used to identify spots along the Mid-Oceanic-Ridge system where magma chambers are possibly present.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abubbles 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3amathematical models 3apopulation density 3awater 3aIndian Ocean 3aPacific Ocean1 aHumler, E.1 aMorizet, Y.1 aLaporte, D.0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 357-358 p.376-385dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.09.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245016700211300001600378520153500394592002801929650001501957650001201972650002001984650001702004650001302021650002402034650002402058650001702082650001602099653001702115653002202132653004102154653001602195653002002211700001802231700005802249700002702307700006002334773009002394856008502484852000902569655001202578IND60751790420221118141511.0211030e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075179042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.09.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurniawan, Darwin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4198-764110aMicroplasma nanoengineering of emission-tuneable colloidal nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots as smart environmental-responsive nanosensors and nanothermometers  ap. 501-513.  aNitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) with controlled emission properties are useful materials for fundamental research and applications. However, the scalable and sustainable production of NGQDs with defined nanostructures from biomass precursors remains elusive. Here a bottom-up microplasma synthesis of emission-controlled colloidal NGQDs used as the multifunctional nanosensors for temperature and selective metal ion sensing is demonstrated. The emission-tuneable NGQDs are synthesized by engineering the N-doping configurations and surface functional groups on the NGQDs surfaces by carefully controlling the plasma conditions and electrolyte chemistry. In situ optical emission and UV–Vis absorbance spectroscopy measurement reveals that the plasma-induced hydroxyl radicals and solvated electrons define the N-dopant configuration and surface functionalization of NGQDs, leading to emission-tuneable NGQDs. The emission-tuneable NGQDs are applied as multifunctional nanosensors for selective Fe³⁺, Cu²⁺, and Hg²⁺ detection revealing broad linear detection range (0.5–300 μM) and low limit of detection (LOD) of 47.9 nM for Hg²⁺ and sensitive temperature detection from 10 to 80 °C. The developed PL sensing method shows high throughput of 5000 detections per hour. Our work demonstrates the possibility of the plasma-enabled nanoengineering of NGQDs with controlled optical properties and a step towards sustainable and scalable synthesis of graphene nanomaterials from renewable bioresources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3abiomass 3adetection limit 3aelectrolytes 3agraphene 3arenewable resources 3asensors (equipment) 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 0aMicroplasmas 0aEmission-tuneable 0aNitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots 0aNanosensors 0aNanothermometer1 aWeng, Ren-Jie1 aSetiawan, Owen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6776-29881 aOstrikov, Kostya (Ken)1 aChiang, Wei-Hung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6350-66960 tCarbon.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 185 p.501-513dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.09.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03968naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009000165300001400255520177800269592002802047650001802075650001902093650003002112650001802142650001902160650001902179650001902198650001702217650001802234650002002252650002002272650000902292650001102301650002102312650001602333650001102349650001802360650000902378650001102387650001702398650002502415650002002440650002002460650001502480650001402495650002302509650001102532650002002543650001102563650001102574650001602585650001602601650001102617651003102628700002002659700001502679700001502694700001802709700001402727700001102741700002002752700001302772700001302785700001402798700001902812700001602831700001602847700001502863700001602878700002002894773011302914856008203027961002003109852000903129655001203138IND60589910220221119215755.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058991022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-017-2023-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHristov, A.N.10aClimate change effects on livestock in the Northeast US and strategies for adaptation  ap. 33-45.  aThe livestock industries are a major contributor to the economy of the northeastern United States. Climate models predict increased average maximum temperatures, days with temperatures exceeding 25 °C, and higher annual precipitation in the Northeast. These environmental changes combined with increased atmospheric CO₂ concentration are expected to either increase or decrease forage productivity depending on the crop, and may decrease protein content and forage digestibility. Winter damage to sensitive forage species may also increase. Predicted temperature increases are expected to reduce fertility in dairy cattle and heat stress-induced inflammation may limit energy available for productive functions. Additional loss in milk production due to decreased feed intake is estimated to be up to 1% of the projected annual milk production through 2100. The effects of climate change on the beef industry in the Northeast are expected to be minimal. Broiler production in the region may benefit from warmer winter and summer temperatures, but future housing will require greater insulation and ventilation fan capacity. Providing adequate housing and ventilation to offset climate changes will also be important for the layer industry and will likely increase the price of eggs. Climate change is expected to have an economic impact on the horse industry in the region through additional management of land and forage resources, building of shelters, and heat abatement at equine events. Increased temperatures and more intense storms will increase nutrient losses and gaseous emissions from animal manure. Uncertainties about how host animals, pathogens, and disease vectors will respond to climate change highlight the need for continued animal health monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal health 3aanimal manures 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abeef industry 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adairy cattle 3adigestibility 3adisease vectors 3aeconomic impact 3aeggs 3aenergy 3afans (equipment) 3afeed intake 3aforage 3agas emissions 3aheat 3ahorses 3ainflammation 3ainsulating materials 3aland management 3amilk production 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3apoultry production 3aprices 3aprotein content 3astorms 3asummer 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3awinter 3aNortheastern United States1 aDegaetano, A.T.1 aRotz, C.A.1 aHoberg, E.1 aSkinner, R.H.1 aFelix, T.1 aLi, H.1 aPatterson, P.H.1 aRoth, G.1 aHall, M.1 aOtt, T.L.1 aBaumgard, L.H.1 aStaniar, W.1 aHulet, R.M.1 aDell, C.J.1 aBrito, A.F.1 aHollinger, D.Y.0 tClimatic change.g2018 Jan., v. 146, no. 1-2 p.33-45dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-2023-z3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FSUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245014500210300001600355520123300371592002801604650001501632650001801647650001001665650001101675650002501686700002501711700002001736700002601756700002601782773009601808856008101904990002301985852000902008655001202017IND60091373820221121231631.0141103e20120822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009137382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2012.07.0232doi7 aPMC34437812pmcid7 a229479252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Sangyoon J.10aDecoupling Substrate Stiffness, Spread Area, and Micropost Density: A Close Spatial Relationship between Traction Forces and Focal Adhesions  ap. 640-648.  aMechanical cues can influence the manner in which cells generate traction forces and form focal adhesions. The stiffness of a cell’s substrate and the available area on which it can spread can influence its generation of traction forces, but to what extent these factors are intertwined is unclear. In this study, we used microcontact printing and micropost arrays to control cell spreading, substrate stiffness, and post density to assess their effect on traction forces and focal adhesions. We find that both the spread area and the substrate stiffness influence traction forces in an independent manner, but these factors have opposite effects: cells on stiffer substrates produce higher average forces, whereas cells with larger spread areas generate lower average forces. We show that post density influences the generation of traction forces in a manner that is more dominant than the effect of spread area. Additionally, we observe that focal adhesions respond to spread area, substrate stiffness, and post density in a manner that closely matches the trends seen for traction forces. This work supports the notion that traction forces and focal adhesions have a close relationship in their response to mechanical cues.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiophysics 3acell adhesion 3acells 3aforces 3atraction (mechanics)1 aBielawski, Kevin S.1 aTing, Lucas H.1 aRodriguez, Marita L.1 aSniadecki, Nathan J.,0 tBiophysical journal.g2012 Aug. 22, v. 103, no. 4 p.640-648dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.07.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01655naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245007200172300001800244520072400262592002800986650002301014650001101037650000901048650001301057650001101070650001801081700001701099700002301116773010801139856008501247852000901332655001201341IND60538361620221117234918.0160815e20160810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053836162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b003662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJordan, Abraham

This Review summarizes the synthesis, characterization, and key stoichiometric reactions of isolable or observable coinage metal hydrides. It discusses catalytic processes in which coinage metal hydrides are known or probable intermediates, and presents mechanistic studies of selected catalytic reactions. The purpose of this Review is to convey how developments in coinage metal hydride chemistry have led to new organic transformations, and how developments in catalysis have in turn inspired the synthesis of reactive new complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3agold 3ahydrides 3asilver 3astoichiometry1 aLalic, Gojko1 aSadighi, Joseph P.0 tChemical Reviews.g2016 Aug. 10, v. 116, no. 15 p.8318-8372dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.chemrev.6b003663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245012700161300001600288500001400304520175800318592002802076650001602104650001702120650001602137650002002153650001402173650001202187650001902199650003502218650001402253650002602267651001202293653001702305653001502322653001502337653002002352653001702372653001502389700002202404700002002426700002302446700002102469700001802490700001802508700002002526700001802546700003302564773009602597856008102693852000902774655001202783IND60698923520221119115836.0210116e20160426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069892352DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.585.80192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaes, Dirk12aA database on the distribution of butterflies (Lepidoptera) in northern Belgium (Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region)  ap. 143-156.  aNAL-light  aIn this data paper, we describe two datasets derived from two sources, which collectively represent the most complete overview of butterflies in Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region (northern Belgium).

It is derived from the database Vlinderdatabank at the INBO, which consists of (historical) collection and literature data (1830-2001), for which all butterfly specimens in institutional and available personal collections were digitized and all entomological and other relevant publications were checked for butterfly distribution data. It also contains observations and monitoring data for the period 1991-2014. The latter type were collected by a (small) butterfly monitoring network where butterflies were recorded using a standardized protocol. The second dataset (further referred to as the Natuurpunt dataset – http://doi.org/10.15468/ezfbee) contains 612,934 records of 63 species and is derived from the database http://waarnemingen.be, hosted at the nature conservation NGO Natuurpunt in collaboration with Stichting Natuurinformatie. This dataset contains butterfly observations by volunteers (citizen scientists), mainly since 2008. Together, these datasets currently contain a total of 1,374,594 records, which are georeferenced using the centroid of their respective 5 × 5 km² Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid cell.

The evaluation of the control properties and the design of the distillation systems were evaluated through the calculation of the condition number and the total annual cost of each design, respectively. Three distillation systems, including the direct sequence, the indirect sequence, and the dividing wall column along with three mixtures with representative ease of separation index (ESI) values and three different feed compositions, were studied. In addition, in a posterior stage to the optimization process, the Eco-indicator 99 for each design was estimated to quantify the environmental impact of the distillation systems. The results offer the trade-offs between the control properties and the design, which is shown through Pareto optimal solutions that enable selection of the solutions that establish the proper balances between both objectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3adistillation 3aengineering 3aenvironmental impact1 aSegovia-Hernández, Juan Gabriel,1 aPonce-Ortega, José María,0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 54, no. 49 p.12320-12330dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.5b016113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01732naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245007200205300001600277520078400293592002801077650000801105650003001113650001401143650001101157650001101168700001801179773009601197856008101293990002301374852000901397655001201406IND60091374020221121231643.0141103e20120822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009137402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2012.06.0482doi7 aPMC34437842pmcid7 a229479442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Zhi-Jie10aIon-Mediated RNA Structural Collapse: Effect of Spatial Confinement  ap. 827-836.  aRNAs are negatively charged molecules that reside in cellular environments with macromolecular crowding. Macromolecular confinement can influence the ion effects in RNA folding. In this work, using the recently developed tightly bound ion model for ion fluctuation and correlation, we investigate the effect of confinement on ion-mediated RNA structural collapse for a simple model system. We find that for both Na⁺ and Mg²⁺, the ion efficiencies in mediating structural collapse/folding are significantly enhanced by the structural confinement. This enhancement of ion efficiency is attributed to the decreased electrostatic free-energy difference between the compact conformation ensemble and the (restricted) extended conformation ensemble due to the spatial restriction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3acellular microenvironment 3amagnesium 3amodels 3asodium1 aChen, Shi-Jie0 tBiophysical journal.g2012 Aug. 22, v. 103, no. 4 p.827-836dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.06.0483Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245010500205300001600310520113500326592002801461650002401489650002401513650001101537650002501548650001701573650001901590650002201609650001201631650002201643650002001665650002101685651001801706700002001724700001901744700002201763700001801785700001601803773011501819856008201934961001902016852000902035655001202044IND60589910520221119220239.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058991052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-017-2046-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNulty, Steven1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4518-564610aTranslating national level forest service goals to local level land management: carbon sequestration  ap. 133-144.  aThe USDA Forest Service has many national level policies related to multiple use management. However, translating national policy to stand level forest management can be difficult. As an example of how a national policy can be put into action, we examined three case studies in which a desired future condition is evaluated at the national, region, and local scale. We chose to use carbon sequestration as the desired future condition because climate change has become a major area of concern during the last decade. Several studies have determined that the 193 million acres of US national forest land currently sequester 11 to 15% of the total carbon emitted as a nation. This paper provides a framework by which national scale strategies for maintaining or enhancing forest carbon sequestration is translated through regional considerations and local constraints in adaptive management practices. Although this framework used the carbon sequestration as a case study, this framework could be used with other national level priorities such as the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) or the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA Forest Service 3aadaptive management 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aforest management 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3aland management 3anational forests 3aUnited States1 aTreasure, Emrys1 aJennings, Lisa1 aMeriwether, David1 aHarris, David1 aArndt, Paul0 tClimatic change.g2018 Jan., v. 146, no. 1-2 p.133-144dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-2046-53Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/RDUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245013900163300002000302520133500322592002801657650001501685650002201700650001101722650001101733650001401744650002101758650001601779650002001795650002301815650001701838650001401855650001601869700002001885700001401905700002001919700001501939773013601954856008202090852000902172655001202181IND60538362120221117234915.0160815e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053836212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.5b029882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Yulong10aSynthesis of New Benzotriazole Derivatives Containing Carbon Chains as the Corrosion Inhibitors for Copper in Sodium Chloride Solution  ap. 12242-12253.  aIn this study, a series of benzotriazole derivatives with various carbon chains (n = 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 16) were synthesized for the corrosion inhibition of copper in 3.5 wt % (wt %) NaCl solution. The corrosion inhibition efficiencies of these inhibitors in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution for copper were measured by various measurements including the polarization curves, the electrochemical impendence spectroscopy as well as the weight loss method. The inhibition mechanism of these new target molecules were analyzed by the plots of Tafel, Nyquist, and Bode. The corrosion inhibition effect was also evaluated by scanning the copper surface with an electron microscope. The results show that the corrosion of copper in chloride aqueous solution is efficiently inhibited by these new organic inhibitors. Furthermore, the corrosion inhibition efficiencies of the target inhibitors are shown to have much dependence on the carbon chain length attached to the molecular backbone. The inhibitor carrying a 7-carbon chain displays the greatest inhibition efficiency as large as ∼98% at 0.15 mM, while even the poorest inhibitor containing a 2-carbon chain shows ∼60% inhibition efficiency. The adsorption of these new inhibitors on copper was further revealed by analysis of Langmuir isotherms and quantum chemical calculations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon 3acopper 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3aengineering 3asodium chloride 3asorption isotherms 3aspectroscopy 3atriazoles 3aweight loss1 aWang, Zhenqiang1 aGao, Fang1 aZhang, Shengtao1 aLi, Hongru0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 54, no. 49 p.12242-12253dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.5b029883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002700188245010000215300001600315520146600331592002801797650001501825650002301840650000901863650001401872650001401886650001101900650001901911650001701930650001301947700001801960700002501978700001802003700002602021773009602047856008102143990002302224852000902247655001202256IND60091368020221120114154.0141103e20120718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009136802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2012.05.0312doi7 aPMC34007702pmcid7 a228539092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolling, Derrick R.J.10aWhat Are the Oxidation States of Manganese Required To Catalyze Photosynthetic Water Oxidation?  ap. 313-322.  aPhotosynthetic O₂ production from water is catalyzed by a cluster of four manganese ions and a tyrosine residue that comprise the redox-active components of the water-oxidizing complex (WOC) of photosystem II (PSII) in all known oxygenic phototrophs. Knowledge of the oxidation states is indispensable for understanding the fundamental principles of catalysis by PSII and the catalytic mechanism of the WOC. Previous spectroscopic studies and redox titrations predicted the net oxidation state of the S₀ state to be (Mnᴵᴵᴵ)₃Mnᴵⱽ. We have refined a previously developed photoassembly procedure that directly determines the number of oxidizing equivalents needed to assemble the Mn₄Ca core of WOC during photoassembly, starting from free Mnᴵᴵ and the Mn-depleted apo-WOC complex. This experiment entails counting the number of light flashes required to produce the first O₂ molecules during photoassembly. Unlike spectroscopic methods, this process does not require reference to synthetic model complexes. We find the number of photoassembly intermediates required to reach the lowest oxidation state of the WOC, S₀, to be three, indicating a net oxidation state three equivalents above four Mnᴵᴵ, formally (Mnᴵᴵᴵ)₃Mnᴵᴵ, whereas the O₂ releasing state, S₄, corresponds formally to (Mnᴵⱽ)₃Mnᴵᴵᴵ. The results from this study have major implications for proposed mechanisms of photosynthetic water oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautotrophs 3acatalytic activity 3aions 3amanganese 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphotosystem II 3aspectroscopy 3atyrosine1 aCox, Nicholas1 aAnanyev, Gennady M.1 aPace, Ron J.1 aDismukes, G. Charles0 tBiophysical journal.g2012 July 18, v. 103, no. 2 p.313-322dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.05.0313Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245009600211300001600307520121600323592002801539650000801567650002101575650002301596650001101619650002201630700002001652700002101672700001701693700001901710773009601729856008101825990002301906852000901929655001201938IND60091368120221120114151.0141103e20120718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009136812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2012.05.0502doi7 aPMC34007722pmcid7 a228539102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchöpflin, Robert10aProbing the Elasticity of DNA on Short Length Scales by Modeling Supercoiling under Tension  ap. 323-330.  aThe wormlike-chain (WLC) model is widely used to describe the energetics of DNA bending. Motivated by recent experiments, alternative, so-called subelastic chain models were proposed that predict a lower elastic energy of highly bent DNA conformations. Until now, no unambiguous verification of these models has been obtained because probing the elasticity of DNA on short length scales remains challenging. Here we investigate the limits of the WLC model using coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations to model the supercoiling of linear DNA molecules under tension. At a critical supercoiling density, the DNA extension decreases abruptly due to the sudden formation of a plectonemic structure. This buckling transition is caused by the large energy required to form the tightly bent end-loop of the plectoneme and should therefore provide a sensitive benchmark for model evaluation. Although simulations based on the WLC energetics could quantitatively reproduce the buckling measured in magnetic tweezers experiments, the buckling almost disappears for the tested linear subelastic chain model. Thus, our data support the validity of a harmonic bending potential even for small bending radii down to 3.5 nm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA conformation 3aMonte Carlo method 3aenergy 3asimulation models1 aBrutzer, Hergen1 aMüller, Oliver,1 aSeidel, Ralf1 aWedemann, Gero0 tBiophysical journal.g2012 July 18, v. 103, no. 2 p.323-330dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.05.0503Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008000164300001800244520107000262592002801332650001201360650001101372650001901383650001901402650001201421650000901433650001401442650001101456650005201467653001801519653001201537653001501549700001601564700001701580700001901597700001601616700001601632773009601648856008101744852000901825655001201834IND60724772920221120100459.0210124e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072477292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguettaz, E.10aData on calcium increases depending on stretch in dystrophic cardiomyocytes  ap. 1443-1447.  aIn this data article, intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration ([Ca²⁺]ᵢ) was measured in isolated ventricular Wild Type (WT) and mdx cardiomyocytes in two different conditions: at rest and during the application of an axial stretch.

In this mechanism, while the nascent peptide is still in the exit tunnel of the ribosome, it induces translational pausing, thereby controlling the expression of downstream genes. One example is SecM, which inhibits peptide-bond formation in the ribosome's peptidyl transferase center (PTC) during its own translation, upregulating the expression of the protein translocase SecA. Although biochemical experiments and cryo-electron microscopy data have led to the identification of some residues involved in SecM recognition, the full pathway of interacting residues that connect SecM to the PTC through the ribosome has not yet been conclusively established. Here, using the cryo-electron microscopy data, we derived the first (to our knowledge) atomic model of the SecM-stalled ribosome via molecular-dynamics flexible fitting, complete with P- and A-site tRNAs. Subsequently, we carried out simulations of native and mutated SecM-stalled ribosomes to investigate possible interaction pathways between a critical SecM residue, R163, and the PTC. In particular, the simulations reveal the role of SecM in altering the position of the tRNAs in the ribosome, and thus demonstrate how the presence of SecM in the exit tunnel induces stalling. Finally, steered molecular-dynamics simulations in which SecM was pulled toward the tunnel exit suggest how SecA interacting with SecM from outside the ribosome relieves stalling.  aPublisher supplied data 3agene expression 3agenes 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aprotein synthesis 3aribosomes 3atransfer RNA1 aSchreiner, Eduard1 aWilson, Daniel N.,1 aBeckmann, Roland1 aSchulten, K.q(Klaus),0 tBiophysical journal.g2012 July 18, v. 103, no. 2 p.331-341dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.06.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013700167300001400304520107800318592002801396596005101424596006701475596008601542650002001628650001501648650001901663650001301682650001701695650001501712650001501727650001401742650002001756650001201776650001601788650002001804700002201824700002501846700002701871700002301898773010201921856008102023852000902104655001202113IND60629673920221119012521.0190202e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062967392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-018-2000-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLutnicka, Hanna10aExposure to herbicide linuron results in alterations in hematological profile and stress biomarkers of common carp (Cyprinus carpio)  ap. 69-75.  aPhenylurea herbicides such as linuron are commonly applied in agriculture. Common carp juveniles were subjected to 31.5 µg/L of linuron for 14 days, and then to 30 days of purification. Peripheral blood was sampled after 1, 3, 7 and 14 days of exposure and 7, 14 and 30 days of purification and hematological parameters were evaluated: erythrocyte (RBCc) and leukocyte (WBCc) counts, hematocrit (Ht), hemoglobin concentration (Hb), mean cell volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and differential leukocyte count. For evaluation of cortisol and catecholamine concentrations blood was sampled after 3, 6 and 12 h, after 1, 3 and 14 days of exposure, and after 30 days of purification. Linuron caused mainly transient increase in RBCc, Ht and MCV values and increase in WBCc and percentage of juvenile neutrophils. The herbicide caused persistant increase of cortisol and catecholamine concentrations. The results indicate that exposure to low concentration of linuron induced a stress response in common carp.  aPublisher supplied data  aN N304 279440cNational Science Center, Poland  a---cUniversity Centre of Veterinary Medicine UJ-UA in Kraków  aDS 3263/ZWRiDZcDepartment of Veterinary Science, Animal Reproduction and Welfare 3aCyprinus carpio 3abiomarkers 3acatecholamines 3acortisol 3aerythrocytes 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3ajuveniles 3aleukocyte count 3alinuron 3aneutrophils 3astress response1 aBojarski, Bartosz1 aWiteska, Małgorzata1 aTombarkiewicz, Barbara1 aFormicki, Grzegorz0 tEcotoxicology.g2019 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.69-75dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-018-2000-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245007900201500001900280500002000299520203100319592002802350650001602378650001302394650001502407650001802422650001702440650000902457773012302466856007302589852000902662655001202671IND60733063820221120125011.0210402e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073306382DNAL7 a10.1111/ivb.123222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmer, A.

But concerns about the challenges and extra work of marking, and about plagiarism, often deter instructors from using them. I used a writing assignment successfully over 20 years in a one‐term invertebrate biology course, despite enrolments exceeding 100. Structured to maximally engage students yet minimize marking load, the assignment often yielded gems of stories for use in subsequent lectures. The Annotated Bibliography assignment asks students: (a) to précis the justification, main results, and significance of three papers from the primary scientific literature in under 250 words each, and (b) to provide a short (150 word) summary of the broader story connecting the three papers. Students liked this assignment because they could choose any aspect of the biology of any invertebrate genus. This inspired them to explore the literature out of personal interest. It's appealing for instructors, because annotations are compact and therefore easy to read, mark, and inspect for plagiarism. It is appealing to host universities, because it generates extensive use of library resources and motivates students to learn how to use them, and online taxonomic databases, effectively. Here I provide: (a) instructions for this assignment, (b) a straightforward marking rubric, (c) two examples of excellent submissions, and (d) comments on the risk and extent of plagiarism. Appendices provide: detailed instructions, a sample annotation with comments to guide student writing, an online submission web page, an online administrator web page, and PHP scripts for both web pages. Finally, I summarize topics and taxa from nearly 2,000 submissions. The five most popular taxa were cephalopods, insects, malacostracan crustaceans, gastropods, and arachnids. Although aspects of sex or reproduction, and camouflage or mimicry were the most popular topics, one paper on extreme limb movements in stomatopods was cited the most.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCephalopoda 3aInternet 3acamouflage 3ainvertebrates 3areproduction 3arisk0 tInvertebrate biology.g2021 Mar., v. 140, no. 1 p.e12322-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867081x1077-83067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ivb.123223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010600157300001600263500001900279520080400298592002801102650002201130650002401152650001601176650001801192650001901210650002001229650001801249650001601267650001301283653002701296653002001323653001801343653001901361700001701380700001401397700001901411700001601430773018201446856007401628852000901702655001201711IND60691973620221123034939.0200502e20020101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069197362DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.66.7902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTASAKI, Yuji10aGene Expression during Pᵢ Deficiency in Pholiota nameko: Accumulation of mRNAs for Two Transporters  ap. 790-800.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of Pᵢ deficiency on gene expression in Pholiota nameko were examined.

Our study aims to investigate the role of miR-1204 in ovarian squamous cell carcinoma. Expression of miR-1204 and glucose transporter 1 in ovarian biopsies and plasma of both OC patients and healthy controls was detected by qRT-PCR. Correlations between patients’ clinicopathological data were analyzed by Chi-square test. MiR-1204 overexpression OC cell lines were established. Expression of GLUT-1 protein was detected by western blot. Glucose uptake was measured by glucose uptake assay. Cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assay. We found that miR-1204 expression was significantly correlated with tumor size. Expression levels of miR-1204 and GLUT-1 were significantly high in OC patients. Expression levels of miR-1204 were positively correlated with expression levels of GLUT-1 in OC patients. MiR-1204 overexpression significantly promoted GLUT-1 expression, glucose uptake and cell proliferation. MiR-1204 may promote ovarian squamous cell carcinoma growth by increasing glucose uptake.  aThis work is supported by Henan province basic and frontier technology research project [No. 122300410409].  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 122300410409cHenan province basic and frontier technology 3aWestern blotting 3abiotechnology 3abreast neoplasms 3acell proliferation 3achi-square distribution 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3amicroRNA 3asquamous cell carcinoma 0aOvarian squamous cell carcinoma 0amiR-1204 0aglucose transporter 1 0aproliferation1 aGu, Xiaoli,1 aYang, Xiaozhuo1 aMeng, Yuejin0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 83, no. 1 p.123-128dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2018.15272083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015400167300001300321520181700334592002802151650001402179650001802193650001902211650001102230650001702241650001302258650001102271650001902282650001102301650001302312650001602325651002102341651001902362700001302381700001602394700002702410773010202437856008502539852000902624655001202633IND60540487520221122052035.0190318e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054048752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2013.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÁlvarez, M.10aMineralization of biogenic materials in the water masses of the South Atlantic Ocean. I: Assessment and results of an optimum multiparameter analysis  ap. 1-23.  aThis is the first of two manuscripts dealing with the circulation, mixing, ventilation and organic matter mineralization of the South Atlantic Ocean (SAO). The present work quantifies the complex mixing of water masses in the SAO using a constrained, least-squares regression, Optimum MultiParameter (OMP) analysis. The OMP based on temperature, salinity, silicate and the conservative parameter NO, was applied on two World Ocean Circulation (WOCE) lines, A17 and A14, in the western and eastern SAO, respectively. The constrained OMP sensitivity to sources of error in the end-member characteristics, measured parameters, equation weights and oxygen to nitrogen mineralization ratio (RN) was carefully assessed using perturbation tests. Perturbation of RN was the only test that changed significantly the mixing proportions although by less than 5%. The constrained OMP method allowed defining the realm and identifying the core-of-flow of each water mass to study its circulation, the evolution of its chemical composition and, eventually, to separate the contribution of physical and biogeochemical processes. Relevant specific outputs of this first manuscript are: (1) north of the South Equatorial Current, the silicate maximum is primarily composed of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) rather than Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW); (2) the two degree discontinuity (TDD) experiences a dramatic meridional change of water masses composition, being dominated by North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) north of the Vema Channel and by CDW southwards; (3) the 50% proportion horizon of Weddell Sea Deep Water (WDSW), with a θ of −0.3°C at the entry of the SAO, defines the upper limit of the WSDW realm more properly than the classical isopycnals of 46.04 or 46.06 σ4, where the proportion of WSDW is around 75%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aleast squares 3amineralization 3amixing 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3aoceans 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3asalinity 3atemperature 3aAntarctic region 3aAtlantic Ocean1 aBrea, S.1 aMercier, H.1 aÁlvarez-Salgado, X.A.0 tProgress in oceanography.g2014 Apr., v. 123 p.1-23dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2013.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007200168300001600240520119900256592002801455653001701483653001901500653002701519653001401546653001801560653001201578653002501590700002601615700001601641700003501657700001901692700001801711773011501729856008301844852000901927655001201936IND60128722820221118050009.0151116e20100217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012872282DNAL7 a10.1644/09-MAMM-A-033R.1.2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrigue, Claire10aMovements of satellite-monitored humpback whales from New Caledonia  ap. 109-115.  aKnowledge of the local and migratory movements of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) from New Caledonia is very limited. To investigate this topic, we attached satellite-monitored tags to 12 whales off southern New Caledonia. Tag longevity ranged from 1 to 52 days (X¯¯ == 22.5 days). Tagged whales generally moved to the south or southeast, with several spending time in a previously unknown seamount habitat named Antigonia before resuming movement, generally toward Norfolk Island or New Zealand. However, 1 female with a calf traveled the entire length of the western coast of New Caledonia (∼∼450 km) and then west in the direction of the Chesterfield Reefs, a 19th century American (““Yankee””) whaling ground. None of the New Caledonia whales traveled to or toward eastern Australia, which is broadly consistent with the low rate of interchange observed from photo-identification comparisons between these 2 areas. The connections between New Caledonia and New Zealand, together with the relatively low numbers of whales seen in these places generally, support the idea that whales from these 2 areas constitute a single population that remains small and unrecovered.  aPublisher supplied data 0adistribution 0ahumpback whale 0aMegaptera novaeangliae 0amigration 0aNew Caledonia 0aOceania 0asatellite monitoring1 aZerbini, Alexandre N.1 aGeyer, Ygor1 aHeide-Jøørgensen, Mads-Peter1 aHanaoka, Wakao1 aClapham, Phil0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2010 Feb. 17, v. 91, no. 1 p.109-115dAmerican Society of Mammalogistsx1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F09-MAMM-A-033R.1.3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010300161300001800264500002000282520169200302592002801994650004402022650002202066650001602088650001502104650002702119650002802146650002302174650002102197650004402218650002102262650001502283650002102298650001802319650001402337700002402351700002002375700002402395700002502419700006602444773013502510856007402645852000902719655001202728IND60649925820221121065106.0190709e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064992582DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.294142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaher, Deepak M.12aA new cardo bisphenol monomer containing pendant azido group and the resulting aromatic polyesters  ap. 1516-1526.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExpanding on our strategy to synthesize aromatic step‐growth polymers containing pendant clickable azido groups via functional monomer approach, we have now designed and synthesized a new cardo bisphenol, viz., 2‐(2‐azidoethyl)‐3, 3‐bis(4‐hydroxyphenyl) isoindolin‐1‐one (PPH‐N₃). PPH‐N₃ was conveniently synthesized starting from commercially available phenolphthalein by a three‐step route in an overall yield of 65% using simple organic transformations. Aromatic (co)polyesters bearing pendant azido groups were synthesized by low‐temperature solution polycondensation of PPH‐N₃ or different molar ratios of PPH‐N₃ and bisphenol‐A (BPA) with aromatic diacid chlorides in dry dichloromethane in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) as a base. The formation of medium to reasonably high‐molecular‐weight (co)polyesters was evidenced from intrinsic viscosity and number‐average molecular‐weight measurements that were in the range 0.52–0.85 dL/g and 16,700–28,200, respectively. Tough, transparent, and flexible films could be cast from chloroform solutions of these (co)polyesters. (Co)polyesters were characterized using FTIR, ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR spectroscopy, XRD, and TGA. The thermal curing reaction of (co)polyesters involving decomposition of azido groups was studied by DSC analysis. The chemical modification of a representative copolyester containing pendant azido groups was carried out quantitatively using catalyst‐free azide‐maleimide cycloaddition reaction with two maleimides, namely, N‐methylmaleimide and N‐hexylmaleimide. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Remotely-sensed techniques provide a unique way to obtain estimates over spatially extensive areas, but their application is limited by the spectral and temporal resolution available from these systems, which is often not suited to meet regional or local objectives. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as remote sensing platforms has recently gained increasing attention, but their applications in forestry are still at an experimental stage. In this study we described a methodology to obtain rapid and reliable estimates of forest canopy from a small UAV equipped with a commercial RGB camera. The red, green and blue digital numbers were converted to the green leaf algorithm (GLA) and to the CIE L*a*b* colour space to obtain estimates of canopy cover, foliage clumping and leaf area index (L) from aerial images. Canopy attributes were compared with in situ estimates obtained from two digital canopy photographic techniques (cover and fisheye photography). The method was tested in beech forests. UAV images accurately quantified canopy cover even in very dense stand conditions, despite a tendency to not detecting small within-crown gaps in aerial images, leading to a measurement of a quantity much closer to crown cover estimated from in situ cover photography. Estimates of L from UAV images significantly agreed with that obtained from fisheye images, but the accuracy of UAV estimates is influenced by the appropriate assumption of leaf angle distribution. We concluded that true colour UAV images can be effectively used to obtain rapid, cheap and meaningful estimates of forest canopy attributes at medium-large scales. UAV can combine the advantage of high resolution imagery with quick turnaround series, being therefore suitable for routine forest stand monitoring and real-time applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aalgorithms 3acameras 3acolor 3aforest canopy 3aforest stands 3aforestry 3aforests 3aleaf angle 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 0aDrone 0aSensefly eBee 0aCover photography 0aHemispherical photography 0aFagus sylvatica1 aDisperati, Leonardo1 aGuzzi, Donatella1 aBianchini, Daniele1 aNardino, Vanni1 aLastri, Cinzia1 aRindinella, Andrea1 aCorona, Piermaria0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2016 May, v. 47 p.60-68dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2015.12.005  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010800161300001600269500001400285520098100299592002801280650002601308650001501334650001801349650000901367650001001376650001401386650002101400653001601421653001501437700002201452700002401474700001701498700001801515700001701533700002201550773018201572856007401754852000901828655001201837IND60691974020221120210338.0200502e20020101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069197402DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.66.8282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTOMOYORI, Hiroko10aLymphatic Transport of Dietary Cholesterol Oxidation Products, Cholesterol and Triacylglycerols in Rats  ap. 828-834.  aNAL-light  aRats were fed on a diet containing 0.5% cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) or 0.5% cholesterol for 30 min, and their lymph was collected for 7 h. The amount of each of the individual oxysterols absorbed in the lymph depended on the ingested amounts, but the recovery was the highest for 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol (10.5%), this being followed by 7-ketocholesterol (5.8%), cholestanetriol (5.2%), 7β-hydroxycholesterol (4.8%), 7α-hydroxycholesterol (3.4%), 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol (2.2%), and 25-hydroxycholesterol (1.8%). A diet enriched with oxysterol, but not cholesterol, resulted in increased transport of triacylglycerols in the lymph. These results suggest that the absorption rate of oxysterols depends on the type, and indicate that the effect of dietary oxysterols on the lymphatic transport of triacylglycerols differs from that of dietary cholesterol. It therefore remains to be determined which oxysterol was responsible for the triacyglycerol transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3a25-hydroxycholesterol 3aabsorption 3abiotechnology 3adiet 3alymph 3aoxidation 3atriacylglycerols 0acholesterol 0aoxysterols1 aCARVAJAL, Octavio1 aNakayama, Masahiro,1 aKISHI, Taiji1 aSatō, Masao,1 aIkeda, Ikuo,1 aIMAIZUMI, Katsumi0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2002 Jan. 1, v. 66, no. 4 p.828-834dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.66.8283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245014200165520146500307592002801772650001201800650001301812650002401825650001501849650002301864650001001887650001701897650000701914650001601921650000901937650002401946650001301970651001001983653002701993653003202020653002402052653001802076700001602094700001602110773011402126856008602240852000902326655001202335IND60732833120221119114644.0220802e20210805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073283312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1257272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Danni10aField-scale studies on the change of soil microbial community structure and functions after stabilization at a chromium-contaminated site  aVarious remediation strategies have been developed to eliminate soil chromium (Cr) contamination which challenges the ecosystem and human health, and chemical stabilization is the most popular one. Limited work focuses on the change of soil microbial community and functions after chemical stabilization. The present study examined the diversity and structure of bacterial, fungal and archaeal communities in 20 soils from a Cr-contaminated site in China after chemical stabilization and ageing. Cr contamination significantly reduced microbial diversity and shaped microbial community structure. After chemical stabilization, bacterial and fungal communities had higher richness and evenness, whereas archaea behaved oppositely. Microbial community structure after stabilization were more similar to uncontaminated soils. Among all environmental variables, pH and Al explained 25.2% and 9.4% of the total variance of bacterial diversity, whereas the major variable affecting fungal community was pH (29.3%). Cr, organic matters, extractable-Al and moisture explained 25.8%, 22.4%, 9.9% and 9.9% of the total variance in archaeal community, respectively. This work for the first time unraveled the change of the whole soil microbial community structures and functions at Cr-contaminated sites after chemical stabilization on field scale and proved chemical stabilization as an effective approach to detoxicate Cr(VI) and recover microbial communities in soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3achromium 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3afungal communities 3afungi 3ahuman health 3apH 3aremediation 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3avariance 3aChina 0aChemical stabilization 0aChromium-contaminated soils 0aMicrobial community 0aSoil function1 aLi, Guanghe1 aZhang, Dayi0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Aug. 05, v. 415 p.125727-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1257273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03671naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245024200196300001500438500001900453500002000472520197500492592002802467650001402495650001602509650001002525650001302535650001802548650001802566650001502584650001602599650001402615650001302629650001402642650002202656650001202678651001002690700005902700700005502759700006102814700005602875700005602931773013202987856007303119852000903192655001203201IND60733064420221120125000.0210402e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073306442DNAL7 a10.1111/pre.124482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalas, Rafael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4688-057910aMorphological and molecular characterization of multiple new Azadinium strains revealed a high diversity of non‐toxigenic species of Amphidomataceae (Dinophyceae) including two new Azadinium species in Irish waters, North East Atlantic  ap. 88-115.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aShellfish contamination with azaspiracids (AZA), which are lipophilic marine biotoxins produced by marine dinoflagellates, is a major and recurrent problem for the Irish shellfish industry. AZA are produced by certain species of Amphidomataceae, but the species diversity of this group of microalgae in Irish waters is poorly known. Here we present a morphological and molecular characterization of multiple new strains of non‐toxigenic Azadinium isolated on an oceanographic survey in 2018. A lack of AZA production for all strains presented here was demonstrated by LC‐MS/MS analysis. One strain of Azadinium caudatum var. margalefii (first strain for the area) confirmed non‐toxigenicity of Atlantic populations of this species. One strain designated as Azadinium cf. zhuanum was similar to Az. zhuanum described from China but differed from the type strain in nucleus position, by the dominant number of apical plates, and by significant differences in rRNA gene sequences. Finally, two new non‐toxigenic Azadinium species are described from the North East Atlantic: Azadinium galwayense sp. nov. and Azadinium perfusorium sp. nov. Azadinium galwayense differed from other Azadinium by a characteristic combination regarding presence and location of the ventral pore (vp; on the right side of the pore plate), of a pyrenoid (located in the episome), and by a pentagonal shape of the median anterior intercalary plate 2a, and lack of contact between plates 1″ and 1a. Azadinium perfusorium shared the same vp position as Az. galwayense and differed by a characteristic combination of a pyrenoid located in the hyposome, a tetragonal shape of plate 2a, and a relatively large size of the two lateral anterior intercalary plates. Molecular phylogeny confirmed the distinctiveness of these two new species and their placement in Azadinium. The present findings significantly increased knowledge on the diversity of Azadinium species in the North East Atlantic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzadinium 3aazaspiracid 3agenes 3aindustry 3alipophilicity 3amarine toxins 3amicroalgae 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3ashellfish 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3aChina1 aTillmann, Urban1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8207-43821 aGu, Haifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2350-91711 aWietkamp, Stephan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7516-98611 aKrock, Bernd1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4022-91011 aClarke, Dave1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8122-51930 tPhycological research.g2021 Apr., v. 69, no. 2 p.88-115dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3867101x1322-08297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pre.124483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007400164300001200238500001900250520158300269592002801852596011501880650002201995650002302017650001302040650001802053650001002071650001902081650001502100650000902115650001102124650002502135650002102160650001102181650001602192700001402208700001302222700001602235700002402251700001502275700001402290773010902304856008202413852000902495655001202504IND60672063320221121234405.0191218e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067206332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-019-2504-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuan, Feishi10aGenetic mapping reveals a candidate gene for egusi seed in watermelon  ap. 182.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCitrullus mucosospermus (egusi watermelon) and Citrullus lanatus (dessert watermelon) are closely related subspecies. Variation in their seed coats underlies a key to understand the major differences in seeds between these two subspecies. Although the genetic model is understood, the candidate genes controlling the egusi seed trait in watermelon are unknown. In this study, a locus that controls the egusi seed trait, WEG6.1, which is located on chromosome 6 of the watermelon genome, was identified. A total of 195 polymorphic primers and 325 F₂ plants were used to construct a primary mapping population and linkage maps. A large population of 758 F₂ plants was used for fine mapping of the eg gene. The candidate gene was mapped to a 130.7 kb region on chromosome 6. Eleven genes were present within the corresponding region of the reference genome. All eleven candidate genes were sequenced, revealing that the CDS of the Cla007520 gene had a 3 bp deletion that resulted in the omission of one amino acid (serine) in C. mucosospermus. In addition, expression of the Cla007520 gene was highest at the early stage of seed formation, exhibiting a downward trend thereafter. The predicted protein of the Cla007520 gene belonged to the CPP protein family, and its amino acid constituents were similar to those of AtTSO1, which is associated with promoting integument cell proliferation in ovule development. This study revealed genes that facilitate the formation of egusi seed and might lead to a breakthrough in seed development and cultivated watermelon domestication.  aPublisher supplied data  aUNPYSCT- 2016136cUniversity Nursing Program for Young Scholars with Creative Talents in Heilongjiang Province 3aCitrullus lanatus 3acell proliferation 3adesserts 3adomestication 3agenes 3agenetic models 3aintegument 3aloci 3aovules 3aseed characteristics 3aseed development 3aserine 3awatermelons1 aFan, Chao1 aSun, Lei1 aCui, Haonan1 aAmanullah, Sikandar1 aTang, Lili1 aGao, Peng0 tEuphytica.g2019 Nov., v. 215, no. 11 p.182-182dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-019-2504-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008900167520109500256592002801351650002601379650001101405650001801416650003101434650000901465650001501474653002201489653002501511653003201536653003101568653002001599700001701619700001801636773009901654856008501753852000901838655001201847IND60780471520221122102225.0220929e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078047152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2022.1176262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Sheng12aA breakage matrix methodology to predict particle size evolution of calcareous sands  aBreakage-induced evolution of particle size distribution (PSD) will greatly affect the mechanical behavior of granular materials, and has been an important concern in geotechnical engineering. This paper presents a breakage matrix approach to investigate the evolution of PSD with detailed breakage information of each single-sized particles via conducting one-dimensional compression tests on dyed calcareous sands with different initial conditions. The breakage of each single-sized particles of soil samples with multi-sized particles under different initial conditions was analysed by the PCAS image recognition technologies. It has been found that the breakage-induced PSD of each single-sized particles of the soil samples tends to be fractally distributed, regardless of their initial PSDs. Furthermore, the degree of particle breakage of each single-sized particles is linearly related with the input work per unit volume. Finally, the proposed model establishes the breakage matrices of both uniform and gap-graded calcareous sands, which demonstrates its satisfactory performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3asoil 3atechnology 0aParticle breakage 0aDyed calcareous sand 0aOne-dimensional compression 0aParticle size distribution 0aBreakage matrix1 aWang, Jia-Lu1 aTong, Chen-Xi0 tPowder technology.g2022 July, v. 407 p.117626-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2022.1176263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245015300208300001800361500001900379520203200398592002802430650002002458650002202478650003702500650001102537650001102548650001302559650002102572650000902593650001102602650001402613650001002627650001302637650001102650700001702661700001302678700001802691700005502709773011902764856008702883852000902970655001202979IND60736636220221120154317.0210510e20210407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073663622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c043962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Weijiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0044-578510aThermal Transformation of Sulfur Species and Hydrogen Sulfide Formation in High-Pyrite-Containing Lacustrine Type-II Shale during Semiopen Pyrolysis  ap. 7778-7786.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe shale of the seventh member of the Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin (abbreviated as Chang 7 shale) is the most prospective shale for in situ conversion process. In our previous study, a series of artificial maturation experiments were conducted to simulate the hydrocarbon generation–retention–expulsion process. However, during the experiments, a large amount of hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) was generated along with hydrocarbon products. Therefore, in this study, a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and elemental analysis was used to reveal the thermal transformation of sulfur species and the formation process of H₂S. The results showed that kerogen decomposition and the corresponding products exert a strong influence on the transformation of organic sulfur and pyritic sulfur and, thus, on H₂S formation. Before the peak hydrocarbon-generating stage (<0.6% Rₒ, 340 °C), the H₂S yield was very low, primarily originating from organic sulfur in the kerogen. During the peak hydrocarbon generation and secondary cracking stage (0.6–1.24% Rₒ, 340–400 °C), the H₂S content showed an noticeable increase, and because the bulk atomic Sₒᵣg/C ratio remained relatively constant, the main source of H₂S changed from organic sulfur to inorganic sulfur. Kerogen decomposition, pyrite decomposition, and thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) reactions contributed to H₂S formation, whereas secondary pyrite formation consumed H₂S. When the hydrocarbon generation potential of kerogen was almost exhausted, H₂S exhibited an abnormally sharp increase, and little or no secondary pyrite was formed. The sulfur generated by pyrite decomposition partly formed H₂S and partly incorporated into the organic matrix of kerogen. Hydrogen radicals generated by kerogen decomposition and secondary oil cracking are proposed as the controlling factor in the initial pyrite decomposition of the Chang 7 shale under the present pyrolysis experimental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriassic period 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abasins 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aoils 3apyrite 3apyrolysis 3ashale 3asulfates 3asulfur1 aHou, Lianhua1 aLuo, Xia1 aLiu, Jinzhong1 aHan, Wenxue1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2313-15160 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Apr. 07, v. 35, no. 9 p.7778-7786dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c043963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245015600201300001600357500001900373500002000392520154700412592002801959650000801987650001001995650001902005650001002024650002102034650001402055650001502069650001402084650001302098651002002111700002402131700002402155700002302179700002202202773013302224856007302357852000902430655001202439IND60733064520221120124933.0210402e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073306452DNAL7 a10.1111/pre.124502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughey, Jeffery R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4053-915010aTaxonomic revisions based on genetic analysis of type specimens of Ulva conglobata, U. laetevirens, U. pertusa and U. spathulata (Ulvales, Chlorophyta)  ap. 148-153.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGenetic analysis of type material of various Ulva species has shown that many names have been misapplied. DNA sequences of two of the specimens on the lectotype sheet of U. australis from South Australia showed that U. australis is conspecific with specimens called U. pertusa from Japan. However, type material of U. pertusa has not been sequenced, nor have other type specimens with type localities in Japan and Australia, including U. conglobata f. conglobata and U. conglobata f. densa from the former, and U. laetevirens and U. spathulata from the latter. To determine if these names have been correctly applied, targeted DNA sequencing of the rbcL gene was performed on (i) the lectotype specimen of U. laetevirens, (ii) the lectotype and two syntype specimens of U. pertusa, (iii) the lectotype and two syntype specimens of U. congoblata f. conglobata and (iv) two specimens on the holotype sheet of U. conglobata f. densa. In addition, high‐throughput sequencing (HTS) analysis was carried out on an isotype specimen of U. spathulata. Phylogenetic analysis of the resulting rbcL gene sequences supports the taxonomic conclusions that U. laetevirens, U. pertusa and U. spathulata are synonyms of U. australis, and U. conglobata f. conglobata and U. conglobata f. densa represent a single separate and distinct species, U. conglobata. These genetic data contribute to the taxonomy of Ulva and further demonstrate that analyzing DNA from type material is the only currently known reliable method to correctly apply names in this genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aJapan 3aconspecificity 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3aholotypes 3alectotypes 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3aSouth Australia1 aGabrielson, Paul W.1 aMaggs, Christine A.1 aMineur, Frédéric1 aMiller, Kathy Ann0 tPhycological research.g2021 Apr., v. 69, no. 2 p.148-153dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3867101x1322-08297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pre.124503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03910naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100002000189245014500209300001600354506007600370520172000446592002802166596005502194596008202249596008702331506003702418650002202455650001402477650001202491650002302503650002402526650002202550650001302572650001402585650001802599650001602617650001502633650001302648650001702661650002402678650001002702650003502712650001102747651001702758700001902775700002302794700002102817700001902838700002102857700001902878700001802897700002202915700001902937700006102956700002003017773013103037856008303168852000903251655001203260IND60684845020221207134802.0220621e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068484502DNAL7 a321581372pmid7 aPMC70363932pmcid7 a10.1007/s12298-019-00740-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarim, Kumba Y.10aGenetic characterization of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) genotypes using agro-morphological and single nucleotide polymorphism markers  ap. 317-330.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDearth of information on extent of genetic variability in cassava limits the genetic improvement of cassava genotypes in Sierra Leone. The aim of this study was to assess the genetic diversity and relationships within 102 cassava genotypes using agro-morphological and single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Morphological classification based on qualitative traits categorized the germplasm into five different groups, whereas the quantitative trait set had four groups. The SNP markers classified the germplasm into three main cluster groups. A total of seven principal components (PCs) in the qualitative and four PCs in the quantitative trait sets accounted for 79.03% and 72.30% of the total genetic variation, respectively. Significant and positive correlations were observed between average yield per plant and harvest index (r = 0.76***), number of storage roots per plant and harvest index (r = 0.33*), height at first branching and harvest index (0.26*), number of storage roots per plant and average yield per plant (r = 0.58*), height at first branching and average yield per plant (r = 0.24*), length of leaf lobe and petiole length (r = 0.38*), number of leaf lobe and petiole length (r = 0.31*), width of leaf lobe and length of leaf lobe (r = 0.36*), number of leaf lobe and length of leaf lobe (r = 0.43*), starch content and dry matter content (r = 0.99***), number of leaf lobe and root dry matter (r = 0.30*), number of leaf lobe and starch content (r = 0.28*), and height at first branching and plant height (r = 0.45**). Findings are useful for conservation, management, short term recommendation for release and genetic improvement of the crop.  aPublisher supplied data  aPJ-2126cInternational Development Research Centre  aIDA Grant H654-SLcWest Africa Agricultural Productivity Program Sierra Leone  aJapan PHRD TF099510-SLcWest Africa Agricultural Productivity Program Sierra Leone0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aManihot esculenta 3abranching 3acassava 3adry matter content 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3aharvest index 3aleaf length 3aleaf width 3apetioles 3aplant height 3aquantitative traits 3aroots 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astarch 3aSierra Leone1 aIfie, Beatrice1 aDzidzienyo, Daniel1 aDanquah, Eric Y.1 aBlay, Essie T.1 aWhyte, Jim B.

Results show that metal doping can efficiently improve the adsorption of harmful algae and enhance the photocatalytic activities in inactivation of harmful algae and degradation of MC-LR. Among the CEG catalysts, Ni-CEG can achieve the highest removal rate up to 90.6% for algal cells with 5 h visible light irradiation, while Bi-CEG catalyst provides the best performance for MC-LR degradation with the removal rate of 80.9% in 6 h visible light irradiation. In general, considering the coexistence of algal cells and microcystin-LR, Bi-CEG is proved to be an excellent candidate for the remediation of eutrophicated waters since it can achieve the efficient removal of both harmful algae and MC-LR. DFT calculations indicate that metal doping can transform the photocatalysts into n-type semiconductor, and provide the mid-gap state. In addition, the partial charge density distribution near Fermi level was mainly composed by the metal dopants, which can enhance the interaction with harmful algae and MC-LR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aadsorption 3agraphene 3airradiation 3alight 3amicrocystin-LR 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aremediation 3asemiconductors 0aDoping 0aCarbon materials 0aPhotocatalysis 0aAlgae 0aMC-LR1 aWang, Xuejiang1 aMa, Rongrong1 aZhang, Jing1 aSong, Jingke1 aWang, Jun1 aChen, Fuming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0108-98310 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 416 p.125729-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1257293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009800168300001200266520124800278592002801526650001501554650001301569650001501582650001301597650001701610650001501627650003101642651001601673653002501689653001401714653002301728653001401751700003001765773014601795856004801941852000901989655001201998IND60778047920221119173331.0220523e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077804792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2016.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFokker, Peter A.10aInversion of double-difference measurements from optical leveling for the Groningen gas field  ap. 1-9.  aHydrocarbon extraction leads to compaction of the gas reservoir, which is visible on the surface as subsidence. Subsidence measurements therefore give information on the hydrocarbon extraction and can thus be used to better estimate uncertain reservoir parameters. Normally, optical height difference measurements are taken between benchmarks, adjusted and tested to arrive at estimated height differences (or subsequently, heights relative to a reference benchmark) and are differenced between epochs to arrive at subsidence estimates. These can subsequently be used in inversions for reservoir parameters. We have designed, implemented and applied a new algorithm that uses measured optical height differences directly in the geophysical inversion. This eliminates the problems introduced by insufficient knowledge of the full covariance matrix of the subsidence estimates. The procedure was applied to invert for compaction of the Groningen gas reservoir in the Netherlands. We used a linear inversion procedure to update an existing reservoir compaction field. This yielded areas of increased and reduced compaction relative to the existing compaction field, which correspond with observed discrepancies in porosity and aquifer activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aaquifers 3ageophysics 3aporosity 3aspatial data 3asubsidence 3avariance covariance matrix 3aNetherlands 0aReservoir compaction 0aInversion 0aDouble differences 0aGroningen1 aVan Thienen-Visser, Karin0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2016 July, v. 49 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2016.01.004  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245008600169300001600255520166900271592002801940650001401968650002301982650001902005650001902024650001602043650001102059650001302070650001602083650001802099650000902117650002802126650002702154650001902181650001502200650001202215653003402227653002902261653003402290653002502324653002302349653002002372653001802392653001502410700003102425700002102456700002302477700002002500773009202520856008402612852000902696655001202705IND60581794920221119044844.0180904e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058179492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrasco, Elisa10aSwitching on a transient endogenous ROS production in mammalian cells and tissues  ap. 180-189.  aThere is a growing interest in the physiological roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as essential components of molecular mechanisms regulating key cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. This interest has fostered the development of new molecular tools to localize and quantify ROS production in cultured cells and in whole living organisms. An equally important but often neglected aspect in the study of ROS biology is the development of accurate procedures to introduce a ROS source in the biological system under study. At present, this experimental requirement is solved in most cases by an external and systemic administration of ROS, usually hydrogen peroxide.We have previously shown that a photodynamic treatment based on the endogenous photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX and further irradiation of the target with adequate light source can be used to transiently switch on an in situ ROS production in human cultured keratinocytes and in mouse skin in vivo. Using this approach we reported that qualitatively low levels of ROS can activate cell proliferation in cultured cells and promote a transient and reversible hyperproliferative response in the skin, particularly, in the hair follicle stem cell niche, promoting physiological responses like acceleration of hair growth and supporting the notion that a local and transient ROS production can regulate stem cell function and tissue homeostasis in a whole organism. Our principal aim here is to provide a detailed description of this experimental methodology as a useful tool to investigate physiological roles for ROS in vivo in different experimental systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3acultured cells 3ahair follicles 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ahydrogen 3airradiation 3akeratinocytes 3amice 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aphysiological response 3aprotoporphyrin 3astem cells 3atissues 0aReactive oxygen species (ROS) 0aProtoporphyrin IX (PpIX) 0a5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) 0aPhotodynamic therapy 0aCell proliferation 0aSkin stem cells 0aHair follicle 0aSrc kinase1 aBlázquez-Castro, Alfonso,1 aCalvo, María I.1 aJuarranz, Ángeles1 aEspada, Jesús,0 tMethods.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 109 p.180-189dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012500157300001600282500001900298500002000317520131100337592002801648596002401676650001601700650001001716650001401726650001201740650001401752650001601766650001601782650001401798650001501812650001401827650001301841650001801854650000901872650001501881650003701896650001901933700006001952773013302012856007302145852000902218655001202227IND60733064620221120124907.0210402e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073306462DNAL7 a10.1111/pre.124522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokouchi, Koh10aParagymnodinium verecundum sp. nov.

The cells were 9.4–17.1 μm long and 5.7–13.6 μm wide and showed a benthic lifestyle. They possessed a sulcal extension‐like furrow on the episome, an eyespot, nematocysts and multiple chloroplasts with separated thylakoids. They ingested prey cells by engulfment, indicating a mixotrophic nutrition. These characters are shared with a known species of the genus Paragymnodinium, P. stigmaticum. However, unlike P. stigmaticum, P. verecundum showed negative phototaxis and possessed a pusule. Additional differences in the ultrastructure of the nematocysts and the flagellar apparatus indicated that these two dinoflagellates are different species. A phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated 18S and 28S ribosomal DNA sequences recovered P. verecundum in a robust clade of species of Paragymnodinium within the clade Gymnodinium sensu stricto. The sister to P. verecundum was P. stigmaticum, but they were clearly separated. Therefore, this dinoflagellate was concluded to be a new species in the genus Paragymnodinium.  aPublisher supplied data  cHokkaido University 3aGymnodinium 3aJapan 3aflagellum 3afurrows 3alifestyle 3anematocysts 3anew species 3anutrition 3aphototaxis 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3aribosomal DNA 3asand 3athylakoids 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure1 aHoriguchi, Takeo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6118-84600 tPhycological research.g2021 Apr., v. 69, no. 2 p.124-136dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3867101x1322-08297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pre.124523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04997naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014500167300001600312520319800328592002803526650002303554650005203577650001803629650001403647650001403661650002003675650001303695650001603708650001203724650001203736650001703748650001403765650001403779650001303793650001703806650003303823650001603856650001803872650001703890650001203907653000803919653001003927653001503937653000803952653001303960653001503973653002003988653001904008653002104027700002104048700001704069700002104086700005804107773012604165856008304291852000904374655001204383IND60722202920221118163759.0211219s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072220292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2020.12.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Abhinit10aExploiting cheminformatic and machine learning to navigate the available chemical space of potential small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2  ap. 424-438.  aThe current life-threatening and tenacious pandemic eruption of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a significant global hazard concerning high mortality rate, economic meltdown, and everyday life distress. The rapid spread of COVID-19 demands countermeasures to combat this deadly virus. Currently, there are no drugs approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19. Therefore, discovering small molecule therapeutics for treating COVID-19 infection is essential. So far, only a few small molecule inhibitors are reported for coronaviruses. There is a need to expand the small chemical space of coronaviruses inhibitors by adding potent and selective scaffolds with anti-COVID activity. In this context, the huge antiviral chemical space already available can be analysed using cheminformatic and machine learning to unearth new scaffolds. We created three specific datasets called “antiviral dataset” (N = 38,428) “drug-like antiviral dataset” (N = 20,963) and “anticorona dataset” (N = 433) for this purpose. We analyzed the 433 molecules of “anticorona dataset” for their scaffold diversity, physicochemical distributions, principal component analysis, activity cliffs, R-group decomposition, and scaffold mapping. The scaffold diversity of the “anticorona dataset” in terms of Murcko scaffold analysis demonstrates a thorough representation of diverse chemical scaffolds. However, physicochemical descriptor analysis and principal component analysis demonstrated negligible drug-like features for the “anticorona dataset” molecules. The “antiviral dataset” and “drug-like antiviral dataset” showed low scaffold diversity as measured by the Gini coefficient. The hierarchical clustering of the “antiviral dataset” against the “anticorona dataset” demonstrated little molecular similarity. We generated a library of frequent fragments and polypharmacological ligands targeting various essential viral proteins such as main protease, helicase, papain-like protease, and replicase polyprotein 1ab. Further structural and chemical features of the “anticorona dataset” were compared with SARS-CoV-2 repurposed drugs, FDA-approved drugs, natural products, and drugs currently in clinical trials. Using machine learning tool DCA (DMax Chemistry Assistant), we converted the “anticorona dataset” into an elegant hypothesis with significant functional biological relevance. Machine learning analysis uncovered that FDA approved drugs, Tizanidine HCl, Cefazolin, Raltegravir, Azilsartan, Acalabrutinib, Luliconazole, Sitagliptin, Meloxicam (Mobic), Succinyl sulfathiazole, Fluconazole, and Pranlukast could be repurposed as effective drugs for COVID-19. Fragment-based scaffold analysis and R-group decomposition uncovered pyrrolidine and the indole molecular scaffolds as the potent fragments for designing and synthesizing the novel drug-like molecules for targeting SARS-CoV-2. This comprehensive and systematic assessment of small-molecule viral therapeutics' entire chemical space realised critical insights to potentially privileged scaffolds that could aid in enrichment and rapid discovery of efficacious antiviral drugs for COVID-19.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3abiotechnology 3acefazolin 3achemistry 3adata collection 3adistress 3afluconazole 3aindoles 3aligands 3aluliconazole 3ameloxicam 3amortality 3apandemic 3apolyproteins 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproteinases 3asulfathiazole 3atherapeutics 3aviruses 0aWHO 0aCOVID 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aFDA 0aCOVID-19 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aRepurpose drugs 0aChemical space 0aGini coefficient1 aLoharch, Saurabh1 aKumar, Sunil1 aRinge, Rajesh P.1 aParkesh, Raman1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4096-654X0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2021, v. 19 p.424-438dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.12.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245012500150300001800275520122300293592002801516650002501544650001701569650001901586650001001605650001801615650001201633650001701645650001401662650001201676650000901688651001001697700001101707700001201718700001301730700001101743700001301754700001201767773011601779856007301895852000901968655001201977IND60112922420221122223019.0141111e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011292242DNAL7 a10.1111/ppa.122202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Y.10aSexual reproduction increases the possibility that Phytophthora capsici will develop resistance to dimethomorph in China  ap. 1365-1373.  aA total of 1511 isolates of Phytophthora capsici were collected from farms with no history of exposure to the carboxylic acid amide (CAA) fungicides in 32 provinces in China during 2006 to 2013. All 1511 isolates were assayed for mating type and 403 were assayed for sensitivity to dimethomorph (DMM) and metalaxyl. The DMM EC₅₀ values ranged from 0·126 to 0·339 μg mL⁻¹. Both A1 and A2 mating types were detected on the same farms in four provinces and with a 1:1 ratio. Most isolates were sensitive to metalaxyl but a few exhibited intermediate resistance or resistance to metalaxyl. The segregation of DMM resistance and sensitivity among 337 progeny obtained from hybridization or self‐crossing in vitro indicated that the resistance of P. capsici to DMM is controlled by two dominant genes. Eighteen progeny that were derived from hybridization differed in DMM sensitivity and in fitness. Some progeny were as fit as parental isolates. Given the distribution of mating types and therefore the potential for sexual reproduction, the control of resistance by two dominant genes, and the fitness of hybrid progeny, the risk of P. capsici populations developing DMM resistance in China is substantial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora capsici 3adimethomorph 3adominant genes 3afarms 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3amating types 3ametalaxyl 3aprogeny 3arisk 3aChina1 aHu, J.1 aCui, X.1 aShao, J.1 aLu, X.1 aMeng, Q.1 aLiu, X.0 tPlant pathology.g2014 Dec., v. 63, no. 6 p.1365-1373dBlackwell Scientific Publications, etc.x0032-08627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppa.122203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011700161300001800278500002000296520092100316592002801237596002801265596005201293650001501345650001501360650001701375650001101392650001201403650001901415650001301434650001201447650001301459650003401472650001201506700002501518700002201543700002301565700003901588700006201627773013501689856007401824852000901898655001201907IND60649926220221121094758.0190709e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064992622DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.294242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDujardin, Wouter10aCrosslinked Polyvinylnorbornene‐Based Membranes as a New Class of Solvent‐Resistant Nanofiltration Membranes  ap. 1593-1600.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSolvent resistant nanofiltration (SRNF) has received increasing attention since the turn of the century within energy‐ and waste‐efficient unit processes. This work explores the synthesis and characterization of crosslinked polynorbornenes for SRNF. A series of polyvinylnorbornene thin‐film composite membranes with increasing degree of crosslinking were prepared and tested for their SRNF performance in heptane, chloroform, and toluene. Sudan Black B (457 g mol⁻¹) was used as the solute. Then, 99% retention was achieved in heptane, 86% in chloroform, and 75% in toluene. It was further shown that the permeance and retention can be fine‐tuned in these solvents by controlling the extent of crosslinking. This work thus introduces the crosslinking of polynorbornenes as a promising material route for SRNF. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

The polymer, as well as the derived carbon molecular sieve membranes, have both shown excellent selectivity and solubility towards CO₂ gas molecules owing to a distribution of ultra-micropores and micro-pores. Molecular modelling has evolved as a powerful method to test the selectivity of the materials as well as develop novel materials for gas separations. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations, to develop a molecular model for 6FDA/BPDA-DAM polymer using a modified Dreiding force-field, to better understand the statistics and the structure of the pores in a melt configuration. A compression-decompression step, followed by repeated annealing cycles are performed to equilibrate the polymer melt. Our calculated bulk properties like density (1.328 g/cc), glass transition temperature (Tg = 698.7K), and average fractional free volume (FFV = 0.123) are in quantitative agreement with available experimental data. We use a combination of grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and isothermal isobaric (NPT) molecular dynamics simulations in order to obtain the CO₂ adsorption isotherm of the polymer matrix, which include matrix swelling effects. Solvent accessible surface area of different atom types, which form the pore interiors, reveal that the exposed oxygen and methyl carbon atoms have increased binding affinity towards CO₂. The simulated isotherms predict a higher loading of CO₂ when compared with the experimental data and we discuss possible origins for this deviation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aannealing 3aartificial membranes 3abinding capacity 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aglass transition temperature 3amelting 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular models 3aoxygen 3apolymers 3apyrolysis 3asimulation models 3asolubility 3asolvents 3asorption isotherms 3astatistics 3asurface area 0a6FDA/BPDA-DAM polymer 0aCarbon molecular sieve precursors 0aDreiding force-field 0aGrand canonical Monte Carlo simulation 0aCO2adsorption1 aKumar, Kishant1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2003-73081 aThakkar, Foram M.1 aPathak, Amar Deep1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4764-90881 aAyappa, K.Ganapathy1 aMaiti, Prabal K.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 613 p.118377-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1183773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245015300177300001400330520167200344592002802016650002302044650002902067650001502096650002102111650001102132650002802143650001502171650002002186650001102206650001002217650001202227650001202239650001502251650001402266650002102280650002202301650001102323650002202334650001002356653001802366653001502384653001602399653002202415653002102437653002902458653002202487700002402509700002802533700003002561773011202591856008602703852000902789655001202798IND60634005820221119233714.0190410e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063400582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Almeida, Maíra N.10aStudy of gamba grass as carbon source for cellulase production by Fusarium verticillioides and its application on sugarcane bagasse saccharification  ap. 33-43.  aGamba grass (Andropogon gayanus), a forage biomass, was used as carbon source for cellulases production by Fusarium verticillioides. A Plackett Burman design was employed to evaluate the effects of different factors over enzymatic production and two different media composition, M1 and M2, were found. In M1 media, endoglucanase and cellobiase activities were 6.5 and 0.39 U/mL, respectively. By another hand, the activities of endoglucanase and cellobiase in M2 conditions were 2.6 and 6.8 U/mL, respectively. Blends of these two extracts were tested on a sugarcane bagasse saccharification and M1 presented the best performance, indicating that higher ratios endoglucanase/cellobiase (12:1) improved sugarcane bagasse hydrolysis. Different dosages of protein (10, 20 and 40 mg/g of dry biomass) were tested intending to improve the hydrolysis performance of M1 extract. Saccharification rates of 43.4 and 73.1% were observed for glucan and xylan fractions respectively when 40 mg/g was used. Some non-productive factors such as enzyme adsorption, sugar inhibition and thermostability were evaluated to get a better understanding about saccharification bottlenecks related to Fusarium verticillioides enzymatic extract. This paper showed, for the first time, that gamba grass can be an efficient inductor for cellulase production in the endophytic fungus Fusarium verticillioides. It was also showed that, in Fusarium verticillioides, the induction of enzymes specialized on plant biomass degradation is highly dependent on carbon source concentration. Endoglucanase was mostly induced in middle concentrations while cellobiase is induced in high concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndropogon gayanus 3aFusarium verticillioides 3aadsorption 3abeta-glucosidase 3acarbon 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aendophytes 3aenzyme activity 3aforage 3afungi 3aglucans 3agrasses 3ahydrolysis 3aphytomass 3asaccharification 3asugarcane bagasse 3asugars 3athermal stability 3axylan 0aEndoglucanase 0aCellobiase 0aGamba grass 0aSugarcane bagasse 0aSaccharification 0aFusarium verticillioides 0aEnzyme production1 aFalkoski, Daniel L.1 aGuimarães, Valéria M.1 ade Rezende, Sebastião T.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 July, v. 133 p.33-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02033naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245006400159300001600223520096100239592002801200650001901228650002501247650002501272650001801297650001301315650003901328650002101367650002001388650001801408700002401426700001901450700001701469773010301486856007301589852000901662655001201671IND60691075620221118062949.0200427e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069107562DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.201622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorenzen, Johan10aMicroRNAs in diabetes and diabetes-associated complications  ap. 820-827.  aDiabetes mellitus due to its high prevalence and associated complications is a major socioeconomic health problem. Diabetes is characterized by multiple macro- and microvascular complications (e.g. diabetic nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, retinopathy). Research efforts aim to elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the disease process. MicroRNAs are endogenous small single stranded molecules regulating targets through mRNA cleavage or translational inhibition. MicroRNAs regulate many biological cellular functions and are often deregulated during diseases. The aim of the present article is to summarize the current knowledge of the impact of microRNAs on the development of diabetes and its associated complications including endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell dysfunction, diabetic cardiomyopathy, diabetic nephropathy, regulation of pancreatic beta cell function as well as skeletal muscle and hepatic involvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiomyopathy 3adiabetic nephropathy 3aislets of Langerhans 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3aretinal diseases 3askeletal muscle 3asmooth muscle1 aKumarswamy, Regalla1 aDangwal, Seema1 aThum, Thomas0 tRNA biology.g2012 June 1, v. 9, no. 6 p.820-827dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.201623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010400167300001600271520119200287592002801479650001501507650001701522650001401539650001001553650001901563650002401582650001401606650002601620650001101646650002601657650002101683650001801704650001501722650002401737650000901761650001301770650001401783653002301797653002101820653001301841653002601854653001301880653002401893700002401917700001601941700003601957773012501993856008202118852000902200655001202209IND60602361220221119072412.0180711e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060236122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilanova, Neus10aMultiple emulsions as soft templates for the synthesis of multifunctional silicone porous particles  ap. 235-243.  aMultiple emulsion templating is a versatile strategy for the synthesis of porous particles. The present work addresses the synthesis of multifunctional poly(dimethylsiloxane) porous particles using multiple water-in-oil-in-water emulsions as soft templates with an oil phase constituted by a crosslinkable poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) oil. Herewith, the impact of the viscosity of PDMS oil (i.e., molecular weight) on the properties of both the emulsion templates and the resulting particles was evaluated. The viscosity of PDMS oil has a strong effect on the size and polydispersity of the emulsion templates as well as on the mechanical properties of the derived particles. The elastic modulus can be tuned by mixing PDMS oils of different viscosities to form bimodal crosslinked networks. Iron oxide nanoparticles can be readily incorporated into the emulsion templates to provide additional functionalities to the silicone particles, such as magnetic separation or magnetic hyperthermia. The synthesized composite magnetic particles were found to be useful as recoverable absorbent materials (e.g., for oil spills) by taking advantage of their high buoyancy and high hydrophobicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3acrosslinking 3aemulsions 3afever 3ahydrophobicity 3amagnetic separation 3amagnetism 3amechanical properties 3amixing 3amodulus of elasticity 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3aoil spills 3aoil-water interface 3aoils 3asilicone 3aviscosity 0aMultiple emulsions 0aPorous particles 0aSilicone 0aMechanical properties 0aSwelling 0aMagnetic properties1 aKolen’ko, Yury V.1 aSolans, C.,1 aRodríguez-Abreu, C.q(Carlos),0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 437 p.235-243dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008100166300001600247520077100263592002801034650002301062650001201085650001301097650001201110650001801122650002201140650001401162650001001176650001701186650001601203653001301219653002001232653000901252653001701261653001101278700001901289700002001308700002001328773011901348856008601467852000901553655001201562IND60752919020221122010015.0211008e20210903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075291902DNAL7 a10.1080/03670244.2021.19262452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Soomi10aDisentangling the Relationship between Food Insecurity and Poor Sleep Health  ap. 580-595.  aThe COVID-19 pandemic has created disruptions in global and national food supply chains. Along with an increase in the unemployment rate, this resulted in a rise in food insecurity at the community-level, threatening individual and family well-being. Food insecurity is associated with inadequate nutrient intakes, weight gain, and psychological distress, including anxiety and depressive symptoms, all of which are known to affect sleep. Yet, little is known about whether and how food insecurity is associated with sleep health, a critical but underrecognized health outcome. This paper reviews literature describing associations between food insecurity and sleep, summarizes key findings based on proposed mechanisms, and discusses directions for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aanxiety 3adistress 3aecology 3afood security 3afood supply chain 3anutrition 3asleep 3aunemployment 3aweight gain 0aCOVID-19 0afood insecurity 0adiet 0asleep health 0astress1 aDeason, Karley1 aRancourt, Diana1 aGray, Heewon L.0 tEcology of food and nutrition.g2021 Sept. 03, v. 60, no. 5 p.580-595dRoutledgewJournal:jnl2815x1543-52377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03670244.2021.19262453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01984naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245011100189300001800300520083900318592002801157650002501185650002501210650001001235650003301245650001801278650001101296650001101307650001501318650002101333650002701354700002101381773009201402856008401494990002301578852000901601655001201610IND60087366920221118195049.0141102e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008736692DNAL7 a217239652pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2011.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Robert G.10aPredicting the glass transition temperature of bioactive glasses from their molecular chemical composition  ap. 3601-3605.  aA recently published paper (M.D. O’Donnell, Acta Biomaterialia 7 (2011) 2264–2269) suggests that it is possible to correlate the glass transition temperature (Tg) of bioactive glasses with their molar composition, based on iterative least-squares fitting of published Tg data. However, we show that the glass structure is an important parameter in determining Tg. Phase separation, local structural effects and components (intermediate oxides) which can switch their structural role in the glass network need to be taken into consideration, as they are likely to influence the glass transition temperature of bioactive glasses. Although the model suggested by O’Donnell works reasonably well for glasses within the composition range presented, it is oversimplified and fails for glasses outside certain compositional boundaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3achemical composition 3aglass 3aglass transition temperature 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aoxides 3aprediction 2aGlassxchemistry 2aTransition Temperature1 aBrauer, Delia S.0 tActa biomaterialia.g2011 Oct., v. 7, no. 10 p.3601-3605dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2011.06.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002000151245008600171300001800257520207000275592002802345650002202373650001602395650001002411650002502421650002702446650001102473650001302484650001102497650001302508650002102521650002502542650001602567650001902583650001102602650001302613650000902626650001702635650002002652650001902672700002102691700001702712700002102729773011502750856008702865961001302952852000902965655001202974IND4460729220221116153810.0150810e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446072922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2011.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEitel, Jan U.H.10aEarly season remote sensing of wheat nitrogen status using a green scanning laser  ap. 1338-1345.  aIn-season, spatially variable nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications in agricultural systems can help to maximize crop N use efficiency and minimize N losses via hydrological leaching, runoff, and atmospheric volatilization. N fertilizer management often relies upon measurements of crop spectral reflectance using ground-based optical on-the-go sensors or hand-held chlorophyll meters. However, soil background reflectance can confound on-the-go sensing, especially during early crop growth stages, and hand-held chlorophyll meters are impractical for spatially explicit mapping at the field scale. Scanning laser technology is available that measures the intensity of the reflected laser light plus height information within a mm-scale ground instantaneous field of view at a very high sampling rate (up to 50,000 pointss⁻¹ in this study). We examined the ability to quantify foliar N status of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using a green (532nm) terrestrial laser scanner during an early stem extension growth stage (Zadoks growth stage 3.2). Laser data were processed by (1) removing soil background returns based on laser-determined height information, (2) standardizing green laser intensity based on white-reference panel readings, and (3) filtering noisy laser returns from leaf edges based on a laser return intensity threshold value. The return intensity of the reflected green laser light more accurately (r²=0.68, RMSE=0.30μgg⁻¹) predicted foliar N concentration than conventional chlorophyll meter readings (r²=0.36, RMSE=0.41μgg⁻¹) and spectral indices measured by a ground optical on-the-go sensor (r²<0.41, RMSE>0.39μgg⁻¹). The results indicate that laser scanners are useful for measuring the N status of wheat during early growth stages, and provide justification for incorporating laser scanner based measurements into developing spatially-explicit estimates of foliar N during this critical growth period.

Tests lasted 24 h, and inhibitor concentration included 0, 10, 25 and 50 ppm. Results have shown that N,N-diethylaminedialkyldiamide is a good corrosion inhibitor that is physically adsorbed on to the steel by following a Langmuir adsorption isotherm to protect it. It affected both the anodic and cathodic reactions. Under dynamic conditions, the corrosion rate increased in both uninhibited and inhibited solutions because the mass transfer of reactants towards the metal surface is enhanced, and because the formed protective corrosion products layer is detached from the steel surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aavocado oil 3acarbon dioxide 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3afatty acids 3amass transfer 3asorption isotherms 3asteel 3asurfactants 0aGemini-surfactant 0aAvocado oil 0aCO2 corrosion1 aVazquez-Velez, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2154-01161 aGalicia-Aguilar, G.1 aCasales-Diaz, M.1 aLopez-Sesenes, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1528-63851 aGonzalez-Rodriguez, J.G.1 aMartinez-Gomez, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5934-31260 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 July, v. 133 p.203-211dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014500164300002000309520103800329592002801367650001801395650002401413650002101437650004401458650002201502650002301524650001101547650003701558650001101595650001201606650001101618650001201629650001801641650001501659650003301674650001901707650003501726650001301761650003701774700002001811700002601831700002101857700001601878700002901894700002801923773014901951856008102100852000902181655001202190IND60466325020221123010933.0151123e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046632502DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4919-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelu, Kuppan10aEvaluation of silver nanoparticles toxicity of Arachis hypogaea peel extracts and its larvicidal activity against malaria and dengue vectors  ap. 17769-17779.  aSilver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were successfully synthesised from aqueous silver nitrate using the extracts of Arachis hypogaea peels. The synthesised SNPs were characterized by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy analysis, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy analysis and high-resonance scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. AgNPs were well defined and measured 20 to 50 nm in size. The nanoparticles were crystallized with a face-centered cubic structure. Larvicidal activity of synthesised AgNPs from A. hypogaea peels was tested for their larvicidal activity against the fourth instar larvae of Aedes aegypti (Yellow fever), Anopheles stephensi (Human malaria). The results suggest that the synthesised AgNPs have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly resource for the control of A. aegypti and A. stephensi. This study provides the first report on the mosquito larvicidal activity of synthesised AgNPs from A. hypogaea peels against vectors of malaria and dengue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aAnopheles stephensi 3aArachis hypogaea 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aYellow fever virus 3adengue 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahumans 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amalaria 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver nitrate 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aElumalai, Devan1 aHemalatha, Periaswamy1 aJanaki, Arumugam1 aBabu, Muthu1 aHemavathi, Maduraiveeran1 aKaleena, Patheri Kunyil0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Nov., v. 22, no. 22 p.17769-17779dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4919-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002500180245007000205300001600275506007600291520122600367592002801593506003701621650000801658650002401666650002401690650002701714650002001741650002401761650002001785653001801805653001701823653001501840653001801855653002301873700001501896773010301911856007302014852000902087655001202096IND60691076020221207140724.0200427e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069107602DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.202062doi7 aPMC34957472pmcid7 a226178782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalpke, Alexander H.10aRNA mediated toll-like receptor stimulation in health and disease  ap. 828-842.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBesides their well known functions in storage and translation of information nucleic acids have emerged as a target of pattern recognition receptors that drive activation of innate immunity. Due to the paucity of building block monomers used in nucleic acids, discrimination of host and microbial nucleic acids as a means of self/foreign discrimination is a complicated task. Pattern recognition receptors rely on discrimination by sequence, structural features and spatial compartmentalization to differentiate microbial derived nucleic acids from host ones. Microbial nucleic acid detection is important for the sensing of infectious danger and initiating an immune response to microbial attack. Failures in the underlying recognitions systems can have severe consequences: thus, inefficient recognition of microbial nucleic acids may increase susceptibility to infectious diseases. On the other hand, excessive immune responses as a result of failed self/foreign discrimination are associated with autoimmune diseases. This review gives a general overview over the underlying concepts of nucleic acid sensing by Toll-like receptors. Within this general framework, we focus on bacterial RNA and synthetic RNA oligomers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aToll-like receptors 3aautoimmune diseases 3adisease susceptibility 3aimmune response 3ainfectious diseases 3ainnate immunity 0aNucleic acids 0aautoimmunity 0ainfections 0amodifications 0atoll-like receptor1 aHelm, Mark0 tRNA biology.g2012 June 1, v. 9, no. 6 p.828-842dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.202063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245009000161300001600251520133000267592002801597650001501625650001401640650003801654650002801692650001901720650001901739650000701758650001801765650002101783700001301804700001301817700001601830773009401846856007901940852000902019655001202028IND60439426820221120221453.0151024e199912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043942682DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10092517225982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDourado, F.10aEffect of cellulase adsorption on the surface and interfacial properties of cellulose  ap. 265-282.  aThe surface properties of several purified cellulose (Sigmacell 101, Sigmacell 20, Avicel pH 101, and Whatman CF 11) were characterised, before and after cellulase adsorption. The following techniques were used: thin-layer wicking (except for the cellulose Whatman), thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry (for all of the above celluloses). The results obtained from the calorimetric assays were consistent with those obtained from thin-layer wicking – Sigmacell 101, a more amorphous cellulose, was the least hydrophobic of the analysed celluloses, and had the highest specific heat of dehydration. The other celluloses showed less affinity for water molecules, as assessed by the two independent techniques. The adsorption of protein did not affect the amount of water adsorbed by Sigmacell 101. However, this water was more strongly adsorbed, since it had a higher specific heat of dehydration. The more crystalline celluloses adsorbed a greater amount of water, which was also more strongly bound after the treatment with cellulases. This effect was more significant for Whatman CF-11. Also, the more crystalline celluloses became slightly hydrophilic, following protein adsorption, as assessed by thin-layer wicking. However, this technique is not reliable when used with cellulase treated celluloses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3apH 3aspecific heat 3athermogravimetry1 aMota, M.1 aPala, H.1 aGama, F.

Pervaporation has not been commercialized for desalination applications because of its energy intensity. However, emerging processes such as hydraulic fracturing produce high total dissolved solids (>30–45 g L⁻¹) byproduct streams that exceed the operational limits of traditional reverse osmosis and could be treated by pervaporation. Here, we demonstrate free-standing pervaporation membranes with excellent permeance and high salt removal based on a partially sulfonated pentablock terpolymer with the tradename Nexar™. Pervaporation membranes were easily cast from this material with desalination performances comparable or superior to commercially available membranes. We found that the polymer degree of sulfonation and casting solvent polarity had a significant impact on the membranes’ water uptake but only a modest impact on the pervaporation desalination performance. Membranes with a degree of sulfonation of 52% (2.0 meq g⁻¹ IEC) and a casting solution composed of 50 wt% n-propanol and 50 wt% toluene achieved a water flux of 3.32 kg m⁻² h⁻¹ (permeance 135 kg m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹) with 99.5% salt removal in pervaporation from a 32 g L⁻¹ sodium chloride feed solution at room temperature. We demonstrated that dense, non-porous Nexar™ pervaporation membrane permeance and salt separation performance were superior to commercial pervaporation membranes and equivalent to commercial membrane distillation membranes, which have much larger pores. This study demonstrates that commercially available sulfonated pentablock terpolymers are excellent membranes for pervaporation desalination because of their ease of casting and excellent performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3aambient temperature 3aartificial membranes 3abyproducts 3acommercialization 3adesalination 3adistillation 3aenergy 3ahydraulic fracturing 3apervaporation 3apolymers 3areverse osmosis 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3asolvents 3astreams 3atoluene 3atotal dissolved solids 3avolatile organic compounds 3awater uptake 0aPervaporation 0aDesalination 0aSelf-assembled sulfonated pentablock terpolymers 0aSalt removal 0aPermeability1 aJain, Amit1 aMann, Stewart C.1 aYang, Yi1 aGreen, Matthew D.1 aWalker, W.

Excellent wastewater treatment performance was obtained in the combined system, which showed a high chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency of 95.8 % and completely eliminated most complex organics revealed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis revealed differences in the microbial community structures of the three reactors. Further identification of the microbial populations suggested that the presence of Lactobacillus and Prevotella in CSTR played an active role in the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). The most diverse microorganisms with analogous distribution patterns of different layers were observed in the EGSB reactor, and bacteria affiliated with Firmicutes, Synergistetes, and Thermotogae were associated with production of acetate and carbon dioxide/hydrogen, while all acetoclastic methanogens identified belonged to Methanosaetaceae. Overall, microorganisms associated with the ability to degrade cellulose, hemicellulose, and other biomass-derived organic carbons were observed in the combined system. The results presented herein will facilitate the development of an improved cellulosic ethanol production wastewater treatment system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3aMethanosaetaceae 3aPrevotella 3aacetates 3aaerobic digestion 3aanaerobic digestion 3abacteria 3abioethanol 3acarbon dioxide 3acellulose 3achemical oxygen demand 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aethanol production 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrogen 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3asludge 3avolatile fatty acids 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aYu, Yanling1 aZhu, Zebing1 aZhao, Wei1 aWang, Haiman1 aAmbuchi, John J.1 aFeng, Yujie0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Nov., v. 22, no. 22 p.17789-17798dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4938-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010400165300001400269520122000283592002801503650002401531650001601555650001201571650001301583650002501596650002201621650001201643650002001655650001301675650001601688653001601704653003001720653001901750653001801769700001301787700001601800700001901816700001501835700002501850700001201875773012301887856008202010852000902092655001202101IND60602361720221119072711.0180711e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060236172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wentai10aCarbon dots functionalized by organosilane with double-sided anchoring for nanomolar Hg2+ detection  ap. 28-34.  aSurface functional groups on carbon dots (CDs) play a critical role in defining their photoluminescence properties and functionalities. A new kind of organosilane-functionalized CDs (OS-CDs) were formed by a low temperature (150°C) solvothermal synthesis of citric acid in N-(β-aminoethyl)-γ-aminopropylmethyl-dimethoxysilane (AEAPMS). Uniquely, the as-synthesized OS-CDs have dual long chain functional groups with both NH2 and Si(OCH3)3 as terminal moieties. Double sided anchoring of AEAPMS on CDs occurs, facilitated by the water produced (and confined at the interface between CDs and solvent) when citric acid condenses into the carbon core. The resultant OS-CDs are multi-solvent dispersible, and more significantly, they exhibit excellent selectivity and sensitivity to Hg²⁺ with a linear detection range of 0–50nM and detection limit of 1.35nM. The sensitivity and selectivity to Hg²⁺ is preserved in highly complex fluids with a detection limit of 1.7nM in spiked 1M NaCl solution and a detection limit of 50nM in municipal wastewater effluent. The results show that the OS-CDs synthesised by the solvothermal method in AEAPMS may be used as an effective Hg²⁺ sensor in practical situations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon quantum dots 3acitric acid 3amercury 3amoieties 3amunicipal wastewater 3aphotoluminescence 3asilicon 3asodium chloride 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aCarbon dots 0aFluorescent nanoparticles 0aHg2+ detection 0aWater quality1 aKim, Tak1 aYan, Zifeng1 aZhu, Guangshan1 aCole, Ivan1 aNguyễn, Nam Trung,1 aLi, Qin0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 437 p.28-34dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03475naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245006500176300001600241520167700257536033701934592002802271650002802299650002002327650001602347650002802363650001102391650001202402650001502414650001702429650001802446650001102464650001202475650002002487650002402507650002002531653000902551653000902560653002502569653001502594700002502609700002602634700002802660700002502688700002102713773014002734856008602874852000902960655001202969IND60752919520221121235237.0211008e20211003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075291952DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2020.18005332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeung, Suey Shuk Yu,10aNutrient Intake and Muscle Measures in Geriatric Outpatients  ap. 589-597.  aLow muscle mass and muscle function are associated with adverse health outcomes in older adults. This study examined nutrient intake as a potential contributing factor for low muscle mass, muscle strength, and muscle power in geriatric outpatients. This cross-sectional study included geriatric outpatients (n = 58, 38 female) with a mean age of 77.2 ± 9.0 years referred to the Falls and Balance outpatient clinic between December 2017 and January 2019. Nutrient intake (macro- and micronutrients) was examined using a 3-day food diary. Energy-adjusted nutrient intake was calculated using the residual method. Sex-standardized muscle measures included muscle mass assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (skeletal muscle mass [SMM in kilograms], SMM index [SMM/height² in kg/m²], and SMM/body mass index), handgrip strength (muscle strength) assessed using a dynamometer, and chair-stand test (muscle power). Univariate linear regression analyses were used to examine the associations of nutrient intake with muscle measures adjusted for age and body weight. A Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple testing (p < 0.001). Higher energy, iodine, and folate intake were associated with higher muscle mass, and higher folate intake was associated with higher muscle strength (p < 0.05). After Bonferroni correction, none of the nutrient intakes remained statistically significant. None of the other nutrients was associated with muscle measures. Only a few nutrients were associated with muscle measures. Nutrient intake appears to be more related to muscle mass than muscle strength and muscle power in geriatric outpatients.  aThis work was supported by the PANINI program (no. 675003) from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie-Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement.

During this process, membranes are in-situ de-carbonated allowing the AEMs to reach their full OH‾ form, and therefore to measure their highest (true) OH‾ conductivity. The de-carbonation process in all the studied AEMs was also investigated. The time constant of the de-carbonation process τ was calculated and related to the membrane properties as well as to the de-carbonation dynamics. The time constant of the de-carbonation process was found to decrease with increasing current densities and decreasing the IEC of the membranes. This work provides unique and important data crucial to increasing the understanding of the main factors that may mitigate the de-carbonation process in AEMs to allow AEM fuel cells to be operated with ambient air.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanion-exchange membranes 3afuel cells 0aAnion exchange membrane 0aHydroxide conductivity 0aHydroxide diffusivity 0aDecarbonation1 aKubannek, Fabian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9513-01791 aKrewer, Ulrike1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5984-59351 aDekel, Dario R.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 612 p.118461-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1184613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009700160300001600257520123000273592002801503653001501531653001701546653001701563653001701580653001801597700002301615773012001638856007601758852000901834655001201843IND60125612520221118220754.0150428e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012561252DNAL7 a10.2112/SI61-001.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBego, Ferdinand10aEcotourism Opportunities and Challenges in Butrint, Albania, a Unique UNESCO and Ramsar Site  ap. 150-157.  aBEGO, F and MALLTEZI, J., 2011.

(ed.), MCRR3–2010 Conference Proceedings, Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue, No. 61, pp. 150–157. Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy, ISSN 0749–0208.This paper provides ecoturism opportunities in the Butrint National Park (BNP), designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1999 and Ramsar site in 2003. Geographical position, landscape and biodiversity combined with a very rich culture heritage makes the site the most frequented by foreign visitors in Albania. Other new opportunities to bring more visitors in outside of the summer touristic season, including birdwatching, walking trials, biking, scuba-diving are discussed. The paper raises concerns that the ecotourism opportunities are put at risk by a number of uncontrolled human activities, such as illegal urbanization and massive tourism, wetland reclamation, mining, irrational marine aquaculture, hunting, excessive grazing and fires. Finally, some recommendations on how to address these concerns and maximize potential for ecotourism development of this unique UNESCO and Ramsar Site in Albania are suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 0aecotourism 0aconservation 0ascuba-diving 0aguided tours 0abird watching1 aMalltezi, Jamarber0 tJournal of Coastal Research.g2011 Dec.,  p.150-157dThe Coastal Education and Research Foundationx1551-50367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2112%2FSI61-001.93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245018400160500001900344520132200363592002801685650002101713650001501734650001001749650001801759650001001777650001601787650000901803650001001812650002001822650001001842650002301852650002101875650001201896650003301908650001601941650001901957700002001976700003401996700001902030700002102049700002202070700002102092700001702113700002002130773012002150856007502270852000902345655001202354IND60738683620221120230421.0210524e20210423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073868362DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110512172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hyuk-Jun 10aImpact of Supplementary Microbial Additives Producing Antimicrobial Substances and Digestive Enzymes on Growth Performance, Blood Metabolites, and Fecal Microflora of Weaning Pigs  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study investigated the effects of microbial additives producing antimicrobial and digestive-enzyme activities on the growth performance, blood metabolites, and fecal microflora of weaning pigs from 21 to 42 d of age. A total of 144 weaning pigs (1:1 ratio of gilt and boar; 21 d of age; 7.40 ± 0.53 kg of average body weight) were randomly distributed into four supplementary levels of microbial additive (0 vs. 0.5 vs. 1.0 vs. 1.5% of fresh weight) with three pens of replication, consisting of 12 weaning pigs per pen. All weaning pigs were maintained with the same basal diet for 21 d. Blood and feces were subsampled at day 21. Feed efficiency tended to increase linearly (p = 0.069) with an increasing supplementation level. Insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and blood glucose presented a quadratic effect (p < 0.05) with an increasing supplementation level, and these blood metabolites were highest at the 1% supplementation level. Immunoglobulin G in blood increased linearly by (p < 0.05) increasing the supplementation level. Salmonella and Escherichia coli in feces were decreased linearly by (p < 0.05) increasing the supplementation level. In conclusion, supplementation of microbial additive at 1.0% improved the feed efficiency, blood metabolites, and fecal microflora of weaning pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3aboars 3abody weight 3adiet 3afeces 3afeed conversion 3agilts 3agrowth performance 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3ametabolites 3amicroorganisms1 aNoh, Hyeon-Tak 1 aParadhipta, Dimas  Hand Vidya1 aJoo, Young-Ho 1 aLee, Seong-Shin 1 aChoi, Jeong-Seok 1 aKim, Dong-Hyeon 1 aKim, Soo-Ki 1 aKim, Sam-Churl 0 tAnimals.g2021 Apr. 23, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110512173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04351naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009600167300001600263520245100279592002802730650002202758650002302780650002202803650002702825650001402852650001402866650002502880650002002905650001202925650002102937650001402958650001102972650001702983650001603000650001403016650001603030650002003046650002103066650001403087650001603101650001403117650001603131650002903147650001403176653001603190653001303206653001303219653001303232653001503245700002503260700002003285700001903305700002003324700004103344700002803385700001703413700002403430773014003454856008603594852000903680655001203689IND60752919620221120202333.0211008e20211003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075291962DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2020.18067582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVyas, Navya10aVitamin D in Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19: Current Perspective and Future Prospects  ap. 632-645.  aVitamin D deficiency (VDD) partly explains geographical differences in COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and mortality. VDD among African-Americans, diabetics, hypertensive, and aged populations possibly explain the higher death rate, aggravated by cocooning. Vitamin D is pleiotropic, mediating bone metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and immune functions, whereas VDD is associated with inflammatory reactions and immune dysfunction, predisposing individuals to severe infections. Vitamin D modulates innate and adaptive immunity via the expression of genes that code antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). And the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)14, the co-receptor for epidermal toll-like receptor (TLR)4. AMPs stimulate TLR2 in macrophages, increasing the conversion of vitamin D into its active form by cytochrome P450 27B1. Antiviral properties of vitamin D-induced AMPs can shift the polarization of the adaptive immune response from helper T cells (Th)1 to the more regulatory Th2 responses that suppress immune over-reactivity by preventing cytokine storm, which is already demonstrated during the Spanish flu episode. Vitamin D induces antiviral effects by both direct and indirect mechanisms via AMPs, immunomodulation, the interplay between major cellular and viral elements, induction of autophagy and apoptosis, variation of genetic and epigenetic factors. The crosstalk between vitamin D and intracellular signaling pathways may operate as a primary regulatory action on viral gene transcription. VDD may increase the likelihood of infection with enveloped viruses, including retrovirus, hepatitis, and dengue. Global data correlates severe VDD with COVID-19 associated coagulopathy, disrupted immune response and mortality, reduced platelet count, and prolonged prothrombin time, suggesting benefits from supplementation.Key teaching pointsVitamin D induces antiviral effects by direct and indirect mechanisms via AMPs, immunomodulation, induction of autophagy, etc. Epidemiology of VDD partly explains geographical differences in COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and mortality.

Many clinical trials are underway globally to delineate the role of vitamin D in both prevention and treatment of COVID-19.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aadaptive immunity 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3ablood platelet count 3abone metabolism 3acalcium 3acytochrome P-450 3acytokines 3adengue 3aepidemiology 3aepigenetics 3ahepatitis 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune response 3aimmunomodulation 3ainfluenza 3amacrophages 3amortality 3aprothrombin 3atranscription (genetics) 3avitamin D 0aCoronavirus 0aCOVID-19 0aimmunity 0apandemic 0aSARS-CoV-21 aKurian, Shilia Jacob1 aBagchi, Debasis1 aManu, Mohan K.1 aSaravu, Kavitha1 aUnnikrishnan, Mazhuvancherry Kesavan1 aMukhopadhyay, Chiranjay1 aRao, Mahadev1 aMiraj, Sonal Sekhar0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2021 Oct. 3, v. 40, no. 7 p.632-645dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33742x1541-10877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2020.18067583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152242014500169245011300314300001600427520187400443592002802317650001202345650001502357650001402372650002502386650002202411650002602433650001902459650002702478650001502505650000902520650001402529650001802543650001902561650001102580650001602591650001202607650001902619650001102638650001002649650001702659700002002676700001602696700002702712773010402739856005502843852000902898655001202907IND4467752920221122084231.0120418e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446775292DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01778.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVRANCKX, GUY10aMeta‐Análisis de la Susceptibilidad de Plantas Leñosas a la Pérdida de Diversidad Genética por Medio de la Fragmentación del Hábitat10aMeta‐Analysis of Susceptibility of Woody Plants to Loss of Genetic Diversity through Habitat Fragmentation  ap. 228-237.  aShrubs and trees are assumed less likely to lose genetic variation in response to habitat fragmentation because they have certain life‐history characteristics such as long lifespans and extensive pollen flow. To test this assumption, we conducted a meta‐analysis with data on 97 woody plant species derived from 98 studies of habitat fragmentation. We measured the weighted response of four different measures of population‐level genetic diversity to habitat fragmentation with Hedge's d and Spearman rank correlation. We tested whether the genetic response to habitat fragmentation was mediated by life‐history traits (longevity, pollination mode, and seed dispersal vector) and study characteristics (genetic marker and plant material used). For both tests of effect size habitat fragmentation was associated with a substantial decrease in expected heterozygosity, number of alleles, and percentage of polymorphic loci, whereas the population inbreeding coefficient was not associated with these measures. The largest proportion of variation among effect sizes was explained by pollination mechanism and by the age of the tissue (progeny or adult) that was genotyped. Our primary finding was that wind‐pollinated trees and shrubs appeared to be as likely to lose genetic variation as insect‐pollinated species, indicating that severe habitat fragmentation may lead to pollen limitation and limited gene flow. In comparison with results of previous meta‐analyses on mainly herbaceous species, we found trees and shrubs were as likely to have negative genetic responses to habitat fragmentation as herbaceous species. We also found that the genetic variation in offspring was generally less than that of adult trees, which is evidence of a genetic extinction debt and probably reflects the genetic diversity of the historical, less‐fragmented landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aextinction 3agene flow 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aheterozygosity 3ainbreeding coefficient 3alandscapes 3aloci 3alongevity 3ameta-analysis 3aplant genetics 3apollen 3apollen flow 3aprogeny 3aseed dispersal 3ashrubs 3atrees 3awoody plants1 aJACQUEMYN, HANS1 aMuys, Bart,1 aHonnay, O.q(Olivier),0 tConservation biology.g2012 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.228-237dBlackwell Publishing Incx0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01778.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245003900159300001600198520113800214592002801352650002001380650002801400650002401428650001801452650001901470650001401489650002901503653001301532653002401545653001001569653002201579700001801601700001601619773010301635856007301738852000901811655001201820IND60691076420221118062934.0200427e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069107642DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.203302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaicher, André10aTelomeres and disease: Enter TERRA  ap. 843-849.  aTelomere function is tightly regulated in order to maintain chromosomal stability. When telomeres become dysfunctional, the replicative capacity of cells diminishes and cellular senescence ensues. This can lead to impaired tissue replenishment and eventually degenerative disorders, referred to as telomere syndromes. Cancer can also develop as a result of the genomic instability associated with telomere dysfunction. TERRA (TElomeric Repeat containing RNA) is a long non-coding transcript that stems from sub-telomeric regions and continues into the telomeric tract and is therefore a hybrid of both sub-telomeric and telomeric sequence. In general, increased TERRA transcription is associated with telomere shortening and compromised telomere function. Here we will briefly outline the general principles behind telomere dysfunction-associated diseases. Furthermore, we will discuss the few known links that exist between telomere transcription (TERRA) and disease. Finally, we will speculate on how the understanding, and eventual manipulation, of TERRA transcription could potentially be used in terms of therapeutic strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell senescence 3achromosomal instability 3agenetic instability 3amessenger RNA 3anon-coding RNA 3atelomeres 3atranscription (genetics) 0atelomere 0agenomic instability 0aTERRA 0atelomere syndrome1 aKastner, Lisa1 aLuke, Brian0 tRNA biology.g2012 June 1, v. 9, no. 6 p.843-849dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.203303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012600170300001400296520195600310592002802266653001302294653001902307653001702326653002302343653001802366653001802384700002102402700002002423773013002443856008802573852000902661655001202670IND60125612720221118220705.0150428e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012561272DNAL7 a10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00063.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeccia, V.

The Río de la Plata estuary response to wind variability in synoptic timescale: salinity fields and salt wedge structure.The Río de la Plata estuary response to wind variability in a synoptic timescale is studied with the Estuarine, Coastal and Ocean Model forced by tides, runoff, and idealized winds. Ancillary conductivity, temperature, and depth data from synoptic oceanographic cruises are used to validate the conclusions derived from the simulations. Results show that the estuary's response to wind variability can be explained in terms of four characteristic patterns associated with winds that blow with a dominant component either along or across the estuary axis. Cross-estuary winds from the SW produce a northward displacement of the surface salinity front toward the Uruguayan coast and cause downwelling between Montevideo and Punta del Este. Reciprocally, under NE winds, the surface salinity front migrates to the SW and upwelling between Montevideo and Punta del Este occurs. Along-estuary winds with a downstream component produce a net outflow of continental surface waters and inflow of bottom shelf waters, resulting in an intensification of the stratification. In opposition, winds with an upstream component produce a weakening of the vertical structure. Stratification can be destroyed by strong or persistent SE winds, which are not frequent in the region, and it recovers in a relatively short period (10–15 days) after wind relaxation. Consequently, the salt wedge structure is observed in the Río de la Plata during most of the year. This implies that significant vertical mixing events producing exchanges of water and properties between the surface and the bottom waters occur only a few times a year. As a consequence, the Río de la Plata shows strong retentive features, favoring biota by retaining eggs and larvae—and favoring pollutant accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 0aModeling 0astratification 0awind forcing 0avertical structure 0a60°–54° W 0a37°–34° S1 aSimionato, C.

A case study methodology is used to examine KT at the organizational level of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. The study used purposeful sampling to select WIC informants from state WIC agencies to participate in semi-structured interviews about their individual experiences during the 2009 WIC regulation change process. Thematic coding of retrospective semi-structured interviews with key informants from WIC state agencies revealed key components of the state-level WIC regulation implementation process, and key constructs of Organizational Readiness for Knowledge Translation in the WIC program. WIC informants highlight that decisions made by WIC state agencies regarding how to appraise, synthesize, and adapt evidence or regulation change are constrained by the KT decisions made by federal agencies. WIC state agencies should assess their level of readiness for KT in terms of 1) innovation readiness; 2) personal readiness; and 3) institutional readiness. This WIC case study can help decision-makers to understand the KT process of implementing evidence-informed regulation changes, identify factors that could influence states’ ability to be prepared for implementing changes, and gauge “practicality” of future WIC regulation changes.  aThis work was completed as part of N.Z.’s DrPH dissertation.

These contaminants elicit biological responses in the exposed organisms. Proteomic analysis is a powerful tool in environmental toxicology by evidencing alterations in protein expression due to exposure to contaminants and by providing a useful framework for the development of new potential biomarkers. The aim of this study was to determine changes in protein expression signatures (PES) in the digestive gland of oysters Crassostrea gigas transplanted to two farming areas (LIS and RIB) and to one area contaminated by sanitary sewage (BUC) after 14 days of exposure. This species is one of the most cultivated molluscs in the world. The identified proteins are related to the cytoskeleton (CKAP5 and ACT2), ubiquitination pathway conjugation (UBE3C), G protein-coupled receptor and signal transduction (SVEP1), and cell cycle/division (CCNB3). CKAP5 showed higher expression in oysters kept at BUC in comparison with those kept at the farming areas, while ACT2, UBE3C, SVEP1, and CCNB3 were suppressed. The results suggest that these changes might lead to DNA damage, apoptosis, and interference with the immune system in oyster C. gigas exposed to sewage and give initial information on PES of C. gigas exposed to sanitary sewage, which can subsequently be useful in the development of more sensitive tools for biomonitoring coastal areas, particularly those devoted mainly to oyster farming activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aDNA damage 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aapoptosis 3abiomarkers 3acell cycle 3acoasts 3acytoskeleton 3aecotoxicology 3aeffluents 3afarming systems 3aimmune system 3aoyster culture 3aoysters 3aproteomics 3asewage 3asignal transduction 3aubiquitination1 aGomes, Tania,1 aCompany, Rui1 aMoraes, Roberta R.

Collagen-based skin substitutes are a promising treatment to promote wound healing by mimicking the native skin structure. Recently, collagen from marine organisms has gained interest as a source for producing biomaterials for skin regenerative strategies. This preliminary study aimed to describe the application of a collagen-based skin-like scaffold (CBSS), manufactured with collagen extracted from sea urchin food waste, to treat experimental skin wounds in a large animal. The wound-healing process was assessed over different time points by the means of clinical, histopathological, and molecular analysis. The CBSS treatment improved wound re-epithelialization along with cell proliferation, gene expression of growth factors (VEGF-A), and development of skin adnexa throughout the healing process. Furthermore, it regulated the gene expression of collagen type I and III, thus enhancing the maturation of the granulation tissue into a mature dermis without any signs of scarring as observed in untreated wounds.

The hydrolysis of sulfuric acid ester, RSO₄H, is effected to completion in pure acetone concentration (99–99.5%) at 45 °C for 3 h. The difference between the after-hydrolysis value and the zero-hydrolysis titer (in 90% acetone–water solutions) represents the amount of sulfuric acid liberated from the hydrolysis of sulfuric acid ester. The method is proved reliable for determining sulfuric acid ester in all types of unstabilized cellulose nitrates including those types containing low percentages of sulfuric acid ester such as the high-nitrogen content types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3acellulose 3ahydrolysis 3alead 3anitrates 3asulfuric acid 3atitration1 aHamed, W.0 tCellulose.g2000 Dec., v. 7, no. 4 p.337-345dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishersx0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10092869173423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011900169300001600288520108400304592002801388650001301416650002201429650001101451650001101462650001401473650002201487650000901509650001201518650002601530653003901556653003101595653003801626653002201664653001601686700001601702773014001718856008601858852000901944655001201953IND60752919920221120202102.0211008e20211003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075291992DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2020.18124512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker, Kelly10aAlzheimer’s Disease Warning Signs: Gender and Education Influence Modifiable Risk Factors—A Pilot Survey Study  ap. 583-588.  aThe aim of this research was to determine the relationships among diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease warning signs, and lifestyle factors such as fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity. Adults over the age of 50 (N = 147) responded to a survey about their health, family history, and experience of Alzheimer’s warning signs in the previous year. Pearson’s correlation revealed significant relationships between fruit and vegetable intake and education, gender, and physical activity. Alzheimer’s warning signs were associated with relatives having an Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis. Other results were nonsignificant. Diabetes impacts one-third of older adults in the United States and increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. This survey revealed that women, who are more at risk for Alzheimer’s disease, are less likely to engage in physical activity, a behavior that could decrease their risk. Similarly, those with higher education were more likely to consume colorful fruits and vegetables, potentially decreasing their risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes 3adisease diagnosis 3afruits 3agender 3alifestyle 3aphysical activity 3arisk 3asurveys 3avegetable consumption 0aAlzheimer’s disease risk factors 0afruit and vegetable intake 0aAlzheimer's disease warning signs 0ageneral nutrition 0agerontology1 aRhee, Yeong0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2021 Oct. 3, v. 40, no. 7 p.583-588dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33742x1541-10877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2020.18124513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245006300159300002000222520137600242592002801618650000801646650001701654650002301671650001101694650001201705650001101717650001301728650001301741650002201754700002101776700002101797773012101818856007501939852000902014655001202023IND60549947720180208000000.0160909e20121207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054994772DNAL7 a10.1021/jo302238u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadia, Conxita,10aSugar–Oligoamides: Synthesis of DNA Minor Groove Binders  ap. 10870-10881.  aSugar-oligoamides have been designed and synthesized as structurally simple carbohydrate-based ligands to study carbohydrate–minor groove DNA interactions. Here we report an efficient solution-phase synthetic strategy to obtain two broad families of sugar–oligoamides. The first type, structure vector A (-Py[Me]-γ-Py-Ind), has a methyl group present as a substituent on the nitrogen of pyrrole B, connected to the C terminal of the oligoamide fragment. The second type, structure vector B (-Py[(CH₂)₁₁OH]-γ-Py-Ind), has an alkyl chain present on the nitrogen of pyrrole B connected to the C terminal of the oligoamide fragment and has been designed to access to di- and multivalent sugar–oligoamides. By using sequential DIPC/HOBt coupling reactions, the oligoamide fragment -Py[R]-γ-Py-Ind has been constructed. The last coupling reaction between the anomeric amino sugar and the oligoamide fragment was carried out by activating the acid derivative as a BtO- ester, which has been performed by using TFFH. The isolated esters (BtO-Py[R]-γ-Py-Ind) were coupled with selected amino sugars using DIEA in DMF. The synthesis of two different selective model vectors (vector A (1) and vector B (2)) and two types of water-soluble sugar–oligoamide ligands, with vector A structure (compounds 3–7) and with vector B structure (compound 8), was carried out.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aamino sugars 3achemical reactions 3aesters 3aligands 3amodels 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3aorganic chemistry1 aSouard, Florence1 aVicent, Cristina0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2012 Dec. 07, v. 77, no. 23 p.10870-10881dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo302238u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245007900164300001600243520118600259592002801445650001501473650001401488650001201502650002101514650001501535650001801550650001101568650001001579650001601589650002101605650001901626650001601645650001401661650001501675700001901690700002101709773011201730856007901842852000901921655001201930IND60439427520221120221619.0151024e200012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043942752DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10092939242052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, M.G.10aCellulose Depolymerisation and Paper Properties in E. Globulus Kraft Pulps  ap. 359-368.  aThe aim of this work was to study the impact of cellulose depolymerisation on the beating potential and handsheet properties of the portuguese E. globulus kraft pulp. A homogeneous sample of eucalypt wood chips was cooked using different kraft pulping conditions (cooking temperatures and times, and sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphide concentrations) in order to obtain a wide variation for intrinsic viscosity of the pulps. In the range of industrial cooking conditions, this property was found to be linearly dependent on the effective alkali charge, for a given cooking time and temperature. Unbeaten and beaten (at 2000 rev. PFI) pulp properties were evaluated and the results confirm that the higher the pulp intrinsic viscosity the better the pulp beatability and the paper properties. However, the differences in the latter cannot be exclusively explained by the differences in viscosity, since pulps with the same viscosity may exhibit distinct papermaking potentials. It was then necessary to scan other pulp chemical characteristics that could also influence the development of paper properties such as lignin, pentosan content and polysaccharides relative composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3acellulose 3acooking 3adepolymerization 3akraft pulp 3akraft pulping 3alignin 3apaper 3apapermaking 3asodium hydroxide 3asodium sulfide 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awood chips1 aFerreira, P.J.1 aFigueiredo, M.M.0 tCellulose.g2000 Dec., v. 7, no. 4 p.359-368dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishersx0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10092939242053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245008100160300001600241500001500257520177800272592002802050650001702078650001302095650001202108650001502120650002402135650001402159650001602173650001502189650002602204650001902230650001202249653001202261653002302273653000902296653001102305653001402316653001802330653001602348653001102364773011502375856007502490852000902565655001202574IND60123723820221116191246.0150331e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012372382DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.14005642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerced, Amelia10aNovel insights on the structure and composition of pseudostomata of Sphagnum  ap. 329-335.  a2019-12-04  a• Premise of the study: The occurrence of stomata on sporophytes of mosses and hornworts is congruent with a single origin in land plants. Although true stomata are absent in early-divergent mosses, Sphagnum has specialized epidermal cells, pseudostomata, that partially separate but do not open to the inside. This research examined two competing hypotheses that explain the origin of pseudostomata: (1) they are modified stomata, or (2) they evolved from epidermal cells independently from stomata. • Methods: Capsule anatomy and ultrastructure of pseudostomata were studied using light and electron microscopy, including immunolocalization of pectins. • Key results: Cell walls in pseudostomata are thin, two-layered, and rich in pectins, similar to young moss stomata, including the presence of cuticle on exterior walls. Outer and ventral walls have a thick cuticle that suggests that initial separation of ventral walls involves cuticle deposition as in true stomata. Further mechanical separation between ventral walls does not form a pore and occurs as the capsule dries. • Conclusions: As in moss stomata, pseudostomata wall architecture and behavior facilitate capsule dehydration, shape change, and dehiscence, supporting a common function. The divergent structure and fate of pseudostomata may be explained by the retention of Sphagnum sporophytes within protective leaves until nearly mature. Ultrastructural and immunocytological data suggest that pseudostomata are related to stomata but do not conclusively support either hypothesis. Solving the relationship of early land plants is critical to understanding stomatal evolution. Pseudostomata are structurally and anatomically unique, but their relationship to true stomata remains to be determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aembryophytes 3aSphagnum 3apectins 3acell walls 3aelectron microscopy 3aevolution 3asporophytes 3adehiscence 3amosses and liverworts 3aultrastructure 3astomata 0acuticle 0aimmunolocalization 0amoss 0apectin 0acell wall 0apseudostomata 0aSphagnaceae 0aleaves0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2015 Mar., v. 102, no. 3 p.329-335dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.14005643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01972naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009400158300002000252520071100272592002800983650002201011650003801033650002101071650002001092650002201112650003701134700002901171700002001200700002701220700002201247700001601269700002101285700002501306700002201331700001601353773012101369856007501490852000901565655001201574IND60549948020171214000000.0160909e20121207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054994802DNAL7 a10.1021/jo302297j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Vega, Laura10aNonlinear Optical Thin Film Device from a Chiral Octopolar Phenylacetylene Liquid Crystal  ap. 10891-10896.  aA set of chiral discotic phenylacetylenes have been synthesized by 3-fold Sonogashira coupling between different ethynylbenzenes and triiodobenzenes.

Our objective was to characterize the eating duration (ED) over 10 d of clockwise rotating and to associate it with the intake of energy and macronutrients. Thirty male shift-workers from a mining company were evaluated over a complete rotation shift schedule of 10 consecutive days (2 d of morning shifts, 2 d of afternoon shifts, 24 h free-day, 2 d of night shifts, and three free days). ED was defined as the interval between the first meal after awaking and last meal before sleep onset. Sleep/wake periods and food intake were evaluated by actigraphy and 24 h recalls, respectively. Generalized models were used to analyze the variation in ED and its association with nutrient intake over the shift schedule. ED periods showed significant variations throughout shift rotation and were associated with energy intake. The highest energy intake (3410 ± 235 kcal) and longest ED (20.7 ± 1.2 h) were found on Day 5, the day between afternoon and night shifts, and a part of Day 6 (night shift), i.e., in the longest period of wakefulness and the shortest sleep duration (4.7 ± 0.3 h) (p < 0.05 for all). The lowest energy intake (1284 ± 125 kcal) and shortest ED (4.96 ± 0.7 h) (p < 0.05) occurred after the last night shift (Day 7). The balance between the percentage of macronutrients did not differ statistically between the ED periods. In general, longer periods of wakefulness showed greater energy intake, demonstrating the tendency of workers to eat around the clock during their shift. Even with the energy intake variation, the balance of macronutrients remained the same over the ED periods. Despite the need of confirmation in future studies, these results suggest that the management of ED period could be considered in the nutritional approach of shift workers.  aThis work was supported by the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); and the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) (88882.429139/2019-01).  aPublisher supplied data 3aactigraphy 3acase studies 3aenergy intake 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3amales 3anutrient intake 3asleep 0aeating duration 0anutrition 0ashift workers 0arotation shift schedule1 aRosa, Dayane Eusenia1 aLopes, Tássia do Vale Cardoso1 aMoreno, Claudia Roberta de Castro1 aCrispim, Cibele Aparecida0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2021 Oct. 3, v. 40, no. 7 p.624-631dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33742x1541-10877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2020.18148993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245007200210300001600282520136500298592002801663596005701691596005601748596006101804596003901865650002601904650002601930650001001956650001201966650001001978650000901988650000901997700002002006700002602026700001902052773011102071856008202182852000902264655001202273IND60629671520221119005538.0210228e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062967152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10164-018-0581-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKutsukake, Nobuyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8637-623310aBehavioural interference among eusocial naked mole rats during work  ap. 101-109.  aIt has been reported that individuals of cooperative breeding species occasionally interfere with the work of other group members. However, the occurrence and function of this behaviour are controversial. In the naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber), a eusocial mammal, individuals frequently perform ‘tail-tugging’ behaviour, in which an actor holds the tail of another individual with the mouth and pulls that individual to a different place. In this study, we investigated the possible function of this behaviour in the experimental setting of soil excavation. Behavioural observations on three colonies showed that this behaviour was performed and received by individuals of all individual categories (i.e. queen, reproductive males, and workers), although a queen in one colony performed 72.5% of the observed behaviour. Our data support the hypothesis that this behaviour is used to monopolise work in a specific space because (1) tail-tugging was more likely to occur when the actor and recipient were working than when they were not, and (2) the actor performed tail-tugging in a cell in which that individual worked frequently. This study provides a rare example of behavioural interference in a cooperative society and suggests that there is disagreement and conflict regards the opportunity to work among colony members in this eusocial mammal.  aPublisher supplied data  a18870025cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a2077023cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aPD fellowhipcJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aSPRcRIKEN Brain Science Institute 3aHeterocephalus glaber 3aalloparental behavior 3amales 3amammals 3amouth 3asoil 3atail1 aInada, Masayuki1 aSakamoto, Shinsuke H.1 aOkanoya, Kazuo0 tJournal of ethology.g2019 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.101-109dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl42016x0289-07717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10164-018-0581-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245016500175520141100340592002801751650002301779650002101802650002301823650001401846650003801860650001601898650001901914650001101933650002301944650002001967650001901987650001302006650002602019650002102045653001402066653001602080653001902096653002102115653001802136700003302154700001802187700002402205700003502229700002902264700001802293700003002311773009902341856008202440852000902522655001202531IND60780468420221121144821.0220706e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078046842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1207042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValashedi, Mehdi Rabiee10aCRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Lcn2 in human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 ameliorates erastin-mediated ferroptosis and increases cisplatin vulnerability  aLipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is an antioxidant-related protein upregulated in various cellular stress conditions, especially cancer. In this study, we abrogated Lcn2 expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and evaluated its effect on cellular proliferation, migration, and ferroptotic cell death. Validated human Lcn2 CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) and homology-directed repair (HDR) plasmids were co-transfected into MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Lcn2 gene knockout was confirmed at the transcriptional and protein levels using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell proliferation was measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. Cytotoxicity assay was performed in the presence or absence of erastin, cisplatin (CDDP), and ferrostatin-1 using the CCK-8 method. Ferroptosis level was measured using the malondialdehyde assay lipid peroxidation kit. The migration capacity of the cells was also evaluated using the scratch assay. Targeting Lcn2 using CRISPR/Cas9 reduced cellular proliferation and migration capability, and elevated the vulnerability of MDA-MB-231 cells to cisplatin. Furthermore, Lcn2 expression loss effectively promoted erastin-mediated ferroptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Inhibition of Lcn2 is a potentially useful strategy for sensitizing MDA-MB-231 tumor cells to ferroptotic cell death.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3abreast neoplasms 3acell proliferation 3acisplatin 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aferroptosis 3agene targeting 3ahumans 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3aneoplasm cells 3aplasmids 3areverse transcription 3atoxicity testing 0aLcn2/NGAL 0aFerroptosis 0aCancer therapy 0aOxidative stress 0aBreast cancer1 aRoushandeh, Amaneh Mohammadi1 aTomita, Kazuo1 aKuwahara, Yoshikazu1 aPourmohammadi-Bejarpasi, Zahra1 aKozani, Pouya Safarzadeh1 aSato, Tomoaki1 aRoudkenar, Mehryar Habibi0 tLife sciences.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 304 p.120704-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1207043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03847naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245011400154500001900268500002000287520246400307592002802771596003802799650001102837650003502848650001402883650002702897650002002924650001702944650001002961650001002971650001902981650001403000650002603014650001003040651001003050700006103060700003203121700005603153773012303209856007203332852000903404655001203413IND60733061620221120121141.0210402e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073306162DNAL7 a10.1002/eap.22562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBielby, Jon10aHost contribution to parasite persistence is consistent between parasites and over time, but varies spatially  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMost parasites and pathogens infect multiple hosts, but a great deal of variation exists in the role of those hosts in persistence of infection. Understanding which hosts are most important in maintaining parasites can provide a clearer target for infection control. Recently developed empirical and theoretical approaches provide a way to quantify the relative contribution of hosts within a community and place them in a multi‐host framework to better direct control efforts. Amphibians provide a framework for better understanding multi‐host–multi‐parasite dynamics. Two well‐studied amphibian parasites, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Ranavirus, infect multiple host species and exhibit a great deal of heterogeneity in how they affect hosts. We used these two parasites and a community of five amphibian species to investigate the relative importance of hosts in parasite persistence, and how any patterns varied spatially and temporally. At two sites (Lake Ercina and Lake Lloroza in the Picos de Europa National Park, Spain) we collected data on the prevalence and shedding rate of parasite infection for both Bd and Ranavirus, and the abundance of each species’ life stages. We used these data to parameterize a recently developed modeling framework, which was used to quantify the relative contribution of each host to the community reproductive number, R₀. By comparing each host‐category over time and between sites we were able to identify consistencies in which host was responsible for the maintenance of these two parasites. Within a site one species consistently contributed the most to the persistence of both parasites. This consistency did not transfer between sites, the maintenance host species being different for each. At one site (Ercina), life stages of the common midwife toad, Alytes obstetricans, acted as the maintenance host for both Bd and Ranavirus. In contrast, at the second site, Lloroza, the alpine newt, Ichthyosaura alpestris, fulfilled that role. A single host species was responsible for infection persistence of both parasites at each lake. Attempts to control the infection levels and impacts of multiple parasites can benefit from a community epidemiology approach, and provide clarity on which hosts are the foci of mitigation efforts. However, at a small spatial scale, the target host may vary according to the physical qualities of those sites and the demographics of the host community.  aPublisher supplied data  aCGL2015‐70070‐RcMICINN grant 3aAlytes 3aBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis 3aRanavirus 3ademographic statistics 3adisease control 3aepidemiology 3ahosts 3alakes 3anational parks 3aparasites 3asalamanders and newts 3atoads 3aSpain1 aPrice, Stephen J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6983-62501 aMonsalve‐CarcaÑo, Camino1 aBosch, Jaime1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0099-79340 tEcological applications.g2021 Apr., v. 31, no. 3 p.e02256-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.22563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01497naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013900161300001600300500001900316520031900335592002800654650001500682650001700697650001800714650001600732650003100748653001700779653002300796653002300819700001600842700002400858773018200882856007401064852000901138655001201147IND60691970920221120175810.0200502e20020101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069197092DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.66.6602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTANIMORI, Shinji10aEnantioselective Synthesis of Both Enantiomers of Dimethyl cis-(4-Acetoxycyclopent-2-enyl)malonate, Key Intermediates for Epijasmonate  ap. 660-662.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBoth enantiomers (3 and 4) of dimethyl cis-(4-acetoxycyclopent-2-enyl)malonate (3), known intermediates for the synthesis of epijasmonate, were prepared in an enantio-enriched form from common starting material 2 based on desymmetrization of the meso-character by palladium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3abiochemistry 3abiotechnology 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselective synthesis 0aepijasmonoid 0aallylic alkylation 0apalladium catalyst1 aTSUJI, Yuko1 aKIRIHATA, Mitsunori0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2002 Jan. 1, v. 66, no. 3 p.660-662dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.66.6603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03503naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006300138245010000201500001900301500002000320520213200340592002802472596003302500596005102533596007202584650002302656650001302679650002202692650002102714650001502735650001702750651001902767700001802786700002402804700001802828700002202846700002102868773012302889856007203012852000903084655001203093IND60733061720221120121159.0210402e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073306172DNAL7 a10.1002/eap.22572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEppinga, Maarten B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1954-632410aSpatially explicit removal strategies increase the efficiency of invasive plant species control  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEffective management strategies are needed to control expansion of invasive alien plant species and attenuate economic and ecological impacts. While previous theoretical studies have assessed optimal control strategies that balance economic costs and ecological benefits, less attention has been paid to the ways in which the spatial characteristics of individual patches may mediate the effectiveness of management strategies. We developed a spatially explicit cellular automaton model for invasive species spread, and compared the effectiveness of seven control strategies. These control strategies used different criteria to prioritize the removal of invasive species patches from the landscape. The different criteria were related to patch size, patch geometry, and patch position within the landscape. Effectiveness of strategies was assessed for both seed dispersing and clonally expanding plant species. We found that, for seed‐dispersing species, removal of small patches and removal of patches that are isolated within the landscape comprised relatively effective control strategies. For clonally expanding species, removal of patches based on their degree of isolation and their geometrical properties comprised relatively effective control strategies. Subsequently, we parameterized the model to mimic the observed spatial distribution of the invasive species Antigonon leptopus on St. Eustatius (northern Caribbean). This species expands clonally and also disperses via seeds, and model simulations showed that removal strategies focusing on smaller patches that are more isolated in the landscape would be most effective and could increase the effectiveness of a 10‐yr control strategy by 30–90%, as compared to random removal of patches. Our study emphasizes the potential for invasive plant species management to utilize recent advances in remote sensing, which enable mapping of invasive species at the high spatial resolution needed to quantify patch geometries. The presented results highlight how this spatial information can be used in the design of more effective invasive species control strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  a201509cVan Eeden Foundation  cUniversity of Zurich Research Priority Program  a858.14.052cNederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek 3aAntigonon leptopus 3ageometry 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3aspatial data 3aSint Eustatius1 aBaudena, Mara1 aHaber, Elizabeth A.1 aRietkerk, Max1 aWassen, Martin J.1 aSantos, Maria J.0 tEcological applications.g2021 Apr., v. 31, no. 3 p.e02257-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.22573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010400169520147100273592002801744650002001772650001901792650001101811650001901822650001401841650001601855650001701871650001501888650001301903650001601916653001101932653001001943653001001953653001001963653001001973653001101983653001001994653001002004653001002014653001002024653003302034653002302067653001902090653001702109653001902126700005702145700006002202700005402262700006402316700006402380700006202444700003102506700006002537700001902597700005602616700005702672700005702729700002102786773012902807856008602936852000903022655001203031IND60732830620221119120528.0211106e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073283062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1257022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoang, Son A.10aMitigation of petroleum-hydrocarbon-contaminated hazardous soils using organic amendments: A review  aThe term “Total petroleum hydrocarbons” (TPH) is used to describe a complex mixture of petroleum-based hydrocarbons primarily derived from crude oil. Those compounds are considered as persistent organic pollutants in the terrestrial environment. A wide array of organic amendments is increasingly used for the remediation of TPH-contaminated soils. Organic amendments not only supply a source of carbon and nutrients but also add exogenous beneficial microorganisms to enhance the TPH degradation rate, thereby improving the soil health. Two fundamental approaches can be contemplated within the context of remediation of TPH-contaminated soils using organic amendments: (i) enhanced TPH sorption to the exogenous organic matter (immobilization) as it reduces the bioavailability of the contaminants, and (ii) increasing the solubility of the contaminants by supplying desorbing agents (mobilization) for enhancing the subsequent biodegradation. Net immobilization and mobilization of TPH have both been observed following the application of organic amendments to contaminated soils. This review examines the mechanisms for the enhanced remediation of TPH-contaminated soils by organic amendments and discusses the influencing factors in relation to sequestration, bioavailability, and subsequent biodegradation of TPH in soils. The uncertainty of mechanisms for various organic amendments in TPH remediation processes remains a critical area of future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3aorganic matter 3apetroleum 3aremediation 3asoil quality 3asolubility 3asorption 3auncertainty 0aBTEX - 0aDOC - 0aDOM - 0aHMW - 0aLMW - 0aNAPL - 0aPAH - 0aPCR - 0aSOM - 0aTPH - 0aTotal petroleum hydrocarbons 0aOrganic amendments 0aImmobilization 0aMobilization 0aBioremediation1 aSarkar, Binoy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4196-12251 aSeshadri, Balaji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1855-045X1 aLamb, Dane1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2303-54601 aWijesekara, Hasintha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7451-74621 aVithanage, Meththika1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2923-40651 aLiyanage, Chathuri1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4672-71951 aKolivabandara, Pabasari A.1 aRinklebe, Jörg,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7404-16391 aLam, Su Shiung1 aVinu, Ajayan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7508-251X1 aWang, Hailong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6107-50951 aKirkham, M.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9518-35481 aBolan, Nanthi S.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 416 p.125702-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1257023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245008600153300002000239520134800259592002801607650003001635650001201665650000901677650001501686650001701701650001801718700001701736700001301753700001601766773012401782856007401906852000901980655001201989IND60672060620221121224302.0191009e20191002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067206062DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra06735c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tao10aTheoretical prediction of some layered Pa₂O₅ phases: structure and properties  ap. 31398-31405.  aDensity functional theory (DFT) was used to predict and study protactinium pentoxide (Pa₂O₅), which presents a fluorite and layered protactinium oxide-type structure. Although the layered structure has been observed with the isostructural transition Nb and Ta metal pentoxides experimentally, the detailed structure and properties of the layered Pa₂O₅ are not clear and understandable. Our theoretical prediction explored some possible stable structures of the Pa₂O₅ stoichiometry according to the existing M₂O₅ structures (where M is an actinide Np or transition Nb, Ta, and V metal) and replacing the M ions with protactinium ions. The structural, mechanical, thermodynamic and electronic properties including lattice parameters, bulk moduli, elastic constants, entropy and band gaps were predicted for all the simulated structures. Pa₂O₅ in the β-V₂O₅ structure was found to be a competitive structure in terms of stability, whereas Pa₂O₅ in the ζ-Nb₂O₅ structure was found to be the most stable overall. This is consistent with Sellers's experimental observations. In particular, Pa₂O₅ in the ζ-Nb₂O₅ structure is predicted to be charge-transfer insulators. Furthermore, we predict that ζ-Nb₂O₅-structured Pa₂O₅ is the most thermodynamically stable under ambient conditions and pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aentropy 3aions 3aprediction 3aprotactinium 3astoichiometry1 aLi, Shichang1 aGao, Tao1 aAo, Bingyun0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 02, v. 9, no. 54 p.31398-31405dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06735c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03930naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245016100165520222000326592002802546650001302574650001902587650000902606650001502615650003302630650002602663650001402689650001802703650002102721650002602742650002102768650002202789650001902811650000902830650002302839650002502862650001702887651001002904653003502914653001202949653001502961653001902976653001002995653001703005700002003022700001703042700001903059700001603078700001803094700001303112700001803125773011603143856008403259852000903343655001203352IND60725993520221123001954.0220205e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072599352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1067622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chong10aOptimizing tillage method and irrigation schedule for greenhouse gas mitigation, yield improvement, and water conservation in wheat–maize cropping systems  aExcessive agricultural inputs meet food demand only at a huge environmental cost, and optimized management strategies are needed to promote the balanced development of food security, water conservation, and environmental sustainability. Here, we conducted a two-year field experiment to investigate annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, yield, water use efficiency (WUE), global warming potential (GWP), and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) from 2016 to 2018 in a typical wheat–maize cropping system in the North China Plain. Two tillage methods (T1, rotary tillage; T2, subsoiling) and four irrigation schedules (W1, pre-planting irrigation; W2, pre-planting + jointing irrigation; W3, pre-planting + anthesis irrigation; W4, pre-planting + jointing + anthesis irrigation) were used for winter wheat, and conventional practices were adopted for summer maize. In the winter wheat–summer maize season, the soil acted as a net sink for CH₄ but as a source for CO₂ and N₂O in all treatments, and CO₂ accounted for the highest proportion of the GWP. The inappropriate irrigation period in the W3 treatment caused greater GHG release and reduced crop yield, whereas the excessive irrigation in the W4 treatment led to low water productivity. Although the use of irrigation water increased annual GHG emissions, an appropriate irrigation schedule could significantly mitigate the GHGI. Compared with the W3 and W4 treatments, the W2 treatment increased yield by an average of 7.56–10.58% and 2.06–2.68%, improved WUE by 9.95–17.83% and 11.29–22.84%, reduced GWP by 3.70–5.10% and 0.65–2.25%, and decreased GHGI by 10.66–14.26% and 3.05–4.86%, respectively. The T2 treatment resulted in high GHG emissions and was accompanied by low yield and water productivity. Relative to the T2 treatment, the annual yield and WUE in the T1 treatment increased by an average of 4.41–15.15% and 8.12–12.76%, and the annual GWP and GHGI decreased by 3.97–4.62% and 8.80–16.93%. Therefore, rotary tillage combined with supplementary irrigation at the jointing stage can mitigate GHG emissions and improve yield and water productivity, making it an environmentally friendly agricultural practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acarbon dioxide 3acorn 3acrop yield 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afield experimentation 3aflowering 3afood security 3agreenhouse gases 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation water 3apollution control 3arotary tillage 3asoil 3awater conservation 3awater use efficiency 3awinter wheat 3aChina 0aWheat–maize cropping systems 0aTillage 0aIrrigation 0aGreenhouse gas 0aYield 0aWater-saving1 aZhao, Jiongchao1 aFeng, Yupeng1 aShang, Mengfei1 aBo, Xiaozhi1 aGao, Zhenzhen1 aChen, Fu1 aChu, Qingquan0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 248 p.106762-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1067623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245018200163300001600345500001900361520147000380592002801850650001901878650002001897650002201917650001801939650002201957650001801979650002201997650001002019650002402029653003702053653002302090653002902113653002102142700001902163700001902182700002302201700001702224773011702241856007802358852000902436655001202445IND60684842020221120031700.0200319e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068484202DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2019.02532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRochira, Andrea10aSchool Gardening Activities Aimed at Obesity Prevention Improve Body Mass Index and Waist Circumference Parameters in School-Aged Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  ap. 154-173.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBackground: Childhood obesity, due to its increasing prevalence, is one of the most challenging problems in public health and prevention. Recent strategies have been implemented to tackle this trend, including school gardening projects. This systematic review analyzes the main elements of school gardening with a specific meta-analysis about its impact on anthropometric parameters. Materials and Methods: We searched studies in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library on school gardening projects carried out until February 2019 and addressed to children aged 6 to 13 years. Results: Thirty-three studies passed the screening selection. Outcomes analyzed were fruits and vegetables consumption/knowledge, nutritional attitudes and behavior, anthropometric outcomes (i.e., BMI, waist circumference—WC) and other outcomes (i.e., blood pressure, science achievement, and physical activity). We performed descriptive analyses of these outcomes and found a general benefit from school gardening projects. We subsequently performed a meta-analysis on anthropometric outcomes, highlighting a significant reduction of both BMI percentile (%) (−1.37%) and WC (−1.30 cm). Conclusions: Although more high-quality studies are needed on this topic, along with a greater homogeneity of anthropometric measurements, the results of our article show a modest but positive impact of school gardening projects on anthropometric measures and more generally on children's health.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood pressure 3abody mass index 3achildhood obesity 3ameta-analysis 3aphysical activity 3apublic health 3asystematic review 3awaist 3awaist circumference 0achildhood overweight and obesity 0aobesity prevention 0apreventive interventions 0aschool gardening1 aTedesco, Dario1 aUbiali, Andrea1 aFantini, Maria Pia1 aGori, Davide0 tChildhood obesity.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 16, no. 3 p.154-173dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2019.02533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006100138245012300199500001900322500002000341520223000361592002802591596006402619650002402683650002002707650002702727650002402754650001202778650001002790650001602800650001302816700005902829700002102888700005902909773012202968856007203090852000903162655001203171IND60733061820221120121228.0210402e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073306182DNAL7 a10.1002/eap.22582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeegman, Mitch D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1633-092010aPartial and complete dependency among data sets has minimal consequence on estimates from integrated population models  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIntegrated population models (IPMs) are widely used to combine disparate data sets in joint analysis to better understand population dynamics and provide guidance for conservation activities. An often‐cited assumption of IPMs is independence among component data sets within the combined likelihood. Dependency among data sets should lead to underestimation of variance and bias because individuals contribute data to more than one data set. In practice, studied individuals often occur in multiple data sets in IPMs (i.e., overlap), which is one way for the independence assumption to be violated. Such cases have the potential to dissuade practitioners and limit application of IPMs to solve emerging ecological problems. We assessed precision and bias of demographic rates estimated from IPMs using a complete gradient (0–100%) of overlap among data sets, wide ranges in demographic rates (e.g., survival 0.1–0.8) and sample sizes (100–1,200 individuals) and variable data sources. We compared results from our simulations with those from IPMs constructed using empirical data on tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) where data sets either had complete overlap or included different individuals. Contrary to previous investigators, we found no substantive bias or uncertainty in any demographic rate from IPMs derived from data sets with complete overlap. While variability in demographic rates was greater at low sample sizes (i.e., low capture, recapture, and survey probabilities), there were negligible differences in the posterior mean or root mean square error of demographic rates among IPMs with strong dependence vs. complete independence among data sets. Our simulations suggest IPMs can be designed using only capture–recapture data or harvest and capture‐recovery data where population estimates are obtained from the same data as survival and productivity data. While we encourage researchers to carefully consider the modeling approach best suited for their data sets, our results suggest that dependence among data sets does not generally compromise IPM estimates. Thus, violation of the independence assumption should not dissuade researchers from the application of IPMs in ecological research.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aTachycineta bicolor 3adata collection 3amark-recapture studies 3apopulation dynamics 3asurveys 3atrees 3auncertainty 3avariance1 aArnold, Todd W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7920-772X1 aClark, Robert G.1 aSchaub, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2745-05570 tEcological applications.g2021 Apr., v. 31, no. 3 p.e2258-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.22583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010500172300001400277520154800291592002801839650001201867650001001879650002401889650001601913650001001929650001401939650001301953651001101966653001201977653001401989653001702003653001402020653001302034653001102047700002202058773013002080856008502210852000902295655001202304IND60581792120221119045304.0180904e20170725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058179212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2016.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabinovich, Rivka14aThe earliest elephants out of Africa: Taxonomy and taphonomy of proboscidean remains from Bethlehem  ap. 23-42.  aThe bone-bearing beds of Bethlehem were excavated by Gardner and Bate in the late 1930s, yielding an important Plio-Pleistocene faunal assemblage. In the 1950s, Hooijer revised the fauna and described elephant remains, including a large tusk, a mandible, several molars and some post-cranial elements, identified by him as Archidiskodon cf. planifrons. Recent preparation and Computed Tomography has given new insights into the early elephant remains from Bethlehem – both in terms of their anatomy and their post-depositional deformation. This includes two further mandibles, distorted and almost totally obscured by sediment, whose morphology has been revealed. The elephant material has been studied in detail and compared morphometrically with key taxa including Siwalik Elephas planifrons and European Mammuthus rumanus. The morphology of the molars cannot definitively distinguish between Elephas or Mammuthus, but their evolutionary grade, and the morphology of the mandible, are most conformable with a primitive mammoth intermediate between African M. subplanifrons and European M. rumanus. Conversely a largely complete tusk shows none of the spiral twisting associated with Mammuthus and is more conformable with Elephas. The possibility that two elephantid taxa are represented in the Bethlehem deposit cannot be discounted, and is consistent with a wide size variation seen among the postcranial bones. These remains, together with some others recently described, represent the most primitive known elephantines out of Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephas 3abones 3acomputed tomography 3adeformation 3afauna 3asediments 3ataxonomy 3aAfrica 0aElephas 0aMammuthus 0aElephantidae 0aTaphonomy 0aTaxonomy 0aLevant1 aLister, Adrian M.0 tQuaternary international.g2017 July 25, v. 445 p.23-42dElsevier LtdaElsevier Ltd and INQUAwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2016.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007000169300001800239500001400257520038800271536022500659592002800884596010600912650001801018650001501036650001601051650001301067650002601080653001301106653002201119653001401141653002101155653002101176700001901197700002201216773013901238856008501377852000901462655001201471IND60692842220221119121400.0200503e20181202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069284222DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2018.15119662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIto, Shinsaku12aA concise synthesis of peramine, a metabolite of endophytic fungi  ap. 2053-2058.  aNAL-light  aThe total synthesis of peramine, a natural product isolated from an endophytic fungi, has been achieved in four steps and 34% overall yield from known compounds.

The assessment was based on the influence of feed strategy, interaction between cycle time and influent concentration, applied volumetric organic load (OLRA), and temperature over system stability and performance. The system showed flexibility with regard to the feed strategy, but the reduction of cycle time and influent concentration, at the same OLRA, resulted in lower methane productivity. Increasing organic load, up to the value of 15.27 gCOD L⁻¹ day⁻¹, favored the process, increasing methane yield and productivity. Temperature reduction from 30 to 25 °C resulted in worse performance, although increasing it to 35 °C provided similar results to 30 °C. The best results were achieved at an OLRA of 15.27 gCOD L⁻¹ day⁻¹, cycle time of 8 h, fed-batch operation, and temperature of 30 °C. The system achieved soluble COD removal efficiency of 89%, methane productivity of 208.5 molCH₄ m⁻³ day⁻¹ and yield of 15.76 mmolCH₄ gCOD⁻¹. The kinetic model fit indicated methanogenesis preference for the hydrogenotrophic route. At the industrial scale estimative, considering a scenario with a sugarcane ethanol plant with ethanol production of 150,896 m³ year⁻¹, it was estimated energy production of 25,544 MWh month⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data  a#2015/06246-7cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a#443181/2016-0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiofilm 3acheese whey 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenergy 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3akinetics 3amethane 3amethane production 3asugarcane 3atemperature 3avinasse1 aLovato, Giovanna1 aAlbanez, Roberta1 aRatusznei, Suzana M.1 aRodrigues, José A.

Its conservation is a priority as the only extant species of the order Microbiotheria. We investigated whether the apparent low abundances reported for D. gliroides are real, or reflect a sampling artifact. We used wire-mesh and Sherman live traps, devices for recording tracks and hair, 2 types of bait, and 2 trap placements (ground level and 1.5––2.5 m high) in an old-growth forest in southern Chile. Type of bait and placement height affected captures of D. gliroides. The most efficient trapping combination (wire-mesh traps baited with banana, and placed above ground) yielded capture rates of up to 11%%, and a relative population density of 21 ±± 5 individuals/ha (mean ±± SE), whereas traditional methods used for sampling small mammals were not effective. The sampling artifact uncovered here may have important future management and conservation implications.  aPublisher supplied data 0aabundance 0acapture efficiency 0aDromiciops gliroides 0asampling artifact 0aSouth American temperate rain forest1 aJiméénez, Jaime E.0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2009 Dec. 15, v. 90, no. 6 p.1357-1362dAmerican Society of Mammalogistsx1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F09-MAMM-A-027R1.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012400162520163000286592002801916650001901944650002401963650002801987650001102015650002002026650003002046650001602076650002002092650001702112653003702129653002902166653002202195653002602217653002102243653002002264700001702284700001302301700001802314700001502332700001402347773009902361856008202460852000902542655001202551IND60780468720221121144825.0220706e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078046872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1207192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Zhihao10aFecal microbiota transplantation for diseases: Therapeutic potential, methodology, risk management in clinical practice  aMore than 95 % of human diseases may be related to the disturbance of gut microbes. As a treatment method that extensively regulates the gut microbes, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has proven to be an effective therapy for some diseases, becoming a topic of interest among clinicians, patients and scientists. To review the latest clinical research results of FMT in the treatment of various diseases and the methodology and risk management in clinical application. Search PubMed and Web of Science for reliable research results of clinical treatment of FMT within 5–10 years, as well as application guidelines and risk management policies in different regions. As a measure of allogeneic/autologous microbiota transplantation, FMT has been used to treat a variety of diseases. By reviewing the clinical studies of FMT in gastrointestinal diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases and malignant tumors, the various mechanisms in the treatment of diseases are summarized. Such as regulation of receptor microbiota composition, specific metabolites, phage function and immune response. In addition, potential risk factors, donor stool screening indicators, recipient self-specificity and possible prognostic marker molecules in the course of FMT treatment were generalized. The potential regulatory mechanisms, risk factors and targets of FMT in gastrointestinal diseases, metabolic diseases, malignancies and neurological diseases were reviewed and proposed. It provides a theoretical basis for the establishment of a standardized treatment system for FMT and a breakthrough in treatment technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteriophages 3abiomedical research 3agastrointestinal system 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolites 3arisk management 3atherapeutics 0aFecal microbiota transplantation 0aGastrointestinal disease 0aMetabolic disease 0aNeurological diseases 0aMalignant tumors 0aRisk management1 aTian, Peijun1 aYang, Bo1 aZhao, Jianxin1 aWang, Gang1 aChen, Wei0 tLife sciences.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 304 p.120719-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1207193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01721naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010200158300001600260500001900276520053800295592002800833650002100861650001200882650001800894650001900912653001800931653001600949653003600965653002301001700002401024700002401048700002201072773018201094856007401276852000901350655001201359IND60691971220221120094229.0200502e20020101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069197122DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.66.6702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYAMAUCHI, Ryo10aPreparation of the Addition Products of α-Tocopherol with Cholesteryl Linoleate-Peroxyl Radicals  ap. 670-673.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aα-Tocopherol was reacted with cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxides (Ch18:2-OOH) in the presence of an iron-chelate, Fe(III) acetylacetonate, at 37°C in benzene.

A case study on sucrose replacement by Stevia rebaudiana and addition of beta glucan in fruit drinks  ap. 76-84.  aThe present study provides a more holistic view on consumers’ hedonic food experience compared to what is traditionally seen in sensory research, by integrating the hedonic sensory experience and post-ingestive sensations in one study to understand food satisfaction. The study was performed using apple-cherry fruit drinks with different levels of beta-glucans and different sweeteners, sucrose or Stevia rebaudiana. The aims were: 1) to study the hedonic sensory experience, 2) to study time and product effects on post-ingestive sensations and satisfaction, and 3) to study main drivers of satisfaction.A randomized cross-over consumer study was conducted using 66 subjects. Hedonic ratings of sensory perceptions were collected immediately after intake, and subjective ratings of post-ingestive sensations were collected pre intake and in 10min intervals up to 40min post intake. Significant hedonic differences of sensory properties were found between all fruit drinks, except between the fruit drinks varying in type of sweetener only. Differences in post-ingestive sensations were found immediately – and 10min post intake between fruit drinks with and without added beta glucan. Satisfaction with sensory attributes was found to be the main driver of food satisfaction, while post-ingestive sensations drove satisfaction as well. While replacing sucrose with Stevia rebaudiana did not affect the hedonic and post-ingestive sensations, addition of beta glucan resulted in both positive and negative post-ingestive sensations. In general, adding beta glucan without compromising satisfaction is difficult. This study show that a detailed description of hedonic sensory – as well as post-ingestive sensations can bring important information about factors driving consumers’ satisfaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStevia rebaudiana 3abeta-glucans 3acase studies 3afruit drinks 3asensory properties 3asucrose 3asweeteners 0aStevia rebaudiana 0aBeta glucan 0aSatisfaction 0aConsumer study 0aHedonics 0aPost-ingestive sensations1 aMielby, Line H.1 aViemose, Ida1 aBredie, Wender L.P.1 aHyldig, Grethe0 tFood quality and preference.g2017 June, v. 58 p.76-84dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2017.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015100168300001400319520113800333592002801471650002501499650001901524650001501543650001301558650002301571650002301594650001901617650002101636650001601657650001401673650001401687650001901701653002501720653001901745653002201764653002301786653002101809653003401830700001601864700002401880773014101904856008502045852000902130655001202139IND60722200020221118163520.0220222e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072220002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2020.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShyam, Shilpa10aCo-composting invasive aquatic macrophytes and pond sediment holds the potential for environmental amelioration: Selecting the right shade of grey  ap. 17-23.  aCo-composting of invasive aquatic weeds with pond sediment can be a cost-effective way to manage the problem of invasion and eutrophication in aquatic systems and improvement of soil fertility in agricultural systems. Nevertheless, preparation of good quality compost is a challenge because of the variations in the physico-chemical properties of the plant material and the bulking agent. Mixing the plant biomass and the bulking agent in an appropriate proportion is crucial to make good quality compost, which requires a systematic empirical study. We standardized a protocol for composting Eichhornia crassipes and Ipomoea carnea biomass using pond sediment as a bulking agent. For each species, we used a randomized block design with 3 treatments × 3 replicates. The study revealed that mixing pond sediment and the weed biomass in 1:5 ratio yielded better quality compost in both the species compared to other treatments. The study emphasizes that composting aquatic weeds with pond sediment should help in managing the problem of weed invasion, sedimentation, eutrophication, and loss of soil fertility in agricultural fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aIpomoea carnea 3acomposting 3acomposts 3acost effectiveness 3aempirical research 3aeutrophication 3ainvasive species 3amacrophytes 3aphytomass 3asediments 3asoil fertility 0aEichhornia crassipes 0aIpomoea carnea 0aFishpond sediment 0aAerobic composting 0aInvasive species 0aManagement of aquatic systems1 aDas, Tapati1 aKumar, G.V.Prasanna0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2022 Feb., v. 42, no. 1 p.17-23dElsevier B.V.aEcological Society of ChinawJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2020.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013600167500002200303520171300325592002802038650001102066650001202077650002602089650002002115650003502135650001302170650001002183650001102193650003302204650001402237650001602251651002102267653003502288653001702323653001702340653002602357653001502383653002202398700006002420700002202480700002002502700006002522700002502582773006902607856008402676852000902760655001202769IND60581792720221119045345.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058179272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2017.08.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖn, Z.

In this study we attempt to extract statistically independent climate related signals from μ-XRF multi element data of a core drilled from Lake Hazar in Eastern Anatolia, using the independent component analysis (ICA) method. In addition, we analysed ostracod shells for oxygen and carbon isotopes. The ICA method has advantages over traditional dimension reduction methods, such as principal component analysis or factor analysis, because it is based on maximal statistical independence rather than uncorrelatedness, where independence is a stronger property.The Hz11-P03 core, which represents the last 17.3 ka, was recovered from Lake Hazar which, at times, formed the headwaters of the Tigris. Applying the ICA method, we selected two out of six independent components by measuring distance correlation similarity. We propose that one of the selected components can be read as a proxy for temperature and the other for precipitation in this region.Our results indicate that the region was relatively cold and wet during the late glacial, between 17.3 and 14.8 ka BP, and wet and warm during Bølling-Allerød. The lake level dropped below today's level during the Younger Dryas stadial (12.49 and 11.76 ka BP), forming a marked hiatus in the core's stratigraphic record. During the beginning of the Holocene, while precipitation values were high, the temperature gradually increased until 8 ka BP. Between 8 and 5 ka BP, the region was warm but extremely dry. After 5 ka BP, around 3.5 ka BP temperatures suddenly fell, and three abrupt dry phases are observed around 3.5 ka and 2.8 ka and 1.8 ka BP.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aelemental composition 3afactor analysis 3aindependent component analysis 3aisotopes 3alakes 3aoxygen 3aprincipal component analysis 3asediments 3atemperature 3aTurkey (country) 0aIndependent component analysis 0aPaleoclimate 0aThe Holocene 0aEastern Mediterranean 0aLake Hazar 0aUpper Mesopotamia1 aAkçer-Ön, Sena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0708-86291 aÖzeren, M.

Brittle lignin oligomers, isolated from plant biomass, require a low-melting host polymer matrix to form a rigid and tough renewable material. We demonstrate controlled lignin dispersion and interfacial interactions in softened recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) using a simple solvent-free, melt-blending technique. To avoid lignin degradation and devolatilization during melt processing, it was thermally treated. Tall oil fatty acid was used to enable PET processability at low enough temperature to accommodate lignin without charring. Chemical analysis reveals reduction of aliphatic hydroxyl content from 2 mmol g⁻¹ to 1.63 mmol g⁻¹ and an increase of total phenolic hydroxyl moieties from 5.86 to 6.64 mmol g⁻¹ and cleavage of β-O-4 ether linkages due to thermal treatment. Structural transformation of lignin macromolecules during heat treatment was further confirmed by an increase in molar mass and improved thermal stability. Interfacial interactions between lignin and PET were assessed from mechanical properties and thermal analyses. Thermal treatment not only helps to improve the stability of lignin but also slightly reduces the size of the dispersed lignin domains via favored interfacial interactions with the PET matrix. These methods improve mechanical properties of the material. Further, incorporation of lignin in the plasticized PET matrix increases the ductility in the blended products. The method we discuss here utilizes industrial wastes and co-products, and it does not require solvent or toxic chemicals during the reactive extrusion process that yields complete conversion to products.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiorefining 3abrittleness 3achemical analysis 3acoproducts 3aextrusion 3afatty acids 3afuels 3aheat treatment 3aindustrial wastes 3alignin 3amelting 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3aphytomass 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3asolvents 3atall oil 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3athermal stability 3athermoplastics 3atoxic substances1 aNguyen, Ngoc A.1 aRajan, Kalavathy1 aHarper, Davidq(David Paul),1 aNaskar, Amit K.0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 9, no. 54 p.31202-31211dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra07052d3Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245015500167500001900322520188300341592002802224650001802252650002402270650001902294650001502313650001802328650002202346650001402368650001402382650001702396650002002413650001602433650001402449650001602463650001302479650001502492650001502507650001002522650001502532653003102547653002302578653003302601653001302634653002002647700002402667700001902691700002102710700001902731700002302750700002002773773010602793856008402899852000902983655001202992IND60722200320221118163450.0210610e20210220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072220032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2020.1040672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrikryl, Petr10aMass spectrometry-based proteomic exploration of the small urinary extracellular vesicles in ANCA-associated vasculitis in comparison with total urine  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare, but potentially severe autoimmune disease, even nowadays displaying increased mortality and morbidity. Finding early biomarkers of activity and prognosis is thus very important. Small extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from urine can be considered as a non-invasive source of biomarkers. We evaluated several protocols for urinary EV isolation. To eliminate contaminating non-vesicular proteins due to AAV associated proteinuria we used proteinase K treatment. We investigated the differences in proteomes of small EVs of patients with AAV compared to healthy controls by label-free LC–MS/MS. In parallel, we performed an analogous proteomic analysis of urine samples from identical patients. The study results showed significant differences and similarities in both EV and urine proteome, the latter one being highly affected by proteinuria. Using bioinformatics tools we explored differentially changed proteins and their related pathways with a focus on the pathophysiology of AAV. Our findings indicate significant regulation of Golgi enzymes, such as MAN1A1, which can be involved in T cell activation by N-glycans glycosylation and may thus play a key role in pathogenesis and diagnosis of AAV.The present study explores for the first time the changes in proteomes of small extracellular vesicles and urine of patients with renal ANCA-associated vasculitis compared to healthy controls by label-free LC–MS/MS. Isolation of vesicles from proteinuric urine samples has been modified to minimize contamination by plasma proteins and to reduce co-isolation of extraluminal proteins. Differentially changed proteins and their related pathways with a role in the pathophysiology of AAV were described and discussed. The results could be helpful for the research of potential biomarkers in renal vasculitis associated with ANCA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aautoimmune diseases 3abioinformatics 3abiomarkers 3aglycosylation 3amass spectrometry 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apathogenesis 3apathophysiology 3apeptidase K 3aprognosis 3aproteinuria 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aurinalysis 3aurine 3avasculitis 0aANCA-associated vasculitis 0aUrinary proteomics 0aSmall extracellular vesicles 0aExosomes 0aN-glycosylation1 aSatrapova, Veronika1 aFrydlova, Jana1 aHruskova, Zdenka1 aZima, Tomáš,1 aTesař, Vladimír,1 aVokurka, Martin0 tJournal of proteomics.g2021 Feb. 20, v. 233 p.104067-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2020.1040673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013000167520146100297592002801758650001601786650001601802650002001818650001401838650001801852650001001870650001501880650002001895650000901915653001101924653001001935653000801945653000801953653000901961653001101970653000901981653000901990653001001999653000802009653000802017653000802025653000702033653001102040653001002051653000802061653002002069653001002089653001202099700002002111700002202131700002202153700002102175700001802196700001802214773009902232856008202331852000902413655001202422IND60780469220221122044605.0220706e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078046922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1207242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZahra, Goodarzi10aCombined effects of the exposure to silver nanoparticles and noise on hearing function and cochlea structure of the male rats  aThis study intended to investigate whether exposure to the combination of noise and Ag-NPs in rats induces cochlear damage and hearing dysfunction. A total of 24Wistar rats were divided into four treatment groups and received/exposed to saline (IP), Ag-NPs (100 mg/kg, 5d/w for 4 weeks), 8 kHz narrowband noise (104 dB SPL, 6 h/day, 5d/w for 4 weeks) and Ag-NPs plus noise. The DPOAE, serum levels of MDA and SOD and changes in body weight were assessed. The rat cochlea was further stained for investigating the mRNA expression (TL-6, NOX3, and TNF-), IHC (TUJ-1 and MHC7), and histological alterations. The Ag-NPs characteristics were also analysed by SEM and XRD. DPOAE values were remarkably reduced (p < 0.05) among the exposed groups. Furthermore, exposure to noise and Ag-NPs significantly increased MDA levels and decreased the SOD activity in the serum. In comparison to the control group, the expression of IL-6, TNF-, and NOX3 was shown to be elevated in the Ag-NPs plus noise group. The body weight also increased significantly in all groups with the exception of the Ag-NPs plus noise group. IHC tests showed remarkable down-regulation of TUJ1 and MYO7A. Morphological changes confirmed our findings as well. SEM and XRD data validated the production of Ag-NPs. According to the findings of this study, sub-acute exposure to noise and Ag-NPs causes permanent damage to the hair cells that are in charge of high-frequency perception.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3agene expression 3ahistology 3ainterleukin-6 3amales 3ananosilver 3anoise pollution 3arats 0aAg-NPs 0aDPOAE 0aMDA 0aSOD 0aIL-6 0aTNF-α 0aNOX3 0aTUJ1 0aMYO7A 0aSEM 0aXRD 0aIHC 0aIP 0aAg-NPs 0aNoise 0aIHC 0amRNA expression 0aDPOAE 0aCochlea1 aEsmaeil, Karami1 aMohammad, Faridan1 aRashidy-Pour, Ali1 aMahdi, Mohammadi1 aMahdi, Akbari1 aAli, Khavanin0 tLife sciences.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 304 p.120724-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1207243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014900171300001400320520162100334592002801955650001101983650001301994650001502007650001202022650002802034650001102062650001102073650001402084650001902098650002302117650001902140650001702159650002302176651001202199653002702211653002902238653001302267653000902280653000802289700002702297700002402324700002002348700001602368700001902384773014802403856004802551852000902599655001202608IND60778045920221119173138.0220523e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077804592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2015.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Abebe Mohammed10aEstimating leaf functional traits by inversion of PROSPECT: Assessing leaf dry matter content and specific leaf area in mixed mountainous forest  ap. 66-76.  aAssessments of ecosystem functioning rely heavily on quantification of vegetation properties. The search is on for methods that produce reliable and accurate baseline information on plant functional traits. In this study, the inversion of the PROSPECT radiative transfer model was used to estimate two functional leaf traits: leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA). Inversion of PROSPECT usually aims at quantifying its direct input parameters. This is the first time the technique has been used to indirectly model LDMC and SLA. Biophysical parameters of 137 leaf samples were measured in July 2013 in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. Spectra of the leaf samples were measured using an ASD FieldSpec3 equipped with an integrating sphere. PROSPECT was inverted using a look-up table (LUT) approach. The LUTs were generated with and without using prior information. The effect of incorporating prior information on the retrieval accuracy was studied before and after stratifying the samples into broadleaf and conifer categories. The estimated values were evaluated using R² and normalized root mean square error (nRMSE). Among the retrieved variables the lowest nRMSE (0.0899) was observed for LDMC. For both traits higher R² values (0.83 for LDMC and 0.89 for SLA) were discovered in the pooled samples. The use of prior information improved accuracy of the retrieved traits. The strong correlation between the estimated traits and the NIR/SWIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum suggests that these leaf traits could be assessed at canopy level by using remotely sensed data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aconifers 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aleaf dry matter content 3aleaves 3amodels 3amountains 3anational parks 3aradiative transfer 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3aspecific leaf area 3aGermany 0aFunctional leaf traits 0aRadiative transfer model 0aPROSPECT 0aLDMC 0aSLA1 aDarvishzadeh, Roshanak1 aSkidmore, Andrew K.1 aDuren, Iris van1 aHeiden, Uta1 aHeurich, Marco0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2016 Mar., v. 45 p.66-76dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2015.11.004  aDNAL 7aarticle01421naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245002100173300001800194520060700212592002800819653001500847653001200862653001400874653002200888700002400910773011700934856008301051852000901134655001201143IND60128720820221118050007.0151116e20091215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012872082DNAL7 a10.1644/09-MAMM-S-130R2.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopa-Lisseanu, Ana G.10aBats on the Move  ap. 1283-1289.  aRecent years have seen an increase in the number of publications on bat migration and an overall growing interest among bat researchers that culminated in the 1st International Symposium on Bat Migration in Berlin in January 2009.

The golden mussel colonizes hard manmade substrates and its attachment can cause economic losses at water intake facilities. To evaluate the repellent effects of the high alkalinity (pH 12–13) of freshly prepared cement mortar on golden mussels, test pieces made of cement were immersed in a Japanese urban tidal river. Compared with coated mortar, and wood and limestone test pieces, the cement mortar did not show significant repellent effects on golden mussel attachment. Therefore, concrete constructions on riverbanks may be a preferred substrate for golden mussel colonization. A 4-year immersion experiment showed that copper substrate had a strong repellent effect on biofouling, while cement mortar, aluminum, and stainless steel did not have any adverse effects on golden mussel attachment. This experiment also revealed the settlement of invasive golden mussel in an urban tidal area where the salinity fluctuated up to 20.0‰.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLimnoperna fortunei 3aadverse effects 3aalkalinity 3aaluminum 3abiofouling 3acement 3aconcrete 3aconstruction materials 3acopper 3afinancial economics 3afreshwater 3ainvasive species 3alimestone 3apH 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3asalinity 3astainless steel 3awood 3aChina1 aFumoto, Takayuki1 aKawakami, Hiroshi0 tLimnology.g2019 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.131-136dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3949861x1439-86217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-018-0559-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008100171300001300252520142100265592002801686650002701714650001101741650002201752650001101774650002601785650001701811650001301828650001701841650002101858651001301879653002801892653001701920653001801937653002501955653002201980700002002002700001502022773009202037856008502129852000902214655001202223IND60561911520221122233543.0180831e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056191152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2017.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinho, Graça14aThe Portuguese plastic carrier bag tax: The effects on consumers’ behavior  ap. 3-12.  aMarine litter from lightweight plastic bags is a global problem that must be solved. A plastic bag tax was implemented in February 2015 to reduce the consumption of plastic grocery bags in Portugal and in turn reduce the potential contribution to marine litter. This study analyzes the effect of the plastic bag tax on consumer behavior to learn how it was received and determine the perceived effectiveness of the tax 4months after its implementation. In addition, the study assessed how proximity to coastal areas could influence behaviors and opinions. The results showed a 74% reduction of plastic bag consumption with a simultaneously 61% increase of reusable plastic bags after the tax was implemented. Because plastic bags were then reused for shopping instead of garbage bags, however, the consumption of garbage bags increased by 12%. Although reduction was achieved, the tax had no effect on the perception of marine litter or the impact of plastic bags on environment and health. The majority of respondents agree with the tax but view it as an extra revenue to the State. The distance to the coast had no meaningful influence on consumer behavior or on the perception of the tax. Although the tax was able to promote the reduction of plastics, the role of hypermarkets and supermarkets in providing alternatives through the distribution of reusable plastic bags was determinant to ensuring the reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acoasts 3aconsumer behavior 3aincome 3amunicipal solid waste 3aplastic bags 3aplastics 3asupermarkets 3awaste management 3aPortugal 0aMarket-based instrument 0aPlastic bags 0aMarine litter 0aSustainable behavior 0aDistance to coast1 aBalaia, Natacha1 aPires, Ana0 tWaste management.g2017 Mar., v. 61 p.3-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245012700210300001600337520152300353592002801876650002001904650002001924650001601944650001401960650001601974650001201990650001802002650001702020650001502037650001002052650002102062650002302083650001702106650001302123700001802136700002302154700001702177700002302194700002202217700001802239700002102257773012802278856008202406852000902488655001202497IND60675995720221119181330.0191113e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067599572DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-019-03048-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuura, Hideyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5491-966710aDevelopment of a Paper-Based Luminescence Bioassay for Therapeutic Monitoring of Aminoglycosides: a Proof-of-Concept Study  ap. 798-809.  aAminoglycosides are widely used antibiotics that bind to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit to inhibit translation. Owing to their adverse side effects and narrow therapeutic index, monitoring blood levels of aminoglycosides is important to maximize their effectiveness and minimize their toxicity. Current monitoring techniques require a well-equipped diagnostic laboratory. The present study aimed to present a proof-of-concept for a simple, low-cost biochemical assay utilizing a paper platform for the detection of serum/whole blood aminoglycosides. A paper-based bioassay chip for the assay was developed by spotting and freeze-drying cell-free transcription/translation reaction machinery for a luminescent reporter protein (NanoLuc) within an array of wax circles printed on filter paper. The paper-based chip could be used to quantify serum/whole blood aminoglycosides within clinically relevant concentrations in 30–60 min by spotting minimal volumes of samples, followed by the NanoLuc substrate, in the wax circles and detecting the associated changes in luminescence signals, using a simple digital camera. Furthermore, a one-pot assay in which cell-free transcription/translation reaction machinery and NanoLuc substrate are mixed in advance and embedded in paper could be used to detect an aminoglycoside in serum. Overall, our paper-based bioassay can potentially provide a basic platform for the simple and low-cost therapeutic monitoring of aminoglycosides, especially in resource-limited regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aaminoglycosides 3aantibiotics 3abioassays 3ablood serum 3acameras 3afreeze drying 3aluminescence 3amonitoring 3apaper 3aprotein subunits 3aribosomal proteins 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity1 aUjiie, Kazuki1 aDuyen, Tran Thi My1 aIzutsu, Koki1 aFujiyama, Kazuhito1 aMaeda, Shinichiro1 aHarada, Kazuo1 aHirata, Kazumasa0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2019 Nov., v. 189, no. 3 p.798-809dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-019-03048-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04968naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245014200177500001900319520302800338592002803366650002303394650001003417650002603427650001303453650001503466650001303481650001503494650002503509650001703534650001403551650002303565650003803588650001303626650001303639650001503652650001103667650001103678650002903689650001703718653001103735653000903746653000803755653000703763653001103770653000803781653001003789653001403799653001603813653001203829653003103841653001803872653001903890653005703909653001403966700001803980700002003998700002304018700002504041700001704066773010604083856008404189852000904273655001204282IND60722200620221118162824.0210201e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072220062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2020.1040832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadilla Trejo, Alberto,10aConus venom fractions inhibit the adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 domains to the host vascular receptors  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUsing high-throughput BioPlex assays, we determined that six fractions from the venom of Conus nux inhibit the adhesion of various recombinant PfEMP-1 protein domains (PF08_0106 CIDR1α3.1, PF11_0521 DBL2β3, and PFL0030c DBL3X and DBL5e) to their corresponding receptors (CD36, ICAM-1, and CSA, respectively). The protein domain-receptor interactions permit P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IE) to evade elimination in the spleen by adhering to the microvasculature in various organs including the placenta. The sequences for the main components of the fractions, determined by tandem mass spectrometry, yielded four T-superfamily conotoxins, one (CC-Loop-CC) with I-IV, II-III connectivity and three (CC-Loop-CXₐₐC) with a I-III, II-IV connectivity. The 3D structure for one of the latter, NuxVA = GCCPAPLTCHCVIY, revealed a novel scaffold defined by double turns forming a hairpin-like structure stabilized by the two disulfide bonds. Two other main fraction components were a miniM conotoxin, and a O2-superfamily conotoxin with cysteine framework VI/VII. This study is the first one of its kind suggesting the use of conotoxins for developing pharmacological tools for anti-adhesion adjunct therapy against malaria. Similarly, mitigation of emerging diseases like AIDS and COVID-19, can also benefit from conotoxins as inhibitors of protein-protein interactions as treatment.Among the 850+ species of cone snail species there are hundreds of thousands of diverse venom exopeptides that have been selected throughout several million years of evolution to capture prey and deter predators. They do so by targeting several surface proteins present in target excitable cells. This immense biomolecular library of conopeptides can be explored for potential use as therapeutic leads against persistent and emerging diseases affecting non-excitable systems.We aim to expand the pharmacological reach of conotoxins/conopeptides by revealing their in vitro capacity to disrupt protein-protein and protein-polysaccharide interactions that directly contribute to pathology of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This is significant for severe forms of malaria, which might be deadly even after treated with current parasite-killing drugs because of persistent cytoadhesion of P. falciparum infected erythrocytes even when parasites within red blood cells are dead. Anti-adhesion adjunct drugs would de-sequester or prevent additional sequestration of infected erythrocytes and may significantly improve survival of malaria patients. These results provide a lead for further investigations into conotoxins and other venom peptides as potential candidates for anti-adhesion or blockade-therapies.This study is the first of its kind and it suggests that conotoxins can be developed as pharmacological tools for anti-adhesion adjunct therapy against malaria. Similarly, mitigation of emerging diseases like AIDS and COVID-19, can also benefit from conotoxins as potential inhibitors of protein-protein interactions as treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aConus 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aadhesion 3aconotoxins 3acysteine 3adisulfides 3aerythrocyte membrane 3aerythrocytes 3aevolution 3afalciparum malaria 3aintercellular adhesion molecule-1 3apeptides 3aplacenta 3aproteomics 3asnails 3aspleen 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atherapeutics 0aPfEMP1 0aCIDR 0aDBL 0aCD 0aICAM-1 0aCSA 0anAChR 0aConotoxin 0aConopeptide 0aMalaria 0aNuclear magnetic resonance 0aBioPlex assay 0aProteogenomics 0aPlasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 0aConus nux1 aDovell, Sanaz1 aChesnokov, Olga1 aHoggard, Mickelene1 aOleinikov, Andrew V.1 aMarí, Frank0 tJournal of proteomics.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 234 p.104083-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2020.1040833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010900174520203400283592002802317650001102345650001902356650001202375650001802387650001502405650002602420650002502446650002002471650002002491650002102511650001702532650001702549650001202566651001502578651001802593653001802611653002002629653002702649653002502676653002502701653003102726700002302757700002102780700001902801700002802820700002102848773013402869856008503003852000903088655001203097IND60780469520221121144817.0220802e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078046952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.1111092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnelling, Andrea M.10aNutrient availability in the North Pacific region not primarily driven by climate through the Quaternary  aThe subarctic North Pacific Ocean is a relatively understudied region in terms of palaeoclimate, limiting our understanding of how the region has both driven and responded to palaeoenvironmental events. Today, the subarctic North Pacific Ocean is marked by a year round stratified water column with a halocline at c. 300 m water depth. Previous studies at ODP Site 882 in the Northwest Pacific have suggested the stratified water column system developed at the onset of major Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (2.73 Ma). In addition to limiting the upwelling of carbon-rich deep waters and associated ventilation of CO₂ to the atmosphere, the shift to a stratified state fundamentally altered oceanographic conditions and biogeochemical cycling across the region. Key questions remain over whether the region was permanently stratified for all of the Quaternary, or whether the changes in stratification/biogeochemical cycling altered over major climatic transitions such as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), a process that would alter regional ocean-atmospheric carbon exchanges. We present new silicon and oxygen isotope data from diatoms (δ³⁰Sidᵢₐₜₒₘ and δ¹⁸Odᵢₐₜₒₘ), alongside previously published data in order to test the mechanisms of biogeochemical cycling in the subarctic North Pacific Ocean between 2.85 Ma and 0.06 Ma, including influences from the wider region such as Glacial North Pacific Intermediate Water (GNPIW) originating in the Bering Sea. This has enabled us to reconstruct temporal changes in photic zone nutrient utilisation and silicic acid supply in the northwest subarctic Pacific Ocean through the progressive intensification of glacial-interglacial cycles through the Quaternary and over the MPT. We show that prior to the MPT climate does not appear to be a primary controller of nutrient availability in the North Pacific region, but that following the MPT, it has a greater influence, shown by the interrelationship with the upwelling index from the Bering Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aeuphotic zone 3aglaciation 3anutrient availability 3anutrient utilization 3aoxygen isotopes 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3asilicic acid 3asilicon 3aBering Sea 3aPacific Ocean 0aNorth Pacific 0aSilicon isotope 0aBiogeochemical cycling 0aNutrient utilisation 0aOcean stratification 0aMid-Pleistocene Transition1 aSwann, George E.A.1 aPashley, Vanessa1 aLacey, Jack H.1 aHorstwood, Matthew S.A.1 aLeng, Melanie J.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 601 p.111109-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.1111093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009600174500001900270520145000289592002801739650001501767650001901782650001901801650002001820650001801840650001901858650001901877650000901896650001401905650001501919650001701934650001601951650001601967653002701983653001802010653002002028653002502048653002302073700001702096700002702113700002302140700002302163700001602186700002002202700002702222773012302249856008502372852000902457655001202466IND60725994420221122141924.0210212e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072599442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.1067222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aʻAlī, Muḥammad,10aCO2-wettability reversal of cap-rock by alumina nanofluid: Implications for CO2 geo-storage  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe usage of nanofluids is vast in different applications of nano-energy. These minute nanoparticles can be used to alter the hydrophobicity into hydrophilicity for CO₂-brine-mineral systems in the presence of organic acids. Nonetheless, the literature lacks the information for the behavior of nanoparticles and its associated concentrations in the presence of organic acids at the reservoir (high temperature and high pressure) conditions.In this study, we have investigated that how different alkyl chain organic acids impact the wettability of mica muscovite for different ageing times (7 days and one year) and how this impact can be reversed by nanofluid priming at different concentrations. To do that, we have used different organic acids with different alkyl chain lengths (hexanoic acid C₆, lauric acid C₁₂, stearic acid C₁₈, and lignoceric acid C₂₄) at 10⁻² mol/L. We have also used different Al₂O₃ nanoparticle suspensions (0.05 wt%, 0.1 wt%, 0.25 wt% and 0.75 wt%) in deionized water.When mica substrates were exposed to organic acids for a longer ageing time of 1 year, it has lost its water-wetness rapidly at maximum. Whereas this effect was optimally reduced by 0.25 wt% of alumina nano-formulation and mechanical irreversible adsorption of alumina nanoparticles was noted on mica substrates. This reversal of wettability may raise the containment security and CO₂ structural trapping potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3adodecanoic acid 3ahexanoic acid 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amica 3amuscovite 3ananofluids 3astearic acid 3atemperature 3awettability 0aAlumina nano-particles 0aOrganic acids 0aCO2 geo-storage 0aDeep saline aquifers 0aCap-rock formation1 aAftab, Adnan1 aAwan, Faisal Ur Rahman1 aAkhondzadeh, Hamed1 aKeshavarz, Alireza1 aSaeedi, Ali1 aIglauer, Stefan1 aSarmadivaleh, Mohammad0 tFuel processing technology.g2021 Apr., v. 214 p.106722-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.1067223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245011200202300001500314520124900329592002801578596005401606596006801660650002401728650002301752650002501775650001501800650001001815650001801825650001601843650001501859650002401874650001701898650001101915651001001926700001801936700002201954700002101976700001701997700001502014773010202029856008202131852000902213655001202222IND60629672620221119005528.0190509e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062967262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10201-018-0557-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBan, Syuhei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7168-558310aModern lake ecosystem management by sustainable harvesting and effective utilization of aquatic macrophytes  ap. 93-100.  aThere are many problems related to overgrowth of aquatic macrophytes in many lakes and rivers throughout the world; for instance, the harvesting costs in Lake Biwa have been increasing by 200 million Japanese yen a year (equivalent to 1.8 million USD). Historically, aquatic macrophytes were harvested for use as fertilizer in agriculture in Japan, but are no longer in use because chemical fertilizers promote plant growth more effectively and are easier and cheaper to use. Thus, developing effective ways to utilize aquatic macrophytes is important to resolve this issue. In addition, sustainably harvesting macrophytes is also important for aquatic ecosystem management because macrophytes play a key role in aquatic ecosystems as nursery grounds and refuges for other small organisms living in the littoral area. Therefore, management and effective utilization of macrophytes through sustainable harvesting may play an important role in the conservation of lake ecosystems. In this short review, a recycling system using anaerobic digestion (AD) of submerged macrophytes, which were sustainably harvested from lakes, and microalgal mass culturing with AD effluent were introduced as a new technique for the conservation of lake ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  aEnvironment ResearchcMinistry of the Environment  aTechnology Development Fund 4-1406cMinistry of the Environment 3aanaerobic digestion 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aecosystem management 3aharvesting 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3amacrophytes 3amicroalgae 3amineral fertilizers 3aplant growth 3arivers 3aJapan1 aToda, Tatsuki1 aKoyama, Mitsuhiko1 aIshikawa, Kanako1 aKohzu, Ayato1 aImai, Akio0 tLimnology.g2019 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.93-100dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3949861x1439-86217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-018-0557-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012600160300001600286500001900302520121700321592002801538650001201566650001501578650001801593650001601611650001101627650001501638650001601653650001401669650001001683650001401693650001301707650002501720650002501745650000901770650001301779650002101792653001901813653001701832700001801849700002201867773018201889856007402071852000902145655001202154IND60691972220221120220023.0200502e20020101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069197222DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.66.7112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guoying,10aEffects of Dietary Powdered Green Tea and Theanine on Tumor Growth and Endogenous Hyperlipidemia in Hepatoma-bearing Rats  ap. 711-716.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of dietary powdered green tea (PGT) and theanine on in vivo hepatoma growth and cancerous hyperlipidemia were investigated in rats that had been implanted with a rat ascites hepatoma cell line of AH109A cells. The hepatoma-bearing rats were fed with a 20% casein diet (20C), 20C containing 2% PGT, or 20C containing 0.1% theanine for 14 days. Dietary PGT significantly and time-dependently reduced the solid tumor volume and weight as did dietary theanine. The hepatoma-induced endogenous hyperlipidemia, which was characterized by rises in the serum cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) and triglyceride (hypertriglyceridemia) levels, was significantly suppressed by PGT and theanine supplementation. Bile acid excretion into the feces was significantly higher in the PGT- and theanine-fed rats than in the control rats. This inhibition of hypercholesterolemia may have resulted from tumor growth suppression as well as increased excretion of steroids from the body. These results suggest that PGT had both anti-proliferative activity toward hepatoma cells and hypolipidemic activity in the hepatoma bearing rats. They also suggest that theanine was, at least in part, responsible for the PGT actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascites 3abile acids 3abiotechnology 3ablood serum 3acasein 3acell lines 3acholesterol 3aexcretion 3afeces 3agreen tea 3ahepatoma 3ahypercholesterolemia 3ahypertriglyceridemia 3arats 3atheanine 3atriacylglycerols 0ahyperlipidemia 0atumor growth1 aMIURA, Yutaka1 aYagasaki, Kazumi,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2002 Jan. 1, v. 66, no. 4 p.711-716dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.66.7113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001100153245012100164300001800285500001900303520150600322592002801828650001301856650001101869650001601880650001101896650001301907650001401920650003101934650001101965650001901976700005501995700001702050700001602067700005502083700005102138700005602189773011902245856008702364852000902451655001202460IND60736634520221120150450.0210510e20210402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073663452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c040922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aE, Lei10aHigh-Performance Supercapacitor Device with Ultrathick Electrodes Fabricated from All-Cellulose-Based Carbon Aerogel  ap. 8295-8302.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA thick electrode with a high mass loading is one of the promising structural designs to improve the energy density of supercapacitors. However, the slow ion transport and sluggish charge kinetics caused by the increased electrode thickness are still major challenges toward high-performance energy storage devices. Herein, an all-cellulose-based carbon aerogel asymmetric supercapacitor (ACAS) device is successfully assembled by using a thin cellulose aerogel as a separator and cellulose carbon aerogel and RuO₂/cellulose carbon aerogel as the ultrathick anode and cathode, respectively. Benefiting from the 3D hierarchical porous percolation network structure, both cellulose aerogel and carbon aerogel provide continuous pathways that are beneficial to the electrolyte penetration, thereby facilitating the rapid transport of ions and electrons. As a result, the assembled ACAS device achieves an ultrathickness (up to ∼2.3 mm), including the anode (up to 1.2 mm) and the cathode (up to 1.0 mm). Consequently, the ACAS device possesses a high volumetric capacitance of 6.18 F cm–³ and a high energy density (3.4 Wh L–¹) with a maximum power density of 23 W L–¹, which surpass values for the most-reported cellulose-based asymmetric supercapacitor. This work presents a design concept using renewable cellulose materials for the separator and thick electrodes in supercapacitors, which further facilitates the future application of sustainable and high-density energy storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3aanodes 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acathodes 3acellulose 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aenergy 3aenergy density1 aGan, Wentao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2498-65001 aSun, Jiaming1 aWu, Zhenwei1 aMa, Chunhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9590-38911 aLi, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3008-98651 aLiu, Shouxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0491-88850 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Apr. 02, v. 35, no. 9 p.8295-8302dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c040923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01723naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008500158300002000243520074200263592002801005650002001033650001501053650001301068650001101081650001301092700002101105700002301126700002001149700002101169773012401190856007401314852000901388655001201397IND60672061720221121101731.0191009e20191007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067206172DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra07527e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Min Joon10aSynthesis and reactivity of 2-thionoester pyrroles: a route to 2-formyl pyrroles  ap. 31773-31780.  a2-Functionalised pyrroles exhibit considerable synthetic utility.

Here, we examined whether a rotifer species, Brachionus calyciflorus showed a different development degree of induced defenses against its predator Asplanchna and cyclopoid copepods between the microhabitats of a macrophyte bed consisting of Trapa species and open water. B. calyciflorus was more abundant and had larger posterolateral spines as a defensive trait in open water than in the Trapa bed. Asplanchna was more abundant in open water than in the Trapa bed, whereas cyclopoids were more abundant in the Trapa bed. Both of the predators significantly affected the development of the defense trait. The effect of Asplanchna on the defense trait was positive, whereas the effect of cyclopoids was negative. Thus, a spatial difference in the development degree of induced defense between the microhabitats occurred as the dense Trapa bed influenced the abundance of the two predators. The results also suggest that the induced defense of B. calyciflorus was effective in reducing the predation pressure from Asplanchna while B. calyciflorus was not able to avoid predation by cyclopoids in the Trapa bed.  aPublisher supplied data  a25281052cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a26291088cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a23-1251-011cRiver foundation 3aBrachionus calyciflorus 3aCopepoda 3aTrapa 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3amicrohabitats 3apredation 3apredators 3aspatial variation1 aKagami, Maiko1 aKuriyama, Takeo1 aYoshida, Takehito0 tLimnology.g2019 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.29-38dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3949861x1439-86217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-017-0534-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03873naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245016500202500001400367520212900381592002802510650002002538650001302558650001202571650001902583650002102602650002402623650000902647650001602656650002602672650001102698650002202709650001702731650001802748650000902766650001302775650001802788650001302806650001102819650001802830650001102848651001002859653002402869653001702893653001202910700001802922700001502940700005802955700005103013700001303064700001903077773010803096856008203204852000903286655001203295IND60725994720221120094424.0210215e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072599472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2021.1080682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Ruixuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3787-455910aEffects of nitrogen and maize plant density on forage yield and nitrogen uptake in an alfalfa–silage maize relay intercropping system in the North China Plain  aNAL-light  aSustainable production of high-yielding and high-quality forages such as alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is critically important for fast-growing animal husbandry regions such as the North China Plain (NCP). Alfalfa production in this region is limited during the hot-rainy summer period from July–September, but these conditions may allow the production of intercropped silage maize (Zea mays L.) following spring harvests of alfalfa to boost the overall forage production. In this study, an alfalfa–silage maize (AM) relay intercropping system was evaluated in a field experiment from 2017 to 2019 to assess the impact of maize nitrogen (N) fertilization rates of 0, 60, 120, and 180 kg N ha–¹ and maize plant densities of 30,000, 45,000, and 60,000 plants ha–¹ on the forage yield and N uptake. The AM system was compared with alfalfa monocropping (AA) and silage maize monocropping (MM) controls. The 3-yr average land equivalent ratio (LER) and land equivalent ratio for nitrogen yield (LERN) of AM ranged from 1.05 to 1.37 relative to AA and MM, indicating that intercropping was advantageous for improving the overall forage production and N utilization. Intercropping reduced the maize yield by 23–30 % and the maize N yield by 26–35 % compared with the monocultured maize across 3 years. Increasing N fertilization and maize plant density often enhanced the maize yield and N uptake in the AM system. The alfalfa stand density in AM was negatively affected by the increased maize plant density and was 30–55 % lower than that in AA. Spring forage production of alfalfa in the AM and AA systems was similar in most cases, but yields in the AM system were reduced in 2018 and 2019 when maize was grown with the highest N rate (180 kg N ha–¹) and the highest plant density (60,000 plants ha–¹). On the basis of the system yield, N yield, and LER, the AM system with a maize plant density of 45,000 plants ha–¹ fertilized at 120 kg N ha–¹ was the most advantageous and could be recommended as an alternative cropping system in the NCP to increase forage yields with a relatively low input of N.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aZea mays 3aalfalfa 3aalfalfa silage 3aanimal husbandry 3acontinuous cropping 3acorn 3afield crops 3afield experimentation 3aforage 3aforage production 3aforage yield 3aintercropping 3aland 3anitrogen 3aplant density 3aresearch 3aspring 3astand density 3asummer 3aChina 0aRelay intercropping 0aSilage maize 0aN yield1 aZhao, Haiming1 aLiu, Guibo1 aYou, Yongliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5485-21751 aMa, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4268-05961 aLiu, Nan1 aZhang, Yingjun0 tField crops research.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 263 p.108068-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.1080683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245011200178300001600290520126400306592002801570596007301598596008901671650002701760650002101787650002101808650001701829650002501846650002301871650001401894650002101908650000701929650001201936650001301948650001301961650002201974650001601996650001402012650001002026700007202036773012802108856008202236852000902318655001202327IND60675996020221119181314.0191113e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067599602DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-019-03024-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartim, Damaris Batistão10aTwo Novel Acetylesterases from Pantoea dispersa: Recombinant Expression, Purification, and Characterization  ap. 834-854.  aTwo novel acetylesterases from Pantoea dispersa, with low amino acid sequence identity between them, were expressed in Escherichia coli with a carboxyl-His₆ tail given by the expression plasmid, purified, and characterized. The purified proteins, named Est-1 and Est-2, had a molecular mass of 33 kDa and 37 kDa, respectively. Both proteins presented a modeled structure of homodimers with monomers presenting the α/β-hydrolase fold, with the catalytic triad Ser-Asp-His present in the active site. The KM for p-nitrophenyl acetate and Vₘₐₓ values found for Est-1 were of 1.4 ± 0.2 mM and 8.66 ± 0.59 μmol/min and for Est-2 were of 0.36 ± 0.077 mM and 6.13 ± 0.56 μmol/min, respectively. Both enzymes presented an optimum pH of 7.0. The optimum temperature for Est-1 was 40 °C and for Est-2 was 50 °C. The temperatures in which the enzymes Est-1 and Est-2 lost half of their activity (T₅₀) were 44.1 and 58.9 °C, respectively. SDS, EDTA, and PMSF significantly inhibited the enzymes. The two purified enzymes also presented activity against triacetin and were able to deacetylate the carbohydrates pectin and xylan, with higher activity against pectin. Thus, they could be considered as carbohydrate esterases.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  aStudent scholarshipcConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aEscherichia coli 3aPantoea dispersa 3aactive sites 3aamino acid sequences 3acatalytic activity 3aesterases 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apectins 3aplasmids 3aproteins 3asequence analysis 3atemperature 3atriacetin 3axylan1 aBarbosa-Tessmann, Ione Parra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9860-378X0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2019 Nov., v. 189, no. 3 p.834-854dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-019-03024-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03688naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006500138245008700203500001900290500002000309520192600329592002802255596014602283596005102429596006802480650001302548650001802561650001302579650002302592650001902615651001502634700002802649700006202677700006102739700002802800700001902828700002602847700001902873700002102892700002102913700002002934700006002954773012303014856007203137852000903209655001203218IND60733062920221120111250.0210402e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073306292DNAL7 a10.1002/eap.22802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStewart, Joseph A.

Conifer regeneration in these areas is limited because seeds must travel long distances to reach the interior of large burned patches and establishment is jeopardized by increasingly hot and dry conditions. To better inform postfire management in low elevation forests of California, USA, we collected 5‐yr postfire recovery data from 1,234 study plots in 19 wildfires that burned from 2004–2012 and 18 yrs of seed production data from 216 seed fall traps (1999–2017). We used these data in conjunction with spatially extensive climate, topography, forest composition, and burn severity surfaces to construct taxon‐specific, spatially explicit models of conifer regeneration that incorporate climate conditions and seed availability during postfire recovery windows. We found that after accounting for other predictors both postfire and historical precipitation were strong predictors of regeneration, suggesting that both direct effects of postfire moisture conditions and biological inertia from historical climate may play a role in regeneration. Alternatively, postfire regeneration may simply be driven by postfire climate and apparent relationships with historical climate could be spurious. The estimated sensitivity of regeneration to postfire seed availability was strongest in firs and all conifers combined and weaker in pines. Seed production exhibited high temporal variability with seed production varying by over two orders of magnitude among years. Our models indicate that during droughts postfire conifer regeneration declines most substantially in low‐to‐moderate elevation forests. These findings enhance our mechanistic understanding of forecasted and historically documented shifts in the distribution of trees.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center, USGS Ecosystems Mission Area, and USGS Land Change Science Program  a18‐JV‐11272138‐064cUSDA Forrest Service  a8CA04059cCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection 3aaltitude 3aburn severity 3aconifers 3atemporal variation 3atree mortality 3aCalifornia1 avan Mantgem, Phillip J.1 aYoung, Derek J.

While it is known that the successful establishment of fragments in isolated water bodies is largely determined by retention of fragment viability during overland transport (i.e. desiccation resistance), detailed information on species‐specific desiccation resistance is still scarce and the underlying mechanisms remain uncharted. We combined measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence (Fᵥ/Fₘ: maximum quantum yield of photosystem II) with determination of water loss and post‐desiccation survival and regeneration to examine the desiccation resistance of shoot fragments without and with apical tips for six submerged aquatic plant species (Myriophyllum spicatum, Myriophyllum heterophyllum, Ceratophyllum demersum, Lagarosiphon major, Elodea canadensis, Hydrilla verticillata). Overall, the relationship between Fᵥ/Fₘ and relative water loss was nonlinear, and a decrease in Fᵥ/Fₘ was significantly related to reduced fragment survival and regeneration. We determined an overall critical minimum of 0.40 in Fᵥ/Fₘ and a critical maximum of 84% in water loss for regeneration. Differences in the relationships between water loss and desiccation time and between Fᵥ/Fₘ and water loss were species‐specific rather than fragment type‐specific. Plant fragments of M. spicatum (fragments without apices excluded), M. heterophyllum, and C. demersum maintained a high Fᵥ/Fₘ even after losing a large proportion of the initial water content, while the Fᵥ/Fₘ for L. major, E. canadensis, and H. verticillata decreased more rapidly with advancing water loss. Maintaining the function of the photosynthetic apparatus at high water loss can prolong fragment viability during overland transport. Our results suggest that aquatic plants have species‐specific mechanisms to cope with water deficit. Measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence can precisely predict the likelihood of fragment regeneration and constitute a useful tool to assess the spread potential of aquatic plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a20016/450cDeutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt DBU 3aCeratophyllum demersum 3aElodea canadensis 3aHydrilla verticillata 3aLagarosiphon major 3aMyriophyllum spicatum 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3afluorometry 3aphotosystem II 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3asurface water 3aviability 3awater content1 aJahns, Peter1 aHussner, Andreas0 tFreshwater biology.g2019 Aug., v. 64, no. 8 p.1401-1415dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1839x0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.133133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245012300164300001600287500001900303520071500322592002801037650003301065650001301098650001801111650001101129650001401140650002001154650001101174650001401185650002001199650001901219653002501238653002601263653002901289700001801318700002001336773018201356856007401538852000901612655001201621IND60691972620221121024554.0200502e20020101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069197262DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.66.7372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTACHIBANA, Shinjiro10aHeterogeneity of Dehydrogenases of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Showing Dye-linked Activity with Polypropylene Glycols  ap. 737-742.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDistinct enzyme activities were found in extracts from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showing dye-linked oxidation of polypropylene glycols.

Increased lipid peroxidation marked by elevated TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) level, increased protein carbonylation, alterated levels of ascorbate, glutathione and increased activities of enzymes SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), APX (ascorbate peroxidase) and GPX (glutathione peroxidase) were noted in the seedlings on As treatment. Exogenously added leaf aqueous extracts of Azadirachta indica (0.75 mg mL⁻¹, w/v) and Ocimum sanctum (0.87 mg mL⁻¹, w/v) in the growth medium considerably alleviated As toxicity effects in the seedlings, marked by reduced As uptake, restoration of membrane integrity, reduced production of ROS, lowering oxidative damage and restoring the levels of ascorbate, glutathione and activity levels of antioxidative enzymes. Arsenic uptake in the seedlings declined by 72.5% in roots and 72.8% in shoots, when A. indica extract was present in the As treatment medium whereas with O. sanctum extract, the uptake declined by 67.2% in roots and 70.01% in shoots. Results suggest that both A. indica and O. sanctum aqueous extracts have potentials to alleviate arsenic toxicity in rice plants and that A. indica can serve as better As toxicity alleviator compared to O. sanctum.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAzadirachta indica 3aOcimum tenuiflorum 3aOryza sativa 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aarsenic 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abiomass 3acatalase 3aculture media 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroponics 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amembrane permeability 3anutrient solutions 3arice 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asodium arsenite 3asuperoxide anion 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atoxicity1 aPandey, Akhilesh Kumar1 aDubey, R.

A previous report showed that dominant expression of splicing variants in the Orange (Or) gene causes β-carotene accumulation in cauliflower curd. In this study, we focused on a putative orthologue of the cauliflower or gene in rice, Osor, and attempt to accumulate β-carotene in rice callus by modification of the Osor gene via genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9. FINDINGS: CRISPR/Cas9 vectors for the Osor gene were constructed and transformed into rice calli. Some transformed calli showed orange color due to β-carotene hyper-accumulation. Molecular analyses suggest that orange-colored calli are due to an abundance of in-frame aberrant Osor transcripts, whereas out-of-frame mutations were not associated with orange color. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that directed gene modification of the Osor gene via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing results in β-carotene fortification in rice calli. To date, golden rice, which accumulates β-carotene in rice endosperm, has been developed by conventional transgenic approaches. Our results suggest an alternative approach to enhancing β-carotene accumulation in crops.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aOryza sativa 3abeta-carotene 3abiofortification 3acallus 3acauliflower 3acrops 3adeveloping countries 3aendosperm 3agene editing 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3amutation 3arice 3avitamin A 3avitamin A deficiency1 aSaika, Hiroaki1 aTakemura, Miho1 aMisawa, Norihiko1 aToki, Seiichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0066-64460 tRice.g2019 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.81-81dSpringer USwJournal:J000001787x1939-84257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12284-019-0345-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01514naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003700149245009800186300001800284500001900302520048900321592002800810650001300838650001200851650001500863650001300878650001600891650001400907700006600921773012100987856008301108852000901191655001201200IND60741776020221120182714.0210618e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074177602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c015752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShambhavi, Chikkabagilu Nagaraju10aRuthenium(II)-Catalyzed Redox-Neutral C–H Alkylation of Arylamides with Unactivated Olefins  ap. 4849-4854.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA Ru(II)-catalyzed weak chelating group-aided ortho-C–H alkylation of arylamides with unactivated olefins in a redox-neutral fashion has been demonstrated.

Samples containing E. coli were stored at 4, −24 and −80 °C overnight before they were pressurized. A maximum of 1.83 log reduction of CFU·ml⁻¹ was obtained following a 9-min treatment at 400 MPa and 4 ± 1 °C in samples stored at 4 °C whereas, 5.63 and 6.83 log reductions were obtained in samples frozen at −24 and −80 °C, respectively. Major disruption of E. coli cells observed by scanning electron microscopy and increased amounts of DNA and RNA measured in pressure treated frozen PBS samples indicated that the main mechanism of inactivation in frozen samples was due to cell rapture. The validity of enhanced microbial inactivation by freezing before HHP for a real food system was tested by using orange juice. Pressurization (250 MPa, 15 min) of frozen (−80 °C) orange juice resulted in 4.88, 4.15 and 4.61 log CFU·ml⁻¹ reductions in number of E. coli for the samples having pH 3.2, 4.5 and 5.8, respectively. In the absence of freezing, the same treatment caused only up to 0.42 log reduction in samples having pH 4.5 and 5.8.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli K12 3aRNA 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aorange juice 3apH 3aphosphates 3aresponse surface methodology 3asynergism 0aHigh hydrostatic pressure processing 0aEscherichia coli, cell rapture 0aFrozen state 0aOrange juice1 aKaratzas, Kimon A.G.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Jan., v. 136 p.110313-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1103133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010000163500001900263520126400282592002801546650002601574650001001600650001301610650001301623650001101636650001501647650002301662650001401685650001401699650004301713650002401756650001001780653002701790653001001817653002501827653001801852653000901870653000901879653000701888653000901895653001101904653001001915653001101925653000901936653000901945653000801954653000701962653000701969653000701976653000801983653000701991653000801998653000702006653000702013653000702020653000702027653000702034653000702041653000702048700001502055700001302070700001602083700005902099700001802158700001702176700001602193700005402209773008802263856008302351852000902434655001202443IND60696289720221119123640.0200705e20200830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069628972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2020.1447992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Jie10aAssociation analysis of KMT2D copy number variation as a positional candidate for growth traits  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCopy number variations (CNVs) are an important source of genetic variation, which can affect a wide range of economic traits by diverse mechanisms. KMT2D (Lysine methyltransferase 2D) is an important positional candidate for growth traits. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with large effects on economically important traits cover the KMT2D gene. The KMT2D gene overlays a CNV within its exons, hence it was chosen as a crucial candidate gene to study the association between CNV and growth traits. Further, KMT2D, a major mammalian histone H3K4 mono-methyltransferase, plays a critical role in regulating development, differentiation, metabolism, and tumor suppression. Therefore, we proposed the hypothesis that KMT2D CNV may have phenotypic effects on sheep growth traits. In our study, KMT2D CNVs in three Chinese sheep breeds were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and the loss copy was found to be the dominant genotype. Association analysis between growth traits and KMT2D CNV was also performed, which revealed that individuals with the median copy showed better performance than those with the loss copy in all three breeds. This research suggested that KMT2D CNV can be used as a promising marker for sheep molecular breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopy number variation 3aexons 3agenotype 3ahistones 3alysine 3ametabolism 3amethyltransferases 3aneoplasms 3aphenotype 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative traits 3asheep 0aCopy number variations 0aKMT2D 0aAssociation analysis 0aGrowth traits 0aCNVs 0aCNVR 0aSV 0aSNPs 0aIndels 0aKMT2D 0aANKRD1 0aaCGH 0aqPCR 0aQTL 0aWH 0aBW 0aBL 0aBOL 0aHW 0aCBC 0aCG 0aCW 0aCD 0aRW 0aHS 0aSS 0aCS1 aJiang, Rui1 aYang, Yu1 aCao, Xiukai1 aHuang, Yongzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4477-58551 aLan, Xianyong1 aLei, Chuzhao1 aHu, Linyong1 aChen, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1546-47910 tGene.g2020 Aug. 30, v. 753 p.144799-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.1447993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012200172300001800294520102400312592002801336650004401364650002201408650001401430650001501444650001401459650002001473650001201493650001301505650001101518650003301529650001601562650002101578650002401599653001201623653002401635653001401659653002701673700001801700700001601718700001401734773009901748856008501847852000901932655001201941IND60581259820221117204656.0180914e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058125982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2017.07.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlsharifi, Mariam10aBiodiesel production from canola oil using novel Li/TiO2 as a heterogeneous catalyst prepared via impregnation method  ap. 1077-1089.  aThis study focused on the development of heterogeneous catalyst for transesterification process by implanting lithium onto TiO2 by wet impregnation process. A series of Li/TiO2 was prepared with different amounts of Li (20, 30, 40 wt %) and at different calcination temperatures (450, 600, 750). The Li/TiO2 catalysts were characterized by several spectroscopic and analytical techniques like XRD, FT-IR, BET, TG-DSC and FESEM. The XRD study revealed that the insertion of Li improved the catalyst efficiency without any alteration in structure of TiO2. Li/TiO2 catalysts with 30%w/w Li and calcined at 600 °C was found to be the most efficient with 98% transesterification yield. The best performance of catalyst was achieved with methanol to oil ratio of 24:1, 5 wt % of catalyst loading, at 55 °C reaction temperatures for 3 h of reaction time. The kinetic studies revealed the transesterification process was compatible with the zero order model. However the reusability decreases after every successive use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiodiesel 3acanola oil 3acatalysts 3afuel production 3alithium 3amethanol 3amodels 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3atransesterification 0aLi/TiO2 0aTransesterification 0aBiodiesel 0aHeterogeneous catalyst1 aZnad, Hussein1 aHena, Sufia1 aAng, Ming0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Dec., v. 114 p.1077-1089dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.07.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03796naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245010100214300001600315520201800331592002802349650001502377650001202392650001602404650001202420650001202432650001802444650002002462650001202482650002002494650001902514651002102533651001502554653003702569653001802606653001602624653002502640653001902665700006402684700001702748700005802765700002802823700002402851700003102875700002302906700001902929700001802948700005702966773013403023856008803157852000903245655001203254IND60649466020221119065757.0200509e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064946602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.5242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamanillo, Marina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0753-474810aDistribution of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) in distinct regions of the Southern Ocean  ap. 736-748.  aTransparent exopolymer particles (TEP) are an abundant class of suspended organic particles, mainly formed by polysaccharides, which play important roles in biogeochemical and ecological processes in the ocean. In this study we investigated horizontal and vertical TEP distributions (within the euphotic layer, including the upper surface) and their short-term variability along with a suite of environmental and biological variables in four distinct regions of the Southern Ocean. TEP concentrations in the surface (4 m) averaged 102.3 ± 40.4 μg XG eq. L⁻¹ and typically decreased with depth. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration was a better predictor of TEP variability across the horizontal (R² = 0.66, p < 0.001) and vertical (R² = 0.74, p < 0.001) scales than prokaryotic heterotrophic abundance and production. Incubation experiments further confirmed the main role of phytoplankton as TEP producers. The highest surface TEP concentrations were found north of the South Orkney Islands (144.4 ± 21.7 μg XG eq. L⁻¹), where the phytoplankton was dominated by cryptophytes and haptophytes; however, the highest TEP:Chl a ratios were found south of these islands (153.4 ± 29.8 μg XG eq (μg Chl a)⁻¹, compared to a mean of 79.3 ± 54.9 μg XG eq (μg Chl a)⁻¹ in the whole cruise, in association with haptophyte dominance, proximity of sea ice and high exposure to solar radiation. TEP were generally enriched in the upper surface (10 cm) respect to 4 m, despite a lack of biomass enrichment, suggesting either upward transport by positive buoyancy or bubble scavenging, or higher production at the upper surface by light stress or aggregation. TEP concentrations did not present any significant cyclic diel pattern. Altogether, our results suggest that photobiological stress, sea ice melt and turbulence add to phytoplankton productivity in driving TEP distribution across the Antarctic Peninsula area and Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaptophyta 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aislands 3amelting 3aphytoplankton 3apolysaccharides 3asea ice 3asolar radiation 3aturbulent flow 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 0aTransparent exopolymer particles 0aPhytoplankton 0aProkaryotes 0aSolar radiation dose 0aSouthern Ocean1 aOrtega-Retuerta, Eva1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0780-83471 aNunes, Sdena1 aEstrada, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5769-94981 aSala, María Montserrat1 aRoyer, Sarah-Jeanne1 aLópez-Sandoval, Daffne C.1 aEmelianov, Mikhail1 aVaqué, Dolors1 aMarrasé, C.,1 aSimó, Rafel,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3276-76630 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 691 p.736-748dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.5243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011000171300001800281520117900299592002801478650000801506650001901514650001901533650001901552650001801571650002501589650001401614650001501628650001801643650002901661650001601690653001101706653001801717653001401735653002201749653002001771653002201791700001601813700002001829700002301849773009201872856008501964852000902049655001202058IND60629969820221121180849.0210904e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062996982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.01.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamadan, Mohamad10aMixed numerical - Experimental approach to enhance the heat pump performance by drain water heat recovery  ap. 1010-1021.  aTo reduce the carbon dioxide foot print, it is unescapable to adopt an energy policy that incorporates simultaneously renewable energy systems as well as smart energy strategies such as heat recovery. In the frame of this view, a heat recovery approach is suggested. The heat is recovered from drain water. It is then utilized to enhance the performance of heat pump within two schemes. Directly by replacing the ambient air heating the evaporator and indirectly by preheating the air heated by the condenser. The suggested approach is a numerical and experimental method that, on one hand, relies on experiments to determine the temperature of the drain water and on the other hand, it uses an iterative procedure to solve the energy balance equation and the mass balance equation. To that end an in-house code is developed. It allows to evaluate the heat efficiency of the heat recovery system as well as the performance of the heat pump. It has been shown that using such system may enhance the Coefficient of Performance up to 400%. In addition, economic and environmental studies are performed to assess the economic and environmental impact of the proposed techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3adrainage water 3aenergy balance 3aenergy policy 3aenvironmental impact 3aequations 3aheat pumps 3aheat recovery 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 0aEnergy 0aHeat recovery 0aHeat pump 0aEnergy efficiency 0aEnergy recovery 0aEnergy management1 aMurr, Rabih1 aKhaled, Mahmoud1 aOlabi, Abdul Ghani0 tEnergy.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 149 p.1010-1021dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.01.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005300153245008900206520193200295592002802227650001302255650000902268650001202277650001202289650001602301650001302317650000902330650002002339651001202359653003002371653002102401653002502422653002302447653002202470653001502492700002102507773012702528856008802655852000902743655001202752IND60746597620221122053041.0220205e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074659762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1085652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGobin, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3742-706210aSpatio-temporal variability of dry and wet spells and their influence on crop yields  aSpatial modelling of extreme dry (wet) spells is relevant to design agricultural insurances and establish risk management strategies. We characterised dry (wet) spells during the period 1971–2010 in 133 rainfall stations and investigated their impact on crop yields across Belgium. A day was considered as a dry (wet) day when the total amount of rainfall is below (above) 0.2 mm. A two-way ANOVA demonstrated significant differences between low and high yields across 12 agricultural regions in the number of consecutive dry (wet) days, rainfall amount during the wet days and their total during the crop growing season. Generalised Extreme Value distributions were fitted to the maxima series using maximum likelihood to estimate the distribution parameters. The number of consecutive dry (wet) days and rainfall amount was considered during the cropping season between March and October. We modelled maxima observed at rainfall stations by means of max-stable processes, an extension of multivariate extreme value theory. Spatial extreme modelling was performed through pairwise likelihood inference by a madogram and enabled 20-year return levels to be simulated across regions based on geographic coordinates and altitude as covariates. Spatial return levels confirmed the exceptionality of 2016 and 2018 as extreme wet and dry years with high return periods. The 2018 drought resulted in yield reductions of 74% for maize and 42% for potato, while the 2016 rainfall induced yield losses of up to 39% for winter cereals, 45% for maize and 53% for potato. The max-stable models provided a good fit to the joint behaviour of extremes in the number of consecutive dry (wet) days during the growing season as an indication for crop stress. The method allows for spatio-temporal characterisation of generalised extreme value distributions across regions, and provides a tool for weather based insurances and risk management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acorn 3adrought 3aforests 3ameteorology 3apotatoes 3arain 3arisk management 3aBelgium 0aGeneralised extreme value 0aSpatial extremes 0aMax-stable processes 0aDry and wet spells 0aAgricultural risk 0aCrop yield1 aVan de Vyver, H.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 308-309 p.108565-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1085653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01513naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245009400178300001800272520048100290592002800771650001600799650002300815650002300838650002200861650002200883700001700905700001200922700005300934773012000987856008301107852000901190655001201199IND60646408920221119125902.0190610e20190529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064640892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b010632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotagiri, Rajendraprasad10aStereospecific Synthesis of (E)-5-Tetrasubstituted-ylidene-3,5-dihydro-4H-imidazol-4-ones  ap. 3946-3949.  aA stereospecific synthesis of (E)-5-tetrasubstituted-ylidene-3,5-dihydro-4H-imidazol-4-one derivatives is demonstrated through a cascade process by combination of a Michael addition and Boulton–Katritzky rearrangement.

These greenhouse gases, along with carbon dioxide (CO2), are the three most prominent atmospheric constituents contributing to current global warming. This study investigates the exchange of CH4, N2O and CO2 exchange in an Australian tropical ephemeral wetland (Fogg Dam) and the environmental factors controlling these fluxes. Wetland Net Ecosystem Production (NEP) was determined using CO2 exchange measurements using eddy covariance over 3 years. CH4 and N2O gas exchanges were measured in short campaigns during December 2006 (dry season) and February and March 2007 (wet season). The extensive coverage of vegetation in the wetland during both wet and dry seasons led to a large annual NEP (sink) of +1129.4±70.4gCO2m−2yr−1 or +3.07MgCha−1y−1. Instantaneous, non-CO2 fluxes of CH4 and N2O on a CO2 equivalent basis were near zero during the dry season. However, during the wet season the CH4 source offsets approximately 93% of the CO2 sink, and N2O emission offset <1% of the CO2 sink. The primary environmental factor controlling the greenhouse gas emissions was soil water content as temperature did not vary significantly seasonally.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adry season 3aeddy covariance 3aenvironmental factors 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amethane 3anet ecosystem production 3anitrous oxide 3asoil water content 3atropics 3awet season 3aAustralia 0aEphemeral wetland 0aMethane 0aNitrous oxide 0aCarbon dioxide 0aWild rice1 aLivesley, Stephen J.1 aRandle, Jennifer1 aHutley, Lindsay B.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 182-183 p.239-247dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2013.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245013300186300001400319520109900333592002801432650001101460650002301471650001801494650002901512650002001541650001501561650001101576650002001587651002301607700002201630700001701652700002301669700002501692700001701717700001801734700001901752700001801771700002201789773009701811856004801908852000901956655001201965IND50090051220221122042341.0140612e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009005122DNAL7 a248618962pmid7 a10.1007/s11120-014-0011-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUragami, Chiasa10aLight-dependent conformational change of neoxanthin in a siphonous green alga, Codium intricatum, revealed by Raman spectroscopy  ap. 69-77.  aSiphonous green algae, a type of deep-sea green algae, appear olive drab and utilize blue–green light for photosynthesis. A siphonous green alga, Codium (C.) intricatum, was isolated from Okinawa prefecture in Japan, and a clonal algal culture in filamentous form was established. The major light-harvesting antenna was analogous to the trimeric LHCII found in higher plants, but the C. intricatum complex contained an unusual carbonyl carotenoid siphonaxanthin. Culture conditions were optimized to achieve high siphonaxanthin content in intact lyophilized filamentous bodies. Interestingly, the carotenoid composition was different when cultured under high irradiance: all-trans neoxanthin was accumulated in addition to the normal 9′-cis form in whole cell extract. Resonance Raman spectra of intact filamentous bodies, cultured under high- and low-light conditions, confirmed the accumulation of all-trans neoxanthin under high irradiance conditions. A plausible function of the presence of all-trans neoxanthin will be discussed in relation to the regulation against high light stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCodium 3aRaman spectroscopy 3afreeze drying 3alight harvesting complex 3alight intensity 3aneoxanthin 3aolives 3aseaweed culture 3aRyukyu Archipelago1 aGalzerano, Denise1 aGall, Andrew1 aShigematsu, Yusuke1 aMeisterhans, Maïwen1 aOka, Naohiro1 aIha, Masahiko1 aFujii, Ritsuko1 aRobert, Bruno1 aHashimoto, Hideki0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2014 July, v. 121, no. 1 p.69-77dSpringer-Verlagx0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-014-0011-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010800169300001600277520184000293592002802133650001502161650001102176650002002187650002402207650002102231650002202252650001602274650001302290650001902303650002202322650001902344650001202363653002002375653001202395653002402407653002702431700001902458700002102477700001902498773012502517856008302642852000902725655001202734IND60782699520221116222223.0220830e20221115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078269952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahpeima, Soraya10aElectro-polymerization rates of diazonium salts are dependent on the crystal orientation of the surface  ap. 985-994.  aElectro-polymerization of diazonium salts is widely used for modifying surfaces with thin organic films. Initially this method was primarily applied to carbon, then to metals, and more recently to semiconducting Si. Unlike on other surfaces, electrochemical reduction of diazonium salts on Si, which is one of the most industrially dominant material, is not well understood. Here, we report the electrochemical reduction of diazonium salts on a range of silicon electrodes of different crystal orientations (111, 211, 311, 411, and 100). We show that the kinetics of surface reaction and the reduction potential is Si crystal-facet dependent and is more favorable in the hierarchical order (111) > (211) > (311) > (411) > (100), a finding that offers control over the surface chemistry of diazonium salts on Si. The dependence of the surface reaction kinetics on the crystal orientation was found to be directly related to differences in the potential of zero charge (PZC) of each crystal orientation, which in turn controls the adsorption of the diazonium cations prior to reduction. Another consequence of the effect of PZC on the adsorption of diazonium cations, is that molecules terminated by distal diazonium moieties form a compact film in less time and requires less reduction potentials compared to that formed from diazonium molecules terminated by only one diazo moiety. In addition, at higher concentrations of diazonium cations, the mechanism of electrochemical polymerization on the surface becomes PZC-controlled adsorption-dominated inner-sphere electron transfer while at lower concentrations, diffusion-based outer-sphere electron transfer dominates. These findings help understanding the electro-polymerization reaction of diazonium salts on Si en route towards an integrated molecular and Si electronics technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3adiazo compounds 3adiazonium compounds 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aelectronics 3amoieties 3apolymerization 3areaction kinetics 3asemiconductors 3asilicon 0aDiazonium salts 0aSilicon 0aCrystal orientation 0aElectro-polymerization1 aLe Brun, Anton1 aRaston, Colin L.1 aDarwish, Nadim0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Nov. 15, v. 626 p.985-994dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009900157300001800256500002000274520126400294592002801558596001201586596000901598650002601607650001601633650001401649650000901663650001901672650001701691650000901708650002001717650002701737650001801764650001201782700002501794700001501819700001601834700002701850700001601877773012401893856007402017852000902091655001202100IND60786977420221120031929.0220807e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078697742DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.132602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTentelier, C.10aTesting mate choice and overdominance at MH in natural families of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar  ap. 1644-1659.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study aimed to test mate choice and selection during early life stages on major histocompatibility (MH) genotype in natural families of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar spawners and juveniles, using nine microsatellites to reconstruct families, one microsatellite linked to an MH class I gene and one minisatellite linked to an MH class II gene. MH‐based mate choice was only detected for the class I locus on the first year, with lower expected heterozygosity in the offspring of actually mated pairs than predicted under random mating. The genotype frequencies of MH‐linked loci observed in the juveniles were compared with frequencies expected from Mendelian inheritance of parental alleles to detect selection during early life stages. No selection was detected on the locus linked to class I gene. For the locus linked to class II gene, observed heterozygosity was higher than expected in the first year and lower in the second year, suggesting overdominance and underdominance, respectively. Within family, juveniles' body size was linked to heterozygosity at the same locus, with longer heterozygotes in the first year and longer homozygotes in the second year. Selection therefore seems to differ from one locus to the other and from year to year.  aPublisher supplied data  cUPV/EHU  cUPPA 3aMendelian inheritance 3aSalmo salar 3abody size 3afish 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3aloci 3amating behavior 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aoverdominance 3aprogeny1 aBarroso‐Gomila, O.1 aLepais, O.1 aManicki, A.1 aRomero‐Garmendia, I.1 aJugo, B.

It is typically measured at low throughput with manual implements or approximated on-the-go with unique systems, limiting the robustness and broader applicability of data sets. This work assessed the viability of planter downforce as an on-the-go and relatively standardized means to collect soil strength data. Manually sampled soil mechanical and physical property data was collected and compared with planter downforce. Medium to high relationships were observed between planter downforce and vane shear strength (r² = 0.76), cone penetration resistance (r² = 0.67), and bulk density (r² = 0.78). These indicate planter downforce – a dataset extensively collected by modern planters – has the potential to meaningfully describe distributions of soil strength in agricultural fields, and thereby serve as a useful soil informatics dataset to improve modeling of crop development and productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abulk density 3adata collection 3amodels 3aresistance to penetration 3ashear strength 3asoil strength 3aviability 0aSoil strength 0aPlanter downforce 0aOn-the-go sensors1 aRyan, Bradley J.1 aTechnow, Frank1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2497-31361 aMyers, D.

Matsum. and Nakai] have periodically suffered large losses from a disease caused by Squash vein yellowing virus (SqVYV), which is transmitted by the whitefly Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1), formerly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) biotype B. Common cucurbit weeds like balsam apple (Momordica charantia L.) and smellmelon [Cucumis melo var. dudaim (L.) Naud.] are natural hosts of SqVYV, and creeping cucumber (Melothria pendula L.) is an experimental host. Study objectives were to compare these weeds and ‘Mickylee’ watermelon as sources of inoculum for SqVYV via MEAM1 transmission, to determine weed susceptibility to SqVYV, and to evaluate whitefly settling and oviposition behaviors on infected vs. mock-inoculated (inoculated with buffer only) creeping cucumber leaves. We found that the lowest percentage of watermelon recipient plants was infected when balsam apple was used as a source of inoculum. Watermelon was more susceptible to infection than balsam apple or smellmelon. However, all weed species were equally susceptible to SqVYV when inoculated by whitefly. For the first 5 h after release, whiteflies had no preference to settle on infected vs. mock-inoculated creeping cucumber leaves. After 24 h, whiteflies preferred to settle on mock-inoculated leaves, and more eggs were laid on mock-inoculated creeping cucumber leaves than on SqVYV-infected leaves. The transmission experiments (source of inoculum and susceptibility) show these weed species as potential inoculum sources of the virus. The changing settling preference of whiteflies from infected to mock-inoculated plants could lead to rapid spread of virus in the agroecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant viruses 3aagroecosystems 3aBemisia tabaci 3aplant diseases and disorders 3awatermelons 3aoviposition 3ahosts 3acucumbers 3aCitrullus lanatus 3aMelothria pendula 3aCucumis 3aleaves 3aSquash vein yellowing virus 3aMomordica charantia 3aviruses 3abiological resistance 3aeggs 3aweeds 3ainoculum 0avirus source 0asusceptibility 0ainsect-vector 0aweed 0aHemiptera1 aMcAuslane, H.

High socio-economic status (SES) was defined as >high school education and poverty–income ratio (PIR) >350 %, low SES as <high school level or PIR <130 %. Dietary intakes were assessed using 24 h recalls.SettingMetropolitan statistical area-central city, -suburban, and rural areas in the USA.SubjectsUS adults (n 2797; 1460 men, 1337 women) aged 20–64 years.ResultsApproximately 80 % of Americans reported using FL, including checking the nutrition panel, list of ingredients, short phrases, serving size, or health benefits. Only 26 % used all FL information. Compared with white women of higher SES, white men, black men and women with lower SES were 77–90 % less likely to use FL. Rural residents were 40 % less likely (OR = 0·60; 95 % CI 0·42, 0·86). Participants with good nutrition knowledge, perceptions and beliefs were twice as likely to check FL for nutrient content of foods (OR = 2·28; 95 % CI 1·53–3·40). Those who were unaware of diet–disease relationships were less likely to use FL (OR = 0·53; 95 % CI 0·32–0·85). Among overweight/obese Americans (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²), those who perceived their weight ‘about right’ were 51 % less likely to use FL than those perceiving themselves as overweight.ConclusionsMen, especially black men, women of low SES, rural residents and overweight Americans with inaccurate self-perception of body weight are less likely to use FL and should be targeted for increased intervention.  aPublisher supplied data 3anutrient content 3afoods 3asociodemographic characteristics 3apoverty 3arural population 3aage 3aurban areas 3aWhites 3aobesity 3arural areas 3aBlacks 3adiet recall 3aadults 3anutrition labeling 3awomen 3aserving size 3asuburban areas 3aingredients 3ademographic statistics 3afood beliefs 3amen 3anutritional intervention 3aDiet and Health Knowledge Survey 3aAmericans 3aContinuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals 3abody mass index 3aself-perception 3afood intake 3aincome 3asocioeconomic status 3asecondary education 3ahealth information 3aeducational status 3anutrition knowledge 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0aoverweight1 aJahns, Lisa1 aGittelsohn, Joel1 aWang, Youfa0 tPublic health nutrition.g2012 May, v. 15, no. 5 p.760-772dCambridge University Pressx1475-27277nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/581253Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1368980011002242  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/HNRC1681.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01562naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245012000163300001800283520047100301592002800772650001400800650001700814650003600831650002300867650001300890650001100903650001200914700001600926700001500942700005500957773012001012856008301132852000901215655001201224IND60646409220221119130059.0190610e20190517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064640922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b011012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Zhe10aRhodium(III)-Catalyzed Intramolecular Olefin Hydroarylation of Aromatic Aldehydes Using a Transient Directing Group  ap. 3959-3962.  aA Rh(III)-catalyzed intramolecular olefin hydroarylation of aromatic aldehydes with a transient directing group has been described.

Kaplan-Meier graphs were used to depict differences in survival functions between exposure groups and Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for associations between being clinical FMD cases and the following fertility outcomes: age at first calving; fertility failure related culling (not in calf); time to first service; time to conception. Potential confounding variables investigated and controlled for were age, breed, parity, stage of lactation/gestation and eligibility for service. A case control study was nested within the cohort to investigate the effects of disease on conception HR following calving by comparing animals susceptible to fertility suppression at the time of the outbreak (cases) to animals that had conceived prior to the outbreak (controls).The median age of first calving in clinically affected young-stock was 2.7 months higher than non-clinical cases (adjusted HR = 0.37, 95%CI 0.21–0.67, P = 0.01). There was no evidence of a difference in fertility related culling and times to first service and conception. Animals susceptible to fertility suppression at the time of the outbreak had a lower hazard of conception compared to animals served prior to the outbreak (HR = 0.56, 95%CI 0.41–0.75, P = 0.01). Within the herd, the odds of being a case decreased with parity and age likely related to the lifetime number of vaccination doses received which may reduce the impact among older animals in the herd. Moreover, one would expect the impact to be higher in a non-vaccinating herd to be higher. Notwithstanding these limitations, the results of this study provide evidence that FMD outbreaks in endemic settings impact herd fertility performance. An increased age at first calving is likely to increase rearing costs and reduce an animal’s lifetime productivity while poorer conception rates will likely extend calving intervals. Impaired herd fertility and production will incur higher costs to the farmer and society as animals are less productive which for FMD can extend beyond the outbreak period where economic studies tend to focus. These impacts of FMD on herd fertility should be considered when conducting benefit-cost analyses of FMD control to inform resource allocation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acalves 3acalving 3acase-control studies 3acohort studies 3aconception 3acost benefit analysis 3adairy herds 3adata collection 3afarmers 3afemales 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3agraphs 3alactation 3apregnancy 3arearing 3aregression analysis 3aresource allocation 3asociety 3avaccination 3aKenya 0aFoot-and-mouth disease 0aEconomic impact 0aFertility 0aEndemic1 aRushton, Jonathan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5450-42021 aDulu, Thomas Daido1 aLyons, Nicholas Anthony0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 159 p.57-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03528naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001700162245010300179300001800282520202900300592002802329650002602357650001902383650001002402650001202412650001402424650002402438650002102462650001702483650001902500650000902519650001502528650001102543650001102554650001302565650001202578650002102590650001102611650004502622650003702667650000902704650002002713650001402733650003402747650001202781700001902793773010002812856007702912852000902989655001202998IND60083422620221120173946.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008342262DNAL7 a229169432pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-47062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCarthy, J.10aEstimation of genetic parameters for test-day records of dairy traits in a seasonal calving system  ap. 5365-5377.  aVariance components for test-day milk yield were estimated for primiparous animals in a seasonal calving system where 80% of calvings occur within a 5-mo period in the spring. The objective was to investigate if the variance components of milk production were affected by seasonality via month in milk and test month (TM). These effects were, therefore, fitted for both the permanent environment effect and additive genetic effect. Estimates of heritability (0.14–0.27) were found to be lowest during early and late lactation for all calving months. The peak in heritability (0.22–0.27) occurred later in lactation for animals that calved toward the end of the spring calving season. Genetic variance of test day milk yield for all calving months was found to be highest at the beginning of the lactation (2.23–3.36kg²), with a plateau toward the middle of the lactation. Genetic variance was found to be highest (2.98–3.36kg²) for animals calving early in the season. Genetic correlations between corresponding stages of lactation were strongest (0.99–1.00) between consecutive calving months. Genetic correlations were slightly weaker when intervals between calving months increased; however, they remained above 0.96 in all cases. Akaike’s information criterion values from models both inclusive and exclusive of TM, suggest that the model exclusive of TM is the preferred model. Estimated breeding values of lactation milk yield from bulls with 20 or more daughters, predicted for a full 305-d lactation, were used to compare the model with the standard test-day model (i.e., exclusive of TM), based on DIM. Correlations were higher than 0.995 for milk yield (and higher than 0.930 for persistency) between models inclusive and exclusive of TM, suggesting that given the straightforward approach taken in the current study, an apparent benefit for including seasonality in the evaluation of test-day milk yield was not found; however, there may be benefits of including it in the estimation of persistency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive gene effects 3abreeding value 3abulls 3acalving 3adaughters 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic variance 3aheritability 3alate lactation 3amilk 3amilk yield 3amodels 3aspring 3avariance 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aLactationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMale 2aModels, Genetic 2aPregnancy 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aSeasons1 aVeerkamp, R.F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Sept., v. 95, no. 9 p.5365-5377dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-47063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010600172300001600278520125000294592002801544650002501572650001101597650002201608650001601630650000901646650001501655650001801670653002901688653002401717653002201741653003401763653001001797700002901807700002201836700002601858700001601884700002101900700002101921773009001942856008502032852000902117655001202126IND60629970120221121010422.0190207e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062997012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.01.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, P.A.

The blade pitch control is an effective method to improve the aerodynamic response of a wind turbine, usually applied to large-scale wind turbines. This study presents the effects of varied blade pitch on the aerodynamic performance of a small-size wind turbine. The blades were sketched out according to the Blade Element Moment (BEM) theory, applying the aerodynamic profile NREL-S809 and designed for a tip speed ratio of eight. To analyze the influence of the blade pitch angle on the energy conversion, a comparative study was carried out varying the pitch angle to five different values. Using the analysis of variance (ANOVA), it was possible to demonstrate that blade pitch control could be an effective method also for small-sized wind turbines. A performance chart from the results of blade pitch experiments shows that the power coefficient varies significantly when the angle changes. As conclusion, it is highlighted that an enhanced behavior could be attained by the use of a pitch angle controller resulting in a better recovery of the energy available in the wind.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3ablades 3aenergy conversion 3aurban areas 3awind 3awind power 3awind turbines 0aSmall-scale wind turbine 0aPitch angle control 0aUrban environment 0aBlade element momentum theory 0aANOVA1 aCarneiro de Araujo, J.W.1 aLima, R.J.

The nesting eagles produced 1 fledgling in 2004 and 2 fledglings in 2005. Our assessment of landcover types within a 5-km radius of the nest indicated that grasslands accounted for most of the area (90%%), followed by agricultural lands (8%%). Black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies occupied 2.5%% of the area, and single human residences with associated structures (i.e., barns) occupied <1%%. The nearest source of permanent surface water >2.5 ha in surface area was 51 km from the nest. An analysis of regurgitated castings collected near the nest revealed a mammalian-dominated, breeding-season diet with black-tailed prairie dogs occurring in 80.9%% of the castings. Other identified prey included cottontails (Sylvilagus spp., 15.9%%), black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus, 3.2%%), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana, 3.2%%), and plains pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius, 1.6%%). Bird remains were also present in 34.9%% of the castings. This is the first reported successful nesting of Bald Eagles in the panhandle region of Texas since 1916; the nest is particularly unique because of its distance from any substantial body of water.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBald Eagle 0agrassland 0aHaliaeetus leucocephalus 0aprairie 0aprairie dog 0aTexas1 aGiovanni, Matthew D.1 aBeall, Blake N.0 tWestern North American naturalist.g2006 Apr., v. 66, no. 2 p.246-250dBrigham Young Universityx1527-09047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3398%2F1527-0904%282006%2966%5B246%3ASNBABE%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016700168300001800335520138700353592002801740650001701768650001901785650001101804650002001815650002901835650002301864651001201887653002101899653000801920653002101928653002001949653002301969653001901992700001902011700006102030773009902091856008502190852000902275655001202284IND60581260220221117204338.0180914e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058126022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2017.07.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLydon, Tracey10aPressure management and energy recovery in water distribution networks: Development of design and selection methodologies using three pump-as-turbine case studies  ap. 1038-1050.  aEnergy consumption in water distribution networks is a widely publicised problem. Similarly the control of leakage through pressure management in water networks has also received significant attention in the literature. This paper outlines progress on the development of micro-hydropower systems for energy recovery and pressure management in water distribution networks.Design and selection methodologies are outlined for pump-as-turbines (PAT) to recover energy and control pressure at 3 case study pressure reducing valves (PRV) in the water distribution network (WDN) of Dublin, Ireland. This investigation comprised the use of experimental characterisation of a laboratory scale prototype PAT, extrapolation of these results to larger scales using Suter and Affinity laws, and the assessment of their performance against real-world flow and pressure data. An assessment of existing PAT selection methodologies was also conducted and compared against the experimental data.The results of this investigation highlight that up to 40% of the gross power potential of an existing PRV could be converted to electrical energy using a PAT while also controlling pressure. Existing PAT selection methodologies did not concur well with the experimental results. The use of 2 PATs in parallel to increase the efficiency of the overall system achieved marginal improvements in performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3arenewable energy sources 3awater distribution 3aIreland 0aMicro-hydropower 0aPAT 0aPressure control 0aEnergy recovery 0aWater distribution 0aSustainability1 aCoughlan, Paul1 aMcNabola, Aonghus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8715-11800 tRenewable energy.g2017 Dec., v. 114 p.1038-1050dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.07.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245008400166300001600250520161900266592002801885650002301913650002901936650001701965650001901982650001202001650001302013650001102026650001402037650001602051650001302067650001202080653001202092653001302104653001302117653001202130653001102142700002502153700001702178773013902195856007602334852000902410655001202419IND60594702120221119105405.0180522e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059470212DNAL7 a10.2983/035.036.03112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrothues, Thomas M.10aReducing Discards of Flatfish in the Sea Scallop Dredge Fishery by Dredge Pause  ap. 627-631.  aFlatfishes are routine bycatch in the Atlantic sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus (Gmelin) dredge fishery but must be discarded at sea. Despite release, a 90% mortality rate is assumed for overfished species such as yellowtail flounder Limanda ferruginae and windowpane Scophthalmus aquosus.When the scallop fishery exceeds the annual catch limit for yellowtail flounder, accountability measures may be triggered and seasonal closures of the scallop fishery can occur in specific areas. Flatfish bycatch is potentially reduced by stopping the scallop dredge in midwater to allow escape. This technique has been voluntarily practiced, but not widely adopted, owing to a lack of knowledge about its efficacy relative to collateral scallop loss. In a test of 122 scallop dredge tows on a commercial vessel using otherwise standard procedures, pausing the dredge during retrieval significantly reduced flatfish bycatch relative to pause length (0, 5, 10, or 15 min) but also allowed some scallop escapement. Flatfish were more likely to escape from paused dredges if there were fewer scallops in the dredge. Video provided evidence that flatfish do escape through the tickler chains and over the lip during pauses, and also showed the benefit of time in allowing them to work free of the suspended scallop load. During rough weather, vessel heave winnowed the dredge contents, increasing scallop loss. Captains can judge the practice as a cost-benefit calculation to avoid loss of revenue from early closure, but it appears to offer only a weak return on the time investment. Escaped fish may still suffer mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLimanda ferruginea 3aPlacopecten magellanicus 3aScophthalmus 3aaccountability 3abycatch 3aflounder 3aincome 3amortality 3aoverfishing 3ascallops 3aweather 0abycatch 0adiscards 0aflatfish 0ascallop 0adredge1 aBochenek, Eleanor A.1 aMartin, Sean0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2017 Dec., v. 36, no. 3 p.627-631dNational Shellfisheries AssociationwJournal:15036x0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.036.03113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012700168520115500295592002801450650001701478650001001495650001101505650002301516650001901539653001101558653001801569653001001587653001401597653001701611700001501628700001601643700001401659773012201673856008101795852000901876655001201885IND60713050220221121230137.0211030e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071305022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1103182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHnin, Kay Khaing12aA novel infrared pulse-spouted freeze drying on the drying kinetics, energy consumption and quality of edible rose flowers  aRose flowers were dried by infrared freeze drying (IRFD) at different temperatures without and with pulsed spouted system, which is called novel infrared pulse-spouted freeze drying (IRPSFD). Drying kinetics, water activity, color, total phenolics content (TPC), and total anthocyanins contents (TANC) were investigated and compared with freeze drying (FD) as a control. The required time and energy for drying processes were also evaluated. Compared to FD, IRPSFD could shorten the processing time by 8–30% and save 15–36% of the total energy consumption. Pulse-spouted mode application and high drying temperature could shorten the total drying time and save energy. FD samples possessed the highest lightness (L*) value and lowest redness (a*) value. Compared with IRFD samples, the volatile profiles of IRPSFD samples were similar to those of FD samples. Moreover, the TPC of IRPSFD samples was slightly higher than that obtained by IRFD samples at each temperature. Therefore, the pulse-spouted mode application not only reduced the required processing time and total energy consumption but also improved the overall quality of the products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3acolor 3aenergy 3aphenolic compounds 3awater activity 0aDrying 0aEdible flower 0aColor 0aPhenolics 0aAnthocyanins1 aZhang, Min1 aJu, Ronghua1 aWang, Bin0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Jan., v. 136 p.110318-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1103183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011800166520139000284592002801674650003201702650001101734650002001745650002101765650001701786650001501803650001701818651001401835651001001849653003401859653001501893653004301908653001801951653002501969700001701994700005802011700001602069700001602085773009002101856008502191852000902276655001202285IND60782138420221118224655.0220824e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078213842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1246612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Yeming10aLOWESS smoothing and Random Forest based GRU model: A short-term photovoltaic power generation forecasting method  aAccurate prediction of photovoltaic power generation is vital to guarantee smooth operation of power stations and ensure users’ electricity consumption. As a good forecasting tool, Gated Recurrent Unit method has been widely used in different forecasting areas. However, the existing studies ignore the impact of data fluctuations on prediction accuracy, to fill the gaps and enhance prediction accuracy, several different data smoothing techniques are introduced and compared to reduce fluctuations, Random Forest method is used for feature selection, and RepeatVector layer extended by attribute dimensions and TimeDistributed layer with full connectivity are utilized to optimize the Gated Recurrent Unit model. A real-world case from the photovoltaic power plant in Xuhui District, Shanghai, China, is adopted to evaluate the performance of proposed method. The comparing results with Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory, and the actual data as well, show that the proposed prediction method can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of photovoltaic power generation. We also use the daily and monthly data of The Desert Knowledge Australia Solar Centre in Australia to investigate whether the proposed method is suitable for short-term or medium and long-term prediction. The results indicate that our method is more appropriate for short-term prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric energy consumption 3aenergy 3aneural networks 3apower generation 3apower plants 3aprediction 3asolar energy 3aAustralia 3aChina 0aPhotovoltaic power generation 0aPrediction 0aLocally weighted scatterplot smoothing 0aRandom forest 0aGated recurrent unit1 aWang, Yanxin1 aLeng, Mingming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3377-23871 aYang, Xinyu1 aZhou, Qiong0 tEnergy.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 256 p.124661-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1246613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002100167245008700188300001600275520114400291592002801435653001201463653001001475653003001485653002701515700001701542700002001559773011701579856011501696852000901811655001201820IND60131564420221117210309.0151127e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013156442DNAL7 a10.3398/1527-0904(2006)66[273:EOALUO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernandez, K.

Playas are also highly threatened from anthropogenic land use (chiefly agriculture, which decreases hydroperiod through increased sedimentation). We examined community structure of adult odonates (dragonflies and damselflies) in playas differing in the 2 main regional forms of surrounding land use (cropland vs. grassland). Analysis of odonate diversity revealed high overlap between cropland and grassland playas. Traditional species-area theory did not fit observed patterns, as there appears to be a threshold playa size that supports maximal odonate diversity; this nonlinear response may reflect a tradeoff between hydroperiod and availability of emergent vegetation that is required for perching and oviposition. Since agriculture effectively reduces playa depth but not size of the overall playa watershed, this may mean that cropland playas serve as ““ecological traps.”” This property has important implications for regional odonate diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aOdonata 0aplaya 0aspecies-area relationship 0aanthropogenic land use1 aReece, B.

However, the mechanisms driving xylogenesis and intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs), as well as the seasonal dynamics of wood development in water-limited environments, are still unclear. In this study, we assessed the kinetics of xylem development weekly in Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis) and Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia), at two altitudes in the Helan Mountains, semi-arid China. Results indicate that summer drought in June inhibited cambial division and reduced xylogenesis, resulting in only 40% of the xylem developing before August. The onset of abundant precipitation in mid-July reactivated radial growth. This second growth extended the growing season by one month and partly compensated for the negative effect of the drought on growth. E-type IADF were characterized by narrow cells with thick walls, formed during July and early August. The duration of cell enlargement explained 57% of variance in tracheid diameter, showing that it played an important role in determining cell size. In contrast, changes in the cell wall thickness were mainly driven by the rate of secondary wall thickening, which explained 65% of the variance. This study reveals the potential mechanisms for xylem development and E-IADF formation under summer drought in semi-arid China, provides evidence for the plasticity and resistance of Chinese pine and Qinghai spruce under varying environmental conditions, and contributes to our understanding of likely future trends in forest productivity under climate changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea crassifolia 3aPinus tabuliformis 3acambium 3acell growth 3acell walls 3adrought 3aforests 3ameteorology 3asummer 3atracheids 3atree growth 3avariance 3awood 3aChina 0aConifer 0aTree ring structure 0aXylem phenology 0aXylogenesis 0aCell enlargement 0aSecondary wall thickening1 aYang, Bao1 aPeng, Xiaomei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6328-62941 aRossi, Sergio0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 308-309 p.108572-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1085723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03535naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012700174300001800301500002000319520233000339592002802669596004702697596004702744650002602791650002202817650000902839650001802848650001302866650001402879650001302893650001202906700002102918773013902939856008603078852000903164655001203173IND60584939020221118163443.0220813e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058493902DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2017.13502202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTyszko, Stephen M.10aComparing Otoliths and Scales as Structures Used to Estimate Ages of Largemouth Bass: Consequences of Biased Age Estimates  ap. 1075-1082.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aManagement agencies often estimate the ages of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides based on the examination of scales—a structure that is known to produce biased estimates—without knowing how the associated bias affects management decisions. We sought to understand the effects of this bias by comparing population metrics that were predicted using scale‐derived and otolith‐derived age data. We collected scales and otoliths from Largemouth Bass that were sampled during standard electrofishing surveys. The age of each fish was estimated independently by three separate readers using both scales and otoliths. We assessed the average coefficient of variation for scale‐derived and otolith‐derived age estimates, examined the bias of scale‐derived age estimates, and estimated von Bertalanffy growth model parameters by using ages estimated from scales and otoliths. These parameter estimates were used in yield‐per‐recruit simulations that predicted yield and the percentage of individuals in the cohort surviving to 380 mm (proportional size distribution [PSD] 380) or to 470 mm (PSD 470) at several levels of natural mortality and fishing mortality. Otolith‐derived age estimates were more precise; scale‐derived age estimates showed significant positive bias for fish younger than age 6 and significant negative bias for fish older than age 6. Von Bertalanffy parameter estimates were significantly different when using ages estimated from scales and those estimated from otoliths. Modeling indicated that estimates of yield and PSD 380 resulting from the two structures were similar. However, the use of scale‐derived ages resulted in underestimating the impact of fishing mortality on PSD 470 by as much as five times at low levels of natural mortality and fishing mortality. Our estimates of precision and bias were similar to other comparisons of scales and otoliths, and the results of our yield‐per‐recruit simulations are likely generally applicable for Largemouth Bass management. Trophy fishing is a common management objective, and managers relying on scale‐based age data could be less likely to adopt the restrictive harvest regulations that are critical for producing trophy Largemouth Bass.

While the ability of using VIs, notably with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), to track vegetation growth has been well established, the operational capability to accurately estimate the crop coefficient (Kc) and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) at farm-scale from spaceborne platforms has not been widely studied. The study evaluated wheat ET over 7 sites between 2016 and 2019 in Yuma and Maricopa, Arizona, USA estimated by using Sentinel 2 and Venus satellites to map NDVI time-series for entire wheat cropping seasons, December to June. The basal crop coefficient (Kcb) was modeled by the NDVI time-series and the daily FAO56 reference ETₒ was obtained by near-by weather network stations. Eddy covariance (EC) stations in each field observed ETc during the same seasonal periods, and applied irrigation amounts were logged. The experiment found that remote sensing of NDVI and modeled Kcb accurately estimated Kc and crop ET during mid-season through senescence in most cases. However, NDVI-based estimation performed less well during early season (<60 days after planting), when observed ETc was highly variable due to frequent rain and irrigation at low crop cover. Mid-season Kc values observed for the seven wheat fields were from 0.92 to 1.14, and end of season Kc values ranged from about 0.20 to 0.40, in close agreement to values reported elsewhere. Seasonal VI-based transpiration and ETc values ranged from 467 to 618 mm, closely agreeing with seasonal EC data, which ranged 499–684 mm. Using the Venus sensor, the study in Maricopa in 2019 revealed that when augmented by a background soil water balance model, water stressed wheat can be detected mid-season with NDVI. This capability is specifically due to the sensor’s ability to provide well-calibrated images every 2 days. Findings from this study will help farmers, irrigators, and water managers use and understand the capabilities of visible near infrared remote sensing to track ETc from space.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop coefficient 3adurum wheat 3aeddy covariance 3aevapotranspiration 3afields 3aimage analysis 3airrigation rates 3amodel validation 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3asoil water balance 3asoil-plant interactions 3atime series analysis 3atranspiration 3avegetation 3awater stress 3aArizona1 aHunsaker, Douglas J.1 aSanchez, Charles A.1 aSaber, Mazin1 aGonzalez, Juan Roberto1 aAnderson, Ray0 tAgricultural water management.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 239 p.106266-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1062663Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/69629083Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Satelite-based%20NDVI.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245018100161300001600342520113700358592002801495650002701523650002701550650001901577650001301596650001201609650002001621650001001641650001301651650002201664650001101686650001601697650001901713653002701732653001201759653001501771653001201786653001801798653001601816653002201832700002301854700002401877773013901901856007602040852000902116655001202125IND60594702320221119140515.0180522e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059470232DNAL7 a10.2983/035.036.03132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbarra, Ana M.10aEffects of the Tetraploid Condition on Gamete Size and on Testis Versus Ovary Allocation in the True Functional Hermaphroditic Scallop Argopecten ventricosus (Sowerby II, 1842)  ap. 641-648.  aThe Catarina scallop Argopecten ventricosus is a true functional hermaphrodite, in which male and female gamete cells develop synchronously in one gonad organ spatially divided into a testis and an ovary. Tetraploid Catarina scallops were produced and macroscopic observations showed a significant reduction in the total area allocated to the testis of this functional hermaphrodite when compared with diploids. Further micro and ultrastructure analyses indicated that gamete cells are larger in tetraploids than diploids and that the clear separation between sexual gonadal areas usually observed in diploids was partially lost in tetraploids, with some male acini projecting into the ovary area adjacent to the testis area. The reduced testis area was present in two generations of tetraploids mated between them, indicating its inheritance. A genetic mechanism of sex determination similar to that observed in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is proposed to explain the reduced testis area in tetraploid scallops and the rare occurrence of “only males” or “only females” in this and other true hermaphroditic scallops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgopecten ventricosus 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aanimal ovaries 3adiploidy 3afemales 3ahermaphroditism 3amales 3ascallops 3asex determination 3atestes 3atetraploidy 3aultrastructure 0aArgopecten ventricosus 0ascallop 0atetraploid 0amollusc 0ahermaphrodite 0agamete size 0asex determination1 aRamírez, José L.1 aMaldonado, Rosalío0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2017 Dec., v. 36, no. 3 p.641-648dNational Shellfisheries AssociationwJournal:15036x0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.036.03133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100006400190245006800254300001800322506007600340520062800416592002801044506003701072650002001109650002601129650002301155650001801178650001401196650001101210700005001221700005901271700005601330700005601386700006301442700006101505700005601566773012101622856008301743852000901826655001201835IND60646409620221207110208.0190610e20190419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064640962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b011232doi7 aPMC65586372pmcid7 a310022512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemay-Drouhard, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2270-117710aFunctionalization at Will of Rim-Differentiated Pillar[5]arenes  ap. 3976-3980.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe development of an efficient synthetic route toward rim-differentiated C₅-symmetric pillar[5]arenes (P[5]s), whose two rims are decorated with different chemical functionalities, opens up successive transformations of this macrocyclic scaffold.

Fucoxanthin exhibits optical characteristics attributed to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state that arises in polar environments due to the presence of the carbonyl group. In this study, we report the spectroscopic properties of fucoxanthin in methanol (polar and protic solvent) observed by femtosecond pump–probe measurements in the near-infrared region, where transient absorption associated with the optically allowed S₂ (1¹B ᵤ ⁺ ) state and stimulated emission from the strongly coupled S₁/ICT state were observed following one-photon excitation to the S₂ state. The results showed that the amplitude of the stimulated emission of the S₁/ICT state increased with decreasing excitation energy, demonstrating that the fucoxanthin form associated with the lower energy of the steady-state absorption exhibits stronger ICT character.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarotenoids 3aenergy 3amethanol 3aspectroscopy1 aFujii, Ritsuko1 aSugisaki, Mitsuru1 aOka, Naohiro1 aIha, Masahiko1 aHashimoto, Hideki0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2014 July, v. 121, no. 1 p.61-68dSpringer-Verlagx0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-014-9995-6  aDNAL 7aarticle01808naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006500149245014900214300001800363520051500381592002800896650001400924650001200938650002800950650001600978650001600994650001901010650001401029650002101043700002401064700002601088700005701114700006101171773012101232856008401353852000901437655001201446IND60741776920210908000000.0210908e20210607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074177692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c016652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPascual-Escudero, Ana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5780-173910aAldehydes as Photoremovable Directing Groups: Synthesis of Pyrazoles by a Photocatalyzed [3+2] Cycloaddition/Norrish Type Fragmentation Sequence  ap. 4903-4908.  aA straightforward methodology for the regioselective synthesis of pyrazoles has been developed by a domino sequence based on a photoclick cycloaddition followed by a photocatalyzed oxidative deformylation reaction.

Understanding variability of coastal vulnerability along the entire coastline informs coastal planning and management at an island-wide scale as some coastal stretches are more appropriate for big-scale development, while others require additional coastal protection and/or ecosystem conservation. To date, few researches focused on developing macro-scale coastal vulnerability index at an island or archipelagic-scale. This paper fills a knowledge gap by developing an integrated coastal vulnerability index (ICVI) for nine small islands in the Azores archipelago. Considering that degree of vulnerability varies according to human-environment traits of each coastal stretch, this paper characterises integrated coastal vulnerability according to three broad attributes, i.e. exposure to external stressors, biophysical features and socioeconomic characteristics. Using field work, semi-quantitative analysis and GIS, ICVI is a simple and relatively quick approach that provides a broad overview of coastal vulnerability in small island context. A set of six accessible and representative parameters was employed as indicators for this vulnerability assessment, i.e. type of cliff; type of beach; coastal defences; exposure to swell/storm waves; outcrop flooded and land-use. The entire coastline of each island was divided into segments according to their geomorphic compartments and subsequently assigned with a relative ICVI value. Each segment was ranked into five classes ranging from very low to very high based on its relative degree of vulnerability. While majority of the coasts are of moderate relative vulnerability in the Azores, vulnerability varies broadly along the coast between low, moderate and high. The ICVI approach serves as a useful decision support tool to facilitate effective planning and management for the Azores small islands and the methodology has the flexibility of being scaled deep by adding more indicators where necessary and available or scaled out to other small islands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthropocene epoch 3aclimate 3acoasts 3adecision support systems 3aecosystems 3ageographic information systems 3aislands 3aland use 3aplanning 3arisk assessment 3astorms 3aAzores 0aCoastal hazards 0aCoastal planning 0aCoastal adaptation 0aResilience 0aCoastal vulnerability index (CVI) 0aSustainable coastal development1 aBorges, Paulo1 aPhillips, Michael Robert1 aMedeiros, Antonio,1 aCalado, Helena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4043-4466 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4043-44660 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Nov. 10, v. 690 p.1218-1227dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011600156300001800272500002000290520049300310592002800803596002700831596002900858596004500887596004500932650002700977650001601004650001101020650000901031650001501040650001101055650001601066700002001082700002101102700002201123773012301145856007401268852000901342655001201351IND60786978120221120065738.0220807e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078697812DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.132732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazloumi, N.10aQ10 measures of metabolic performance and critical swimming speed in King George whiting Sillaginodes punctatus  ap. 2200-2205.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study examined thermally driven changes in swimming performance and aerobic metabolism (Q₁₀ and aerobic scope of activity) of adult King George whiting Sillaginodes punctatus to the coldest (16° C) and the warmest (26° C) temperature encountered by this species.

Sixty 3-d-old Holstein calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Dietary treatments were (1) steam-flaked (SF) corn without alfalfa hay (AH) supplementation (SF-NO), (2) SF corn with AH supplementation (SF-AH), (3) cracked (CR) corn without AH supplementation (CR-NO), and (4) CR corn with AH supplementation (CR-AH). All calves received the same amount of pasteurized whole milk and weaned on d 56 of the experiment; the study was terminated on d 70. Steam-flaked corn contained higher amounts of gelatinized starch in comparison with cracked corn (44.1 vs. 12.5% of total starch, respectively). Starter intake was not affected by corn processing methods or AH provision during the pre- or postweaning periods. However, we noted an interaction between corn processing methods and forage supplementation for starter intake during d 31 to 50 of the experiment, where calves fed on SF-AH starter had greater starter intake than those fed SF-NO starter, but the starter intake was not different between CR-NO and CR-AH fed calves. Furthermore, AH increased average daily gain (ADG) of calves fed an SF-based diet but not in calves fed a CR-based diet during the preweaning and overall periods. Interaction between forage provision and time was significant for ADG and feed efficiency, as calves supplemented with forage had higher ADG (0.982 vs. 0.592, respectively) and feed efficiency compared with forage unsupplemented calves at the weaning week. Forage supplementation resulted in more stable ruminal condition compared with nonforage-fed calves, as evidenced by higher ruminal pH (5.71 vs. 5.29, respectively) at postweaning and lower non-nutritive oral behavior around weaning time (55 vs. 70.5 min, respectively). The concentration of blood β-hydroxybutyrate was also greater in calves supplemented with forage than in unsupplemented calves. Results of the present study indicated that performance response and skeletal growth were the same between 2 corn processing methods. Forage provision improved ADG of calves fed the SF-based diet, but not the CR-based diet throughout the study.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aHolstein 3aalfalfa hay 3aaverage daily gain 3abiochemical pathways 3ablood 3acorn 3adairy calves 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afeed conversion 3aforage 3agelatinization 3ametabolites 3anutritional behavior 3apH 3apasteurization 3arumen fermentation 3astarch 3aweaning 3awhole milk 0acalf 0acracking 0aforage provision 0asteam flaking1 aKhorvash, M.1 aGhorbani, G.R.1 aGhasemi, E.1 aMirzaei, M.1 aHashemzadeh-Cigari, F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Aug., v. 101, no. 8 p.7061-7072dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-137983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013900175300001800314520105800332592002801390650002301418650002201441650002101463650002101484650002501505650004201530650002601572650001601598650002601614650002901640650002601669650001001695650001601705650002101721650001001742650002201752650001701774653002501791653002101816653001901837653002701856653002401883700002101907700001401928700002501942700001901967700001601986773010702002856008402109961001202193852000902205655001202214IND60122264220221120071810.0150325e20140917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012226422DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9034812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedimagh-Saidana, S.10aAsterisulphoxide and asterisulphone: two new antibacterial and antifungal metabolites from the Tunisian Asteriscus maritimus (L.)

The feeding trials were replicated in three tanks each for a total of 15 tanks. The study was conducted for eight weeks. At the beginning of the experiment, 30 rainbow trout (initial weight: 35.67 ± 0.88 g) were randomly stocked into each tank. At the end of the experiment, growth performance improved in the fish fed sumac fruit powder; however, other than the final body weight, the differences were not significant (P > 0.05). The final body weight increased for treatments 1, 3, and 5 g kg⁻¹ (P = 0.18). Intestinal morphology was enhanced in the experimental groups (P < 0.05). No differences were observed in serum biochemistry with sumac powder supplementation. The effect of sumac powder on superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were also investigated for the overall antioxidant status. SOD activity in muscle was higher in fish fed diets containing various doses of sumac powder than in the controls (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the supplementation administration of sumac powder showed a positive effect on the growth performance, intestinal tissue morphology, and antioxidant enzyme stimulation in rainbow trout.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aRhus coriaria 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3ablood chemistry 3abody weight 3acatalase 3adietary supplements 3afeeds 3afish 3afruits 3agrowth performance 3ahistology 3aintestines 3amalondialdehyde 3amuscles 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atechnology 0aALP 0aALT 0aANOVA 0aAST 0aCAT 0aCHOL 0aFCR 0aGLU 0aHDL-C 0aMDA 0aSGR 0aSOD 0aSR 0aTRIG 0aVLDL 0aWG 0aH&E 0aRhus coriaria L. 0aOncorhynchus mykiss 0aGrowth performance 0aIntestinal morphology 0aAntioxidant enzyme 0aserum biochemical parameters1 aÖzil, Öznur1 aBayrak, Halit1 aYiğit, Nalan Özgür1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6109-94251 aOzmen, Ozlem,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1835-10821 aSaygın, Mustafa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4925-35031 aAslankoç, Rahime0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2021 Aug., v. 278 p.114993-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2021.1149933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008400173300001500257520143800272592002801710650001901738650002201757650000901779650002001788650001801808650000901826650002001835650001201855653002901867653001601896653001801912653003201930653003001962653002201992700002302014773009502037856008602132852000902218655001202227IND60688568820200616000000.0200429e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068856882DNAL7 a10.1080/08927936.2018.14062032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgado, Mikel M.10aDevelopment and Psychometric Evaluation of the Cat Care and Needs Scale (CCANS)  ap. 89-100.  aThe objective of this study was to develop a brief scale, primarily intended for research applications, that measures how well people report meeting the welfare needs of their pet cats. The practice of keeping cats as a companion animal has increased, and despite their popularity, many cats suffer from poor welfare and behavioral problems. The failure to meet their welfare needs and provide for natural behaviors impacts their quality of life and may affect cats’ retention in adoptive homes. We present three studies in which we developed, piloted, and psychometrically evaluated the Cat Care and Needs Scale (CCANS) by surveying cat guardians, examining their selfreported care-taking habits and interactions in regards to a pet cat. The final study (n = 1,591) resulted in a 15-item scale which shows high reliability, with application of item response theory indicating that individual items were all suitable for inclusion. Diverse evidence, including a factor analysis, parallel analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis, supports that the scale is unidimensional. The CCANS is scalable and allows for correlational comparisons with other scales which measure any variable of interest in research exploring human–companion animal relationships or cat welfare. We propose that the CCANS scale is a step forward in measuring how well pet owners understand and meet their cats’ behavioral, welfare, and basic care needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3abehavior problems 3acats 3afactor analysis 3apet ownership 3apets 3aquality of life 3asurveys 0acat–owner relationship 0acat welfare 0adomestic cats 0ahuman– animal interaction 0aresponsible pet ownership 0ascale development1 aReevy, Gretchen M.0 tAnthrozoös.g2018 Jan. 2, v. 31, no. 1 p.89-100dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08927936.2018.14062033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008400166300001800250520177700268592002802045650001902073650001502092650000902107650001902116700002202135773012202157856008102279852000902360655001202369IND60747555320221120072133.0210814e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074755532DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293210800932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhitrov, N. B.10aDiagnostic Horizons in the Classification System of Russian Soils: Version 2021  ap. 1131-1140.  aUpdating the classification system of Russian soils as a preliminary procedure to the development of its new version is provided by new data, extensive testing of the system in terrain conditions, online and offline discussions, validation in the course of cartographic works, and addressing to the international experience. The first step in updating—analysis of diagnostic horizons as basic elements of the system—comprised scrutinizing the array of horizons, checking their essence, and improving the scheme of their presentation in the system, which is believed to be more convenient and up-to-date. Eleven horizons were moved to a lower category of diagnostic properties. However, it was proposed to enlarge the set of human- modified horizons by introducing the technogenic horizons in addition to the agrogenic horizons, to add a special chernozemic horizon (like chernic horizon in the WRB), and to separate the mesotrophic peat horizon from eutrophic and oligotrophic peat horizons. In the definitions of diagnostic horizons, more strict and formal criteria were formulated along with descriptive characteristics of pedogenesis and the environment. Hence, the volume of definitions of diagnostic horizons increased by approximately three times on the average, while the definitions of diagnostic criteria were preserved intact. Names or symbols were modified for several horizons. As a result, the total number of diagnostic horizons decreased from 51 in the former version-2008 to 47 in the proposed updated version. This paper presents the updated list of horizons and three examples of their revised definitions in the expected updated version. The article provides a proposed general list of diagnostic horizons and 3 examples of new horizon descriptions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeutrophication 3alandscapes 3apeat 3asoil formation1 aGerasimova, M.

The objective of this study was to determine the optimum concentration of a prepared cellulase solution from a commercial source to obtain meaningful estimates of in vitro dry matter digestibility (FVDMD) and development of NIRS equations for tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). A total of 176 tall fescue samples were pretreated using pepsin and 0.125 M L⁻¹ HCl followed by digestion using five different concentrations of a prepared cellulase solution obtained from Worthington Corp., Freehold, NJ. Concentrations of the prepared cellulase solution were 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 g L⁻¹. Maximum digestion occurred with the prepared cellulase solution at 0.57 g L⁻¹. However, the most meaningful equation for estimating tall fescue IVDMD by NIRS occurred when samples were digested using the prepared cellulase solution at a concentration of 0.8 g L⁻¹.

After a growing disparity between these two indicators in the 1980s, when Brazil's per capita GPI featured a 35% decline, there was a relative catch-up in per capita GPI, but not one sufficiently strong enough to reduce the historical GPI–GDP gap. The recent trend of rapidly increasing environmental and social costs, along with the decline in unpaid labour and infrastructure services, poses concerns about the sustainability of an increasing GPI for Brazil into the future. Policies aimed at reducing environmental costs are necessary if Brazil is to enjoy a sustainable pattern of non-declining economic welfare. Brazil must pursue a higher rate of productivity in material and energy consumption in order to keep environmental pressures to a minimum level.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost benefit analysis 3aenergy 3agross domestic product 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3aBrazil 0aEcological economics 0aSustainable economic welfare 0aUneconomic growth 0aEnvironmental and social costs 0aGPI1 aGarcia, Junior Ruiz0 tEcological economics.g2015 Oct., v. 118 p.49-56dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245010800206300001800314520142700332592002801759650001701787650002601804650001801830650001101848650001501859650001801874650001501892650001301907650001601920650001501936651001401951653000901965653001901974653001701993653002702010653001502037700002102052700006002073700002102133700001802154700006302172700006002235773013902295856008002434852000902514655001202523IND60767363920221119024337.0220215e20220131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076736392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.1c074512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRauert, Cassandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2543-902310aConcentrations of Tire Additive Chemicals and Tire Road Wear Particles in an Australian Urban Tributary  ap. 2421-2431.  aTire road wear particles (TRWPs) are one of the largest sources of microplastics to the urban environment with recent concerns as they also provide a pathway for additive chemicals to leach into the environment. Stormwater is a major source of TRWPs and associated additives to urban surface water, with additives including the antioxidant derivative N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine-quinone (6PPD-quinone) demonstrating links to aquatic toxicity at environmentally relevant concentrations. The present study used complementary analysis methods to quantify both TRWPs and a suite of known tire additive chemicals (including 6PPD-quinone) to an urban tributary in Australia during severe storm events. Concentrations of additives increased more than 40 times during storms, with a maximum concentration of 2760 ng/L for ∑₁₅additives, 88 ng/L for 6PPD-quinone, and a similar profile observed in each storm. TRWPs were detected during storm peaks with a maximum concentration between 6.4 and 18 mg/L, and concentrations of TRWPs and all additives were highly correlated. Contaminant mass loads to this catchment were estimated as up to 100 g/storm for ∑₁₅additives, 3 g/storm for 6PPD-quinone, and between 252 and 730 kg of TRWPs/storm. While 6PPD-quinone concentrations in this catchment were lower than previous studies, elevated concentrations post storm suggest prolonged aquatic exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aenvironmental science 3amicroplastics 3astorms 3astormwater 3asurface water 3atechnology 3atoxicity 3aurban areas 3awatersheds 3aAustralia 0aTRWP 0atire additives 0a6PPD-quinone 0aAustralian environment 0amass loads1 aCharlton, Nathan1 aOkoffo, Elvis D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8773-97611 aStanton, Ryan S.1 aAgua, Alon R.1 aPirrung, Michael C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4585-83531 aThomas, Kevin V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2155-100X0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2022 Jan. 31, v. 56, no. 4 p.2421-2431dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c074513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006900146245016500215300001800380520105600398592002801454650001401482650002301496650001101519650002001530650001801550650001301568650001901581650001701600650000901617650001401626650002001640700005701660700002601717700001901743700002301762773017001785856008001955852000902035655001202044IND60601959320180822000000.0180709e20180131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060195932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b043452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Contador, Miguel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0162-437110aOptimization of the Zr Content in the CuO-ZnO-ZrO2/SAPO-11 Catalyst for the Selective Hydrogenation of CO+CO2 Mixtures in the Direct Synthesis of Dimethyl Ether  ap. 1169-1178.  aZr incorporation in the CuO-ZnO catalyst for methanol synthesis from CO+CO₂ mixtures, for its later use in the bifunctional catalyst conformation for dimethyl ether (DME) direct synthesis, has been studied. Different Cu/Zn/Zr ratio catalysts were prepared, via coprecipitation method, and characterized regarding to physical, chemical, structural, and metallic properties. Specific Cu surface area and dispersion are responsible for boosting the activity of CuO-ZnO based catalysts, which increases when incorporating ZrO₂. Based on the kinetic behavior (COₓ conversion and methanol yield and selectivity) and stability in the methanol synthesis, CZZr1 (Cu:Zn:Zr = 2:1:1) was selected as the most suitable metallic function, with 8.14% of COₓ conversion and methanol selectivity over 98%. A bifunctional catalyst was prepared by physical mixture of CZZr1 with SAPO-11. The bifunctional catalyst activity was tested on the DME direct synthesis, showing a good performance providing a high DME yield and selectivity, with a noticeable stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3acoprecipitation 3ahydrogenation 3amethanol 3aprocess design 3asurface area 3azinc 3azirconium 3azirconium oxide1 aAteka, Ainara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3863-58081 aRodriguez-Vega, Pablo1 aBilbao, Javier1 aAguayo, Andrés T.0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Jan. 31, v. 57, no. 4 p.1169-1178dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b043453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002000136245006900156300001800225520180500243592002802048653002502076653002402101653002102125653002302146700001802169773010502187856007202292852000902364655001202373IND60127145120221120113637.0151110e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012714512DNAL7 a10.1554/03-5952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBachtrog, Doris10aAdaptive evolution of asexual populations under muller's ratchet  ap. 1403-1413.  aWe study the population genetics of adaptation in nonequilibrium haploid asexual populations. We find that the accumulation of deleterious mutations, due to the operation of Muller's ratchet, can considerably reduce the rate of fixation of advantageous alleles. Such reduction can be approximated reasonably well by a reduction in the effective population size. In the absence of Muller's ratchet, a beneficial mutation can only become fixed if it creates the best possible genotype; if Muller's ratchet operates, however, mutations initially arising in a nonoptimal genotype can also become fixed in the population, since the loss of the least-loaded class implies that an initially nonoptimal background can become optimal. We show that, while the rate at which adaptive mutations become fixed is reduced, the rate of fixation of deleterious mutations due to the ratchet is not changed by the presence of beneficial mutations as long as the rate of their occurrence is low and the deleterious effects of mutations (sd) are higher than the beneficial effects (sₐ). When sₐ > sd, the advantage of a beneficial mutation can outweigh the deleterious effects of associated mutations. Under these conditions, a beneficial allele can drag to fixation deleterious mutations initially associated with it at a higher rate than in the absence of advantageous alleles. We propose analytical approximations for the rates of accumulation of deleterious and beneficial mutations. Furthermore, when allowing for the possible occurrence of interference between beneficial alleles, we find that the presence of deleterious mutations of either very weak or very strong effect can marginally increase the rate of accumulation of beneficial mutations over that observed in the absence of such deleterious mutations.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBackground selection 0agenetic hitchhiking 0aMuller's ratchet 0arate of adaptation1 aGordo, Isabel0 tEvolution.g2004 July, v. 58, no. 7 p.1403-1413dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F03-5953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245014700170520203800317592002802355650001302383650001602396650001602412650002402428650001102452650001302463650001802476650001402494650002002508650001402528650002002542650001202562650001802574650002002592650001402612650001502626650001702641650001602658650001502674653000802689653000702697653000702704653000702711653000702718653000802725653000702733653000702740653000702747653000902754653002002763653002302783653001202806700002102818700005502839700002802894700001902922773011802941856008903059852000903148655001203157IND60743004320221120180750.0220606e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074300432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2021.1150132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorouzi, M.10aPerformance of Holstein calves receiving increased nutrient intake through the addition of skim milk or milk replacer powder to the whole milk  aThe purpose of this research was to describe the performance of Holstein calves before and after weaning when total solids in their daily milk were increased with skim milk or milk replacer powder. Forty-five female Holstein calves (body weight = 39.5 ± 1.61 kg) were assigned in random to 1 of 3 treatments: 1) whole milk (WM) with total solids of 123 ± 4.1 g/kg, 2) whole milk + skim milk powder (WM + SM) with total solids of 181 ± 6.2 g/kg, and 3) whole milk + milk replacer powder (WM + MR) with total solids of 184 ± 9.7 g/kg. Calves received 6 l/day of milk from days 2–14, 7 l/day from days 15–35, 6 l/day from days 36–42, 5 l/day from days 43–49, and then 2 l/day from days 50 until weaning (d 56). Calves remained in the study until day 90. Calves exhibited no difference in their pre- and post-weaning starter consumption. Although pre-weaning feed conversion efficiency was slightly different among calves, post-weaned calves receiving WM were more efficient in converting feed nutrients to body weight gain. Evolution of body frame development was slightly different among calves. However, WM + SM-fed calves had greater body length at weaning. Pre-weaning weight gain and body weight at weaning were greater when calves consumed high-solids milk based on SM or MR. Feeding WM + SM increased the number of days with diarrhea, which resulted in the highest proportion of calves in this group to receive antibiotics treatment. Amount of electrolytes administered per calf as well as days with antibiotic therapy were generally lesser in WM-fed calves. Slight treatment differences were noted in post-weaning total-tract digestion of DM, CP and OM in calf starter. However, fat digestibility was greatest in calves consuming WM + SM. Overall, our findings indicate that a high-solids milk feeding strategy based on SM or MR improved calf growth rate in the pre-weaning phase while having no effect on starter consumption. However, diarrhea incidence increased when calf nutrient intake was increased through SM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aantibiotics 3abody length 3abody weight changes 3acalves 3adiarrhea 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3adried skim milk 3aevolution 3afeed conversion 3afemales 3amilk replacer 3anutrient intake 3askim milk 3atechnology 3atherapeutics 3aweight gain 3awhole milk 0aADF 0aCP 0aDM 0aME 0aMR 0aNDF 0aOM 0aSM 0aWM 0aCalf 0aHigh-solid milk 0aGrowth performance 0aWeaning1 aAlamouti, Ali A.1 aForoudi, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8926-67661 aAḥmadī, Faraj Allah,1 aBeiranvand, H.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2021 Aug., v. 278 p.115013-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2021.1150133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245012500160300001800285520125000303592002801553650001401581650001901595650001901614650001901633650001401652650001501666650002201681650002801703650001601731650001501747653002401762653002301786653001501809653003801824700001401862700001401876700001401890700001701904700001401921700001801935700005301953773013902006856008002145852000902225655001202234IND60767364020221119024345.0220215e20220125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076736402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.1c074692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xinru10aSelective Removal of Phenolic Compounds by Peroxydisulfate Activation: Inherent Role of Hydrophobicity and Interface ROS  ap. 2665-2676.  aSelective removal of organic pollutants by advanced oxidation methods has been receiving increasing attention for environmental remediation. In this study, a novel catalyst, which can selectively oxidize phenolic compounds (PCs) based on their hydrophobicity, composed of metal–organic-framework-derived Fe/Fe₃O₄ and three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (rGOF) is designed for peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation. This heterogeneous PDS activation system can completely degrade hydrophobic PCs within 30 min. By investigating the hydrophobic properties of eight representative PCs, a positive correlation between the hydrophobicity of PC and the reaction kinetics is reported for the first time. The selective removal stems from the strong interaction between highly hydrophobic PCs and the catalyst. Moreover, the mechanism investigation shows that the degradation reaction is triggered by interface reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our study reveals that the selective degradation of organic pollutants by PDS activation depends on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the pollutant and catalyst. The reported results provide new insights into a highly selective and efficient PDS activation system for organic pollutant removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3areaction kinetics 3areactive oxygen species 3aremediation 3atechnology 0aselective oxidation 0aphenolic compounds 0aadsorption 0ainterface reactive oxygen species1 aLiu, Ying1 aQin, Hehe1 aYe, Ziwei1 aWei, Xiaojie1 aMiao, Wei1 aYang, Dianhai1 aMao, Shun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3319-42030 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2022 Jan. 25, v. 56, no. 4 p.2665-2676dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c074693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010000175300001600275520130200291592002801593650001401621650001901635650001201654650002101666650002801687653001301715653001001728653003101738653001301769653001301782653002701795653001201822700002001834700002301854700002201877773009601899856008601995852000902081655001202090IND60688569220200616000000.0200429e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068856922DNAL7 a10.1080/08927936.2018.14340452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlante, Courtney N.10a“Animals Like Us”: Identifying with Nonhuman Animals and Support for Nonhuman Animal Rights  ap. 165-177.  aWhile anthropomorphizing nonhuman animals has been shown to increase identification with them and, by extension, concern for their wellbeing, little research has directly tested whether identifying with nonhuman animals is similarly associated with concern for their wellbeing. We tested hypotheses related to this premise across three cross-sectional studies. In study 1 (n = 224), we tested the hypothesis that therians—a group of people who self-identify with nonhuman animals, show greater concern for nonhuman animal rights than non-therian furries—people with a fan-like interest in media featuring anthropomorphized animal characters. In study 2 (n = 206), we further tested this hypothesis using implicit and explicit measures of identification with nonhuman animals to predict behavioral intentions to support nonhuman animal rights. In study 3 (n = 182), we tested the generalizability of our findings in a sample of undergraduate students. Taken together, the studies show that explicit, but not implicit, identification with nonhuman animals predicts greater support for their rights. The implications of these findings for research on anthropomorphism and animal rights activism are discussed, as well as the limitations of these findings and possible avenues for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivists 3aanimal welfare 3aanimals 3acollege students 3across-sectional studies 0aattitude 0afurry 0ahuman–animal interaction 0aidentity 0amorality 0anonhuman animal rights 0atherian1 aReysen, Stephen1 aRoberts, Sharon E.1 aGerbasi, Kathleen0 tAnthrozoös.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 31, no. 2 p.165-177dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08927936.2018.14340453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04810naa a2200949 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012600168520241500294592002802709650002602737650002002763650001702783650001702800650001602817650001302833650001602846650001502862650001002877650003202887650001602919650002002935650001202955650002002967650001002987650001802997650001903015650001903034650001703053650001803070650001203088650002103100650001003121650002303131650001603154650002103170650001203191650002203203650001703225650003603242650002103278650000903299653001403308653001403322653001203336653001103348653000903359653000803368653000803376653000803384653000703392653000803399653000703407653000803414653000803422653000803430653000703438653000903445653000803454653000803462653001003470653000803480653001003488653000903498653001203507653001003519653000903529653001303538700001803551700002103569700001403590700002203604700002403626773010403650856008503754852000903839655001203848IND60724713520221121152147.0210518e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072471352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phyplu.2021.1000322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aR, Malarvizhi10aPlausible influence of atorvastatin and dietary legumes (horsegram and groundnut) in dyslipidemia in experimental rodents  aDyslipidemia a common pathology in metabolic syndrome results due to various factors. Although statins are proven for its beneficial role in the management of hyperlipidemia, plant-based foods and their ingredients are still a cornerstone of health care and medical prescriptions. Legumes are important constituents of a balanced diet. They are rich in fiber and provide health benefits and are used to treat disease related pathologies.The present study intended to identify the influence of two legumes, horsegram and groundnut individually and with atorvastatin in high fat diet induced hyperlipidemic rats and trace if there is any adverse effect due to food drug interactions.Hyperlipidemia in Sprague Dawley rats were induced by feeding high fat diet for 12 weeks. Subsequently, supplementation of horsegram and groundnut with and without atorvastatin was given for 4 weeks. The physiological indicators (body weight, feed intake, fat index), biochemical parameters (cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, urea and creatinine) including markers of oxidative stress (catalase, GST, SOD, TBARS and GSH), mRNA expression markers of lipid metabolism and inflammation markers (SREBP-1, ACC, FABP, HMG-CoAR, NF-kB and IL-6) and the protein expression of HO-1 and NF-kB followed by histopathological analysis of the heart, liver and kidney tissues were checked to study the influence of the legumes with and without atrovastatin.Results showed that administration of the legumes individually and their combination with atorvastatin significantly reduced the body weight, feed intake, fat index, biochemical metabolites and enzymatic markers in comparison to the HFD group. In addition, it also decreased the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels. Likewise, the legumes individually as well as in combination with atorvastatin significantly decreased the protein expression of HO-1 and NF-kB. Further, histopathological analysis confirmed the influence of the legumes and its combination to overcome hyperlipidemia as evidenced by the pathological changes in the treated rats.The results of the present work confirm that the legumes individually as well as its combination with atorvastatin are helpful to manage hyperlipidemia. On comparison, horsegram with atorvastatin possess a better therapeutic efficacy when compared to groundnut with atorvastatin and there is no evidence of food drug interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrotyloma uniflorum 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidants 3aatorvastatin 3abody weight 3acatalase 3acholesterol 3acreatinine 3adrugs 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3afeed intake 3agene expression 3aglucose 3ahealth services 3aheart 3ahigh fat diet 3ahistopathology 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3akidneys 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3ametabolic syndrome 3ametabolites 3aoxidative stress 3apeanuts 3aprotein synthesis 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atriacylglycerols 3aurea 0aHorsegram 0aGroundnut 0aSREBP-1 0aNF-κB 0aHO-1 0aALT 0aALP 0aAST 0aCO 0aCVD 0aGN 0aGSH 0aGST 0aHFD 0aHG 0aHO-1 0aLDH 0aLPO 0aNF-kB 0aSOD 0aTBARS 0aγGT 0aSREBP-1 0aACCβ 0aFABP 0aHMG-CoAR1 aMani, Sugumar1 aSali, Veeresh K.1 aP, Nithya1 aSekar, Vidhushini1 aVasanthi, Hannah R.0 tPhytomedicine plus.g2021 May, v. 1, no. 2 p.100032-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27657x2667-03137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phyplu.2021.1000323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245010000207300001800307520106300325592002801388650001601416650001901432650001101451650001501462650001901477650001501496700002301511700002301534700002401557700002701581773017001608856008001778852000901858655001201867IND60601959620221117211331.0180709e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060195962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b043702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgu, Cornelius E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5339-979410aModels for Predicting Average Bubble Diameter and Volumetric Bubble Flux in Deep Fluidized Beds  ap. 2658-2669.  aThe average bubble diameter and volumetric bubble flux give indications about the overall bed expansion in a fluidized bed. As these properties depend on the particle properties and fluidized bed regime, their accurate predictions have been a challenge. A new set of models for predicting the average bubble properties within the bubbling and slugging regimes in a deep fluidized bed is proposed, where bubble flux is modeled by G=U0−c(U0Umf)aUmf, bubble diameter is modeled by d̅b=0.848G0.66D0.34 and transition velocity is modeled by UbsUmf=1+2.33Umf−0.027(φ0.35ctat−1)(h0D)−0.588. The models are developed using the information obtained from an experimental setup equipped with a dual-plane electrical capacitance tomography and a porous distributor plate. Although they are empirical, the proposed models are based on the two-phase theory used in describing the bubble flow in a fluidized bed. These models have been validated, and the results show that they can be used to predict the behavior in different regimes at different gas velocities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3afluidized beds 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprocess design 3atomography1 aPfeifer, Christoph1 aEikeland, Marianne1 aTokheim, Lars-Andre1 aMoldestad, Britt M.

How Researchers Guide Participants to Select Dogs in Surveys of Human–Dog Relationships  ap. 195-210.  aSurveys and questionnaires are regularly used in studies of human–animal relationships. However, little attention has been given to understanding how survey participants are provided with instructions for the selection of a single animal within a multi-pet household, let alone the implications for reporting and interpreting data. We reviewed the instructions for the selection of an individual animal in studies addressing emotional or psychological attachment between people and dogs. By searching multidisciplinary journals from the year 2000 onwards, we identified a total of 128 papers, of which 63 met the inclusion criteria. Where selection criteria/instructions were not clear, authors were contacted. One in five studies (21%, or n = 13) did not report their instructions. When provided, instructions varied considerably. The most commonly provided direction was “favorite/closest relationship” (n = 12, or 19%). The remainder (n = 38, or 60%) were spread across eight different categories. Around half of the studies used a validated questionnaire that already contained an instruction, though a similar proportion of studies implemented author-designed instruments. Overall, the common absence and inconsistency of instructions for individual dog selection is taken to imply that there is no standard expectation or approach for instructions to be reported in studies of human relationships with dogs, or human–animal relationships more generally. We recommend further research on the implication of selection methods to ensure that instructions can be matched with specific research aims.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3ahuman-animal relations 3ahumans 3aquestionnaires 3aselection criteria 3asurveys 0aKeywords: animal selection 0ahuman–animal interaction 0amethodology 0amulti-pet household 0asurvey design1 aO’Dwyer, Lisel1 aBowen, Holly1 aSmith, Bradley0 tAnthrozoös.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 31, no. 2 p.195-210dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08927936.2018.14340573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245008500211300001400296520125500310592002801565650001101593650001801604650001901622650002001641650002301661651001201684653001001696653001301706653001301719653002101732653000801753700002301761700002801784773010001812856008701912852000901999655001202008IND60537841220221116175508.0190405e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053784122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Nikoleta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2899-207510aSocial capital and willingness-to-pay for coastal defences in south-east England  ap. 74-82.  aGlobally, it is widely acknowledged that constructing hard engineered coastal defences is both financially and environmentally unsustainable. Here we seek to investigate the willingness of residents in rapidly eroding coastal zones to contribute towards the costs of constructing and maintaining such structures. The originality of this paper is that it provides one of the first analyses of the influence of social capital parameters (social trust, institutional trust, social reciprocity and social networks) on respondents' willingness to pay (WTP). Fieldwork for the study was conducted in Romney Marsh, a low-lying coastal area of south-east England. The findings have substantive public policy implications for coastal management. First is that we demonstrate that while social and institutional trust exerts a positive influence on WTP, the presence of social networks militates against WTP. Secondly while the study found 45.6% of respondents were willing to pay an average monthly premium of £3.53, a high level of refusal to pay was evident among respondents. Thirdly even among those respondents willing to pay, disagreement was expressed over the political–administrative level at which a ‘coastal defence tax’ should be collected.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3apublic policy 3asocial capital 3asocial networks 3awillingness to pay 3aEngland 0aTrust 0aNetworks 0aFlooding 0aCoastal defences 0aWTP1 aClark, Julian R.A.1 aMalesios, Chrisovaladis0 tEcological economics.g2015 Nov., v. 119 p.74-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245008500206300001600291520167700307592002801984650001202012650001202024650001202036650001902048650001102067650000902078650001102087650001602098650001102114651001702125653002902142653002602171653003202197653001702229700001502246773008602261856008502347852000902432655001202441IND60628525420221117173106.0190403e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062852542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2019.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiongxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5386-055210aResponse of lower Yellow River bank breachings to La Niña events since 924 CE  ap. 159-169.  aThe El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of inter-annual climate variability, strongly affecting summer precipitation and streamflow of large rivers. So far, no effort has been made to relate ENSO events with alluvial river stability. Based on the historical document of the lower Yellow River (LYR) and the data of previously reconstructed ENSO variability, the present study aims to establish the relation between the LYR's artificial levee breaching events (LBEs) and the ENSO events from 924 CE to 1938, and thereby reveal how river instability responds to climate change in millennial scale, for a better understanding of the coupling relation between the climate, hydrology and river channel changes. From 924 CE to 1938, there are 303 La Niña influenced years (ENSO variability < −0.5), of which 172 (56.8%) are related to the occurrence of LBE. We divided the reconstructed ENSO variability into 9 classes and calculated the LBE frequency for each class. We found that the LBE frequency is negatively correlated with class average value of ENSO variability, significant at p < 0.05. By relating the 21 major course shifting events (CSEs) of the LYR (924 CE to 1938) to the occurrence of La Niña influenced years, we found that 13 (61.9%) were influenced by La Niña. The decadal LBE frequency (Fb) and decadal average of ENSO amplitude show anti-phase variations since 1100 CE, with r = −0.356 (n = 82, p = 0.0010) after a linear detrending treatment. Through the control on summer rainfall and therefore on floods in the Yellow River, La Niña events influence the occurrence of the LBEs and CSEs in the LYR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afloods 3arain 3arivers 3astream flow 3asummer 3aYellow River 0aHistorical river changes 0aRiver course shifting 0aHydrological effect of ENSO 0aYellow River1 aLi, Fuxing0 tCatena.g2019 May, v. 176 p.159-169dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245011800162300001600280520129900296592002801595596007601623596012201699650001601821650001601837650002501853650001101878650001201889650001601901650003101917650001001948650001201958650001301970650001101983650001901994650002202013650002402035650001302059650001202072700001802084700001602102700001702118700001502135700001902150700001802169773012902187856008302316852000902399655001202408IND60786483620221120202427.0220803e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078648362DNAL7 a10.1007/s12374-020-09295-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xue10aCharacterization on a Novel Rolled Leaves and Short Petioles Soybean Mutant Based on Seq-BSA and RNA-seq Analysis  ap. 261-277.  aA soybean (Glycine max (Linn.) Merr.) mutant displaying rolled leaves and short petioles was identified as being caused by multiple sites, named rlsp1. Compared to wild-type (WT), the phloem structure of petioles in rlsp1 was not obvious, while the thickness of leaves was significantly greater but the arrangement of leaves cells was relatively looser. Sequencing-based bulked segregant analysis (Seq-BSA) identified 10 candidate regions on chromosomes 3, 6, 8, 13, and 17 with total 6.47 Mb, containing 790 genes. 7946 and 5402 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were also identified in leaves and petioles, respectively, by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Glyma.03G128600 as orthologs of Arabidopsis BOP (BLADE ON PETIOLES) gene may be the key candidate gene causing the variation of rlsp1. The abnormal development of petiole phloem structure, inhibition of auxin signal transduction pathway, promotion of microtubule-related pathways, and repressed of carbohydrate processes were also closely associated with the formation of rlsp1. These results were further validated by the changes of phytohormones, sucrose, Ca²⁺, and chlorophyll. The candidate genes found in this study enrich the understanding of the molecular basis for the formation of rolled leaves and short petioles in soybean.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0102105cNational Major Science and Technology Projects of China  aKFJ-STS-QYZX-126cRegional Key Project of Science and Technology Service Network from the Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aArabidopsis 3aGlycine max 3aabnormal development 3aauxins 3acalcium 3achlorophyll 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amutants 3apetioles 3aphloem 3aplant hormones 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3asoybeans 3asucrose1 aLiu, Changkai1 aTu, Bingjie1 aLi, Yansheng1 aChen, Heng1 aZhang, Qiuying1 aLiu, Xiaobing0 tJournal of plant biology.g2022 Aug., v. 65, no. 4 p.261-277dSpringer Nature SingaporewJournal:J000000110x1226-92397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12374-020-09295-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002000184245009400204300001800298506007600316520124800392592002801640506003701668650001301705650001001718650001101728650000901739650001601748650001301764650001401777650002601791650001101817650001201828650002201840650001401862650001301876650002701889650004301916650004801959650002502007650003002032650001102062650000902073650001602082650003602098650003702134650005202171650002402223650005702247700001902304700002002323773017302343856004602516852000902562655001202571IND4487017920221207113213.0120516e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448701792DNAL7 a225478052pmid7 aPMC33566192pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.12041051092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Jung-Hoon10aRequirement of Rad18 protein for replication through DNA lesions in mouse and human cells  ap. 7799-7804.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn yeast, the Rad6-Rad18 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme plays a critical role in promoting replication although DNA lesions by translesion synthesis (TLS). In striking contrast, a number of studies have indicated that TLS can occur in the absence of Rad18 in human and other mammalian cells, and also in chicken cells. In this study, we determine the role of Rad18 in TLS that occurs during replication in human and mouse cells, and show that in the absence of Rad18, replication of duplex plasmids containing a cis-syn TT dimer or a (6-4) TT photoproduct is severely inhibited in human cells and that mutagenesis resulting from TLS opposite cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts formed at the TT, TC, and CC dipyrimidine sites in the chromosomal cII gene in UV-irradiated mouse cells is abolished. From these and other observations with Rad18, we conclude that the Rad6-Rad18 enzyme plays an essential role in promoting replication through DNA lesions by TLS in mammalian cells. In contrast, the dispensability of Rad18 for TLS in chicken DT40 cells would suggest that the role of the Rad6-Rad18 enzyme complex has diverged considerably between chicken and mammals, raising the possibility that TLS mechanisms differ among them.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achickens 3agenes 3ahumans 3amice 3amutagenesis 3aplasmids 3aubiquitin 3aultraviolet radiation 3ayeasts 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Line 2aChickens 2aDNA Damagexphysiology 2aDNA Replicationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Knockdown Techniques 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMutagenesis 2aPlasmidsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSpecies Specificity 2aUbiquitin-Conjugating Enzymesxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aPrakash, Satya1 aPrakash, Louise0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 May 15, v. 109, no. 20 p.7799-7804dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1204105109  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245006200162500001400224520110400238592002801342650002201370650000801392650001201400650001101412650002501423650001701448650001301465650001901478650002601497650001301523650001201536650001701548700002201565700002101587700002701608700002101635700002401656700001901680700002101699700002201720700002501742700002201767773012101789856007301910852000901983655001201992IND60724608120221118225812.0210122e20201230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072460812DNAL7 a10.3390/v130100502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKüchler, Leonore 10aAstrovirus-Associated Polioencephalomyelitis in an Alpaca  aNAL-light  aAn 8-year-old alpaca was admitted to the emergency service of the Clinic for Ruminants in Bern due to a reduced general condition and progressive neurological signs. Despite supportive treatment, its condition deteriorated and the animal had to be euthanized. Histopathological analysis revealed a severe non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis with neuronal necrosis, most likely of viral origin. We detected abundant neuronal labelling with antibodies directed against two different epitopes of Bovine Astrovirus CH13/NeuroS1 (BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1), which is a common viral agent associated with non-suppurative encephalitis in Swiss cattle. These findings were further verified by detection of viral RNA by use of in-situ hybridization and real-time RT-PCR. Next generation sequencing revealed that the detected virus genome had a pairwise identity of 98.9% to the genome of BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an astrovirus-associated polioencephalomyelitis in an alpaca. These results point to the possibility of an interspecies transmission of BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBovine astrovirus 3aRNA 3aalpacas 3acattle 3adisease transmission 3aencephalitis 3aepitopes 3ahistopathology 3ain situ hybridization 3anecrosis 3aneurons 3aviral genome1 aRüfli, Isabelle 1 aKoch, Michel  C.1 aHierweger, Melanie  M.1 aKauer, Ronja  V.1 aBoujon, Céline  L.1 aHilbe, Monika 1 aOevermann, Anna 1 aZanolari, Patrik 1 aSeuberlich, Torsten 1 aGurtner, Corinne 0 tViruses.g2020 Dec. 30, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130100503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007900165300001600244520125900260592002801519596005901547596007901606650002201685650001701707650002101724650003101745650001801776650001201794650002901806650001801835650001901853650001001872700001501882700001701897700001501914700001801929700001801947700001601965700005601981773012902037856008302166852000902249655001202258IND60786483820221120202430.0220803e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078648382DNAL7 a10.1007/s12374-021-09325-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Linghong14aThe Essential Role of W5 in Wax Metabolism in Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)  ap. 311-317.  aEpicuticular wax serves as an interface with the environment and thus plays an important role in the resistance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Previously, we identified the wax-deficient mutant w5, and GC–MS profiling showed that β-diketone biosynthesis was completely blocked and the content of some other components also decreased significantly in the w5 mutant. In the present study, comparative transcriptome profile of the flag-leaf sheath between the w5 mutant and its wild type was performed, and the expression patterns of differentially expressed genes in wax metabolism pathway were analyzed. The results showed that a total of 767 differentially expressed genes were identified and they were mainly enriched in wax biosynthesis and transportation pathways by Gene Ontology (GO) analyses. Further analysis showed that the expressions of epicuticular wax metabolism-related genes were almost significantly downregulated, which might contribute to the dramatic decrease of the epicuticular wax content in the w5 mutant. Here, our study delineated a transcriptional landscape of the wax metabolism regulatory genes in the w5 mutant and paved a way for further exploring the molecular mechanisms of epicuticular wax metabolism in wheat.  aPublisher supplied data  a31991214cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFD0101004cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiosynthesis 3aepicuticular wax 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3amutants 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atransportation 3awheat1 aZhang, Zhe1 aSong, Wanjun1 aSu, Zhenqi1 aZhang, Yufeng1 aYou, Mingshan1 aNi, Zhongfu1 aXing, Jiewen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3503-07390 tJournal of plant biology.g2022 Aug., v. 65, no. 4 p.311-317dSpringer Nature SingaporewJournal:J000000110x1226-92397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12374-021-09325-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016800167300001400335520177900349592002802128650002302156650001102179650001502190650001202205650002202217650001002239650001902249650001602268650002302284650001702307650002002324650001902344650001302363650001402376650001402390650000902404650001502413653001802428653000902446653001902455653001302474653001902487653001302506653001302519700002902532700003402561700002202595773012302617856008502740852000902825655001202834IND60595677920221123030926.0180605e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059567792DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2017.13977732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGajda, Anna10aTetracycline antibiotics transfer from contaminated milk to dairy products and the effect of the skimming step and pasteurisation process on residue concentrations  ap. 66-76.  aThe presence of antibiotics in raw milk and milk derivatives poses a threat to human health and can negatively affect the dairy industry. Therefore, the main object of this study was to investigate the transfer of oxytetracycline (OTC), tetracycline (TC), chlortetracycline (CTC) and doxycycline (DC) from raw, experimental milk contaminated with tetracyclines (TCs) to different dairy products: cream, butter, buttermilk, sour milk, whey, curd and cheese. Additionally the effect of the skimming process on TCs concentrations was tested, as well as the influence of low-temperature long-time pasteurisation. The analyses of TCs in milk and dairy products were performed by an LC-MS/MS method. In order to determine TCs residues in dairy products, an analytical method was developed with the same extraction step for all matrices. TCs molecules were inhomogenously distributed between the milk derivative fractions. The highest concentrations were determined in curd and cheese in the ranges 320–482 µg/kg and 280–561 µg/kg, respectively. Low levels of TCs in butter and whey were observed (11.8–41.2 µg/kg). TCs were found in sour milk (66.0–111 µg/kg), cream (85.0–115 µg/kg) and buttermilk (196–221 µg/kg) at much higher levels than in butter and whey, but lower than in curd and cheese. During the skimming process, the highest yield of cream was obtained after the raw milk was held at 2–8°C for 24 h.

It could be helpful for national greenhouse gas inventories and also for revealing potential ways of mitigation. In order to describe temporal variability of soil N₂O emission under varying key conditions, a field experiment was carried out at a cropland site on loamy and clay loamy Chernozems in Central Hungary. Dynamics of N₂O emissions were observed bi-weekly during a two-year-long study (November 2017–November 2019) using a static closed chamber–gas chromatographic method. Additional variables, including soil water content, soil temperature, leaf area index, vegetation index and net ecosystem exchange of CO₂ were also measured. Besides, a laboratory pot experiment was conducted focusing on the role of soil water content, N fertilizer, and plant presence on soil N₂O emissions. Average field N₂O emissions during the study period varied between 0.27 and 29.94 µg N m–² h⁻¹ with the largest emission peaks measured following the freeze-thaw cycle during wintertime. Additional N₂O emission peaks were observed following applications of N fertilizer and at high soil water content. Significant positive correlations were found between field N₂O emission and both soil water content and vegetation index. In contrast, a negative relationship was found between N₂O emission and soil temperature. Similar pattern was observed in the pot experiment with a significant positive correlation between N₂O emissions and soil water content when neither soil nitrate content nor temperature were limiting for microbial denitrification. In addition, a significant correlation between N₂O emission and fertilizer rate was revealed at the soil water content higher than 30% both in bare and planted soil. However, variations in soil N₂O emission among the treatments were not significantly correlated with plant presence, but a partial positive effect was observed when the soil water content was higher than 30% and samples were treated with 150 kg ha–¹ N. Based on the measured N₂O emission from both field and lab experiments and its relationship with the different drivers, it can be concluded that soil N₂O emission was strongly influenced by soil water content and N fertilizer rates and plant presence could moderately modify these responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChernozems 3acarbon dioxide 3achromatography 3aclay 3acropland 3adenitrification 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3agreenhouse gases 3aleaf area index 3anet ecosystem exchange 3anitrates 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3asoil temperature 3asoil water content 3atemporal variation 3awinter 3aCentral European region 3aHungary1 aMalek, I.1 aPosta, K.1 aKampfl, G.1 aFóti, S.1 aPintér, K.1 aNagy, Z.1 aBalogh, J.0 tEurasian soil science.g2021 Aug., v. 54, no. 8 p.1183-1195dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl3978911x1064-22937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10642293210800323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245018000200300001600380520125500396592002801651596008601679596013501765596006201900596020201962596008502164650001902249650001702268650001502285650003102300650002402331650001302355650001502368700001602383700001602399700001802415700001802433700001702451700001402468700001602482773012902498856008302627852000902710655001202719IND60786483920221120202555.0220803e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078648392DNAL7 a10.1007/s12374-021-09321-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Hu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7796-694410aComparative Analysis of miRNA Expression Profiles Provides Insight into Regulation of Biosynthesis of Flavonoids and Terpenoids Between Two Varieties of Toona sinensis Sprouts  ap. 291-310.  aIn this study, small RNA sequencing has been performed to identify the miRNAs and explore their regulatory mechanism in T. sinensis sprouts. From HPLC analysis, the flavonoid content was higher in the BYC2 (purple toon sprout) than in the GYC2 (green toon sprout), whereas the volatile terpenoids revealed an inverse change. Therefore, the small RNA libraries of two varieties were constructed, and 331 known miRNAs and 23 novel miRNAs were discovered. Differential gene expression analysis demonstrated the upregulation of 25 miRNAs and the downregulation of 27 miRNAs between BYC2 and GYC2. qRT-PCR analysis showed that nine miRNAs involved in the biosynthetic regulation of flavonoids were downregulated in the BYC2, whereas eight miRNAs related to the regulation of the biosynthesis of terpenoids were upregulated, when compared with GYC2. The results indicated that the differential expression of the miRNAs mentioned above played a crucial role in the regulation of the formation of the flavonoids and terpenoids in T. sinensis sprouts. The present study not only fills in the paucity of knowledge regarding the T. sinensis miRNA, it also provides more valuable information for the genetic improvement of T. sinensis cultivation for the future.  aPublisher supplied data  aKJ2019A0515cthe Natural Science Key Foundations of the Anhui Bureau of Education  agxgwfx2020049cinstitution of higher education outstanding top talent cultivation funding project of the Anhui Bureau of Education  a202010371013cthe Innovation Program for College Students  aZYAOX2018027cthe Open Fund of Advantaged and Characteristic Disciplines (Traditional Chinese Medicine of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University) for Key Construction Universities in Zhejiang Province  aNo. 2020FSKJ01ZDcthe Natural Science Key Foundation of Fuyang normal university 3aToona sinensis 3abiosynthesis 3aflavonoids 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic improvement 3amicroRNA 3aterpenoids1 aShi, Xiaopu1 aShen, Cheng1 aChen, Caifeng1 aQu, Changqing1 aPatel, Gopal1 aZhou, Wei1 aKai, Guoyin0 tJournal of plant biology.g2022 Aug., v. 65, no. 4 p.291-310dSpringer Nature SingaporewJournal:J000000110x1226-92397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12374-021-09321-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002100160245009100181300001600272500000900288520225400297592002802551650001602579650001402595650001202609650002902621650001502650650002202665650001702687650001402704650002102718650001602739650002302755650001002778651000902788700002102797700001802818773012202836852000902958856009702967655001203064IND9206249620221122110745.0191122e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920624962DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1992.00021962008400040027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManjanatha, M.G.10aEfficiency, Competitiveness, and Persistency of Chinese Rhizobium fiedii in Iowa Soils  ap. 676-681.  aepub  aNative Bradyhizobium japonicum occupy the majority of Midwest soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] nodules despite inoculation with more effective N₂-fixing bradyrhizobia. The objective of this study was to determine whether three fast-growing strains of Rhizobium fiedii obtained from soybean fields in China could displace the highly competitive native strains from the nodules of commonly grown Iowa-soybean cultivars. Before introducing these nonnative organisms into Iowa soils, we evaluated their effectiveness under greenhouse conditions compared with the effectiveness of B. juponicum strains USDA 110 and USDA 123. There was a dominant strain-by-cultivar interaction, and two of the three fast-growers were as effective in N₂ fixation as was USDA 123, but were less effective than was USDA 110. Furthermore, we evaluated the competitiveness of the fast-growers against native bradyrhizobia in six different soils in the greenhouse. Nodule occupancy by the fast-growers ranged from 1.5 to 38.7%. Results indicated significant cultivar-by-soil, strain-by-soil, and soil-by-strain-by-cultivar interactions. For field tests, two separate sites were selected each year in the summers of 1987 and 1988. Each of the three strains was introduced into soils at approximately 10⁶ colony forming units (CFU) cm⁻¹ row. Nodule occupancies for the four site years on Corsoy 79 and Williams 82 soybean cultivars ranged from 3.8 to 13.3%. The saprophytic survivability of fast-growers, based on nodule occupancy of field-collected soil in the greenhouse, was tested 2 and 3 yr after inoculation. Fast-growing rhizobia isolated from nodules were identified by their acid production on an artificial medium, and the reliability of this method was verified by comparing restriction-endonuclease-digestion patterns of plasmid DNA of test and reference strains. The nodule occupancies by strains of R. fredii on Williams 82 ranged from 8.6 to 13.3% and 4.4 to 11.370, 2 and 3 yr after inoculation, respectively. Thus, the strains of R. fiedii were able to persist in soil reasonably well as saprophytes. Contribution from the Dep. of Agronomy, Iowa State Univ., Journal Paper No. 5-14393 of the Iowa Agric.

Our understanding of individual response behaviour and how it is integrated into a functioning colony is still patchy. Most theoretical studies addressing this question are based on the assumption that workers have intrinsic and often fixed response thresholds for task-related stimuli. Here, we investigated the plasticity in worker fanning response behaviour in a bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. Using a temperature-controlled brood dummy, we first asked whether the fanning response is modulated by rate of temperature change. Second, we examined to what extent the fanning response is influenced by recent fanning experience. Our results show that the individual fanning response is modulated by both the rate of temperature increase and recent experience. Workers responded at lower temperatures and with a higher probability when the temperature of the brood dummy increased slowly compared with more rapid temperature increases. Workers that repeatedly responded to an increase in brood dummy temperature with fanning showed a significant decrease in their response thresholds, whereas the response thresholds of control workers that experienced the same treatment but did not gather fanning experience remained unchanged. The decrease in response threshold was pronounced when the time interval between two successive fanning events was less than 6h. When 16h or more separated fanning events, individual fanning responses returned to higher threshold levels. We suggest that experience-dependent modulation of response thresholds plays an important role in the behavioural differentiation of workers and the flexibility of insect colonies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus terrestris 3aanimal behavior 3ainsect colonies 3aprobability 3asocial insects 3atemperature 3aworker bees 0abehavioural plasticity 0aBombus terrestris 0abumblebee 0adivision of labour 0aexperience 0aresponse threshold model 0aself-organization 0aself-reinforcement 0athermoregulation1 aKleineidam, C.J.1 aRoces, F.1 aWeidenmüller, A.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2013 Jan., v. 85, no. 1 p.27-34dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005300145245017100198300001800369520164300387592002802030650001602058650003402074650002002108650002902128650002602157650001902183650001502202650000702217650001002224653001602234653001302250653001002263653002202273653003102295653002502326700001502351700005602366700001302422700002302435700001302458700001302471700001302484700005702497773013902554856008002693852000902773655001202782IND60767364620221119023305.0220215e20220203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076736462DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.1c075282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Xing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2423-889510aMolecular Insights into Roles of Dissolved Organic Matter in Cr(III) Immobilization by Coprecipitation with Fe(III) Probed by STXM-Ptychography and XANES Spectroscopy  ap. 2432-2442.  aThe coprecipitation of heavy metals (HMs) with Fe(III) in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a crucial process to control the mobility of HMs in the environment, but its underlying immobilization mechanisms are unclear. In this study, Cr(III) immobilization by coprecipitation with Fe(III) in the presence of straw-derived DOMs under different Fe/C molar ratios, pHs, and ionic strengths was investigated using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and ptychography and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The results showed that Cr(III) retention was enhanced in the presence of DOM, a maximum of which was achieved at an Fe/C molar ratio of 0.5. The increase of pH and ionic strength could also promote Cr(III) immobilization. Cr K-edge XANES results indicated that Fe (oxy)hydroxide fractions, instead of organics, provided the predominant binding sites for Cr(III), which was directly confirmed by high spatial resolution STXM-ptychography analysis at the sub-micron- and nanoscales. Moreover, organics could indirectly facilitate Cr immobilization by improving the aggregation and deposition of coprecipitate particles through DOM bridging or electrostatic interactions. Additionally, C K-edge XANES analysis further indicated that the carboxylic groups of DOM were complexed with Fe (oxy)hydroxides, which probably contributed to DOM bridging. This study provides a new insight into Cr(III) immobilization mechanisms in its coprecipitation with Fe(III) and DOM, which could have important implications on the management of Cr(III)-enriched soils, particularly with crop straw returning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acoprecipitation 3adissolved organic matter 3aenvironmental science 3aionic strength 3amicroscopy 3apH 3astraw 0airon oxides 0achromium 0aXANES 0aSTXM-ptychography 0aaggregation and deposition 0amolecular mechanisms1 aWang, Jian1 aHu, Yongfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7510-94441 aLiu, Jin1 aDarma, Aminu Inuwa1 aJin, Lin1 aHan, Hui1 aHe, Chao1 aYang, Jianjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3562-40190 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2022 Feb. 03, v. 56, no. 4 p.2432-2442dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c075283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010400167300001800271520167600289592002801965650001401993650001502007650001302022650001602035650001402051650001302065650001202078650001102090650001302101650001402114650001902128650002302147650001702170650001902187773012202206856008102328852000902409655001202418IND60747556420221122231432.0210814e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074755642DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293210801472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSapronov, D.

It was found that the dynamics of CO₂ emission during the freeze–thaw cycles were similar for all soils. The CO₂ emission from frozen soil samples was reliably determined. Subsequent soil thawing promoted a pulse increase in the CO₂ emission in comparison with that before and after the freeze–thaw cycle regardless of the soil type. Thus, for the first time, it has been shown on a wide range of soils that a significant response of СО₂ emission to freeze–thaw of the soil surface can occur in any natural zone. The magnitude of the response depends on the soil properties, primarily on the organic matter content. The influence of single freeze–thaw cycles on the annual CO₂ flux is insignificant. However, frequent freeze–thaw cycles can affect the CO₂ flux both within individual seasons and throughout the year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalcisols 3aChernozems 3aCryosols 3aKastanozems 3aLeptosols 3aLuvisols 3aPodzols 3aRussia 3aSolonetz 3aVertisols 3acarbon dioxide 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afrozen soils 3aorganic matter0 tEurasian soil science.g2021 Aug., v. 54, no. 8 p.1196-1205dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl3978911x1064-22937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10642293210801473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010500165300001600270520112200286592002801408650003401436650001501470650001701485650001001502650001401512650002601526650000901552650001201561653002101573653002801594653002501622700001701647700001301664700001501677700001201692700001601704700001801720700001601738700001501754700001401769700001301783773017401796856008301970852000902053655001202062IND60724714320221121193025.0210124e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072471432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtcms.2016.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jian10aClassification of traditional Chinese medicine constitution based on facial features in color images  ap. 141-146.  aTo explore the possible correlation between traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) constitution and facial features in color images and to improve the accuracy of automated constitution classification.Color images were taken of 5150 individuals of different professions.

The role of developmental temperature in shaping female preference functions, and thus its influence on signal-preference coupling has not been investigated. In this study, the effects of developmental temperature are examined in both males and females of the Hawaiian cricket, Laupala cerasina, to determine the degree of signal-preference matching between male song and female preference due to developmental environment. We found that rearing females in different temperature environments affected adult female acoustic preference functions in the same direction as male calling song, thereby influencing variation in adult reproductive behavior in such a way that male and female components remain coordinated. However, we further demonstrate that for male song, the effect of the rearing environment is not permanent but appears only to exert influence for a period of days. This mid-term temperature effect is distinct from the effect of short-term ambient temperature, which influences song in a matter of minutes and has been well documented. Signal-preference coordination, and sexual selection pressures due to mismatching within natural populations, likely will be influenced by nymphal developmental environments of males and females, as well as by adult singing and preference environments.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCricket song 0amate recognition 0aphonotaxis 0apreference 0asexual selection 0asignal1 aShaw, Kerry L.0 tEvolution.g2004 July, v. 58, no. 7 p.1627-1633dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F04-0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245006900170300001800239520163900257592002801896650001401924650001401938650001301952650001601965650001301981650002501994650002202019650002602041650001902067650002602086650001802112650001802130650001702148700001902165700002102184700001802205700002002223700002902243700001902272773012202291856008102413852000902494655001202503IND60747556520221122204102.0210814e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074755652DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293210800812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashirskaya, N.

The organic carbon content, total microbial biomass, biomass of living microbial cells, and oligotrophy index of microbial communities have been determined. The organic carbon content in soils of more arid areas at the southern and western boundaries of the Baer Knolls is 1.5–2 times lower as compared to soils at their northern boundary. The highest oligotrophy index of the microbial community has been detected in the soil profile in the southern part of the Baer Knolls. It reflects the high participation of microorganisms, which are best adapted to arid conditions. The variability of total and living microbial biomass depends on the soil texture, especially in the upper horizon, where these parameters in clayey soils are 1.5–2 times higher than in sandy ones. The data on the total and living microbial biomass in brown semidesert soils of the Baer Knolls are lower than in chestnut soil (Haplic Kastanozems, Cambisols, Calcisols) and solonetzes (Solonetz). Brown semidesert soil of the Baer Knolls and eroded chestnut-like paleosols of the Subboreal xerothermic period (the 3rd–2nd millennia BC) are characterized by similar total microbial biomass, whereas the biomass of living microbial cells in eroded chestnut-like paleosols is 6–9 times higher than in brown semidesert soils of the Baer Knolls and varies at the levels of light chestnut soils (Calcisols) and solonetzes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalcisols 3aCambisols 3aCastanea 3aKastanozems 3aSolonetz 3abioactive properties 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3aorganic carbon 3apaleosolic soil types 3aparticle size 3asoil profiles 3asoil texture1 aDemkina, T.

Soil parent material is one of the important factors affecting SOC and N dynamics. The aim of this research was to explore C and N dynamics of a soil lithosequence with parent materials ranging from sedimentary to metamorphic and plutonic bedrock in the eastern Kurdistan province, in western Iran.We examined the hypothesis that SOC and N accumulation potential and turnover vary significantly with soil bedrock lithology. To test our hypothesis, we collected soil samples at three depth intervals (0–5, 5–25 and 25–50 cm) as well as aboveground plant materials in six geological contexts: clastic carbonate sedimentary (CCS), foliated metamorphic (FM), non-foliated metamorphic (NFM), intermediate plutonic (IP), felsic plutonic (FP) and intermediate felsic plutonic (IFP). Soil characteristics (SOC, total N, δ13C, δ15N, soil texture, pH, EC, carbonates, available P) and plant material properties (C and N contents and their stable isotopic signatures) were determined in 45 soil samples and 18 plant materials, respectively.Results showed that both geology and soil depth strongly influenced the SOC and total N concentrations as well as their stable C and N isotopic composition. Both SOC and total N were highest per site/lithology in the soils over FM geology (5.42 and 0.51 g kg−1 soil for SOC and total N, respectively) and least in the soils forming on FP parent material (0.97 and 0.12 g kg−1 soil for SOC and total N, respectively). In the case of stable C and N isotopic composition, the highest mean value per lithology was found in the NFM soils (−23.68‰ for δ13C) and FP soils (13.74‰ for δ15N), while the lowest mean signature was observed in the soils developed over FM geology (−25.41‰ and 7.88‰ for δ13C and δ15N, respectively). Vertical distribution of both δ13C and δ15N signatures in the studied soils showed an increasing trend by depth. The main controlling factors for organic C and N concentrations across the lithosequence were explored using PLSR and PCA analyses.Results indicated that different soil properties controlled the SOC and total N contents at the different depths. Soil stable C and N isotopic compositions and pH were the factors that influenced negatively the organic C and N contents across the studied lithosequence. Differently, soil C/N ratio was strongly positively associated with SOC and TN contents. Clay- and silt-size fractions had no substantial influence on the organic C and N concentrations, although importance of silt particles for SOC and TN storage increased with increasing soil depth. These findings provide evidence that geology, as soil parent material, can control both SOC and N accumulation and turnover. However, a more in-depth study is required to understand the mechanisms by which parent lithology affects the organic C and N dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acarbonates 3aelectrical conductivity 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apH 3arangelands 3asilt 3asoil depth 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil parent materials 3asoil sampling 3asoil texture 3aspatial distribution 3astable isotopes 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aIran 0aSoil organic carbon 0aLithosequence 0aGeology 0aStable isotope0 tCatena.g2019 May, v. 176 p.245-263dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011700161500001400278520125200292592002801544650001901572650005201591650001501643650001501658650002701673650001301700650001201713651001101725651001901736773012101755856007301876852000901949655001201958IND60724608520221118225554.0210122e20201231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072460852DNAL7 a10.3390/v130100542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTumban, Ebenezer 10aLead SARS-CoV-2 Candidate Vaccines: Expectations from Phase III Trials and Recommendations Post-Vaccine Approval  aNAL-light  aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets/aerosols and it causes COVID-19. The virus infects epithelial cells by using the spike protein on its surface to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on the cells. Thus, candidate vaccines targeting the spike protein are currently being developed to prevent against infections. Approximately 44 SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines are in clinical trials (phase I–III) and an additional 164 candidates are in preclinical stages. The efficacy data from phase I/II trials of lead candidate vaccines look very promising with virus-neutralizing geometric mean antibody titers in the range of 16.6–3906. Most recently, two SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, have been granted the first emergency use authorization (EUA) in the U.S.; BNT162b2 has also been granted an EUA in the United Kingdom, Canada, and in the European Union. This review assesses whether SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines (with approved EUA or in phase III trials) meet the criteria for an ideal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The review concludes with expectations from phase III trials and recommendations for phase IV studies (post-vaccine approval).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantibodies 3aepithelium 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aCanada 3aUnited Kingdom0 tViruses.g2020 Dec. 31, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130100543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03661naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245013100165300001600296520193200312592002802244650001302272650002502285650002802310650001702338650002502355650002302380650002002403650001902423650001802442650001802460650000902478650003702487650001402524650003002538650002002568650002202588650001402610653004402624653003702668653002402705653002802729653001102757700001902768700001802787700001302805700001702818700001802835773017402853856008303027852000903110655001203119IND60724714520221121193012.0210124e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072471452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtcms.2017.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuxia10aAnti-tumor activities of macromolecular fractions of fresh gecko in vivo and their induction of Bel-7402 cell differentiation  ap. 328-335.  aTo investigate the anti-tumor effect of macromolecular fractions of fresh gecko (M-AG) in vivo and their differentiation-inducing activity in Bel-7402 cells in vitro.An H22 hepatocarcinoma-bearing mouse model was used to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of M-AG samples. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was applied to analyze cell viability. Cell morphology was observed by phase contrast microscopy. The quantity of the alpha-fetoprotein was detected by a radioimmunoassay. Chromatometry was used to assay the albumin quantity. Activities of alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl trans-peptidase were measured by biochemical methods. Finally, western blotting was applied to assess proteins in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.Macromolecular fractions of fresh gecko exerted a significant anti-tumor effect in mice. The inhibition rate of tumor growth was 63% in the moderate M-AG dose group. Cells treated with M-AG displayed a differentiated state. The treatment lowered alpha-fetoprotein secretion and significantly decreased the activities of γ-glutamyl trans-peptidase and alkaline phosphatase in Bel-7402 cells. In contrast, M-AG increased the amount of albumin in the cell culture medium. All biochemical indices demonstrated that M-AG induced Bel-7402 cell differentiation. Western blotting showed no changes in the quantities of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, p38 MAPK, or c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1/2. However, M-AG significantly activated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in a dose-dependent manner.

Field studies indicate flexibility in social behaviours in response to a changing OSR, in particular as the OSR changes across the breeding season. Remaining unclear, however, is the degree to which these behavioural changes are a direct response to an unpredictably varying OSR, or are seasonal, developing in response to seasonal cues. In this experiment, we collected cohorts of male and female fantail darters at regular intervals over the course of two full breeding seasons and placed them in artificial streams in high, moderate and low adult sex ratios (ASRs). We observed streams for 5-day periods, during which we tallied aggressive and sexually solicitous behaviours. Both male and female intrasexual aggression responded to ASR manipulations as predicted, with males increasing and females tending to decrease intrasexual aggression in response to higher male numbers. Changes in intersexual aggression rates were not correlated with changes in intrasexual rates, indicating that these two classes of behaviour varied independently of one another. Male solicitations towards females increased at moderate ASRs, but decreased when the ratio of males to females exceeded the observed natural range. Contrary to predictions, female solicitations towards males increased with increasing male numbers. Male density and hence encounter rate was a confounding factor for interpreting male-directed (but not female-directed) behaviours in response to the ASR, and furthermore negatively affected overall reproductive success. We found no evidence that competitive or solicitous behaviour responds directly to seasonal cues in Etheostoma flabellare; rather, competition over mates and solicitation of mates appear to respond directly to changes in the ASR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEtheostoma 3aadults 3aaggression 3aanimal behavior 3abehavior change 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3afemales 3amales 3aprediction 3asex ratio 3asexual selection 3asocial behavior 3astreams 0aadult sex ratio 0aaggression 0abehavioural plasticity 0aEtheostoma flabellare 0amate competition 0amate solicitation 0aoperational sex ratio 0aparental care 0areproductive success 0aseason1 aMendelson, Tamra C.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2013 Jan., v. 85, no. 1 p.43-49dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100001700185245012600202300001100328520108600339592002801425650002101453650003001474650002301504650001301527650001401540650002001554650001101574650001301585650001901598650000901617650002701626650003001653650001201683700001901695700001801714700002101732773009501753856008101848852000901929655001201938IND60572706520221116191930.0170718e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057270652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-017-0644-62doi7 a10.1007/s11032-017-0644-62chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammers, Mia10aConstructing a genetic linkage map of Vitis aestivalis-derived “Norton” and its use in comparing Norton and Cynthiana  ap. 64.  aThe first microsatellite-based linkage map for Vitis aestivalis was constructed using 183 progeny from the crosses of V. aestivalis-derived “Norton” and V. vinifera “Cabernet Sauvignon”. A total of 1157 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were tested, 859 were amplified via PCR and 413 were polymorphic for at least one parent. The map for Norton consisted of 376 markers and covered 1496.6 centimorgan (cM) on 19 chromosomes. The consensus map consisted of 411 markers on 19 linkage groups with a total distance of 1678.6 cM. Although isozyme and SSR marker analyses in 1993 and 2009 provided preliminary evidence that Norton and Cynthiana grapes are genetically identical, only five banding patterns and four microsatellite loci were reported. This study characterized the relationship between these two cultivars using 185 microsatellites spanning 19 linkage groups for a genome-wide analysis. Four accessions of Norton and three accessions of Cynthiana were used; capillary electrophoresis results revealed Norton and Cynthiana to be identical at all selected loci.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis aestivalis 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achromosome mapping 3acrossing 3acultivars 3agenetic markers 3agrapes 3aisozymes 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprogeny1 aSapkota, Surya1 aChen, Li-Ling1 aHwang, Chin-Feng0 tMolecular breeding.g2017 May, v. 37, no. 5 p.64-64dSpringer Netherlandsx1380-37437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-017-0644-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245011000204300001600314520143700330592002801767596006001795650002501855650001201880650001801892650001301910650001601923650001501939650001101954650002901965650001001994700005902004700005602063700005502119700005202174773012902226856008302355852000902438655001202447IND60786484220221120202508.0220803e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078648422DNAL7 a10.1007/s12374-022-09355-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, Kangseok1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3074-691712aA SHORTROOT-Mediated Transcriptional Regulatory Network for Vascular Development in the Arabidopsis Shoot  ap. 341-355.  aIn plants, vascular development is a dynamic process that integrates extrinsic and intrinsic factors. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), SHORTROOT (SHR) has been known to play key roles in regulating cell division and differentiation in root vascular development. However, the role of SHR in the shoot vasculature remains unknown. Here, we employed various experimental approaches to unravel SHR’s role in shoot vascular development. In hypocotyls and inflorescence stems, shr exhibited reduced cell numbers in the (pro)cambium. As a result, the daughter cells that would be incorporated into the phloem and xylem would become a shortage of supply, thereby causing precocious differentiation. By expression profiling, we identified a putative SHR-mediated transcriptional regulatory network (TRN), which includes a subset of the ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) family. Among these, we found that SHR directly regulated expression of ERF018, whose expression domains were largely overlapped with those of SHR. Additionally, we found that ERF018 overexpressors (ERF018-OXs) showed a reduction in cambium cell division in hypocotyls. Interestingly, the level of SHR transcripts was elevated in ERF018-OX hypocotyls. Taken together, our results provide insights into the previously uncharacterized role of SHR, implying that maintaining homeostasis of key regulators’ levels plays an important role in shoot vascular development.  aPublisher supplied data  aKonkuk University Research Fund 2018cKonkuk University 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acambium 3acell division 3aethylene 3ahomeostasis 3ahypocotyls 3aphloem 3atranscription (genetics) 3axylem1 aYoon, Eun Kyung1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8690-79891 aDhar, Souvik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9693-81451 aOh, Jiyeong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6927-02821 aLim, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0237-34630 tJournal of plant biology.g2022 Aug., v. 65, no. 4 p.341-355dSpringer Nature SingaporewJournal:J000000110x1226-92397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12374-022-09355-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013100171300001600302520195100318592002802269650001202297650001702309650002602326650002802352650002702380650001402407650001902421650000702440650001502447650001402462650001902476650001802495650001702513650001902530650002502549651000902574653001302583653001502596653001502611653001002626653001602636700002102652773008602673856008502759852000902844655001202853IND60628526020221120040105.0190403e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062852602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2019.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahrami, Shahram10aGeomorphological controls on soil fertility of semi-arid alluvial fans: A case study of the Joghatay Mountains, Northeast Iran  ap. 145-158.  aAlluvial fans are ideal locations to examine the effect of geomorphic processes and landforms on the soil characteristics. The rate of soil development and fertility differs between active surfaces, exposed to aggradation, and old or relict surfaces, subject to degradation. The aim of this research is to evaluate the effect of landforms and processes on soil fertility based on the studies on three alluvial fans of different ages (relict, old and young). A total of 36 soil samples were collected from these three alluvial fan surfaces. The samples were gathered from different locations of fans (apex and toe) and landforms (gully beds, interfluves, swales, and bars) and for each sample, nine variables including soil texture, acidity (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), total neutralizing value (TNV), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), total nitrogen (TN), total organic carbon (TOC), and hydraulic conductivity (K) were measured. The results show that the values of TNV, AP, AK, TN and TOC increase as clay% increases. In the relict and old fans, the values of TNV, TOC, TN, AP, AK, clay%, and silt% are higher in the interfluves than in the gully beds. Also, in the relict and old fans, the rates of clay%, silt%, TOC, TN, and AP are higher in the apexes than in the toes. In the young fan, the values of most variables are higher in the toe compared to the apex. The wide and relatively flat interfluves of the apex of old and relict fans have soils that are more fertile compared to the extensively entrenched surfaces of relict and old fan toes with relatively steep sloped interfluves. The less fertile soils in the apex of young fan can be attributed to its coarse-textured soils and also to repeated flooding and depositional processes. Overall, this study reveals that geomorphological landforms and processes such as aggradation and degradation play an important role in the spatial variation of soil fertility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acase studies 3acoarse-textured soils 3aelectrical conductivity 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amountains 3aneutralization 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asoil fertility 3asoil sampling 3asoil texture 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3aIran 0aLandform 0aRelict fan 0aInterfluve 0aGully 0aDegradation1 aGhahraman, Kaveh0 tCatena.g2019 May, v. 176 p.145-158dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245013700161500001400298520121500312592002801527650002501555650001301580650001201593650001901605650001401624650000901638650001701647650001801664650002501682650002201707650001201729650002601741700002301767700002401790700002201814700002301836700002101859700002501880700002201905700002201927773012101949856007302070852000902143655001202152IND60724608720221118225736.0210122e20210103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072460872DNAL7 a10.3390/v130100562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorgogna, Cinzia 10aEvidence of BK Polyomavirus Infection in Urothelial but not Renal Tumors from a Single Center Cohort of Kidney Transplant Recipients  aNAL-light  aEmerging evidence indicates that reactivation of BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) in the kidney and urothelial tract of kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) may be associated with cancer in these sites. In this retrospective study of a single center cohort of KTRs (n = 1307), 10 clear cell renal cell carcinomas and 5 urinary bladder carcinomas were analyzed from 15 KTRs for the presence of BKPyV infection through immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Three of these patients had already exhibited biopsy-proven polyomavirus-associated nephropathies (PyVAN). Although the presence of BKPyV large-T antigen was evident in the urothelium from a kidney removed soon after PyVAN diagnosis, it was undetectable in all the formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks obtained from the 10 kidney tumors. By contrast, large-T antigen (LT) labeling of tumor cells was detected in two out of five bladder carcinomas. Lastly, the proportion of BKPyV DNA-FISH-positive bladder carcinoma nuclei was much lower than that of LT-positive cells. Taken together, our findings further strengthen the association between BKPyV reactivation and cancer development in KTRs, especially bladder carcinoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman polyomavirus 1 3aantigens 3abladder 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinoma 3afish 3afluorescence 3ahybridization 3aimmunohistochemistry 3akidney transplant 3akidneys 3aretrospective studies1 aAlbertini, Silvia 1 aMartuscelli, Licia 1 aPoletti, Filippo 1 aVolpe, Alessandro 1 aMerlotti, Guido 1 aCantaluppi, Vicenzo 1 aBoldorini, Renzo 1 aGariglio, Marisa 0 tViruses.g2021 Jan. 03, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130100563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100001800136245011600154300001800270520152100288592002801809653001001837653002301847653001401870653002201884653001501906653002101921653001401942700002501956700003001981773010502011856007202116852000902188655001202197IND60127146720221117190853.0151110e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012714672DNAL7 a10.1554/03-4812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFornoni, Juan10aPopulation variation in the cost and benefit of tolerance and resistance against herbivory in datura stramonium  ap. 1696-1704.  aIn this study we examine the hypothesis that divergent natural selection produces genetic differentiation among populations in plant defensive strategies (tolerance and resistance) generating adaptive variation in defensive traits against herbivory. Controlled genetic material (paternal half-sib families) from two populations of the annual Datura stramonium genetically differentiated in tolerance and resistance to herbivory were used. This set of paternal half-sib families was planted at both sites of origin and the pattern of genotypic selection acting on tolerance and resistance was determined, as well as the presence and variation in the magnitude of allocational costs of tolerance. Selection analyses support the adaptive differentiation hypothesis. Tolerance was favored at the site with higher average level of tolerance, and resistance was favored at the site with higher average level of resistance. The presence of significant environmentally dependent costs of tolerance was in agreement with site variation in the adaptive value of tolerance. Our results support the expectation that environmentally dependent costs of plant defensive strategies can generate differences among populations in the evolutionary trajectory of defensive traits and promote the existence of a selection mosaic. The pattern of contrasting selection on tolerance suggests that, in some populations of D. stramonium, tolerance may alter the strength of reciprocal coevolution between plant resistance and natural enemies.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCosts 0agenetic divergence 0aherbivory 0anatural selection 0aresistance 0aselection mosaic 0atolerance1 aValverde, Pedro Luis1 aNúúñez-Farfáán, Juan0 tEvolution.g2004 Aug., v. 58, no. 8 p.1696-1704dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F03-4813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011900162300001800281520138000299592002801679650001501707650001201722650001401734650001301748650001701761650000901778650001101787650002301798650001501821650001301836700002101849700001501870700001901885700001201904700001301916700001801929700001901947773014601966856008102112852000902193655001202202IND60572706720221116191946.0170717e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057270672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-5793-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Jing10aHybrid electrooxidation and adsorption process for the removal of ammonia in low concentration chloride wastewater  ap. 5098-5105.  aThe ammonia removal performance of a hybrid electrooxidation and adsorption reactor (HEAR) is evaluated. The influences of current density, chloride concentration, and packing particles for ammonia removal in HEAR were investigated, and the performance of HEAR under serials circulation was studied. Results indicated that ammonia removal efficiency achieved around 70 % under the optimal condition after 30-min electrolysis. The optimal condition was determined as current density of 10 mA/cm², Cl⁻/NH₄ ⁺ molar ratio of 1.8, and modified zeolites as particles. The ammonia adsorption kinetic and adsorption isotherm on zeolites fitted well with second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm model, respectively. Adsorption amount of ammonia on zeolites sampled at 30-min electrolysis achieved 2.4 mg/L, higher than 1.9 mg/L of zeolites at 20-min electrolysis, indicating that electrooxidation coupled with adsorption led to simultaneous ammonia removal and zeolite regeneration in HEAR. No decrease of ammonia removal efficiency was observed over several cycles with the electrooxidation treatment. The presence of free chlorine indicating ammonia removal in HEAR was due to the combined influence by adsorption and indirect electrooxidation. These results showed that HEAR was a prospective alternative as a tertiary treatment for wastewater with low chloride ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3achlorides 3achlorine 3aelectrolysis 3aions 3amodels 3asorption isotherms 3awastewater 3azeolites1 aZhao, Qing-Liang1 aZhang, Jun1 aJiang, Jun-Qiu1 aLi, Wei1 aYu, Hang1 aHuang, Li-Kun1 aZhang, Yun-Shu0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Feb., v. 24, no. 6 p.5098-5105dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5793-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01929naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245006300159300001600222520087700238592002801115650001601143650001301159650001301172650001201185650001801197650001101215650001901226650001901245650001401264700002201278700002201300773016801322856008001490852000901570655001201579IND60601960420221123013950.0180709e20180117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060196042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b043962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Di10aMass Transfer Parameters for Packings: Effect of Viscosity  ap. 718-729.  aThe effect of liquid viscosity (μL) on the effective mass transfer area (aₑ) and liquid film mass transfer coefficient (kL) of packing must be known to determine packing height. Most existing correlations are based on water and are not applicable to viscous systems. In this work, aₑ, kL, and gas film mass transfer coefficient (kG) were measured in a 0.43 m ID packed column with 0.5–3 m of packing. Liquid viscosity was varied from 0.8 to 70 mPa·s by adding glycerol to water. Liquid viscosity has an insignificant effect on aₑ over the range of μL investigated. The total dependence of kL on μL is −0.75, of which −0.35 is indirect influence through diffusivity, and −0.4 is direct influence through liquid turbulence. Universal mass transfer models for packing were developed as functions of packing geometry, operating condition, and fluid property.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiffusivity 3ageometry 3aglycerol 3aliquids 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aprocess design 3aturbulent flow 3aviscosity1 aSeibert, A.

The main goal was to assess whether micropollutants in the wastewater mass cause an ecotoxicological risk to the aquatic environment, and to determine how far the zone of risk extends beyond the wastewater outlet. Real-time measurements of elevated electrical conductivity were used as a proxy to indicate the presence of wastewater-influenced water. Conductivity was highest in immediate proximity to the wastewater outlet, though if all measurements obtained over the duration of the sampling campaign were integrated, elevated conductivity extended over an area of at least 1 km²surrounding the outlet. Additionally, water samples were collected within and outside Vidy Bay, and were analyzed for 39 micropollutants (pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and corrosion inhibitors). Micropollutant concentrations were generally in the low ng/L range, though for some substances >100 ng/L was measured. The concentrations of most pharmaceuticals, which are primarily wastewater-derived, decreased with decreasing conductivity and with increasing distance from the wastewater outlet. Pesticide concentrations, in contrast, were homogeneous throughout Vidy Bay and the lake. An ecotoxicological risk assessment based on the cumulative risk exerted by all measured substances indicated that the wastewater caused a zone of potential ecotoxicological risk that extended well into the deep lake and in the direction of a downstream drinking water intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3acorrosion 3acumulative risk 3adrinking water 3adrugs 3aelectrical conductivity 3alakes 3arisk assessment 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aLake Geneva1 aAkhtman, J.q(Jos),1 aMartelletti, Lorenzo1 aRutler, Rebecca1 aBonvin, Florence1 aGrange, Aureline1 aArey, J.

For 6 amino acids (Thr, β-Ala, α-Ala, Met, Val and Orn) the negative mode led to lower LoQ values, while the positive mode offered lower LoQ values for 5 amino acids (Arg, Asp, Glu, GABA, and Pro). The remaining 11 amino acids showed similar LoQ values in both modes. Because of this, negative ionization mode allowed to detect and quantify amino acids such as: β-Alanine, threonine, and ornithine whose concentrations were low in most of the analysed samples. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for the results in both modes were similar. The method's linearity was determined to be in the range of 1 to 130 ppb with r² > 0.99. Recoveries ranged from 93 to 112%. Negative mode was less affected by matrix effects the main effect was signal enhancement. In contrast, the positive ionization mode suffered from signal enhancement as well as signal suppression.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeers 3aderivatization 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3aornithine 3astandard deviation 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athreonine 0aLC-MS 0aFree amino acids 0aBeer 0aElectrospray 0aDerivatization1 aHerodes, Koit1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1763-17841 aLeito, Ivo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3000-49640 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 Aug. 16, v. 1677 p.463320-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4633203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012600168300001800294520110200312592002801414650000901442650002601451650001001477650002201487650002901509650001201538650002101550650002001571650001601591650001801607653002001625653002401645653001601669653001801685653001701703653001701720700001501737700001401752700001401766700001601780773009901796856008501895852000901980655001201989IND60581257520221117204715.0180831e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058125752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2016.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Yanling10aIn-situ investigation of the effect of dust deposition on the performance of polycrystalline silicon photovoltaic modules  ap. 1273-1284.  aIn this study, a test platform consisting of an array of photovoltaic (PV) modules and different measuring instruments was set up to monitor the real-time temperature of the PV modules, the output power, the solar irradiance, and other environmental parameters. Dust deposition strongly affects the performance of PV modules; therefore, in this study, the effect of dust deposition on the module temperature, the transmittance, and the output power of the PV modules was comprehensively investigated, in particular, focusing on the dust deposition density. The results showed that dust deposition not only reduced the transmittance of the PV glass panel, but also reduced the module temperature, thereby affecting the output power of the PV module. Through an analysis of the test data, the relationships between the dust deposition density and both the relative transmittance and the relative output power rate were successfully established. Moreover, the experiment elucidated that the relative transmittance of a PV module could decline by 20% within only 8 days due to natural dust deposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3adust 3aenvironmental factors 3aglass 3ameasuring devices 3arenewable energy sources 3asilicon 3asolar collectors 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3atransmittance 0aDust deposition 0aPhotovoltaic module 0aTemperature 0aTransmittance 0aOutput power 0aIn-situ test1 aZhang, Hao1 aXiao, Bin1 aZhou, Zhi1 aYan, Xuzhou0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Feb., v. 101 p.1273-1284dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010000156300002000256520123200276592002801508650002001536650001301556650002701569650001701596650002601613650001901639650001401658650001801672650001301690650002601703650001901729650001301748700001701761700001401778700001601792700001701808700001301825700001701838700001501855700001701870773012301887856007402010852000902084655001202093IND60667583420221119224028.0190919e20150526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066758342DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra06576c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Weiwei10aDesign and preparation of bio-based dielectric elastomer with polar and plasticized side chains  ap. 47429-47438.  aA new dielectric elastomer with large actuated strain driven by low electric field was synthesized from di-n-butyl itaconate and isoprene through free radical redox emulsion polymerization. The effect of the copolymerized proportion of poly(di-n-butyl itaconate-co-isoprene) (PDBII) and the dosage of crosslinking agent on the elastic modulus, dielectric properties, and actuated strain of the elastomer were investigated, and a potential dielectric elastomer candidate containing 70 wt% di-n-butyl itaconate was obtained. The permittivity of the PDBII crosslinked by 3.0 phr of dicumyl peroxide was 5.68 at 10³ Hz, which was higher than that of commercial acrylic and silicone dielectric elastomers. Without any prestrain, an actuated strain of 20% was obtained at an electric field of 30 kV mm⁻¹. In order to further increase the actuated strain, barium titanate (BaTiO₃), a high-dielectric-constant ceramic powder, was utilized to fill the PDBII to form a BaTiO₃/PDBII composite. The dielectric constant of the composite increased with increasing content of BaTiO₃, and the elastic modulus of the composite was lower than that of the unfilled PDBII, leading to a larger dielectric actuated strain of the composite.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarium titanate 3aceramics 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3adielectric properties 3aelectric field 3aemulsions 3afree radicals 3aisoprene 3amodulus of elasticity 3apolymerization 3asilicone1 aWang, Runguo1 aYang, Dan1 aHou, Guanyi1 aZhou, Xinxin1 aQiao, He1 aWang, Wencai1 aTian, Ming1 aZhang, Liqun0 tRSC advances.g2015 May 26, v. 5, no. 59 p.47429-47438dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra06576c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013400170520123800304592002801542650000801570650002501578650001201603650001601615650001301631650002401644650001201668650002501680650002501705650002001730650001501750650001501765650001501780650002001795653002301815653001501838653000801853653000801861653001601869700001901885700001601904700002001920773011301940856008502053852000902138655001202147IND60696286920221119123451.0200804e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069628692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1182612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFortunato, Luca10aFouling control in a gravity-driven membrane (GDM) bioreactor treating primary wastewater by using relaxation and/or air scouring  aGravity-driven membrane bioreactors (GD-MBR) have been proposed as a sustainable water treatment due to the low energy requirements in terms of operation. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of different physical cleaning strategies on the membrane performance in a gravity-driven membrane bioreactor treating primary wastewater. The Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) allowed evaluating the impact of the physical cleaning on the biomass developed on the membrane surface. Applying relaxation did not enhance the membrane performance, however, it led to an increase in thickness and a decrease in the biomass specific hydraulic resistance. Using air scouring under continuous filtration increased the biomass specific hydraulic resistance by compressing the biomass (~50% decrease in thickness). When air scouring was applied at the end of a relaxation cycle, a higher biomass removal and a significant increase in flux (250%) were observed. Biopolymers were found to constitute 55% of the fouling layer. This study highlighted the suitability of an in-situ monitoring approach as a key tool to evaluate the impact of different physical cleaning strategies on the biomass removal in membrane filtration process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aartificial membranes 3abiomass 3abiopolymers 3acleaning 3aenergy requirements 3afouling 3ahydraulic resistance 3amembrane bioreactors 3amicrofiltration 3amonitoring 3atomography 3awastewater 3awater treatment 0aFouling mitigation 0aCake layer 0aMBR 0aOCT 0aBiopolymers1 aRanieri, Luigi1 aNaddeo, V.,1 aLeiknes, TorOve0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 610 p.118261-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1182613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03662naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012700165300001800292520179000310592002802100650002202128650002102150650001602171650001802187650002202205650001702227650001602244650001202260650001502272650003102287650001602318650001202334650001602346650000902362650001702371650003102388650003002419650001702449650002202466650001302488650001502501650001402516650001702530650001202547650002302559653002602582653001202608653001002620700001502630700001602645700002202661700001702683700005502700700005502755773013202810856008502942852000903027655001203036IND60646406720221119125854.0190610e20190505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064640672DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b001362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Kaiwu10aProteomic Profiles of the Early Mitochondrial Changes in APP/PS1 and ApoE4 Transgenic Mice Models of Alzheimer’s Disease  ap. 2632-2642.  aAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative diseases. Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) carriers account for 40% of all AD cases, emphasizing the importance of ApoE4 in the pathogenesis of AD. In the present study, we explored the changes of hippocampal proteins expression profile at the early stage (3 month-old) of APP/PS1 and ApoE4 knockin mice with the aim to find potential key pathways involved in AD progression. Proteomic analysis showed a lot of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), 247 (137 increased and 110 decreased) and 1125 (642 increased and 484 decreased) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 and ApoE4 mice, respectively, compared with the wild-type (WT) mice, using a cutoff of 1.2-fold change. Functional classification of DEPs revealed that these proteins mainly comprise proteins involved in acetylation, methylation, endocytosis/exocytosis, chaperone, oxidoreductase, mitochondrial, cytoskeletal, and synaptic proteins in APP/PS1 mice compared with the WT mice. Likewise in ApoE4 mice compared with the WT mice, the DEPs are mostly involved in the functions of synapses, ribosomes, mitochondria, spliceosomes, endocytosis/exocytosis, oxidative phosphorylation, and proteasomes. STRING analysis suggested that some DEPs were involved in insulin signaling and mitochondrial electron transport chain in the two mouse models. The abnormal changes of insulin signaling and mitochondrial electron transport chain were further verified by Western blot. Taken together, our study exposed the changes of hippocampal protein expression profiles at the early stage of APP/PS1 and ApoE4 knockin mice, and the change of insulin signaling and mitochondrial electron transport chain may be the key molecular processes involved in AD progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aWestern blotting 3aacetylation 3aanimal models 3aapolipoprotein E4 3acytoskeleton 3aendocytosis 3aenzymes 3aexocytosis 3agene expression regulation 3ahippocampus 3ainsulin 3amethylation 3amice 3amitochondria 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3apathogenesis 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aribosomes 3aspliceosomes 3asynapse 3atransgenic animals 0aAlzheimer’s disease 0aAPP/PS1 0aApoE41 aNie, Lulin1 aZhou, Qiang1 aRahman, Shafiq Ur1 aLiu, Jianjun1 aYang, Xifei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9000-70161 aLi, Shupeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7807-374X0 tJournal of proteome research.g2019 May 05, v. 18, no. 6 p.2632-2642dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b001363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011500160520099100275592002801266650002401294650001801318650001301336650002301349650001101372650002201383650002301405650001501428650001401443650001601457650001601473653004201489653002001531653001501551653002401566700001501590700001501605700001301620700001801633700001501651700001701666773012201683856008101805852000901886655001201895IND60713047920221119030208.0211030e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071304792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1102952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hui10aApplication of passive modified atmosphere packaging in the preservation of sweet corns at ambient temperature  aThe purpose of this study was to design a passive modified atmosphere packaging (PMAP) to effectively extend the shelf-life of fresh sweet corn under ambient temperatures. Oxygen permeable film (OPF) and water vapor permeable film (WPF) of different areas were used to prepare the PMAPs. By changing the areas of the OPF and WPF, different headspace atmospheres could be created in the PMAPs, and the effects of different atmospheres on the quality of sweet corn could be evaluated. The experiments were carried out under the temperature conditions of 25 ± 1 °C and relative humidity conditions of 60 ± 5%. The headspace gas, weight loss rate, hardness, total soluble solids content, total acid content, vitamin C content, and sensory quality were measured daily. The results showed that when the proportional area of WPF was 80%–85% and OPF was 15%–20%, the PMAP created a suitable atmosphere for fresh sweet corn, extending the shelf-life to 5 days at ambient temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aascorbic acid 3ahardness 3aheadspace analysis 3aoxygen 3arelative humidity 3asensory properties 3ashelf life 3asweetcorn 3awater vapor 3aweight loss 0aPassive modified atmosphere packaging 0aFunctional film 0aSweet corn 0aAmbient temperature1 aLi, Dongli1 aXu, Wencai1 aFu, Yabo1 aLiao, Ruijuan1 aShi, Jiazi1 aChen, Yunzhi0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Jan., v. 136 p.110295-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1102953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013600168300001800304520101000322592002801332650001501360650001601375650002601391650001101417650002101428650001701449650001601466653002801482653003001510653002301540653003801563700001601601773009901617856008501716852000901801655001201810IND60581257620221117204638.0180831e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058125762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2016.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBana, Sangram10aIdentification of unknown parameters of a single diode photovoltaic model using particle swarm optimization with binary constraints  ap. 1299-1310.  a-Photo-voltaic (PV) is a static medium to convert solar energy directly into electricity. In order to predict the performance of a PV system before being installed, a reliable and accurate model design of PV systems is essential. To validate the design of a PV system like maximum power point (MPP) and micro-grid system through simulation, an accurate solar PV model is required. However, information provided by manufacturers in data sheets is not sufficient for simulating the characteristic of a PV module under normal as well as under diverse environmental conditions. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique with binary constraints has been presented to identify the unknown parameters of a single diode model of solar PV module. Multi-crystalline and mono-crystalline technologies based PV modules are considered under the present study. Based on the results obtained, it has been found that PSO algorithm yields a high value of accuracy irrespective of temperature variations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aelectricity 3aenvironmental factors 3amodels 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3atemperature 0aPhotovoltaic (PV) model 0aMaximum power point (MPP) 0aBinary constraints 0aParticle swarm optimization (PSO)1 aSaini, R.P.0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Feb., v. 101 p.1299-1310dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014600164300001400310520189600324592002802220650001902248650002802267650001002295650002402305650001902329650001502348651001602363651001602379700001702395700001502412700001502427700001302442700001702455773010002472856004802572852000902620655001202629IND50090022220221118141458.0140612e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009002222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-013-0321-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazmi, A. M.10aDirect effects of dominant winds on residence and travel times in the wide and open lacustrine embayment: Vidy Bay (Lake Geneva, Switzerland)  ap. 59-71.  aNumerical simulations were carried out to determine the residence (or flushing) time of water in Vidy Bay (north shore of Lake Geneva) for different meteorological conditions. A hydrodynamic model (Delft3D-FLOW) was applied to simulate the flow field in the embayment during 2010 and January 2011. Using these results, particle tracking was applied to estimate transport of wastewater effluent discharged into the embayment. The model predictions compared well with published field measurements of dissolved species (as given by electrical conductivity profiles) within the wastewater. The pelagic boundary of the embayment was defined by the largest within-bay gyre. Based on this definition, particle tracking was used to quantify the residence time under dominant wind conditions. Similarly, particle tracking was used to determine the travel time (i.e., time to exit the embayment) for each of Vidy Bay’s three inflows (stream, stormwater and wastewater effluent). Although the wind field over the lake is variable, current patterns in the embayment can be simulated using the hydrodynamic model forced by a spatially uniform wind field. For a given wind speed, the main factor influencing residence and travel times is the wind angle. The presence of gyres leads to high mean residence times with large variability. As the wind direction becomes more aligned with the shoreline (i.e., with increasing westerly or easterly components), longshore currents dominate. These disrupt gyre formation and markedly reduce the mean and variability of embayment residence time. The numerical model was utilized to assess the potential for plume movement (in plan) from above the wastewater effluent outfall towards one of Lausanne’s drinking water intakes. In the most direct pathway, westward longshore currents can move water from the embayment to the water column above the intake location.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrinking water 3aelectrical conductivity 3alakes 3amathematical models 3awind direction 3awind speed 3aLake Geneva 3aSwitzerland1 aBarry, D.

Embryo production traits have been shown to be heritable, but the genes that cause this variability have not yet been assessed. The main objectives of this study were to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with embryo production traits and to identify candidate genes affecting the number of embryos produced by Holstein donors in Canada that may provide insight into the regulation of embryo production. Breeding values were estimated and de-regressed for all donors and sires using a data set of 150,971 records of superovulation or ovum pick-up and in vitro fertilization. A total of 11,607 animals were genotyped, but of that number only 5,118 were genotyped with at least a 50K SNP panel and had a de-regressed estimated breeding value reliability of at least 10%. For the GWAS, 606,406 imputed SNP on 29 autosomal chromosomes were considered after applying quality control measures. A single-SNP univariate mixed linear animal model was used to perform the GWAS, and a 5% false discovery rate was applied to adjust for multiple testing. We found 36 and 14 significant SNP associated with the total number of embryos and the number of viable embryos, respectively, with most of them located on chromosome 11. Using these significant SNP, positional genes located within 10,000 bp upstream and downstream of the SNP were retrieved. Thirteen genes were harboring or near the significant SNP for the total number of embryos, 4 of them also being near the significant SNP for viable embryos. Some of these genes (CRB2, DENND1A, MAD1L1, NDUFA8, PTGS1) could be considered as potential positional candidate genes related to the number of embryos produced by a donor.

Sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA amplicons from gill and intestinal content microbiomes using the Illumina MiSeq platform yielded 1,276,161 paired-end sequence reads from the gill libraries and 1,092,333 paired-end sequence reads from the intestinal content libraries. General bioinformatic analyses were conducted with the opensource packages Qiime and Mothur. Phylotype assignments to the genus level were made using the commercial One Codex platform. This resulted in 1,697,852 gill and 988,436 intestinal content sequences being classified to genus. A majority of these (67.6% and 37.2%, respectively) were assigned to a single operational taxonomic unit (M. edulis Symbiont, MeS) that has homologies with other recently described Endozoicomonas pathogens and symbionts of marine invertebrates. This newly discovered symbiont shares 98% identity with an uncultured bacterium from the gill tissue of an invasive Indo-Pacific oyster and with HQE1 and HQE2 isolated from the sea squirt Styela clava. Other than MeS, most of the detected bacterial species are known from marine sediments and seawater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus edulis 3aStyela clava 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abacteria 3abioinformatics 3amarine sediments 3amicrobiome 3amussels 3aoysters 3apathogens 3aphylotype 3aribosomal DNA 3aseawater 3asymbionts 3aNew Jersey 0aEndozoicomonas 0aMytilus edulis 0amussel 0aNew Jersey 0aBarnegat Bay1 aIwanowicz, Deborah1 aAdams, Cynthia0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2017 Aug., v. 36, no. 2 p.391-401dNational Shellfisheries AssociationwJournal:15036x0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.036.02123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03900naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100009500153245007700248300001800325520191300343592002802256650001502284650002102299650001602320650001202336650001102348650001302359650002102372650001202393650001402405650001702419650001202436650002702448650001402475650001402489650001102503650001402514650001402528650001202542650001102554650001402565650001902579650001002598650000902608650001702617653001502634653002102649653002002670653001702690653002302707653001002730653001202740700002902752700010002781700002402881700003102905700009602936773012103032856008803153852000903241655001203250IND60649464020221119070218.0191114e20191110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064946402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.5152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHevia, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6352-1442 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6352-144210aLong-term nutrient imbalances linked to drought-triggered forest dieback  ap. 1254-1267.  aDrought-induced forest dieback is causing reductions in productivity, increasing tree mortality and impairing terrestrial carbon uptake worldwide. However, the role played by long-term nutrient imbalances during drought-induced dieback is still unknown. To improve our knowledge on the relationships between dieback and nutrient imbalances, we analysed wood anatomical traits (tree-ring width and wood density), soil properties and long-term chemical information in tree-ring wood (1900–2010) by non-destructive Micro X-ray fluorescence (μXRF) and destructive (ICP-OES) techniques. We studied two major European conifers with ongoing drought-induced dieback in mesic (Abies alba, silver fir) and xeric (Pinus sylvestris, Scots pine) sites. In each site we compared coexisting declining (D) and non-declining (ND) trees. We used dendrochronology and generalized additive and linear mixed models to analyse trends in tree-ring nutrients and their relationships with wood traits. The D trees presented lower growth and higher minimum wood density than ND trees, corresponding to a smaller lumen area of earlywood tracheids and thus a lower theoretical hydraulic conductivity. These differences in growth and wood-anatomy were more marked in silver fir than in Scots pine. Moreover, most of the chemical elements showed higher concentrations in D than in ND trees during the last two-five decades (e.g., Mn, K and Mg), while Ca and Na increased in the sapwood of ND trees. The Mn concentrations, and related ratios (Ca:Mn, Mn:Al and P:Mn) showed the highest differences between D and ND trees for both tree species. These findings suggest that a reduced hydraulic conductivity, consistent with hydraulic impairment, is affecting the use of P in D trees, making them more prone to drought-induced damage. The retrospective quantifications of Mn ratios may be used as early-warning signals of impending dieback.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aPinus sylvestris 3aX-radiation 3acalcium 3acarbon 3aconifers 3adendrochronology 3adieback 3aearlywood 3afluorescence 3aforests 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amodels 3anutrients 3apotassium 3asapwood 3asodium 3atracheids 3atree mortality 3atrees 3awood 3awood density 0aAbies alba 0aPinus sylvestris 0aDendrochemistry 0aWood density 0aX-ray fluorescence 0aItrax 0aICP-OES1 aSánchez-Salguero, Raúl1 aCamarero, J.

A kafirin isolate containing mostly α-kafirins, but also γ- and β-kafirins, was used as shell material. Electrospraying solutions with 10 wt% kafirin and fish oil (20 wt% with respect to kafirin) led to the production of nanocapsules (552 and 861 nm) when electrosprayed at 20–25 kV voltage with flow rates ranging from 0.5 to 1 mL/h. Neither the flow rate nor the voltage had a significant effect (p > 0.05) on the average diameter of the kafirin electrosprayed capsules loaded with fish oil. The encapsulation efficiency of the nanocapsules was up to 94.0 ± 2.5%, indicating that most of the fish oil was encapsulated within the kafirin shell. These results suggest the feasibility of obtaining kafirin-based capsules for the encapsulation of fish oil by electrospraying. This will open up new possibilities for kafirin as hydrophobic shell material for the production of fish oil encapsulates, which can be applied to the fortification with ω−3 fatty acids of food matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrospraying 3aencapsulation 3afish oils 3ahydrophobicity 3akafirins 3ananocapsules 0aKafirin 0aSorghum 0aOmega-3 0aNanocapsules 0aElectrospraying1 aMendes, Ana C.1 aJacobsen, Charlotte1 aCeylan, Zafer1 aChronakis, Ioannis S.1 aBean, Scott R.1 aMoreno, Pedro J.

Suboptimal fragmentation of kernels can affect milk yield from dairy cows when the silage is used as fodder and oversized stover particles can promote mould yielding bacteria during storage due to resulting air pockets. As a forage harvester can harvest hundreds of tonnes per hour, an efficient and robust system for measuring quality in the field is required, however, current methods require manual errorsome separation steps or for samples to be sent to an off-site laboratory. Therefore, we propose to adopt Faster R-CNN with an Inceptionv2 backbone to detect kernel fragments and oversized particles in images of corn silage taken directly after harvesting without the need for separating particles. We explore strategies of data sampling for specialist models, transfer learning from differing domains and tuning the anchors in the Region Proposal Network to accommodate for changes in object shapes and sizes. Our approach leads to significant improvements in average precision for kernel fragmentation and stover overlengths of up to 45.2% compared to a naive model development approach, despite the challenging cluttered scenes. Additionally, our models are able to predict quality for network predictions with the Corn Silage Processing Score (CSPS) for kernel fragmentation and a measure we introduce for chopped stover named Overlength Processing Score (OVPS). For both scores we obtain a strong correlation against physically measured samples with an r² of 0.66 for CSPS, 0.79 and 0.95 for OVPS at two verbal theoretical lengths of cut.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aair 3acorn silage 3aelectronics 3afarmers 3aforage 3amilk yield 3astover 0aObject detection 0aDeep learning 0aKernel fragmentation1 aKirk, Kristian1 aMoeslund, Thomas B.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2021 Sept., v. 188 p.106344-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1063443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014400168520149500312592002801807650001701835650001501852650001701867650002601884650001301910650001801923650003301941650001301974650002601987650002902013650004402042650002102086651001002107653001702117653001502134653001702149653001602166653004102182700002602223700001702249700002102266700002202287773012202309856008102431852000902512655001202521IND60713048220221119030029.0211030e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071304822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1102982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhallab, Dina S.10aChemical profiling of Egyptian propolis and determination of its xanthine oxidase inhibitory properties using UPLC–MS/MS and chemometrics  aIn the current study, propolis samples from various geographical localities in Egypt were investigated by chemical profiling and xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory and radical scavenging activity testing. Metabolic fingerprints were attained using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), UHPLC-MS analysis in an untargeted holistic perspective followed by the subsequent annotation of 65 compounds in total. Variation in chemical profiles of samples was assessed by principle component analysis and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis which was able to successfully classify Egyptian propolis samples into two main types (orange and blue) and one subtype (green or mixed) and rapidly screen type-specific markers. Further, propolis extracts were assessed for their antioxidant and xanthine oxidase inhibitory effects through in vitro assays coupled to orthogonal projection to latent structures in order to relate metabolite profiles to biological effects in Egyptian propolis and pick out the potential biomarkers pinocembrin, kaempferide, coumaroyl acetyl glycerol, galangin, palmitic acid and pinobanksin as likely mediators of antioxidant and XO inhibitory activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive profiling of Egyptian propolis secondary metabolites that can present a chemical-based evidence for its efficacious consistency regarding its potential XO inhibitory activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3achemometrics 3adiscriminant analysis 3aglycerol 3apalmitic acid 3aprincipal component analysis 3apropolis 3asecondary metabolites 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3axanthine oxidase 3aEgypt 0aBee propolis 0aUPLC/MS/MS 0aChemometrics 0aAntioxidant 0aXanthine oxidase inhibitory activity1 aMohyeldin, Mohamed M.1 aShawky, Eman1 aMetwally, Ali M.1 aIbrahim, Reham S.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Jan., v. 136 p.110298-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1102983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04728naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245011500167300001800282520296700300592002803267650001903295650001103314650001703325650001603342650001803358650001003376650001303386650001403399650001003413650001403423650001203437650001803449650000903467650002103476650001503497650000703512650001603519650002003535650001203555650001103567650002303578650001803601650002303619650001303642653001703655653002203672653001803694653001803712653002503730700002003755700002203775700001903797700002303816700002103839773015403860856007904014852000904093655001204102IND60609480420221120113826.0200427e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060948042DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2017-141112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVacca, Giuseppe M.10aMilk yield, quality, and coagulation properties of 6 breeds of goats: Environmental and individual variability  ap. 7236-7247.  aGoat milk and cheese production is continuously increasing and milk composition and coagulation properties (MCP) are useful tools to predict cheesemaking aptitude. The present study was planned to investigate the extension of lactodynamographic analysis up to 60 min in goat milk, to measure the farm and individual factors, and to investigate differences among 6 goat breeds. Daily milk yield (dMY) was recorded and milk samples collected from 1,272 goats reared in 35 farms. Goats were of 6 different breeds: Saanen and Camosciata delle Alpi for the Alpine type, and Murciano-Granadina, Maltese, Sarda, and Sarda Primitiva for the Mediterranean type. Milk composition (fat, protein, lactose, pH; somatic cell score; logarithmic bacterial count) and MCP [rennet coagulation time (RCT, min), curd-firming time (k₂₀, min), curd firmness at 30, 45, and 60 min after rennet addition (a₃₀, a₄₅, and a₆₀, mm)] were recorded, and daily fat and protein yield (dFPY g/d) was calculated as the sum of fat and protein concentration multiplied by the dMY. Data were analyzed using different statistical models to measure the effects of farm, parity, stage of lactation and breed; lastly, the direct and the indirect effect of breed were quantified by comparing the variance of breed from models with or without the inclusion of linear regression of fat, protein, lactose, pH, bacterial, somatic cell counts, and dMY. Orthogonal contrasts were performed to compare least squares means. Almost all traits exhibited high variability, with coefficients of variation between 32 (for RCT) and 63% (for a₃₀). The proportion of variance regarding dMY, dFPY, and milk composition due to the farm was moderate, whereas for MCP it was low, except for a₆₀, at 69%. Parity affected both yield and quality traits of milk, with least squares means of dMY and dFPY showing an increase and RCT and curd firmness traits a decrease from the first to the last parity class. All milk quality traits, excluding fat, were affected by the stage of lactation; RCT and k₂₀ decreased rapidly and a₃₀ was higher from the first to the last part of lactation. Alpine breeds showed the highest dMY and dFPY but Mediterranean the best percentage of protein, fat, and lactose and a shorter k₂₀ and a greater a₃₀. Among the Mediterranean goats, Murciano-Granadina goats had the highest milk yield, fat, and protein contents, whereas Maltese, Sarda, and Sarda Primitiva were characterized by much more favorable technological properties in terms of k₂₀, a₃₀, and a₄₅. In conclusion, as both the farm and individual factors highly influenced milk composition and MCP traits, improvements of these traits should be based both on modifying management and individual goat factors. As expected, several differences were attributable to the breed effect, with the best milk production for the Alpines and milk quality and coagulation for the Mediterranean goats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMurcia-Granada 3aSaanen 3acheesemaking 3acoagulation 3adata analysis 3afarms 3afirmness 3agoat milk 3agoats 3alactation 3alactose 3aleast squares 3amilk 3amilk composition 3amilk yield 3apH 3aplate count 3aprotein content 3arearing 3arennet 3asomatic cell count 3asomatic cells 3astatistical models 3avariance 0acaprine milk 0alactodynamography 0acurd firmness 0aAlpine breeds 0aMediterranean breeds1 aStocco, Giorgia1 aDettori, Maria L.1 aPira, Emanuela1 aBittante, Giovanni1 aPazzola, Michele0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Aug., v. 101, no. 8 p.7236-7247dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-141113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011200155300002000267520118700287592002801474650000801502650001101510650002101521650002201542650001201564650001101576650001301587650001401600650001401614650002401628650001401652650001101666650002101677650002001698650002101718700001901739700001201758700001501770700001201785700002201797700002001819773012401839856007401963852000902037655001202046IND60667584020221119224102.0190919e20150605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066758402DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra06598d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yifan10aFree oxoanion theory for BaMgAl₁₀O₁₇:Eu²⁺ structure decomposition during alkaline fusion process  ap. 50105-50112.  aThe alkaline fusion process is a useful pretreatment for rare earth elements (REEs) recycling from blue phosphor (BaMgAl₁₀O₁₇:Eu²⁺, BAM), but the lack of basic theory affects the further development of the alkaline fusion process. Different substances (KOH, NaOH, Ca(OH)₂, NaCl, Na₂CO₃, and Na₂O₂) were chosen to react with BAM to explain the alkaline fusion process; only KOH, NaOH, Na₂CO₃, and Na₂O₂ can damage the BAM structure. The BAM alkaline fusion reactions share similar processes. Europium and magnesium ions were bonded with free oxoanion (OH⁻, CO₃²⁻, O₂²⁻) preferentially to escape from the BAM structure. The remaining structure of barium aluminate eventually decomposed into aluminate and BaCO₃ in air. Cations (Na⁺, K⁺) were introduced to bond with the aluminate ions to maintain the charge balance of the reaction system. Free Oxoanion Theory (FOAT) was summarized to elucidate the structure decomposition process of BAM. The variation principle of determined lattice energy was in agreement with the FOAT analysis results. FOAT is very beneficial for the REEs recycling mechanism and alkaline fusion technology theory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abarium 3abarium carbonate 3acalcium hydroxide 3acations 3aenergy 3aeuropium 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3apotassium hydroxide 3arecycling 3asodium 3asodium carbonate 3asodium chloride 3asodium hydroxide1 aZhang, Shengen1 aLiu, Hu1 aPan, De'an1 aLiu, Bo1 aVolinsky, Alex A.1 aChang, Cheinchi0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 05, v. 5, no. 62 p.50105-50112dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra06598d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024004200133040001800175100006100193245008300254300001800337506007600355506003100431520135900462592002801821596008301849506003701932650001601969650001101985650001601996650002502012650001802037650002202055650002602077650001002103650002202113650002602135650002002161650002202181650001302203650001302216650001802229650001202247650001202259653001802271653002202289653002102311653001002332700002302342700001802365773013202383856008602515852000902601655001202610IND60646407320221207105214.0190610e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064640732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b002402doi7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b002402chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCoy, Annette M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4088-690210aEffect of Preparation Method on the Protein Profile of Equine Amnion Dressings  ap. 2676-2685.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe protein content of amnion is thought to be the primary contributor to its efficacy as a biological dressing for wounds. Protein elution into antibiotic processing media has been reported, but the effect of antiseptic-based processing methods is unknown. Amniotic membranes were collected from eight healthy mares. Samples were collected after removal of gross debris. Tissues were subsequently divided and processed with either 0.05% chlorhexidine or 2% iodine/0.25% acetic acid. After protein extraction and trypsin digestion, the proteins were labeled with 8-plex iTRAQ tags, combined, and analyzed by high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The MaxQuant-Perseus software suite was used to identify and quantify sample proteins, with functional annotation performed in PANTHER. There were 220 unique proteins identified, of which 144 were found in all individuals and across all conditions, several with a known role in wound healing. Contrary to expectations, processing did not significantly alter the protein content of the amnion tissue. Limitations include the small sample size and single time point. These results suggest that either processing method is acceptable for use in the preparation of equine amnion dressings. The role of expressed proteins in the biological activity of amnion dressings remains to be elucidated.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetic acid 3aamnion 3aantibiotics 3abioactive properties 3achlorhexidine 3acomputer software 3aliquid chromatography 3amares 3amass spectrometry 3aprocessing technology 3aprotein content 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteome 3atissue repair 3atissues 3atrypsin 0aisobaric tags 0atissue proteomics 0awound management 0ahorse1 aArrington, Justine1 aYau, Peter M.0 tJournal of proteome research.g2019 May 22, v. 18, no. 6 p.2676-2685dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b002403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005100150245011000201520128300311592002801594650002901622650001201651650003001663650002001693650001101713650001501724650001301739650001501752650001301767650004401780650002401824650001601848653002101864653003101885653002101916653003701937700001301974700001701987700001702004700001602021700001902037700001402056773011302070856008502183852000902268655001202277IND60696287720221119123703.0200804e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069628772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1182832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Ji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8774-681110aSynthesis and characterization of main-chain type polyimidazolium-based alkaline anion exchange membranes  aWe report the synthesis of main-chain type cationic polyimidazoliums with various C2,4,5-substituents (including hydrogen, methyl, and phenyl groups) using progressive poly-Radziszewski reaction. The effect of C2,4,5-substituent on the chemical stability of polyimidazoliums was studied by characterizing small-molecule imidazolium cation under alkaline condition. The alkaline stability of imidazolium derivatives including 1,3-dihexyl-imidazolium ([DHIm]⁺), 1,3-dihexyl-2-methyl-imidazolium ([DHMIm]⁺), 1,3-dihexyl-2,4,5-trimethyl-imidazolium ([DHTMIm]⁺), 1,3-dihexyl-4,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl-imidazolium ([DHPDMIm]⁺), and 1,3-dihexyl-2,4,5-triphenyl-imidazolium ([DHTPIm]⁺) was investigated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) and validated by density functional theory calculations (GGA-BLYP parameters). [DHDMPIm]⁺ cation with the highest reaction barrier energy value exhibited the highest chemical stability in CD₃OD/D₂O KOH solution at elevated temperatures. The synthesized anion-exchange membranes (AEMs) based on poly(1-dodecyl-2-phenyl-4,5-dimethyl-imidazolium) exhibited promising alkaline stability in strong base solution at 80 °C. These results potentially boost the practical application of main-chain type AEMs in alkaline fuel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion-exchange membranes 3acations 3adensity functional theory 3adeuterium oxide 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen 3aimidazoles 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apotassium hydroxide 3atemperature 0aPolyimidazoliums 0aPoly-Radziszewski reaction 0aDFT calculations 0aAlkaline anion exchange membrane1 aSun, Zhe1 aZhu, Hairong1 aCao, Huixing1 aWang, Bowen1 aZhao, Junliang1 aYan, Feng0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 610 p.118283-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1182833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245017500169500002200344520159900366592002801965650000801993650001302001650001902014650001202033650001702045650002202062650003202084650001302116650002502129651001002154653002202164653002402186653001602210653002102226653002302247700002302270700001802293700001302311700002002324700001802344700002102362700002102383700002302404700002102427773007102448856008402519852000902603655001202612IND60567959320221120073518.0170628s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056795932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2017.04.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyake, Yuichi10aDetermination of hexavalent chromium concentration in industrial waste incinerator stack gas by using a modified ion chromatography with post-column derivatization method  aPre-press version  aAn ion chromatography with post-column derivatization with 1,5-diphenylcarbazide (IC-DPC) analytical method was modified to enable measurement of trace-level hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) in air. One of the difficulties in determining trace levels of Cr(VI) in air with conventional IC-DPC methods is co-elution of the solvent and ion peaks due to high concentrations of ionic compounds in the extract. However, by using gradient elution rather than isocratic elution we were able to fully resolve the Cr(VI) ion peak from the solvent peak without the need for diluting the extract, which would have reduced the minimum quantifiable level of the method. With this method, we were able to detect Cr(VI) in air at concentrations of 5.3ng/m3 (assuming a sampling volume of 1m3 and a final solution volume of 10mL). Recovery tests at three different concentrations of Cr(VI) (50, 250, 1000ng) were performed with or without fly ash; recovery rates at all the concentrations of Cr(VI), with or without fly ash, ranged from 68% to 110% (mean±relative standard deviation, 96%±11%), and there were no differences in recovery rates with respect to the presence or absence of fly ash. Finally, we used the developed method to determine the concentration of Cr(VI) in stack gases collected from eight industrial waste incinerators located in Japan. The concentration of Cr(VI) in the stack gases ranged from below the method quantification limit to 3100ng/m3. The highest concentrations of Cr(VI) detected in the stack gases were two to three orders of magnitude higher than that in ambient air in Japan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3achromium 3aderivatization 3afly ash 3aincinerators 3aindustrial wastes 3aion exchange chromatography 3asolvents 3astatistical analysis 3aJapan 0aAnalytical method 0aHexavalent chromium 0aIncinerator 0aIndustrial waste 0aIon chromatography1 aTokumura, Masahiro1 aIwazaki, Yuta1 aWang, Qi1 aAmagai, Takashi1 aHorii, Yuichi1 aOtsuka, Hideyuki1 aTanikawa, Noboru1 aKobayashi, Takeshi1 aOguchi, Masahiro0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2017.04.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03495naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014300169300001600312520175900328592002802087650000902115650002502124650001202149650001602161650002802177650001402205650002402219650001402243650001802257650003402275650001602309650002202325650001802347650002402365650001302389650000802402650002402410650001002434651000902444653003902453653001602492653002302508653001602531700002202547700002102569700002102590700002102611700002002632700002402652700002302676700001902699773009602718856008202814852000902896655001202905IND60611181320221116161447.0181218e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061118132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2018.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbshirini, Maryam10aDietary total antioxidant capacity is inversely related to menopausal symptoms: a cross-sectional study among Iranian postmenopausal women  ap. 161-167.  aThe aim of this study was to assess the association between dietary total antioxidant capacity (DTAC) and menopausal symptoms (MS) in postmenopausal middle-aged women.A cross-sectional study was conducted with 400 postmenopausal women who referred to municipality health houses and health centers in south Tehran, Iran. Sociodemographic data and anthropometric measures such as body weight, height, and waist circumference were determined. Dietary intake was assessed using a 147-item validated food frequency questionnaire. Energy-adjusted DTAC was calculated using the US Department of Agriculture database. Individual MS was measured by the Menopause Rating Scale questionnaire.Multivariable linear regression analyses indicated that DTAC was negatively associated with total Menopause Rating Scale score, somatic and psychological score, which was independent of confounding variables such as age, education, waist circumference, total physical activity, dietary intake of fiber, tea and coffee intake, total energy intake, and dietary supplement use (P < 0.001). Additionally, in logistic regression, a negative association between MS and DTAC was observed, which was independent of confounding variables (Ptrend = 0.002). Logistic regression for each symptom indicated that higher DTAC was associated with reduction in hot flashes and sweating, sleep problems, anxiety, exhaustion, and difficulty concentrating. However, a significant positive association was observed between DTAC and sexual problems.DTAC is inversely associated with MS, which could be of particular significance for somatic and psychological symptoms. These findings indicate that DTAC could be an important basis for developing an effective dietary measure for reducing MS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3aantioxidant activity 3aanxiety 3abody weight 3across-sectional studies 3adatabases 3adietary supplements 3aeducation 3aenergy intake 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3aphysical activity 3apostmenopause 3aregression analysis 3asweating 3atea 3awaist circumference 3awomen 3aIran 0aDietary total antioxidant capacity 0aAntioxidant 0aMenopause symptoms 0aHot flashes1 aSiassi, Fereydoun1 aKoohdani, Fariba1 aQorbani, Mostafa1 aKhosravi, Shahla1 aHedayati, Mehdi1 aAṣlānī, Zahrā,1 aSoleymani, Mahshid1 aSotoudeh, Gity0 tNutrition.g2018 Nov., v. 55-56 p.161-167dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2018.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02030naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014000172300001800312520069800330592002801028650002901056650002201085650001401107650002501121650001301146650002001159650001501179650001301194653002401207653001801231653002401249653001001273653002001283653002001303700002201323700002401345773015601369856008601525852000901611655001201620IND60539292020221117224636.0190215e20141103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053929202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2014.09.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMochida, Keisuke10aHrr25 phosphorylates the autophagic receptor Atg34 to promote vacuolar transport of α-mannosidase under nitrogen starvation conditions  ap. 3862-3869.  aIn Saccharomyces cerevisiae, under nitrogen-starvation conditions, the α-mannosidase Ams1 is recognized by the autophagic receptor Atg34 and transported into the vacuole, where it functions as an active enzyme. In this study, we identified Hrr25 as the kinase that phosphorylates Atg34 under these conditions. Hrr25-mediated phosphorylation does not affect the interaction of Atg34 with Ams1, but instead promotes Atg34 binding to the adaptor protein Atg11, which recruits the autophagy machinery to the Ams1–Atg34 complex, resulting in activation of the vacuolar transport of Ams1. Our findings reveal the regulatory mechanism of a biosynthetic pathway mediated by the autophagy machinery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalpha-mannosidase 3aautophagy 3abiochemical pathways 3anitrogen 3aphosphorylation 3astarvation 3avacuoles 0aSelective autophagy 0aAutophagosome 0aNitrogen starvation 0aYeast 0aCasein kinase 1 0aVacuolar enzyme1 aOhsumi, Yoshinori1 aNakatogawa, Hitoshi0 tFEBS letters.g2014 Nov. 03, v. 588, no. 21 p.3862-3869dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2014.09.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245010900205300001800314520077000332592002801102650002201130650002401152650002301176650002401199650002301223650001101246650001301257700005801270700002101328700006001349700002001409773013601429856008001565852000901645655001201654IND60606134720221117060454.0180724e20180419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060613472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b015432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerfolja, Katja1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8228-323210aChemical Instability of an Interface between Silver and Bi2Se3 Topological Insulator at Room Temperature  ap. 9980-9984.  aUnderstanding an interaction at an interface between a topological insulator and a metal is of critical importance when designing electronic and spintronic devices or when such systems are used in catalysis. In this paper, we report on a chemical instability of the interface between Bi₂Se₃ and Ag studied by X-ray powder diffraction and electron microscopy. We present strong experimental evidence of a redox solid-state reaction occurring at the interface with kinetics that is significant already at room temperature. The reaction yields Ag₂Se, AgBiSe₂, and Bi. The unexpected room-temperature chemical instability of the interface should be considered for all future theoretical and applicative studies involving the interface between Bi₂Se₃ and Ag.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3acatalytic activity 3aelectron microscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3asilver 3atopology1 aValant, Matjaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4842-56761 aMikulska, Iuliia1 aGardonio, Sandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5560-718X1 aFanetti, Mattia0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Apr. 19, v. 122, no. 18 p.9980-9984dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b015433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245009800170300001600268520168200284592002801966650001901994650001202013650001602025650001102041650001402052650001502066650000902081650001602090650001602106650002202122651001002144651001802154653001502172653002402187653002602211653001602237653002702253700001402280773012302294856008802417852000902505655001202514IND60628374820221120235121.0190325e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062837482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shuai10aImproving rice development and phenology prediction across contrasting climate zones of China  ap. 224-233.  aModelling rice development rate and phenology is crucial for robust yield prediction. However significant uncertainties originating from the temperature response functions in rice models exist. In this study, both the Wang-Engel temperature response function and the Johnson temperature response function were coupled in the MCWLA-Rice model and evaluated at 10 agro-meteorological experiment stations located in contrasting climate zones across China. Results show that the MCWLA-Rice model with the Wang-Engel temperature response function is able to improve the predictions of heading and maturity date for double season rice at the stations in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Mean improvements were 23.5% and 25.1%, respectively. The MCWLA-Rice model with the Johnson temperature response function is able to improve the predictions of heading date by 26.2% and maturity date by 22.9% on average at all stations. At the locations characterised by high temperature stress conditions, both the Wang-Engel and the Johnson temperature response functions are able to improve predictions of heading and maturity date, nevertheless the improvement is not as pronounced as for those locations not suffered from high temperature stress. These results demonstrate how rice phenology simulation can be improved, yet suggest that further improvements should be made to reproduce phenology in locations suffering from heat stress. This study highlights the value of environment-controlled experiments on the effects of exceeding threshold temperatures from several hours to several days on instantaneous crop development rate and improving crop phenology simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic zones 3aheading 3aheat stress 3amodels 3aphenology 3aprediction 3arice 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3ayield forecasting 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aRice model 0aExtreme temperature 0aRice development rate 0aUncertainty 0aCrop model improvement1 aTao, Fulu0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 268 p.224-233dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03602naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016100168500002200329506011700351506007600468520204500544592002802589506003702617650002002654650002002674650001202694650001802706650001602724650001102740650001502751650001102766651001002777653001602787653001802803653001402821653001702835653001302852700001702865700001802882700001702900700001402917773010702931856008503038852000903123655001203132IND60780636220221207085413.0220628e20220609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078063622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geogeo.2022.1000962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Dongdong10aPetrogenesis of Middle Triassic intermediate-mafic igneous rocks in East Kunlun, Northern Tibet: Implications for the crust growth and Paleo-Tethyan orogeny  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTriassic intermediate-mafic igneous rocks are sporadically exposed in the East Kunlun Orogen Belt (EKOB), and their petrogenesis and geological implications for the Paleo-Tethyan orogeny are not well constrained. Geochronologic and geochemical data for the gabbro, gabbroic diorite and quartz diorite in Qingshuihe pluton are presented here to constrain their ages, petrogenesis and geodynamic settings. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating indicates that the gabbro, gabbroic diorite and quartz diorite were formed at 239.8 ± 2.1 Ma, 238.4 ± 1.1 Ma and 235.7 ± 1.1 Ma, respectively. The studied samples span a wide range in geochemical compositions with SiO₂ content of 47.55–63.93 wt%, exhibiting low-K tholeiitic to high-K calc-alkaline affinities. All samples have trace element compositions resembling typical arc magmas, however, from gabbro, gabbroic diorite to quartz diorite, the fractionation degree of rare earth elements gradually increases ((La/Yb) N = 2.08–2.52, 2.20–9.23 and 7.15–17.95, respectively), and the enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (e.g., Rb, Ba, Th and K) and the depletion in high field strength elements (e.g., Nb, Ta, and Ti) are also more obvious. These geochemical features, combined with their enriched Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes ((⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr)ᵢ = 0.709694–0.71445, εNd(t) = -7.9 – -4.7, εHf(t) = -3.65–3.79, respectively), unanimously indicate their parental magma was derived by partial melting of an enriched lithospheric mantle, followed by cumulation of tabular plagioclase and prismatic amphibole generating the appinitic gabbro, and subsequent certain degree of magma mixing and fractional crystallization forming the evolved gabbroic diorite and quartz diorite. This study therefore not only demonstrates that mantle-derived arc magma underplating followed by crust-mantle mixing and fractional crystallization is an important mechanism of continental crust growth, but also confirms that the East Kunlun Paleo-Tethyan oceanic subduction lasted at least until 235 Ma.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTriassic period 3acrystallization 3adiorite 3afractionation 3aplagioclase 3aquartz 3asubduction 3azircon 3aChina 0aEast Kunlun 0aPaleo-Tethyan 0aMagmatism 0aPetrogenesis 0aTectonic1 aXiong, Fuhao1 aMa, Changqian1 aHou, Mingcai1 aZhao, Han0 tGeosystems and geoenvironment.g2022 June 09,  p.100096-dElsevier LtdwJournal:28585x2772-88387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geogeo.2022.1000963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010700168300001600275520127500291592002801566650001601594650001401610650001301624650001301637650001701650650001701667650000901684651001101693700003201704700002501736700003101761700007301792700003901865773012101904856008302025852000902108655001202117IND60762081820221118192018.0220107e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076208182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-021-00770-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrari, Samuel10aMix of trinexapac-ethyl and nitrogen application to reduce upland rice plant height and increase yield  ap. 209-219.  aTechniques to increase grain production such as nitrogen fertilization and plant growth regulators are essential to enable and enhance rice yield. Therefore, our goal was to evaluate the effect of nitrogen fertilization and application of trinexapac-ethyl on vegetative and reproductive traits of upland rice. Experiments were established in Registro, Brasil during the 2011 and 2014 growing seasons and treatments tested consisted of N rates (0; 50; 100; 150; and 200 kg N ha⁻¹) and timings of TE application: V₄, V₇, R₁ and control (without TE). Upland rice grain yield at N rates greater than 117 kg ha⁻¹ applied as topdress combined with TE application at V₇ will start to decrease grain yield. In addition, application of TE at V₇ combined with N rates equal to or close to 117 kg ha⁻¹ will lead to higher yields and shorter plants. The combination of N application at topdress combined with TE application at V₄ led to a linear increase in the number of grains per panicle of rice plants. Nitrogen topdressing was found to increase plant height in the absence to TE or when TE is sprayed at V₄ or R₁. In addition, nitrogen topdressing had a positive increase in the number of tillers, stems, panicles, and SPAD index in rice plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrain yield 3ahighlands 3anitrogen 3apanicles 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3arice 3aBrazil1 ado Valle Polycarpo, Gustavo1 aVargas, Pablo Forlan1 aFernandes, Adalton Mazetti1 aLuís Oliveira Cunha, Matheus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8931-85571 aPagliari, P.

Literature data show that raccoon dogs act as a reservoir of many dangerous parasites, including nematodes of the genus Trichinella. The aims of the study were to determine the prevalence of Trichinella spp. infection in raccoon dogs collected from the Głęboki Bród Forest District between 2013 and 2016, and to evaluate their distribution in the muscle tissue of the host. The larvae of Trichinella spp. were detected in 45 raccoon dogs (39.82%), and all of them were identified as T. britovi. No mixed infection was observed. The intensity of infection ranged from 0.02 to 622.92 larvae per gram (LPG), and the highest mean was observed in the tongue and lower forelimb in both examined sexes. The raccoon dog may play a significant role as a reservoir of T. britovi in the wildlife in the examined area.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNyctereutes procyonoides 3aTrichinella britovi 3adog diseases 3aforests 3ainvasive species 3alarvae 3aliquid petroleum gas 3amixed infection 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3aparasites 3atongue 3awildlife 3aPoland 0aTrichinella britovi 0aRaccoon dog 0aNyctereutes procyonoides 0aWildlife 0aPredilection sites1 aKornacka, Aleksandra1 aMoskwa, Bożena0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2019 Aug., v. 9 p.149-153dElsevier LtdwJournal:21679x2213-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijppaw.2019.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245011600152300002000268520196700288592002802255650003002283650001302313650002502326650002002351650001302371650001802384650001502402650001302417650001302430650002302443700002202466773010102488856007502589852000902664655001202673IND60577139920221119045559.0170806e20141118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057713992DNAL7 a10.1021/la503011u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ji10aSuspended Micro/Nanofiber Hierarchical Biological Scaffolds Fabricated Using Non-Electrospinning STEP Technique  ap. 13641-13649.  aExtracellular matrix (ECM) is a fibrous natural cell environment, possessing complicated micro- and nanoarchitectures, which provide extracellular signaling cues and influence cell behaviors. Mimicking this three-dimensional microenvironment in vitro is a challenge in developmental and disease biology. Here, suspended multilayer hierarchical nanofiber assemblies (diameter from micrometers to less than 100 nm) with accurately controlled fiber orientation and spacing are demonstrated as biological scaffolds fabricated using the non-electrospinning STEP (Spinneret based Tunable Engineered Parameter) fiber manufacturing technique. Micro/nanofiber arrays were manufactured with high parallelism (relative angles between fibers were maintained less than 6°) and well controlled interfiber spacing (<15%). Using these controls, we demonstrate a bottom up hierarchical assembly of suspended six layer structures of progressively reduced diameters and spacing from several polymer systems. We then demonstrate use of STEP scaffolds to study single and multicell arrangement at high magnifications. Specifically, using double layer divergent (0°–90°) suspended nanofibers assemblies, we show precise quantitative control of cell geometry (change in shape index from 0.15 to 0.57 at similar cell areas), and through design of scaffold porosity (80 × 80 μm² to 5 × 5 μm²) quadruple the cell attachment density. Furthermore, using unidirectional or crisscross patterns of sparse and dense fiber arrays, we are able to control the cell spread area from ∼400 to ∼700 μm², while the nucleus shape index increases from 0.75 to 0.99 with cells nearly doubling their focal adhesion cluster lengths (∼15 μm) on widely spaced nanofiber arrays. The platform developed in this study allows a wide parametric investigation of biophysical cues which influence cell behaviors with implications in tissue engineering, developmental biology, and disease biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellular microenvironment 3adiameter 3aextracellular matrix 3afocal adhesions 3ageometry 3amanufacturing 3ananofibers 3apolymers 3aporosity 3atissue engineering1 aNain, Amrinder S.0 tLangmuir.g2014 Nov. 18, v. 30, no. 45 p.13641-13649dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla503011u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245010000176520176900276592002802045650003002073650002302103650001502126650002302141650001802164650002502182650002202207653002702229653001302256653002702269653002102296700002302317700002602340773009502366856008902461852000902550655001202559IND60675541420221122063246.0191231e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067554142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.1043022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanson, Helena I.10aWorking on the boundaries—How do science use and interpret the nature-based solution concept?  aNature-based solutions (NBS) is the latest contribution to the green concept family. NBS is defined as actions based in nature addressing societal challenges. In this study, we lean on the concept boundary object, broken down into three analytical categories: use, core ideas and granularities, to explore the cohesive and fragmenting powers of the NBS concept, and discuss its future role in green space governance.The study is based on a structured, qualitative review of 112 scientific peer-reviewed publications that use the term NBS. Most publications are from 2017 or later, highlighting the novelty of the NBS concept. The concept has a strong footing in the European urban context. Flood mitigation and functional ecosystems and biodiversity conservation are the most targeted sustainability goals in the publications, and a diversity of solutions are considered. There is a close link between the NBS concept, green infrastructure, and the ecosystem service concept, indicating a path dependency in its uptake and use. The publications demonstrate a low level of integration of the NBS concept (i.e. it is commonly used as a buzz word). Most empirical studies focus solely on environmental benefits delivered by NBS, and few studies assess social, economic, and environmental benefits together, which is a central ambition of the concept.We conclude that the NBS concept is working on the boundaries between different scientific disciplines and between science and policy. Depending on how the research community deals with identified temporal, epistemological and ontological granularities, we conclude that the concept has three potential developmental pathways; broader and deeper, biased with stickiness to older green concepts and an empty buzz word.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity conservation 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aempirical research 3aflood control 3agreen infrastructure 3aissues and policy 0aNature-based solutions 0aLand-use 0aGreen space governance 0aBoundary objects1 aWickenberg, Björn1 aAlkan Olsson, Johanna0 tLand use policy.g2020 Jan., v. 90 p.104302-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.1043023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03886naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245011900173520200300292592002802295650002102323650001802344650002102362650002502383650002002408650001602428650001902444650002402463650002702487650001702514650001802531650000802549650001902557650001602576650001902592650001502611650001602626650001502642650001402657650001102671650001102682650001702693650001802710650001502728651001002743653002302753653001602776653002202792653001502814653002602829653002702855700001602882700003202898700002002930700002602950700002302976700002102999773011903020856008803139852000903227655001203236IND60782082020221120103522.0220830e20221020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078208202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1571312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaglio, Mattias10aSpecies-specific efficiency in PM2.5 removal by urban trees: From leaf measurements to improved modeling estimates  aThe growing population in cities is causing a deterioration of air quality due to the emission of pollutants, causing serious health impacts. Trees and urban forests can contribute through the interception and removal of air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM). The dry deposition of PM by vegetation depends on air pollutant concentration, meteorological conditions, and specific leaf traits. Several studies explored the ability of different plant species to accumulate PM on leaf structures leading to the development of models to quantify the PM removal. The i-Tree Eco is the most used model to evaluate ecosystem services provided by urban trees. However, fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) removal is still calculated with a poorly evaluated function of deposition velocity (which depends on wind speed and leaf area) without differentiating between tree species. Therefore, we present an improvement of the standard model calculation introducing a leaf trait index to distinguish the species effect on PM net removal. We also compared model results with measurements of deposited leaf PM by vacuum filtration. The index includes the effect of morphological and functional leaf characteristics of tree species using four parameters: leaf water storage, deposition velocity, resuspension rate and leaf washing capacity. Leaves of 11 common urban tree species were sampled in representative areas of the city of Ferrara (Italy) and at different times of the year from 2018 to 2021. This includes four deciduous broadleaf trees (Tilia cordata, Platanus acerifolia, Acer platanoides, Celtis australis), three evergreen broadleaf trees (Quercus ilex, Magnolia grandiflora, Nerium oleander), and four conifers (Thuja orientalis, Cedrus libani, Pinus pinaster, Picea abies). The results provide significant advancement in assessing PM removal using decision support tools such as models to properly select tree species for future urban tree planting programs aimed at improving air quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer platanoides 3aCedrus libani 3aCeltis australis 3aMagnolia grandiflora 3aNerium oleander 3aPicea abies 3aPinus pinaster 3aPlatanus acerifolia 3aPlatycladus orientalis 3aQuercus ilex 3aTilia cordata 3aair 3aair pollutants 3aair quality 3adry deposition 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3afiltration 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amodels 3aparticulates 3awater storage 3awind speed 3aItaly 0aParticulate matter 0aLeaf traits 0aVacuum-filtration 0ai-Tree Eco 0aModel parametrization 0aNature-based solutions1 aPace, Rocco1 aMuresan, Alexandra Nicoleta1 aGrote, Rüdiger1 aCastaldelli, Giuseppe1 aCalfapietra, Carlo1 aFano, Elisa Anna0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Oct. 20, v. 844 p.157131-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1571313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03518naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012900162300001800291520139200309592002801701596007301729596007001802596008001872596007501952596005902027596006502086596006502151596012402216596011902340596005302459650002702512650001602539650002002555650002402575650002402599650001502623650001802638700001302656700001402669700002202683700001702705700001302722700005702735700001202792773011602804856008302920852000903003655001203012IND60776602420221119063400.0220726e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077660242DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-021-02220-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ran10aEquipment-Free Quantitative Detection of Salmonella typhimurium with a Liposome and Enzyme Reaction-Based Lateral Flow Assay  ap. 1482-1489.  aDeveloping sensitive assay for pathogen detection is a sustained demand for food scientists, industries, and government. In this study, an ultrasensitive colorimetric lateral flow assay (LFA) was successfully developed for the detection of Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium). Based on cascade enzyme reaction induced by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-encapsulated starch-based liposome, the sensitivity of the conventional LFA can be dramatically improved. With this assay, the concentration of Salmonella typhimurium existed in the sample can be efficiently quantified in the range of 10²–10⁶ cfu·mL⁻¹. The detection limit (LOD) of the novel assay can be as low as 50 cfu·mL⁻¹ (S/N = 3), appropriate four orders of magnitude lower than the conventional LFA. In addition, the selectivity experiment results indicate this assay has a high selectivity over other commonly encountered pathogens. The practicability of the novel assay was investigated by detecting the concentration of Salmonella typhimurium in spiked real food samples. The average recoveries range from 92.3 to 107.6%, revealing satisfactory application potential of the proposed assay. With the merits of high sensitivity, rapid detection, and no requirement of any additional instruments, we believe that the proposed assay has a promising prospect in the detection of pathogenic bacteria in food.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019YFD1002704cNational Key Research & Development Program in China  a2019JZZY010722cShandong major projects of independent innovation  a2019BHLC002cBohai Sea Granary Science and Technology Demonstration Project  aQLUTGJHZ2018016cSpecial Project of International Cooperative Research  a31901645cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aZR2019BC088cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province  aZR2021QC011cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province  aGrant No. 2020KJC-ZD06cInnovation Pilot Project of Integration of Science, Education and Industry of Shandong Province  aNo. 2020KJC-ZD011cInnovation Pilot Project of Integration of Science, Education and Industry of Shandong Province  a2018GXRC004cJinan Science and Technology Bureau 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3aenzymatic reactions 3amicrobial detection 3aperoxidase 3arapid methods1 aDu, Zhen1 aHe, Deyun1 aZhang, Mingshuang1 aJin, Zhengyu1 aXu, Enbo1 aWu, Zhengzong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4345-18241 aCui, Bo0 tFood analytical methods.g2022 June, v. 15, no. 6 p.1482-1489dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-021-02220-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05009naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245011600209520258900325592002802914650001302942650001302955650002002968650001902988650001903007650001903026650002803045650000903073650001403082650001103096650001403107650001403121650002203135650002403157650003403181650003403215650002703249650001903276650002403295650001303319650001303332650003703345650001503382653004003397653001503437653002403452653002803476653000903504653001203513700006403525700006403589700002403653700006003677700002003737700002103757700001903778700006203797700002503859700006103884700005803945700002404003700005904027773011904086856008504205852000904290655001204299IND60747882220221120075022.0220205e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074788222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2021.1118602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWise, Lauren A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2138-375210aCorrelates of plasma concentrations of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances among reproductive-aged Black women  aPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic chemicals used in commercial and consumer goods. Black women are underrepresented in studies of PFAS exposure.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of correlates of plasma PFAS concentrations among 1499 Black women aged 23–35 participating in the Study of Environment, Lifestyle, and Fibroids (SELF), a Detroit-based cohort study. At baseline (2010–2012), participants provided questionnaire data on socio-demographics; behaviors; diet; and menstrual, contraceptive, and reproductive histories. Using mass spectrometry in non-fasting plasma samples collected at enrollment, we quantified several PFAS, including perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorodecanoate (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA), and 2-N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetate (MeFOSAA). We used linear regression to calculate percentage differences (%D) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between selected correlates and PFAS concentrations, adjusting for all other correlates.PFHxS, PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA were detected in ≥97 % of women; PFDA in 86 %; MeFOSAA in 70 %; and PFUnDA in 52 %. Age, income, education, and intakes of water, alcohol, and seafood were positively associated with several PFAS. Current smoking was positively associated with MeFOSAA. Body mass index was inversely associated with most PFAS, except PFHxS. Strong inverse associations (%D; 95 % CI) were observed between parity (≥3 vs. 0 births) and PFHxS (−34.7; −43.0, −25.1) and PFOA (−33.1; −39.2, −26.3); breastfeeding duration (≥6 months vs. nulliparous) and PFOA (−31.1; −37.8, −23.7), PFHxS (−24.2; −34.5, −12.3), and PFOS (−18.4; −28.3, −7.1); recent birth (<2 years ago vs. nulliparous) and PFOA (−33.1; −39.6, −25.8), PFHxS (−29.3; −39.0, −18.1), PFNA (−25.2; −32.7, −16.8), and PFOS (−18.3; −28.3, −6.9); and intensity of menstrual bleed (heavy vs. light) and PFHxS (−18.8; −28.3, −8.2), PFOS (−16.4; −24.9, −7.1), PFNA (−10.5; −17.8, −2.6), and PFOA (−10.0; −17.2, −2.1). Current use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) was positively associated with PFOS (20.2; 1.4, 42.5), PFOA (16.2; 1.5, 33.0), and PFNA (15.3; 0.4, 32.4).Reproductive factors that influence PFAS elimination showed strong associations with several PFAS (reduced concentrations with parity, recent birth, lactation, heavy menstrual bleeding; increased concentrations with DMPA use).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aalcohols 3abody mass index 3abreast feeding 3acohort studies 3acontraceptives 3across-sectional studies 3adiet 3aeducation 3aincome 3alactation 3alifestyle 3amass spectrometry 3amedroxyprogesterone 3aperfluorohexane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3aseafoods 3asociodemographic characteristics 3asulfonates 0aper- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 0aCorrelates 0aProspective studies 0aEnvironmental chemicals 0aRace 0aFemales1 aWesselink, Amelia K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3929-44511 aSchildroth, Samantha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7845-35661 aCalafat, Antonia M.1 aBethea, Traci N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3205-20781 aGeller, Ruth J.1 aColeman, Chad M.1 aFruh, Victoria1 aClaus Henn, Birgit1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7118-43271 aBotelho, Julianne C.1 aHarmon, Quaker E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5866-848X1 aThirkill, Maya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5367-98681 aWegienka, Ganesa R.1 aBaird, Donna D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5544-26530 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Jan., v. 203 p.111860-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1118603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245008700175300001800262520110600280592002801386650002501414650002501439650001301464650001501477650002001492650001901512650001501531653001801546653003301564653003301597653001501630653001101645700001401656700001601670773010001686856008401786852000901870655001201879IND60695436820221119210248.0200831e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069543682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWekesa, Jael Sanyanda10aMulti-feature fusion for deep learning to predict plant lncRNA-protein interaction  ap. 2928-2936.  aLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key roles in regulating cellular biological processes through diverse molecular mechanisms including binding to RNA binding proteins. The majority of plant lncRNAs are functionally uncharacterized, thus, accurate prediction of plant lncRNA–protein interaction is imperative for subsequent functional studies. We present an integrative model, namely DRPLPI. Its uniqueness is that it predicts by multi-feature fusion. Structural and four groups of sequence features are used, including tri-nucleotide composition, gapped k-mer, recursive complement and binary profile. We design a multi-head self-attention long short-term memory encoder-decoder network to extract generative high-level features. To obtain robust results, DRPLPI combines categorical boosting and extra trees into a single meta-learner. Experiments on Zea mays and Arabidopsis thaliana obtained 0.9820 and 0.9652 area under precision/recall curve (AUPRC) respectively. The proposed method shows significant enhancement in the prediction performance compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aZea mays 3acomplement 3aneural networks 3anon-coding RNA 3aprediction 0aDeep learning 0aSecondary structure features 0alncRNA–protein interaction 0aPrediction 0aPlants1 aMeng, Jun1 aLuan, Yushi0 tGenomics.g2020 Sept., v. 112, no. 5 p.2928-2936dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007000156300002000226520169900246592002801945650002401973650001801997650001202015650002302027650002202050650001402072650001102086650002902097650001402126650001502140650001302155650001602168650002402184700001702208773012402225856007402349852000902423655001202432IND60665051220221118074642.0190912e20140620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066505122DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra03445g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhavsar, K.10aCurrent research and future perspectives of phytase bioprocessing  ap. 26677-26691.  aPhosphorus is one of nature's paradoxes as it is life's bottleneck for subsistence on earth but at same time is detrimental in surplus quantities in an aquatic environment. Phosphorus cannot be manufactured, though fortunately it can be recovered and reused. The only way to avert a supply crisis is to implement the “3R's” of sustainability, “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.” Phytase is likely to play a critical role in the dephosphorylation of antinutritional and indigestible phytate, a phosphorus locking molecule, to digestible phosphorus, calcium and other mineral nutrients in the coming years. Hence, efforts are required to produce cost effective phytase with fast upstream and economic downstream processing because the current available process is expensive and time consuming. This review summarizes the present state of methods studied for phytase bioprocessing. Production, extraction and purification incur a large cost in product development. In addition, the process has several limitations such as dilute concentration of enzyme, extensive downstream procedures and treatment of generated effluents. However, these methods are currently employed due to lack of alternative methods. Thus, there is a clear need for an efficient, scalable and economical process for phytase production and bioseparation, and improvements are especially required with regard to yield, purity, and energy consumption. Perspectives for an improved bioprocess development for phytase are discussed based on our own experience and recent studies. It is argued that the optimization of production techniques, strain improvement and liquid–liquid extraction deserves more attention in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3abioprocessing 3acalcium 3acost effectiveness 3adephosphorylation 3aeffluents 3aenergy 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphytases 3aphytic acid 3aproduct development1 aKhire, J.

Especially, the optical properties of infrared (IR) camouflage materials should be satisfied with two requirements: deception of IR signature in a detected band through reduced emissive energy and dissipation of reduced emissive energy for preventing thermal instability through an undetected band. Most reported articles suggest the reduction of emissive energy in the detected band; however, broadband emission for enough energy dissipation through the undetected band simultaneously is still a challenging issue. Here, we demonstrate the multiresonance emitter for broadband emission with IR camouflage utilizing the electromagnetic properties of dielectric material. We reveal that the interaction between the magnetic resonance and dielectric layer’s property in a metal–dielectric–metal structure induces the multiple resonance at the specific band. We present an IR camouflage behavior of multiresonance emitter on a curved surface through the IR camera (8–14 μm). We evaluate the energy dissipation in the undetected band, which is 1613% higher than metal and 26% higher than conventional selective emitters. This study paves the way to develop broadband emitters for radiative cooling and thermophotovoltaic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3acooling 3aenergy 3amagnetism 3aoptical properties 0ametamaterials 0acamouflage 0amulti-resonance 0abroadband emitter 0aflexible selective emitter 0aenergy dissipation1 aYoon, Boram1 aKim, Taehwan1 aBae, Ji-Yeul1 aLim, Joon-Soo1 aChang, Injoong1 aCho, Hyung Hee1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5309-37980 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 24, v. 12, no. 7 p.8862-8869dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b210303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01461naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011800155300001800273520028500291592002800576650001100604650001800615650002300633650002300656650001300679650001300692650001400705700002900719700002600748700002600774700002400800700002600824700002200850773013200872856007401004852000901078655001201087IND60617506120221122044206.0181025e20180508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061750612DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc02048e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavi, Anil10aFinding a receptor design for selective recognition of perrhenate and pertechnetate: hydrogen vs. halogen bonding  ap. 4826-4829.  aReceptors bearing hydrogen and halogen bond donors for recognition of perrhenate and pertechnetate were designed and studied.

This study employs a financial analysis technique, the computation of net present values, to explore the ﬁnancial viability of farmers’ investments in an intercropping farming system known as taungya. The analysis employs scenarios that include different farming systems, such as A. decurrens (J.C. Wendl.) Willd. cum teff (Eragrostis tef) intercropping, A. decurrens monocropping, and teff monocropping, as well as changes in output (charcoal and teff) prices and the discount rate. In addition, the time of sale is evaluated in terms of the distribution of profits between buyers and sellers and between sharecroppers and landowners. The intercropping practice (A. decurrens cum teff in the first year) tended to be more profitable than the alternative systems. Financially constrained farmers who have to sell their stands early, however, forego gains. Profits from stand sales later in the 5-year evaluation period were more equally shared between sellers and buyers. Sharecropping profits for farmers ranked among the lowest of the computed profits. A sensitivity analysis revealed that an increase in the discount rate tends to have a more detrimental effect than price fluctuations on the proﬁtability of acacia-based taungya systems, although sharp price fluctuations could affect profitability and cause a farmer to shift back to an annual crop system. Despite their higher profitability, tree-based systems impose a risk of liquidity bottlenecks on farmers throughout the 5-year investment period, which implies that those who are endowed with land or who are more financially well-off can benefit from the required 5-year investment, but it may be more difficult for those who lack land or the necessary financial resources. Providing affordable financing for poorer and landless farmers could increase farmers’ use of the taungya system and allow a more equitable distribution of benefits among the rural population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia decurrens 3aEragrostis tef 3aannuals 3abasins 3acharcoal 3acontinuous cropping 3adiscount rate 3aeconomic sustainability 3afallow 3afarmers 3afunding 3aintercropping 3alandowners 3amanagement systems 3apoverty 3aprices 3aprofitability 3aprofits and margins 3arisk 3arural population 3asales 3asharecropping 3asustainable land management 3ataungya system 3awatersheds 3aEthiopia 0aDrought 0aSustainable livelihoods approach 0aUpper Blue Nile Basin 0aCost benefit analysis1 aTsunekawa, Atsushi1 aHaregeweyn, Nigussie1 aAdgo, Enyew1 aTsubo, M.q(Mitsuru),1 aAyalew, Zemen1 aAbele, S.q(Steffen),0 tLand use policy.g2020 Jan., v. 90 p.104331-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.1043313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245012000166300001800286520121200304592002801516650002001544650001501564650002001579650002501599650001101624650001401635653001201649653001601661653003201677653001501709653002601724700001801750700001401768700001501782700002001797700001801817700002001835773010001855856008401955852000902039655001202048IND60695436920221119210247.0200831e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069543692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Pei-An10aMitochondrial genomes of three Bostrichiformia species and phylogenetic analysis of Polyphaga (Insecta, Coleoptera)  ap. 2970-2977.  aHere we determined mitogenomes of three Bostrichiformia species. These data were combined with 51 previously sequenced Polyphaga mitogenomes to explore the higher-level relationships within Polyphaga by using four different mitogenomic datasets and three tree inference approaches. Among Polyphaga mitogenomes we observed heterogeneity in nucleotide composition and evolutionary rates, which may have affected phylogenetic inferences across the different mitogenomic datasets. Elateriformia, Cucujiformia, and Scarabaeiformia were each inferred to be monophyletic by all analyses, as was Bostrichiformia by most analyses based on two datasets with low heterogeneity. The large series Staphyliniformia was never recovered as monophyletic in our analyses. The Bayesian tree using a degenerated nucleotide dataset (P123_Degen) and a site-heterogeneous mixture model in PhyloBayes was supported as the best Polyphaga phylogeny: (Scirtiformia, (Elateriformia, ((Bostrichiformia, Cucujiformia), (Scarabaeiformia + Staphyliniformia)))). For Cucujiformia, the largest series, we inferred a superfamily-level phylogeny: ((Cleroidea, Coccinelloidea), (Tenebrionoidea, (Cucujoidea + Curculionoidea + Chrysomeloidea))).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aColeoptera 3adata collection 3amitochondrial genome 3amodels 3amonophyly 0aBeetles 0aMitogenomes 0aCompositional heterogeneity 0aPhyloBayes 0aPhylogenetic analysis1 aFeng, Run-Qiu1 aZhang, Li1 aWang, Juan1 aWang, Xiao-Tong1 aZhang, Li-Jun1 aYuan, Ming-Long0 tGenomics.g2020 Sept., v. 112, no. 5 p.2970-2977dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01386naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011200156300002000268520034000288592002800628650001400656650002300670650001200693650001300705650001800718650001300736650001600749700001600765700001800781700001700799700001300816773012400829856007400953852000901027655001201036IND60665051320221118074640.0190912e20140703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066505132DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra03446e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jiale10aSurfactant-free platinum nanocubes with greatly enhanced activity towards methanol/ethanol electrooxidation  ap. 28832-28835.  aThis communication demonstrates a facile approach to synthesize a platinum (Pt) nanocube catalyst (∼3.5 nm) in the absence of surfactants, which exhibits excellent activity towards alcohol electrooxidation.

The species occurrence encompasses inland ecosystems such as the neotropical savanna (cerrado sensu stricto; Cerrado domain) through coastal ecosystems such as mangroves and the restinga (Atlantic Forest domain), all of which are characterized by environmental factors that highly contrast with one another. We analyzed the leaf anatomy of S. terebinthifolius populations from those three ecosystems aiming to verify whether any particular trait would provide the species with foliar anatomical plasticity, thereby enabling it to adapt to such environmentally disparate areas. We found that thickness of the leaf blade, adaxial palisade parenchyma, and spongy parenchyma differed significantly among the three ecosystems. The population from the restinga, an open, coastal ecosystem subjected to high light incidence, showed the highest means for these variables, followed by the populations from mangrove and cerrado. Leaf blade thickness in the restinga population was higher due mainly to increased palisade parenchyma thickness. The adaxial palisade parenchyma thickness in mangrove individuals was more than double the one in the cerrado population. The abaxial palisade parenchyma thickness showed no difference between the mangrove and restinga populations, yet in those two it was higher than in the cerrado population. Schinus terebinthifolius was revealed to have high potential of acclimating to different ecosystems, owing to a high capacity of developing anatomical responses to distinct stress conditions imposed by the surrounding environment, which confirms the species high phenotypic plasticity. Such high capacity of acclimating to contrasting environmental conditions by means of modulating the thickness of different leaf tissues could provide the species with an adaptive advantage in a climate-change scenario.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3aSchinus terebinthifolia 3acerrado 3aclimate change 3acoastal ecosystems 3aforests 3aland restoration 3aleaf anatomy 3aleaf blade 3aleaf thickness 3aparenchyma (plant tissue) 3aphenotypic plasticity 3asavannas 3aBrazil 0aabiotic stress 0aecological plant anatomy 0afoliar micromorphometry 0aleaf tissue thickness1 aAndrade, Guilherme Carvalho1 ade Araújo, Hugo Humberto1 aDias-Pereira, Jaqueline0 tJournal of the Torrey Botanical Society.g2022 Apr. 4, v. 149, no. 3 p.187-193dTorrey Botanical SocietywJournal:jnl55516x1940-06167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3159/TORREY-D-22-00001.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03963naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245006500169300001400234520270500248592002802953650001202981650001602993650001103009650001403020650001303034650001803047650002303065650001403088650002203102650001503124650002303139650001903162650002003181653002603201653003303227653002503260653002703285700001603312773010503328856008703433852000903520655001203529IND60535366720221119222440.0190402e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053536672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2014.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDallali, M.10aLarge eddy simulation of two-way coupling sediment transport  ap. 33-44.  aIn the present paper numerical simulations are used to investigate suspended sediment transport and its effect on the dynamics of the turbulent boundary layer. We use an Euler–Euler methodology based on single-phase approach. Large eddy simulation is employed to resolve the large scales of motion, whereas the contribution of the small scales is parametrized by the use of a dynamic Smagorinsky model. In order to account for sediment-induced buoyancy on momentum, a buoyancy term is considered in the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations through the use of the Boussinesq approximation. We consider four sediment sizes and the simulations are performed for both one-way and two-way coupling approaches to gain a better description of sediment–turbulence interaction. The level of stratification for each particle size is qualified by the bulk Richardson number which increases by decreasing the grain size. The analysis reveals that the reduction of sediment size produces a larger suspension and sediment concentration in the flow field, due to the concurrence of increased available concentration at the wall and reduced deposition velocity. Comparison of concentration profiles between one-way and two-way coupling clearly shows the remarkable effect of stratification on the velocity and concentration mean profiles. This is particularly true for small sediments which are more likely suspended in the fluid column. In agreement with experimental literature results, our study shows that suspended sediment concentration reduces the von Kàrmàn constant of the velocity profile. The analysis of second order statistics and energy power spectra show turbulent suppression due to stratification effects, in agreement with previous studies. The gradient Richardson number distribution along the channel height demonstrates the increased level of stratification along the fluid column by decreasing the grain size. Momentum and concentration diffusivity are also discussed. The non-dimensional concentration diffusivity compares very well with the Coleman’s experimental data in the range of parameters shared by the two studies. Overall, the results of our study confirm that a single-phase mathematical model is a good candidate to simulate suspended sediment transport. Our study also shows that differences between one-way and two-way coupling approaches are negligible for relatively large sediments, that, on the other hand, are more likely transported according to the bed-load mode. For smaller particles, transported according to the suspension-load mode, the two-way coupling approach reproduces the reduction of turbulence activity already observed in physical experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedload 3adiffusivity 3aenergy 3aequations 3amomentum 3aparticle size 3asediment transport 3asediments 3asimulation models 3astatistics 3asuspended sediment 3aturbulent flow 3awater resources 0aLarge eddy simulation 0aSuspended sediment transport 0aTurbulence structure 0aStratification effects1 aArmenio, V.0 tAdvances in water resources.g2015 July, v. 81 p.33-44dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2014.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03967naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245008100161300001800242520260900260592002802869650000802897650001202905650001902917650001502936650001102951650002202962650002602984650001703010650002203027650001303049650001503062650004203077650002703119650001603146650001803162650001903180650001403199653000803213653000903221653000803230653001403238653000803252700002003260773010003280856008403380852000903464655001203473IND60695437020221119210615.0200831e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069543702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Bo10aMinimum error calibration and normalization for genomic copy number analysis  ap. 3331-3341.  aCopy number variations (CNV) are regional deviations from the normal autosomal bi-allelic DNA content. While germline CNVs are a major contributor to genomic syndromes and inherited diseases, the majority of cancers accumulate extensive “somatic” CNV (sCNV or CNA) during the process of oncogenetic transformation and progression. While specific sCNV have closely been associated with tumorigenesis, intriguingly many neoplasias exhibit recurrent sCNV patterns beyond the involvement of a few cancer driver genes. Currently, CNV profiles of tumor samples are generated using genomic micro-arrays or high-throughput DNA sequencing. Regardless of the underlying technology, genomic copy number data is derived from the relative assessment and integration of multiple signals, with the data generation process being prone to contamination from several sources. Estimated copy number values have no absolute or strictly linear correlation to their corresponding DNA levels, and the extent of deviation differs between sample profiles, which poses a great challenge for data integration and comparison in large scale genome analysis.In this study, we present a novel method named “Minimum Error Calibration and Normalization for Copy Numbers Analysis” (Mecan4CNA). It only requires CNV segmentation files as input, is platform independent, and has a high performance with limited hardware requirements. For a given multi-sample copy number dataset, Mecan4CNA can batch-normalize all samples to the corresponding true copy number levels of the main tumor clones. Experiments of Mecan4CNA on simulated data showed an overall accuracy of 93% and 91% in determining the normal level and single copy alteration (i.e. duplication or loss of one allele), respectively. Comparison of estimated normal levels and single copy alternations with existing methods and karyotyping data on the NCI-60 tumor cell line produced coherent results. To estimate the method's impact on downstream analyses, we performed GISTIC analyses on the original and Mecan4CNA normalized data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) where the normalized data showed prominent improvements of both sensitivity and specificity in detecting focal regions.Mecan4CNA provides an advanced method for CNA data normalization, especially in meta-analyses involving large profile numbers and heterogeneous source data quality. With its informative output and visualization options, Mecan4CNA also can improve the interpretation of individual CNA profiles. Mecan4CNA is freely available as a Python package and through its code repository on Github.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalleles 3acarcinogenesis 3acell lines 3aclones 3acomputer software 3acopy number variation 3adata quality 3agenetic disorders 3agenomics 3agerm cells 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainheritance (genetics) 3akaryotyping 3ameta-analysis 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 0aCNV 0asCNV 0aCNA 0aMecan4CNA 0aSNP1 aBaudis, Michael0 tGenomics.g2020 Sept., v. 112, no. 5 p.3331-3341dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245015700162300002000319520108100339592002801420650001901448650002201467650003701489650002401526650001201550650002801562650002101590650001601611650001801627650001901645650001901664650001501683650001801698650001901716650002201735650002901757650001601786650003701802700002701839700002401866700001601890700001801906773012401924856007402048852000902122655001202131IND60665051420221118074935.0190912e20140617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066505142DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra03448a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnsari, Sajid Ali10aVisible light-driven photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical studies of Ag–SnO₂ nanocomposites synthesized using an electrochemically active biofilm  ap. 26013-26021.  aAg–SnO₂ nanocomposites (1 mM and 3 mM) were synthesized in water at room temperature using an electrochemically active biofilm. The resulting nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The Ag–SnO₂ nanocomposites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation for the degradation of methyl orange, methylene blue, 4-nitrophenol and 2-chlorophenol compared with pure SnO₂ nanostructures. Photoelectrochemical measurements, such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, linear scan voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry in the dark and under visible light irradiation, further supported the visible light activity of the Ag–SnO₂ nanocomposites. These results showed that the Ag nanoparticles induced visible light activity and facilitated efficient charge separation in the Ag–SnO₂ nanocomposites, thereby improving the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-chlorophenol 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3abiofilm 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3airradiation 3amethyl orange 3amethylene blue 3ananocomposites 3ananosilver 3ap-nitrophenol 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoluminescence 3areflectance spectroscopy 3atin dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aKhan, Mohammad Mansoob1 aAnsari, Mohd Omaish1 aLee, Jintae1 aCho, Moo Hwan0 tRSC advances.g2014 June 17, v. 4, no. 49 p.26013-26021dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra03448a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245017000158300002000328520163200348592002801980650001502008650001402023650000902037650000902046650001902055650001702074650001902091650003302110650001302143650001102156650001602167700002002183773012402203856007402327852000902401655001202410IND60640684120221117044526.0190504e20160613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064068412DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra09110e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Manjodh10aTemplate-free syntheses of hierarchical PbS microstructures using a new sulphur source and their time-dependent morphological evolution and photocatalytic properties  ap. 56790-56799.  aTemplate-free lead sulphide (PbS) microstructures composed of nanocrystals exhibiting time-dependent morphological evolution from cubes to dendrites (S1–S5) were synthesised by a one-pot solvothermal route using dibenzyl disulphide (DBDS = (C₇H₇S)₂) as a new temperature controlled in situ source of S²⁻ ions. Use of mercaptoethanol (MCE) capping agent resulted in the formation of PbS microstructures (S6–S10) with mainly dendritic morphology as the major phase. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements unveiled the cubic structure of the PbS microstructures. FESEM analyses of the uncapped PbS microstructures (S1–S5) obtained at different time intervals revealed time-dependent morphological evolution from cubic to dendritic structures, whereas the MCE-capped PbS microstructures show the formation of mostly dendritic structures. The possible mechanism of the morphological evolution of PbS microstructures in the presence and absence of MCE capping agent has been discussed. Optical measurements of the samples show a blue-shift in the absorption maxima in comparison to that of bulk PbS and the estimated band gap values are in the range of 3.5–3.8 eV. Photocatalytic investigation of cubic and dendritic microstructures for the degradation of MO revealed a higher catalytic activity of dendrites over cubes. The relatively higher activity of dendrites has been attributed to the higher charge transfer originating due to the branched nature of dendrites. Thus the influence of capping agent on the morphological evolution and the photocatalytic activity of PbS hierarchical structures has been presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adendrites 3aions 3alead 3amicrostructure 3ananocrystals 3aphotocatalysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asulfides 3asulfur 3atemperature1 aNagaraja, C.

The second architecture is a hybrid structure, obtained by adding the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) layer to the first architecture. In terms of accuracy, the performance of the non-hybrid and hybrid architectures that are presented in the study is determined as 98.50% and 99.50%, respectively. High classification success and innovative deep learning structure are the features of this study that distinguish it from previous studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflour 3aneural networks 3awheat1 aAslan, Muhammet Fatih1 aRopelewska, Ewa1 aUnlersen, Muhammed Fahri1 aDurdu, Akif0 tFood analytical methods.g2022 June, v. 15, no. 6 p.1748-1760dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-022-02251-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011900168300001600287520186400303592002802167650001302195650002502208650002402233650001402257650001102271650001502282650001602297650001402313653001302327653001202340653001302352653001302365653001602378653001902394653002302413700002102436773011102457856008602568852000902654655001202663IND60543287620221119133922.0190410e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054328762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeleg, Micha10aPredicting chemical degradation during storage from two successive concentration ratios: Theoretical investigation  ap. 174-181.  aWhen a vitamin's, pigment's or other food component's chemical degradation follows a known fixed order kinetics, and its rate constant's temperature-dependence follows a two parameter model, then, at least theoretically, it is possible to extract these two parameters from two successive experimental concentration ratios determined during the food's non-isothermal storage. This requires numerical solution of two simultaneous equations, themselves the numerical solutions of two differential rate equations, with a program especially developed for the purpose. Once calculated, these parameters can be used to reconstruct the entire degradation curve for the particular temperature history and predict the degradation curves for other temperature histories. The concept and computation method were tested with simulated degradation under rising and/or falling oscillating temperature conditions, employing the exponential model to characterize the rate constant's temperature-dependence. In computer simulations, the method's predictions were robust against minor errors in the two concentration ratios. The program to do the calculations was posted as freeware on the Internet. The temperature profile can be entered as an algebraic expression that can include ‘If’ statements, or as an imported digitized time–temperature data file, to be converted into an Interpolating Function by the program. The numerical solution of the two simultaneous equations requires close initial guesses of the exponential model's parameters. Programs were devised to obtain these initial values by matching the two experimental concentration ratios with a generated degradation curve whose parameters can be varied manually with sliders on the screen. These programs too were made available as freeware on the Internet and were tested with published data on vitamin A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3achemical degradation 3acomputer simulation 3aequations 3amodels 3aprediction 3atemperature 3avitamin A 0aKinetics 0aStorage 0aVitamins 0aPigments 0aSpace-foods 0aNutrients loss 0aChemical stability1 aNormand, Mark D.0 tFood research international.g2015 Sept., v. 75 p.174-181dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245004700161300001600208520149900224592002801723650002601751650001701777650001401794650001101808650001901819650001501838650002101853650001401874650001101888650002201899650001301921650001801934650001601952650001901968650001601987700002402003700002002027700002402047700002102071700001902092700002102111700001702132700001702149773009202166856007302258852000902331655001202340IND60481488420221116230108.0160205e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048148842DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.120632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarton, Andrew D.14aThe biogeography of marine plankton traits  ap. 522-534.  aChanges in marine plankton communities driven by environmental variability impact the marine food web and global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and other elements. To predict and assess these community shifts and their consequences, ecologists are increasingly investigating how the functional traits of plankton determine their relative fitness along environmental and biological gradients. Laboratory, field and modelling studies are adopting this trait‐based approach to map the biogeography of plankton traits that underlies variations in plankton communities. Here, we review progress towards understanding the regulatory roles of several key plankton functional traits, including cell size, N₂‐fixation and mixotrophy among phytoplankton, and body size, ontogeny and feeding behaviour for zooplankton. The trait biogeographical approach sheds light on what structures plankton communities in the current ocean, as well as under climate change scenarios, and also allows for finer resolution of community function because community trait composition determines the rates of significant processes, including carbon export. Although understanding of trait biogeography is growing, uncertainties remain that stem, in part, from the paucity of observations describing plankton functional traits. Thus, in addition to recommending widespread adoption of the trait‐based approach, we advocate for enhanced collection, standardisation and dissemination of plankton functional trait data.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiogeography 3abody size 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aecologists 3afeeding behavior 3afood webs 3amodels 3anitrogen fixation 3aontogeny 3aphytoplankton 3auncertainty 3awater currents 3azooplankton1 aPershing, Andrew J.1 aLitchman, Elena1 aRecord, Nicholas R.1 aEdwards, Kyle F.1 aFinkel, Zoe V.1 aKiørboe, Thomas1 aWard, Ben A.1 aElser, James0 tEcology letters.g2013 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.522-534dBlackwell Sciencex1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.120633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245016500155300002000320520140800340592002801748650001301776650002001789650001801809650003301827650000901860650001201869650001701881700001901898700001701917700001601934773012401950856007402074852000902148655001202157IND60640684220221117045645.0190504e20160613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064068422DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra09117b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Hai-Mu10aFractionated crystallization, polymorphism and crystal transformation of poly(butylene adipate) confined in electrospun immiscible blend fibers with polystyrene  ap. 55961-55969.  aUtilizing electrospun immiscible blend fibers of poly(butylene adipate) (PBA) and polystyrene (PS) and following coating by the high glass transition temperature poly(4-tert-butylstyrene) (P4tBS), confined PBA specimens in nanometer space were effectively prepared. The effect of a physical confinement environment on the PBA crystallization behavior, polymorphism and crystal transformation was adequately investigated. For non-isothermal crystallization, the crystallization ability and melting of subsequent heating was obviously suppressed in the nanospace compared with in the bulk state. Especially, the confined PBA could show fractionated crystallization due to the existence of different sizes of nanospace and the crystallization mechanism was either 1D crystal growth after heterogeneous nucleation or homogeneous nucleation dependent on the domain size. The temperature-dependent polymorphism and crystal transformation is also affected by the nanometer confinement. The formation temperature of the pure β crystal shifts slightly toward a high temperature and the β → α crystal transformation becomes easier for confined PBA compared with bulk PBA. More interestingly, the 2D IR correlation spectra revealed that the β → α crystal transformation in the nanospace takes the melt-recrystallization path, which is quite different from the usually solid–solid transformation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acrystallization 3afractionation 3aglass transition temperature 3aheat 3amelting 3apolystyrenes1 aSong, Yun-Yang1 aMeng, Xiaoyu1 aZhou, Qiong0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 13, v. 6, no. 61 p.55961-55969dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra09117b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245014600170300002000316520167200336592002802008650004402036650002302080650002202103650003702125650001202162650002202174650001902196650001302215650001902228650001302247650002102260650001902281650002802300650001902328650001702347650001202364650003702376700002302413700002302436700002702459773012402486856007402610852000902684655001202693IND60665051520221118074937.0190912e20140609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066505152DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra03451a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoghani-Mamaqani, Hossein10aPolystyrene-grafted graphene nanoplatelets with various graft densities by atom transfer radical polymerization from the edge carboxyl groups  ap. 24439-24452.  aAn initiator and hydroxyl containing modifier, 4-hydroxybutyl 2-bromopropionate (CBr), was synthesized through the coupling reaction of 1,4-butanediol and alpha-bromoisobutyryl bromide. Subsequently, graphene oxide (GO) was functionalized with CBr from the edge carboxyl groups by an esterification reaction to yield initiator-anchored graphene nanoplatelets (GCBr). Then, GCBr was used in different amounts as the precursor for atom transfer radical polymerization of styrene for evaluation of the effects of graphene loading and graft density on the kinetics and properties of the products. Successful edge-functionalization of GO with CBr and polystyrene was also proved by FTIR. A carbon to bromine ratio of 21.92 from the results of XPS shows that about 1 molecule of CBr was attached to every 3.65 aromatic rings of GCBrH. GPC results show that molecular weight and PDI values of the attached chains are higher, and molecular weight and conversion values increase with increasing grafting density. The amount of modifier and polystyrene attachment to the graphene edge was evaluated by TGA. The relaxation behavior of chains in the presence of graphene layers and also the effect of graft content on the chain confinement were studied using DSC. The ordered and disordered crystal structures of carbon were evaluated using Raman spectroscopy. The same XRD angle for the high and low graft densities at 7.5° shows that expansion of the graphene interlayer is independent of the population of attached chains on the graphene edge. Finally, an opaque and wrinkled morphology of graphene nanoplatelets was observed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abromine 3acrystal structure 3aesterification 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3ananocomposites 3aorganobromine compounds 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes 3astyrene 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aHaddadi-Asl, Vahid1 aKhezri, Khezrollah1 aSalami-Kalajahi, Mehdi0 tRSC advances.g2014 June 09, v. 4, no. 47 p.24439-24452dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra03451a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009700177300001600274520100400290592002801294650001101322650001701333650001201350650002101362650002301383650001601406653001401422653001701436653001201453653002601465653001501491700002401506700001901530700002101549700002701570773011101597856008601708852000901794655001201803IND60543287820221119133852.0190410e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054328782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenito-Román, Óscar10aPressurized aqueous ethanol extraction of β-glucans and phenolic compounds from waxy barley  ap. 252-259.  aBeta-glucans and phenolics were extracted from waxy barley using pressurized aqueous ethanol in a stirred batch reactor at 25bar and 500rpm. The effect of temperature (135–175°C), extraction time (15–55min) and ethanol content (5–20%) was evaluated. Temperature had an opposite effect on the extraction of both compounds. The higher the temperature, the lower the β-glucan extraction yield due to fragmentation, but a significant increase on the phenolic recovery was observed. Long extraction times favored the extraction of β-glucans at low temperatures and phenolics at any temperature. The ethanol content was not statistically significant on the β-glucan extraction, but helped to maintain the molecular weight of the extracted β-glucan. To obtain liquid extracts rich in high molecular weight β-glucans and phenolics, mild conditions of 151°C, 21min and 16% ethanol are needed, leading to 51% β-glucan extraction yield with a molecular weight of 500–600kDa and 5mgGAE/g barley.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3abeta-glucans 3aethanol 3amolecular weight 3aphenolic compounds 3atemperature 0aβ-Glucan 0aAntioxidants 0aEthanol 0aPressurized hot water 0aExtraction1 aAlvarez, Víctor H.1 aAlonso, Esther1 aCocero, Maria J.1 aSaldaña, Marleny D.A.0 tFood research international.g2015 Sept., v. 75 p.252-259dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245014400168300001600312520171200328592002802040650001702068650001902085650001902104650002502123650001402148650001102162650001102173650002202184650001902206650002002225653003102245653001902276653003202295700002102327773010702348856008702455852000902542655001202551IND60535367020221119222504.0190402e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053536702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2014.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Dong10aSimulating biodegradation under mixing-limited conditions using Michaelis–Menten (Monod) kinetic expressions in a particle tracking model  ap. 109-119.  aRecent studies have demonstrated that effective field-scale bioremediation reactions rates are significantly lower than batch- or lab-scale rates, when the same law of mass action is used to represent the reaction at both scales. The mismatch is usually attributed to poor mixing of reactants brought about by heterogeneity. A recent method, based on a purely Lagrangian particle tracking (PT) theoretical development, successfully reproduces the effects of mixing-limited bimolecular reaction (A+B→C) from two benchmark experiments. In this numerical method, the reactants are represented by particles, and the small-scale physics are directly translated into a combination of two probabilities that govern whether: (1) reactant particles are collocated during a short time interval, and (2) two collocated particles favorably transform into a reaction. The latter is due to thermodynamics and is independent of scale of mixing. The former directly accounts for the degree of mixing in any system. We extend the application of the PT method to biodegradation, which is commonly characterized by more complex Michaelis–Menten (Monod) chemical kinetics. The advantage of the PT method is that it explains the variation of reaction rate based on mixing-controlled particle collisions instead of using empirical parameters. The PT method not only matches the Michaelis–Menten (Monod) equation under ideal conditions, but also captures the characteristics of non-ideal conditions such as imperfect mixing, disequilibrium, and limited availability of the active sites. We show these using hypothetical systems and also successfully apply the method to a column study of carbon tetrachloride biodegradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3acarbon tetrachloride 3aequations 3amixing 3amodels 3areaction kinetics 3athermodynamics 3awater resources 0aLagrangian particle method 0aBiodegradation 0aMichaelis–Menten kinetics1 aBenson, David A.0 tAdvances in water resources.g2015 Feb., v. 76 p.109-119dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2014.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001200154245013500166520165200301592002801953650002901981650001502010650001502025650002202040650002102062650002002083650001002103650003202113650002002145650001502165651001002180653003102190653002502221653002502246653001302271700001802284700001402302700001702316700001402333773009502347856008902442852000902531655001202540IND60675542020221122130817.0191231e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067554202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.1043562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Da,10aDetailed land use transition quantification matters for smart land management in drylands: An in-depth analysis in Northwest China  aDue to the lack of smart land management strategies, the rapid expansion of cultivated oases usually results in water imbalances and land degradation in drylands. Management strategies require an in-depth detection of the modes and mechanisms of local land use change. In this study, to detect the process and spatial pattern of land use change and quantify the spatial relations between oasis expansion and the sources of water and human disturbances, enhanced analysis of land transition matrix and location relationship-based spatial analysis were conducted from 1990 to 2015 in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin (M-HRB), a typical arid inland river basin in China. The results indicated that cultivated land and desert together accounted for more than 90 % of the study area. In the M-HRB, cultivated land expansion was an obvious process of land use change. Most of the new cultivated land was reclaimed from desert, but the conversion of grassland to cultivated land was the dominant signal of systematic land transition. Swap changes gradually became the main land transition process from 1990 to 2015. The cultivated land showed a close spatial relationship with land and water resources availability, which also constrained the distribution of cultivated land expansion (i.e., within 200-1400 m of human settlements and within 1000 m of water courses or ditches). The quantification results can be used to facilitate smart land management strategies towards sustainable development in the M-HRB. The methods used here can be adapted to other dryland areas for land change detection that supports sustainable land management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarid lands 3agrasslands 3ahuman settlements 3aland degradation 3aland use change 3aoases 3asustainable land management 3awater resources 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aEnhanced transition matrix 0aSpatial distribution 0aResources constraint 0aDrylands1 aGao, Guangyao1 aLü, Yihe1 aXiao, Feiyan1 aFu, Bojie0 tLand use policy.g2020 Jan., v. 90 p.104356-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.1043563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02024naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245005300161300001600214520103600230592002801266650002101294650001201315650001501327650002601342650002001368650001701388650001501405700002301420700002201443700001901465700001601484773009201500856007301592852000901665655001201674IND60481488620221116225834.0160205e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048148862DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.120672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagner, Nicole D.10aNutritional indicators and their uses in ecology  ap. 535-544.  aThe nutrition of animal consumers is an important regulator of ecological processes due to its effects on their physiology, life‐history and behaviour. Understanding the ecological effects of poor nutrition depends on correctly diagnosing the nature and strength of nutritional limitation. Despite the need to assess nutritional limitation, current approaches to delineating nutritional constraints can be non‐specific and imprecise. Here, we consider the need and potential to develop new complementary approaches to the study of nutritional constraints on animal consumers by studying and using a suite of established and emerging biochemical and molecular responses. These nutritional indicators include gene expression, transcript regulators, protein profiling and activity, and gross biochemical and elemental composition. The potential applications of nutritional indicators to ecological studies are highlighted to demonstrate the value that this approach would have to future studies in community and ecosystem ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal nutrition 3aanimals 3aecosystems 3aelemental composition 3agene expression 3alife history 3aphysiology1 aHillebrand, Helmut1 aWacker, Alexander1 aFrost, Paul C.1 aHessen, Dag0 tEcology letters.g2013 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.535-544dBlackwell Sciencex1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.120673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245017500161300001800336520128600354592002801640650001101668650001701679650001201696650002601708650001501734650001301749650001701762650001601779653002701795653002501822653002501847653003401872653001401906700001701920700001901937700001701956700001801973700001501991700002002006700005602026700005502082700005102137773013902188856007802327852000902405655001202414IND60684400520221119144749.0200219e20200130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068440052DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b210742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Shendong10aBoosting Photovoltaic Performance and Stability of Super-Halogen-Substituted Perovskite Solar Cells by Simultaneous Methylammonium Immobilization and Vacancy Compensation  ap. 8249-8259.  aPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) are susceptible to intrinsic structural instability associated with the presence of inorganic halide anions and organic cation vacancies, thus leading to the deterioration or even premature failure of devices. Herein, we develop an efficient strategy using super-halogen BH₄– substitution to simultaneously immobilize methylammonium and substitute iodide vacancy for high-performance PSCs based on the dihydrogen bonding interactions. The introduced super-halogen BH₄– groups not only significantly reduce the vacancy density but also effectively inhibit the decomposition of the CH₃NH₃⁺ group by forming perovskite CH₃NH₃PbI₃₋ₓ(BH₄–)ₓ. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the assembled mesoporous devices is remarkably promoted from 18.43 to 21.10%, accompanied by significant increase of both Jₛc and Vₒc without obvious hysteresis. The superior PSCs can retain 90 and 80% of their initial PCE even after being stored for 1200 h under environmental conditions (50 ± 10% RH) and 240 h at 85 °C in the dark, respectively. Moreover, it delivers excellent optical stability under ultraviolet illumination. This work provides an avenue to improve both the long-term stability and photovoltaic performance of PSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3aborohydrides 3acations 3aenvironmental factors 3ahysteresis 3alighting 3aporous media 3asolar cells 0aperovskite solar cells 0asuper-halogen BH4− 0avacancy substitution 0amethylammonium immobilization 0astability1 aLiu, Guozhen1 aZheng, Haiying1 aXu, Xiaoxiao1 aZhang, Liying1 aXu, Huifen1 aZhu, Liangzheng1 aKong, Fantai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9548-67811 aLi, Yongtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1745-44661 aPan, Xu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3770-79180 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 30, v. 12, no. 7 p.8249-8259dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b210743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01492naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011500162300001800277520041400295592002800709650001500737650002300752650002300775650001800798650001800816650001300834650001900847700003400866700002000900700001700920773013400937856007401071852000901145655001201154IND60617506520221122044205.0181025e20180628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061750652DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc02058b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWurmbrand, Daniel10aMorphogenesis of anisotropic nanoparticles: self-templating via non-classical, fibrillar Cd₂Se intermediates  ap. 7358-7361.  aA fibrillar, polymeric intermediate (Cd₂Se)ₙ was isolated from the synthesis of CdSe nanorods, which suggests that the reactants themselves can template anisotropic growth.

How birds cope with this challenge has been little studied. In this study, we compared the provisioning behavior and nestling condition of the Green-backed Tit Parus monticolus nesting in a landscape mosaic comprised of native mixed-oak forests and exotic Japanese Cedar Cryptomeria japonica plantations. Parent birds in the larvae-poor plantations time their breeding as they do in the larvae-rich forests and have clutches of similar size. We found that parent birds were flexible in adjusting their criteria for prey choice on the basis of larval abundance. In early spring, in cedar plantations where larval abundance was low, male parents maintained constant nearby feeding trips to the early broods, just as they did in the mixed-oak forests, but reduced their dietary specialization on larvae, while female birds increased their provisioning frequency. Combining both parents' efforts, the early brood nestlings raised in the cedar plantations received food deliveries more frequently and with a higher proportion of non-larval prey than their counterparts did in the mixed-oak forests. In contrast, during late brood rearing, when larvae were abundant, both parents in the plantations foraged heavily on larvae at the expense of other prey, just as they did in the mixed-oak forests. We found that parent birds reared heavier nestlings as the contribution of large larvae to the diet increased. Moreover, the nestlings during early broods in the plantations had lower body weights than their counterparts in the mixed-oak forests. We suggest that the provisioning flexibility of Green-backed Tits helps them gather food for raising nestlings when their breeding attempts are less synchronized with the larval food supply in their habitat. As a result, they can breed successfully in the exotic cedar plantations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptomeria japonica 3aParus 3adiet 3afemales 3afood availability 3aforests 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3alarvae 3amales 3aspring 3aTaiwan 0aJapanese Cedar plantation 0aMixed-oak forest 0aProvisioning behavior1 aYao, Mu-Chun1 aChuang, Mei-Chen0 tOrnithological science.g2022 July 29, v. 21, no. 2 p.165-176dUniBio PresswJournal:19740x1347-05587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2326/osj.21.1653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010200157300001600259500001100275520113800286592002801424650001701452650001501469650001501484650001501499650001701514650001401531650001401545650001701559700002101576700001901597700001701616700002401633700002401657700001801681700001801699700001901717700002201736700002401758700001801782700002301800700002001823700002101843700002101864700002001885700002001905700001901925700002001944700001601964773009201980856007302072852000902145655001202154IND60481488720221116225337.0160205e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048148872DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.120782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLind, Eric M.10aLife‐history constraints in grassland plant species: a growth‐defence trade‐off is the norm  ap. 513-521.  aLETTER  aPlant growth can be limited by resource acquisition and defence against consumers, leading to contrasting trade‐off possibilities. The competition‐defence hypothesis posits a trade‐off between competitive ability and defence against enemies (e.g. herbivores and pathogens). The growth‐defence hypothesis suggests that strong competitors for nutrients are also defended against enemies, at a cost to growth rate. We tested these hypotheses using observations of 706 plant populations of over 500 species before and following identical fertilisation and fencing treatments at 39 grassland sites worldwide. Strong positive covariance in species responses to both treatments provided support for a growth‐defence trade‐off: populations that increased with the removal of nutrient limitation (poor competitors) also increased following removal of consumers. This result held globally across 4 years within plant life‐history groups and within the majority of individual sites. Thus, a growth‐defence trade‐off appears to be the norm, and mechanisms maintaining grassland biodiversity may operate within this constraint.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acovariance 3agrasslands 3aherbivores 3alife history 3anutrients 3apathogens 3aplant growth1 aBorer, Elizabeth1 aSeabloom, Eric1 aAdler, Peter1 aBakker, Jonathan D.1 aBlumenthal, Dana M.1 aCrawley, Mick1 aDavies, Kendi1 aFirn, Jennifer1 aGruner, Daniel S.1 aStanley Harpole, W.1 aHautier, Yann1 aHillebrand, Helmut1 aKnops, Johannes1 aMelbourne, Brett1 aMortensen, Brent1 aRisch, Anita C.1 aSchuetz, Martin1 aStevens, Carly1 aWragg, Peter D.1 aPutten, Wim0 tEcology letters.g2013 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.513-521dBlackwell Sciencex1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.120783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245008700175520193100262592002802193650002302221650002602244650001202270650001902282650003002301650001002331650001102341650001602352650002502368650001302393650002902406653002202435653002002457653002202477653001502499653002602514653002102540700001802561700002202579700001902601700002102620773011902641856008802760852000902848655001202857IND60782082720221120103625.0220830e20221020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078208272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1571422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhojasteh, Danial10aClimate change and COVID-19: Interdisciplinary perspectives from two global crises  aThe repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change – two major current global crises – are far-reaching, the parallels between the two are striking, and their influence on one another are significant. Based on the wealth of evidence that has emerged from the scientific literature during the first two years of the pandemic, this study argues that these two global crises require holistic multisectoral mitigation strategies. Despite being different in nature, neither crisis can be effectively mitigated without considering their interdependencies. Herein, significant interactions between these two crises are highlighted and discussed. Major implications related to the economy, energy, technology, environment, food systems and agriculture sector, health systems, policy, management, and communities are detailed via a review of existing joint literature. Based on these outcomes, practical recommendations for future research and management are provided. While the joint timing of these crises has created a global conundrum, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated opportunities and lessons for devising sustainable recovery plans in relation to the climate crisis. The findings indicated that governments should work collaboratively to develop durable and adjustable strategies in line with long-term, global decarbonisation targets, promote renewable energy resources, integrate climate change into environmental policies, prioritise climate-smart agriculture and local food systems, and ensure public and ecosystem health. Further, differences in geographic distributions of climate change and COVID-19 related death cases revealed that these crises pose different threats to different parts of the world. These learnings provide insights to address the climate emergency – and potential future global problems with similar characteristics – if international countries act urgently and collectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aagricultural industry 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate-smart agriculture 3adeath 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental health 3apandemic 3arenewable energy sources 0aCollective action 0aGlobal pandemic 0aPublic perception 0aAdaptation 0aSocio-economic impact 0aRenewable energy1 aDavani, Ehsan1 aShamsipour, Abbas1 aHaghani, Milad1 aGlamore, William0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Oct. 20, v. 844 p.157142-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1571423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03749naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245014800160300001800308520198500326592002802311650001202339650002002351650001002371650001802381650001602399650001802415650001102433650001602444650001102460650002102471650001202492650004102504650001202545650001602557650004002573650001402613650001702627650001202644650001702656650001602673650002102689650001602710653001302726653001602739653002202755653002002777700001802797700002202815700003402837700002602871700002402897773015202921856007703073852000903150655001203159IND60795363820221117073506.0221004e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079536382DNAL7 a10.18805/IJAR.B-39392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Sushil10aEffect of dietary enrichment with omega 3 and 6 fatty acids on blood metabolites, hormone concentration and ovarian function in sahiwal heifers  ap. 1084-1089.  aSupplementation of fat, especially those having unsaturated fatty acids has been proposed to carry positive effects on the reproductive organ, beside providing dietary energy to the animals. This experiment was designed to examine the effects of dietary w-3 or w-6 fatty acid (FA) rich oil supplementation on blood FA, metabolite and hormone concentrations; ovarian follicular growth and corpus luteum (CL) size in Sahiwal breed heifers. Eighteen heifers of 18.33±1.14 months of age and 194±4.16 kg of mean body weight were randomly assigned to 3 diets and individually fed as per ICAR (2013) diets. The diets include chopped wheat straw, green fodder and concentrate mixture containing either (i) no added PUFA rich oil but palm oil @ 3.5% (PO; n=6); (ii) 3.5% added soybean oil as w-6 FA source (SO; n=6); or (iii) 3.5% added linseed oil as w-3 FA source (LO; n=6). SO increased (P<0.05) the plasma concentration of w-6 FA while LO increased (P<0.05) the plasma w-3 FA. Plasma glucose, triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations was not affected due to different diets. Plasma total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were significantly higher (P<0.05) in SO and LO in comparison to PO. However, LDL-cholesterol was at par among all the treatments. Growth Hormone (GH) was not influenced due to different types of oil in heifers’ concentrate mixture. Insulin concentration increased (P<0.05) in LO compared to others. IGF-1 was statistically higher (P<0.05) in SO and LO as compared to CON, which among themselves also varied significantly. Plasma progesterone concentration at day 12 post estrous was higher (P<0.05) in LO. PUFA rich oil supplementation in the concentrate mixture of heifers (SO and LO) increased (P<0.05) the size of the ovulatory follicles as well as size of CL. It was inferred that feeding PUFA rich oil to pre-pubertal Sahiwal heifer's results in advantageous changes in the blood metabolites, plasma hormones and ovarian functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSahiwal 3aanimal research 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3acorpus luteum 3aenergy 3afatty acids 3aforage 3afree fatty acids 3aheifers 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ainsulin 3alinseed oil 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3apalm oils 3aprogesterone 3apuberty 3asomatotropin 3asoybean oil 3atriacylglycerols 3awheat straw 0aHormones 0aMetabolites 0aOvarian functions 0aSahiwal heifers1 aSihag, Sajjan1 aSihag, Zile Singh1 aPatil, Chandershekhar Santosh1 aDhaka, Surender Singh1 aPandey, Anand Kumar0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2022 Sept., v. 56, no. 9 p.1084-1089dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18805/IJAR.B-39393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012600164300001800290520103300308592002801341596006601369650001401435650001601449650002201465650001201487650001801499650002101517650001401538650001701552700001601569700001601585700001901601700005501620700001601675773011601691856008301807852000901890655001201899IND60776603520221119063400.0220726e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077660352DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-021-02211-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Linfang10aScreening and Identification of Specific Aptamers for Shellfish Allergen Tropomyosin with Capillary Electrophoresis-SELEX  ap. 1535-1544.  aTropomyosin (TM), known as the major allergen in shellfish, has gained increasing concerns in industrialized countries, resulting in an urgent need for an accurate, simple, and sensitive method for TM detection in food products. Nucleic acid aptamers, short single-stranded oligonucleotides chains, can bind to various targets with a high affinity and specificity and hence have the potential to be used for the accurate detection of targets. Here, we proposed capillary electrophoresis-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (CE-SELEX) for rapid selection and identification of specific aptamers against shellfish TM. A selected aptamer IX exhibited high specificity and high binding affinity against TM with Kd determined (0.95 nM). In addition, the aptamer IX has great potential to be employed in the establishment of various aptasensors for TM detection in shellfish products. Furthermore, the CE-SELEX method may provide a universal and convenient method for the aptamer selection against more targets.  aPublisher supplied data  aLGC20C200002cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province 3aallergens 3aaptasensors 3aindustrialization 3aligands 3anucleic acids 3aoligonucleotides 3ashellfish 3atropomyosins1 aZhou, Jinru1 aWang, Kuiwu1 aChen, Xiaojing1 aFu, Linglin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5623-30471 aWang, Yanbo0 tFood analytical methods.g2022 June, v. 15, no. 6 p.1535-1544dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-021-02211-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002500191245014100216300001600357520144100373592002801814653003401842653002701876653003601903653004101939653001401980700002001994700002402014700002802038773011102066856008402177852000902261655001202270IND60530765120221122051814.0161026e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053076512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gendis.2016.03.0012doi7 aPMC61461762pmcid7 a302588842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishnan, Ramalingam10aAssociation of angiotensin converting enzyme gene insertion/deletion polymorphism with essential hypertension in south Indian population  ap. 159-163.  aGenetic, environmental and demographic factors contribute to the development of essential hypertension. Genetic polymorphism of Rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been extensively studied to determine the genetic susceptibility to hypertension. The insertion/deletion (I/D) angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphism has been established as a cardiovascular risk factor in some population, but its association with essential hypertension is controversial. This study sought to determine the association of I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene in south Indian essential hypertensive subjects. A total of 208 clinically diagnosed essential hypertensive patients without any associated diseases and 220 healthy control subjects were included in this study. Distribution and allelic frequency of Insertion (I) and Deletion (D) polymorphism at the 287 base pair Alu repeat sequence in the intron 16 of ACE gene were analyzed. The distribution of II, ID, DD genotypes of ACE gene was 28.3%, 32.6% and 38.9% respectively in essential hypertensive patients and to 53.6%, 26.3% and 20% in controls. The allele frequency for D allele is 0.58 in essential hypertension as compared to 0.34 of control subjects. The genotype and allele frequency of ACE gene polymorphism is significantly differed in patients when compared to controls. In conclusion, the I/D polymorphism of ACE gene is associated with Indian essential hypertension.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAngiotensin converting enzyme 0aEssential hypertension 0aInsertion/deletion polymorphism 0aRenin angiotensin aldosterone system 0aGenotypes1 aSekar, Durairaj1 akarunanithy, Santha1 aSubramanium, Sethupathy0 tGenes & Diseases.g2016 June, v. 3 p.159-163dElsevier B.V.aChongqing Medical Universityx2352-30427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gendis.2016.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01591naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100022200140245009400362300001800456520038100474592002800855650002300883650002300906650002100929700003100950700003800981700002901019700002501048773013301073856007401206852000901280655001201289IND60617506820221122013210.0181025e20180531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061750682DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc02069h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín-YergaCurrent address: Applied Electrochemistry, School of Engineering Sciences in Chemistry, Biotechnology and Health, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SE 100-44 Stockholm, Sweden.

Identifying crucial wintering and stopover sites and seasons is an important step toward conserving shorebirds and their habitats along the Indian coast. We assessed spatial and temporal patterns of shorebird composition from January 2015 to December 2016 at seven estuaries along Maharashtra's Sindhudurg district, which is located on India's west coast, a coastal zone of international importance for shorebirds. Three potential shorebird habitats –mangroves, mudflats, and sandy beaches – were selected at each of the estuaries chosen for the study. We established three vantage points, one each in the mangrove, mudflat, and sandy beach areas, to count birds during low tide. The total count method was followed to count birds, and occasional photograph-based counts were also made when flock size was big or the flocks kept changing. We recorded 31 species of migratory shorebirds, of which 68% wintered and 32% used the Sindhudurg coast as migratory stopover site. We found significantly high richness and abundance of shorebirds during winter and in the mudflats. nMDS was used to determine species composition of shorebird across habitats and months and revealed distinct patterns of composition in five unique phases: arrival, wintering, early departure, departure, and breeding. Our results revealed that the species composition of shorebirds is not homogenous across sites and months, and is largely driven by the habitat heterogeneity of estuaries, seasonality, and anthropogenic disturbances. These results provide baseline information on shorebirds along a stretch of India's west coast and highlight the importance of mudflats and non-protected coastal wetlands for shorebirds.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aflocks 3ahabitats 3amigratory behavior 3aspecies diversity 3astopover sites 3awinter 3aIndia 0aEstuaries 0aMudflats 0aSeason 0aShorebirds 0aWest Coast1 aBabu, Santhanakrishnan1 aQuadros, Goldin0 tOrnithological science.g2022 July 29, v. 21, no. 2 p.199-213dUniBio PresswJournal:19740x1347-05587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2326/osj.21.1993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245014900212300001800361520131600379592002801695650001901723650001001742650001601752650002501768650001201793650000901805650000901814650001801823650001301841650001601854700006001870700006201930700002001992700001802012700002202030700002402052700007202076700006002148773011602208856008302324852000902407655001202416IND60776603620221119063712.0220726e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077660362DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-021-02191-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchesani, Giuliana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2876-621110aFast and Sensitive Radiochemical Method for Sr-90 Determination in Food and Feed by Chromatographic Extraction and Liquid Scintillation Counting  ap. 1521-1534.  aStrontium-90 (Sr-90) contamination in food is a major public health issue. Several radiochemical methods are available for the determination of Sr-90. However, the application of these procedures is not focused on solid foods, but only on liquid (milk, water, etc.) and environmental matrices, and they were not fully validated. The aims of this work were to establish and validate a fast, sensitive method for the determination of Sr-90 in solid food matrices such as meat and dairy products, seafood, vegetables, and animal feed, using a specific resin for extraction and ultra-low-level liquid scintillation counting for detection. The method was optimised and validated according to relevant legislation. Good analytical performance was obtained, including high specificity and linearity together with low measurement uncertainty (13.1%). The minimal detectable activity was 11 mBq kg⁻¹, and the mean repeatability (CV%) and recovery values were 10.7% and 100.1%, respectively. These parameters assured method applicability for official food safety controls. The method was applied to reference materials and submitted to proficiency test round to confirm its reliability for Sr-90 quantification in solid foodstuffs and feed. The newly established method may be broadly applicable to complex matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3afeeds 3afood safety 3alaws and regulations 3aliquids 3ameat 3amilk 3apublic health 3aseafoods 3auncertainty1 aTrotta, Gabriele1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9610-62261 aDe Felice, Pierino1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8822-97471 aBortone, Nicola1 aDamiano, Rita1 aNicolini, Michele1 aAccettulli, Rosario1 aChiaravalle, Antonio Eugenio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5571-26441 aIammarino, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1728-59490 tFood analytical methods.g2022 June, v. 15, no. 6 p.1521-1534dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-021-02191-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245005500158300001600213520107700229592002801306650001401334650002401348650002001372650001401392650001501406650001801421650001401439700002501453700002301478700001601501773009201517856007301609852000901682655001201691IND60481489020221116225423.0160205e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048148902DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.120762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlizon, Samuel10aMultiple infections and the evolution of virulence  ap. 556-567.  aInfections that consist of multiple parasite strains or species are common in the wild and are a major public health concern. Theory suggests that these infections have a key influence on the evolution of infectious diseases and, more specifically, on virulence evolution. However, we still lack an overall vision of the empirical support for these predictions. We argue that within‐host interactions between parasites largely determine how virulence evolves and that experimental data support model predictions. Then, we explore the main limitation of the experimental study of such ‘mixed infections’, which is that it draws conclusions on evolutionary outcomes from studies conducted at the individual level. We also discuss differences between coinfections caused by different strains of the same species or by different species. Overall, we argue that it is possible to make sense out of the complexity inherent to multiple infections and that experimental evolution settings may provide the best opportunity to further our understanding of virulence evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevolution 3ainfectious diseases 3amixed infection 3aparasites 3aprediction 3apublic health 3avirulence1 ade Roode, Jacobus C.1 aMichalakis, Yannis1 aDrake, John0 tEcology letters.g2013 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.556-567dBlackwell Sciencex1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.120763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04091naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245014900202300001400351520227400365592002802639650002402667650002202691650004302713650001502756650001302771650002202784650002202806650001402828650001502842650001902857650002402876650001402900650001802914650001002932650002502942653006402967653002203031653001503053653001503068653001903083653003803102653003903140653001803179700001403197700002003211700001603231700001603247700001803263700005503281773009503336856008503431852000903516655001203525IND60623232120221119003557.0201118e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062323212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.11.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZahn, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3038-937110aIdentification of potentially mobile and persistent transformation products of REACH-registered chemicals and their occurrence in surface waters  ap. 86-96.  aTransformation of industrial chemicals might be a significant source of hitherto unknown persistent and mobile organic contaminants (PMOC, PM chemicals) present in the aquatic environment. Herein we depicted a three-step strategy consisting of (I) the prioritization of potential PMOC precursors among REACH-registered chemicals, (II) their lab scale transformation through hydrolysis, photolysis, MnO₂ oxidation, and biotransformation and subsequent structural elucidation of derived transformation products, and finally (III) the assessment of their environmental relevance. The proposed procedure was utilized to investigate eleven chemicals, for nine of which a concentration reduction was observed. For six of these chemicals transformation products were at least tentatively identified and partially confirmed with a commercially available reference standard. Retrospective assessment of high-performance liquid chromatography - high-resolution mass spectrometry data as well as a target screening method for the identified TPs and some of the prioritized REACH chemicals revealed the widespread presence of the following chemicals in the environment: 2-pyrrolidone (hydrolysis product of vinylpyrrolidone), TP 216 (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-acetic acid, biotransformation product of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-ethanol), and 1,3-diphenylguanidine (prioritized chemical with experimental evidence of environmental stability). 2-Pyrrolidone was detected in 23/25 investigated surface water samples and present in concentrations of up to 400 ng/L. TP 216 was detected in 20/25 surface water samples and an additional sampling of a waste water treatment plant and the receiving surface water confirmed that TP 216 is formed in waste water treatment plants. The vulcanisation agent 1,3-diphenylguanidine was present in all investigated samples. A leaching experiment with a tire suggested that tires and thus tire wear particles are a potential source of 1,3-diphenylguanidine. With these data the depicted approach was proven successful and suitable for true unknowns like TP 216, and thus an alternative to non-target screenings or suspect-screenings with predicted TPs to identify environmentally relevant transformation products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3abiotransformation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3aleaching 3amanganese dioxide 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3aphotolysis 3aprioritization 3areference standards 3ascreening 3asurface water 3atires 3awastewater treatment 0aPersistent and mobile organic chemicals (PMOC/PM-chemicals) 0aBiotransformation 0aHydrolysis 0aPhotolysis 0aMnO2 Oxidation 0aPrioritization of REACH chemicals 0aSemi-quantitative target screening 0aSurface water1 aMucha, P.1 aZilles, Urbano,1 aTouffet, A.1 aGallard, H.1 aKnepper, T.P.1 aFrömel, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4812-01270 tWater research.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 150 p.86-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.11.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245014100164520151600305592002801821650003501849650001901884650002601903650002101929650002301950650001401973650001301987650001502000650002502015653002702040653003202067653002402099653001602123653001402139653001402153700002002167700001202187700001702199700001502216700001202231773010402243856008502347852000902432655001202441IND60747883220221120233753.0220205e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074788322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2021.1118842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Houyu14aThe vertical migration of antibiotic-resistant genes and pathogens in soil and vegetables after the application of different fertilizers  aThe prevalence of bacterial resistance caused by the application of animal manure has become an important environmental issue. Herein, the vertical migration of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens in soil and vegetables after the application of different fertilizers was explored. The results showed that the application of composted manure considerably enhanced the abundance of most ARGs and pathogens, especially in surface soil and pakchoi roots. Moreover, the soil ARGs increased partially from log 1.93 to log 4.65 after the application of composted manure, and six pathogens were simultaneously detected. It was observed that the increase in soil depth decreased most ARGs and pathogens by log 1.04–2.24 and 53.98 %~85.54 %, respectively. This indicated that ARGs and pathogens still existed in the deep soil (80–100 cm). Moreover, total organic carbon had a significant influence on the pathogen distribution, whereas bacterial communities primarily drove the vertical migration of ARGs rather than environmental factors. Although most of the ARG-host associations observed in the surface soil were disappeared in deep soil as revealed by network analysis, some co-occurrence pattern still occurred in deep soil, suggesting that some ARGs might be carried to deep soil by their host bacteria. These results were novel in describing the vertical migration of ARGs in the environment after the application of different fertilizers, providing ideas for curbing their migration to crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aanimal manures 3aantibiotic resistance 3acomposted manure 3amigratory behavior 3apathogens 3aresearch 3asoil depth 3atotal organic carbon 0aLongitudinal migration 0aAntibiotic resistance genes 0aPathogenic bacteria 0aFertilizers 0aInfluence 0aMechanism1 aZheng, Xiangqun1 aTan, Lu1 aShao, Zhenlu1 aCao, Haoyu1 aXu, Yan0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Jan., v. 203 p.111884-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1118843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01491naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008300159300001600242520056100258592002800819653002100847653002600868653002000894700001700914700002000931700001800951700002400969773011200993856007501105852000901180655001201189IND60785898720221120110436.0220730e20220729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078589872DNAL7 a10.2326/osj.21.2352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato, Takahiro10aSex Difference in Natal Dispersal in the Eurasian Tree Sparrow Passer montanus  ap. 235-240.  aAvian dispersal patterns vary among populations and breeding conditions, although female passerine birds tend to disperse longer distances from natal sites than do males.

Therefore targeted therapies against ER, known as endocrine therapies, are widely used in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancers. While these therapies have shown great success, de novo and acquired resistance are common. The approach to the problem of endocrine therapy resistance is two-fold: identify the mechanisms of resistance and develop alternative treatments to overcome these mechanisms. This review focuses on the progress and integration of these two aspects of resolving endocrine therapy resistance in ER-positive breast cancer patients.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBreast cancer 0aCirculating tumor DNA 0aESR1 0aEstrogen receptor 0aMutation 0aPlasma1 aPark, Ben Ho0 tGenes & Diseases.g2016 June, v. 3 p.124-129dElsevier B.V.aChongqing Medical Universityx2352-30427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gendis.2016.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007300147245012300220500001900343520180600362592002802168650002302196650001602219650001502235650001602250650001202266650001202278650001602290650001702306650001202323650002302335650002302358650001202381650001402393650002402407650001402431650002202445650001402467650002002481653001602501653000902517653002402526700001802550700001702568700002302585700002402608700005702632773010302689856008202792852000902874655001202883IND60695437920221119210009.0201111e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069543792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2020.1108622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVučić Lovrenčić, Marijana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7365-062710aSex-specific effects of vegetarian diet on adiponectin levels and insulin sensitivity in healthy non-obese individuals  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe beneficial influence of a vegetarian diet in reducing the risk for metabolic syndrome has been demonstrated. However, adiponectin production and secretion are scarcely studied in vegetarians, despite their important role in recovering metabolic homeostasis by reducing visceral obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a vegetarian diet on serum adiponectin levels and its association with the established biomarkers of insulin sensitivity and inflammation in healthy, non-obese individuals.Adiponectin, C-reactive protein, uric acid, glucose, insulin, lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear cell counts were determined in the blood of sex- and age-matched healthy vegetarian (n = 40) and omnivore (n = 36) individuals. The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-2) calculator was used for the β-cell function (HOMA2-%B) and insulin resistance index (HOMA2-IRI) estimation.Adiponectin levels were significantly higher in female vegetarians than the respective omnivore controls (P = 0.03), whereas no dietary-associated difference was observed in men. HOMA2-%B was significantly higher in vegetarians than in omnivore controls (P = 0.04), whereas no diet-dependent differences were found in insulin, HOMA2-IRI, inflammatory, and metabolic biomarkers. Multiple regression analysis showed that adiponectin levels were significantly predicted by the type of diet only in women (P = 0.042), whereas no associations were found in men.A vegetarian diet resulted in improved β-cell function. Favorable adiponectin and insulin sensitivity responses in women reveal a distinct effect of diet-to-metabolic homeostasis, indicating an interesting pattern of sexual dimorphism regarding the beneficial metabolic effect of a vegetarian diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aadiponectin 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3afemales 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3aomnivores 3aregression analysis 3asecretion 3asexual dimorphism 3auric acid 3avegetarian diet 0aVegetarians 0aDiet 0aInsulin sensitivity1 aGerić, Marko1 aKošuta, Iva1 aDragičević, Maro1 aGaraj-Vrhovac, Vera1 aGajski, Goran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1886-14530 tNutrition.g2020 Nov.,  Dec., v. 79-80 p.110862-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.1108623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009900169300001600268520096600284592002801250650001401278650001101292650000901303650001601312650002301328650002001351651001101371653001801382653001401400653002901414653003401443653002301477700002101500773010701521856008701628852000901715655001201724IND60535367720221119222304.0190402e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053536772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2015.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoch, Erwan12aA frailty-contagion model for multi-site hourly precipitation driven by atmospheric covariates  ap. 145-154.  aAccurate stochastic simulations of hourly precipitation are needed for impact studies at local spatial scales. Statistically, hourly precipitation data represent a difficult challenge. They are non-negative, skewed, heavy tailed, contain a lot of zeros (dry hours) and they have complex temporal structures (e.g., long persistence of dry episodes). Inspired by frailty-contagion approaches used in finance and insurance, we propose a multi-site precipitation simulator that, given appropriate regional atmospheric variables, can simultaneously handle dry events and heavy rainfall periods. One advantage of our model is its conceptual simplicity in its dynamical structure. In particular, the temporal variability is represented by a common factor based on a few classical atmospheric covariates like temperatures, pressures and others. Our inference approach is tested on simulated data and applied on measurements made in the northern part of French Brittany.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainsurance 3amodels 3arain 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3awater resources 3aFrance 0aCommon factor 0aContagion 0aPrecipitation simulators 0aSpatial–temporal dependence 0aWeather generators1 aNaveau, Philippe0 tAdvances in water resources.g2015 Apr., v. 78 p.145-154dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2015.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01519naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007000158300001600228520053500244592002800779650001000807650001000817650001000827650001700837650001000854650001900864653002300883653001200906653002000918653001300938700002200951773011200973856007501085852000901160655001201169IND60785898820221120115828.0220730e20220729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078589882DNAL7 a10.2326/osj.21.2412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTojo, Hitoshi10aFirst Record of Ural Owl Strix uralensis Nesting on a Steel Tower  ap. 241-244.  aUral Owls Strix uralensis often use nest boxes, but there have been few reports of them using other man-made structures.

Furthermore, selenium (Se) is a component of the selenoproteins and influences the toxicity of Cd in different organisms, and protect organisms as a kind of heavy metal antagonist. This study exposed mud crab to 5.0 mg/L Cd for 28 days, and investigated whether different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.3 mg/kg) of selenite (Na₂SeO₃) or selenomethionine (SeMet) affect the bioaccumulation of Cd, serum biochemical index, antioxidant and stress-response genes of S. paramamosain. The results showed that the Cd concentration in Cd group was significantly higher than the organic or inorganic Se group. Serum biochemical index demonstrated that Se might relieve the damage or dysfunction of hepatopancreas caused by both Cd accumulation and toxicity. Furthermore, Se improved CAT, GPx T-AOC and SOD activity, and decreased MDA concentrations and the lipid peroxidation levels, antagonistic to Cd. Then, this study analyzed the expression of 26 stress-related genes, the results indicated that the inorganic and organic Se might reduce the damage of cell and the toxicity of heavy metals in the hepatopancreas after Cd exposure. Therefore, this study indicated that Se might alleviate Cd toxicity via the different antioxidative mechanisms, and increased the understanding of environmental toxins on estuary crustaceans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScylla paramamosain 3aantagonism 3aantagonists 3aantioxidants 3abioaccumulation 3ablood serum 3acadmium 3acrabs 3aenvironment 3aestuaries 3aheavy metals 3ahepatopancreas 3ahumans 3alipid peroxidation 3apollution 3arisk 3aselenites 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine 3aselenoproteins 3astress response 3atoxicity 3awildlife 0aScylla paramamosain 0aCadmium 0aSelenium 0aSerum biochemical index 0aOxidative stress1 aLin, Zhenxiang,1 aLi, Bang-Ze1 aCheng, Yuan-Xin1 aXu, Wen-Bin1 aXiao, Yi1 aChen, Da-Yong1 aDong, Wei-Ren1 aShu, Miao-An0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Oct. 20, v. 844 p.157149-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1571493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007900148245010800227300001400335520134400349592002801693650001101721650001201732650001001744650001601754651001301770700002701783700001801810700001601828700002001844773010201864856008301966852000902049655001202058IND60776604020221119063556.0220507e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077660402DNAL7 a10.1007/s12231-022-09543-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aĀjīja, Muhammada Ābadula,d1914-1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5926-771X14aThe Inextricable Link between Ecology and Taste: Traditional Plant Foraging in NW Balochistan, Pakistan  ap. 34-59.  aCross–cultural food studies among various ethnic groups are crucial for understanding patterns of food preferences. The study recorded wild food plants (WFPs) gathered among Baloch, Brahui, Dehwar, Hazaras, and Pathans living in northwest Balochistan, Pakistan. A total of 68 taxa were recorded, of which only one–fifth were commonly used among the various groups. Hazaras and Pathans differed in their WFP foraging patterns while the other groups shared considerably more commonalities in the gathering of WFPs. The distinctiveness of Hazara–foraged ingredients can be explained by the fact that they still rely on foraging conducted over the border in the Afghan mountains, and thus their food knowledge is to some extent less “mixed” with that of the other groups. Slight differences in patterns of wild plant preferences are also shaped by the importance of certain plant tastes, especially sour and bitter ones, among Hazaras and Pathans. The complex mosaic patterns of WFP gathering among the researched groups indicate the prevalence of different ecological attitudes, as well as social customs. Future research trajectories will also have to consider the sensory acceptance of WFPs among groups and generations in order to articulate strategies for incorporating local food biocultural heritage into development programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotany 3aecology 3ataste 3awild plants 3aPakistan1 aAbbasi, Arshad Mehmood1 aSaeed, Shazia1 aAhmed, Alia1 aPieroni, Andrea0 tEconomic botany.g2022 Mar., v. 76, no. 1 p.34-59dSpringer USwJournal:jnl44652x0013-00017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12231-022-09543-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245015400173300001400327520168900341592002802030650001802058650001802076650001102094650001502105650003302120650002002153650002502173650001602198650002002214653002102234653002902255653003502284653001602319653002302335700001502358773010502373856008702478852000902565655001202574IND60535367820221119222223.0190402e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053536782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2015.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatija, Aaditya10aDirect forecasting of subsurface flow response from non-linear dynamic data by linear least-squares in canonical functional principal component space  ap. 69-81.  aInverse modeling is widely used to assist with forecasting problems in the subsurface. However, full inverse modeling can be time-consuming requiring iteration over a high dimensional parameter space with computationally expensive forward models and complex spatial priors. In this paper, we investigate a prediction-focused approach (PFA) that aims at building a statistical relationship between data variables and forecast variables, avoiding the inversion of model parameters altogether. The statistical relationship is built by first applying the forward model related to the data variables and the forward model related to the prediction variables on a limited set of spatial prior models realizations, typically generated through geostatistical methods. The relationship observed between data and prediction is highly non-linear for many forecasting problems in the subsurface. In this paper we propose a Canonical Functional Component Analysis (CFCA) to map the data and forecast variables into a low-dimensional space where, if successful, the relationship is linear. CFCA consists of (1) functional principal component analysis (FPCA) for dimension reduction of time-series data and (2) canonical correlation analysis (CCA); the latter aiming to establish a linear relationship between data and forecast components. If such mapping is successful, then we illustrate with several cases that (1) simple regression techniques with a multi-Gaussian framework can be used to directly quantify uncertainty on the forecast without any model inversion and that (2) such uncertainty is a good approximation of uncertainty obtained from full posterior sampling with rejection sampling.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageostatistics 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3asubsurface flow 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3awater resources 0aInverse modeling 0aFunctional data analysis 0aCanonical correlation analysis 0aGroundwater 0aReservoir modeling1 aCaers, Jef0 tAdvances in water resources.g2015 Mar., v. 77 p.69-81dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2015.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02128naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245012100213500001900334520104600353592002801399650001701427650002101444650002101465650002601486650001501512700002101527700002501548700002301573773012101596856008801717852000901805655001201814IND60695438020221119210618.0201111e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069543802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1048552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinunno, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9546-063710aExploring environmental benefits of reuse and recycle practices: A circular economy case study of a modular building  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecent research indicates that circular economy practices have the potential to provide significant environmental benefits. In particular, recycling has been associated with reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. However, in this study, the authors posit that in a building context, environmental benefits of reuse practices could far surpass recycling. To test this, we evaluated the environmental benefits of a prototype and purpose-built, modular building designed for disassembly and reuse through a life cycle assessment of its components. We then compared the results of our life cycle assessment with the results of a contemporary construction approach with a focus on the recyclability of materials. Our results indicate that, compared to recycling, designing and building for reuse components offsets greenhouse gas emissions by 88% while also benefiting several other tested environmental indicators. Our findings help guide the judicious adoption of practices to reduce buildings’ waste production and greenhouse gas emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acircular economy 3agreenhouse gases 3alife cycle assessment 3aprototypes1 aO'Grady, Timothy1 aMorrison, Gregory M.1 aGruner, Richard L.0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2020 Sept., v. 160 p.104855-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1048553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03470naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004000151245015200191300001600343520179100359592002802150650002202178650001702200650001302217650002202230650001702252650001202269650001802281650001702299650001302316650001602329650001602345650002102361650001902382650001002401650002302411650002102434650001202455650001002467653002002477653001002497653002202507653002102529653001702550700001602567700002702583700003802610700003502648700002702683773011102710856008602821852000902907655001202916IND60543288520221119134234.0190410e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054328852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Melo Pereira, Gilberto Vinícius10aConducting starter culture-controlled fermentations of coffee beans during on-farm wet processing: Growth, metabolic analyses and sensorial effects  ap. 348-356.  aIn this study, the potential use of Pichia fermentans YC5.2 as a starter culture to conduct controlled coffee bean fermentations during on-farm wet processing was investigated. Inoculated fermentations were conducted with or without the addition of 2% (w/v) sucrose, and the resultant microbial growth and metabolism, bean chemistry and beverage quality were compared with spontaneous (control) fermentation. In both inoculated treatments, P. fermentans prevailed over indigenous microbiota and a restricted microbial composition was observed at the end of fermentation process. The inoculation also increased the production of specific volatile aroma compounds (e.g., ethanol, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate) and decreased the production of lactic acid during the fermentation process. Sucrose supplementation did not significantly interfere with the growth and frequency of P. fermentans YC5.2 inoculum but maintained high levels of wild bacteria population and lactic acid production similar to the spontaneous process. In roasted beans, the content of sugars and organic acids were statistically (p<0.05) similar for all the treatments. However, the inoculated fermentations were shown to influence the volatile fraction of roasted coffee beans by increasing the concentration of yeast-derived metabolites compared to control. Sensory analysis of coffee beverages demonstrated that the use of the YC5.2 strain was favorable for the production of high-quality coffees with distinctive characteristics, e.g., intense perception of ‘vanilla’ taste and ‘floral’ aromas. In conclusion, the use of P. fermentans YC5.2 in coffee processing was shown to be a viable alternative to control the fermentation step and to ensure consistent quality of finished products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPichia fermentans 3aacetaldehyde 3abacteria 3acoffee (beverage) 3acoffee beans 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3afermentation 3ainoculum 3alactic acid 3ametabolites 3amicrobial growth 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3asensory evaluation 3astarter cultures 3asucrose 3ataste 0aCoffee beverage 0aYeast 0aPichia fermentans 0aAroma precursors 0aPost-harvest1 aNeto, Ensei1 aThomaz-Soccol, Vanete,1 aMedeiros, Adriane Bianchi Pedroni1 aWoiciechowski, Adenise Lorenci1 aSoccol, Carlos Ricardo0 tFood research international.g2015 Sept., v. 75 p.348-356dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245006000172300001400232520117200246592002801418650003101446650001701477650001901494650001401513650001501527650001701542650000901559650001101568650001801579650002301597650002101620650002001641650001701661650001401678653001401692653001301706653002001719653001601739653002101755700003001776700002601806700002901832700002801861700002301889700002001912773010101932856008102033852000902114655001202123IND60611178620221116164002.0180830e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061117862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2017.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMâncio, Rafael Dias10aVitamin E treatment decreases muscle injury in mdx mice  ap. 39-46.  aOxidative stress, in addition to the absence of the dystrophin protein, has been considered an important regulator of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Vitamin E presents an important role as a potent antioxidant and in preserving the integrity of the cell membrane. In this study, we evaluated the effects of vitamin E therapy on some physiological pathways that can contribute to muscle injury in the diaphragm muscle of mdx mice (the experimental model of DMD) such as CK levels, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and the enzymatic antioxidant system.Mdx mice (14 d old) received 40 mg vitamin E/kg daily by oral gavage for 14 d, followed by the removal of the diaphragm muscle. Control mdx mice and C57BL/10 mice received saline only for the same period and were used as controls.Vitamin E reduced the muscle fiber damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation process in the diaphragm muscle of mdx mice.Vitamin E improves skeletal muscle injury in mdx mice, promoting membrane repair and exhibiting antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects. These vitamin E effects suggest that this antioxidant therapy may be a relevant approach for dystrophinopathies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3acell membranes 3adiaphragm 3adystrophin 3ainflammation 3amice 3amodels 3amuscle fibers 3amuscular dystrophy 3aoxidative stress 3askeletal muscle 3atherapeutics 3avitamin E 0aVitamin E 0aMdx mice 0aMembrane repair 0aAntioxidant 0aAntiinflammatory1 aHermes, Túlio de Almeida1 aMacedo, Aline Barbosa1 aMizobuti, Daniela Sayuri1 aValduga, Amanda Harduim1 aRupcic, Ian Feller1 aMinatel, Elaine0 tNutrition.g2017 Nov.,  Dec., v. 43-44 p.39-46dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2017.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009000156520127800246592002801524650001201552650002401564650001501588650001201603650002301615650002601638650001501664650000901679650000901688650001601697650001001713651001801723651001101741700001601752700001901768700001801787700001801805773012001823856007401943852000902017655001202026IND60757989720221122020411.0211125e20211121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075798972DNAL7 a10.3390/w132232962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fang 10aEffects of Arctic Warming on Microbes and Methane in Different Land Types in Svalbard  aClimate change is having a profound impact on Arctic microbiomes and their living environments. However, we have only incomplete knowledge about the seasonal and inter-annual variations observed among these microbes and about their methane regulation mechanisms with respect to glaciers, glacial melting, snow lakes and coastal marine water. This gap in our knowledge limits our understanding of the linkages between climate and environmental change. In the Arctic, there are large reservoirs of methane which are sensitive to temperature changes. If global warming intensifies, larger quantities of methane stored in deep soil and sediments will be released into the atmosphere, causing irreversible effects on the global ecosystem. Methane production is mainly mediated by microorganisms. Although we have some knowledge of microbial community structure, we know less about the methane-correlated microbes in different land types in the Svalbard archipelago, and we do not have a comprehensive grasp of the relationship between them. That is the main reason we have written this paper, in which current knowledge of microorganisms and methane-correlated types in High Arctic Svalbard is described. The problems that need to be addressed in the future are also identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3amethane 3amethane production 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3asnow 3asoil 3atemperature 3awater 3aArctic region 3aNorway1 aZhang, Han 1 aPei, Shaofeng 1 aZhan, Liyang 1 aYe, Wangwang 0 tWater.g2021 Nov. 21, v. 13, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w132232963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245005500161300001800216520123500234592002801469650001501497650001201512650001101524650001901535650001801554650001201572650001601584650000901600650002301609650002201632700001501654700005301669773013601722856008001858852000901938655001201947IND60606131920221118025152.0180724e20180405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060613192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b014052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fei10aEffects of Water on Mica–Ionic Liquid Interfaces  ap. 9035-9045.  aA growing body of work shows that water can affect the structure and properties of the ionic liquids near solid surfaces, which has rich ramifications in applications of ionic liquids such as lubrication and energy storage. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate how water affects the three-dimensional structure of ionic liquids [BMIM][Tf₂N] near mica surfaces with two different charge densities. We show that water can alter not only the layering of ions near the mica surface but also their lateral and orientation ordering and the aggregation of cations’ hydrophobic tails. Water often, but not always, weakens the structuring of interfacial ionic liquids. The multifaceted impact of water on the interfacial structure of ionic liquids can be traced back to the fact that water is both a dielectric solvent and a molecular liquid. Based on the additional observations that the adsorption of water at mica–ionic liquid interfaces is enhanced by ionic liquids and surface charge, we suggest that the structure of ionic liquids near solid surfaces is governed by the three-way coupling between the self-organization of ions, the adsorption of interfacial water, and the electrification of the solid surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acations 3aenergy 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic liquids 3aliquids 3alubrication 3amica 3amolecular dynamics 3asimulation models1 aFang, Chao1 aQiao, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5219-55300 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Apr. 05, v. 122, no. 16 p.9035-9045dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b014053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007900151245015600230500001900386520155800405592002801963650001701991650002502008650001302033650001702046650001002063650002302073650001802096650001102114650002602125650001502151650001702166650002302183650001902206653002302225653001702248653001702265653001202282653002102294653001202315700006002327700002702387700002702414700005902441700007902500773010902579856008602688852000902774655001202783IND60688787820221123041314.0200804e20200727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068878782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1093982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Hernández, Ginés Benito1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9668-145010aEffects of uv–c on bioactive compounds and quality changes during shelf life of sweet cherry grown under conventional or regulated deficit irrigation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effect of a UV–C postharvest treatment (4 kJ m–²) on physicochemical quality, phenolic contents and total antioxidant capacity of ‘Prime Giant’ sweet cherry throughout 20 d at 2 °C (simulated cold storage during transportation period) plus 5 d at 15 °C (additional shelf life period) was studied. Furthermore, the effect of two regulated deficit irrigation strategies, with 36–39 % water savings, was also studied on such quality parameters. In general, physicochemical quality at harvest (soluble solids content: 16–18 %; titratable acidity: 11.2–12.4 g L–¹) was unaffected throughout the storage periods, independently on storage time, regulated deficit irrigation or postharvest treatments. As observed from the darker red colour, cherry skin showed ≈ 9–10–fold higher phenolic contents and total antioxidant capacity than cherry flesh. Cyanidin–3–rutinoside was the major anthocyanin. Generally, phenolic compounds of cherry skin decreased during storage. However, UV–C treatment lowered such reductions, even increasing total phenolic content by 21–36 % after shelf life in fruit grown under regulated deficit irrigation. Conclusively, a UV–C pre–treatment can be considered as an excellent postharvest tool to increase sweet cherry phenolic compounds. Furthermore, a UV–C pre–treatment can be even combined with regulated deficit irrigation strategies to reduce natural resources consumption without affecting fruit quality, which is particularly interesting in Regions with scarce water availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus avium 3aantioxidant activity 3acherries 3acold storage 3acolor 3adeficit irrigation 3afruit quality 3afruits 3apostharvest treatment 3ashelf life 3astorage time 3atitratable acidity 3atransportation 0aPhenolic compounds 0aanthocyanins 0aantioxidants 0aquality 0aUV–C radiation 0adrought1 aBlanco, Víctor,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6649-31761 aBlaya-Ros, Pedro José1 aTorres-Sánchez, Roque1 aDomingo, Rafael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6432-23221 aArtés-Hernández, F.q(Francisco),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0689-73010 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 July 27, v. 269 p.109398-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1093983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001100142245009700153300001600250520109300266592002801359650003001387650001001417650001701427650001101444650002401455650001601479650002501495650001201520650001201532650001901544650001301563700001201576700001301588700001201601700001301613700001101626773012801637856007701765852000901842655001201851IND60765426020221117205208.0220904e20131220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076542602DNAL7 a10.17221/7181-vetmed2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, JS10aDiagnostic approach to malignant fibrous histiocytomas of soft tissue in dogs: a case report  ap. 621-627.  aMalignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs), newly named as &lsquo;undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas&rsquo; in 2002 by the World Health Organization, generally show an ambiguous origin. They have been described to fibroblastic or histiocytic in origin, while storiform-pleomorphic variants share a similar morphologic pattern with other sarcomas. For this reason additional diagnostic methods including immunology, ultrastructure analysis and molecular approaches are necessary for a more accurate diagnosis. We report three cases of MFH in individual dogs which presented histological characteristics of pleomorphic sarcomatoid tumours. Microscopic investigation, immunohistochemistry (vimentin, CD68, desmin, &alpha;-smooth muscle actin, and S-100) and electron microscopy were performed for diagnosis. One case was diagnosed as storiform-pleomorphic type and two were diagnosed as giant cell type MFHs. The present study demonstrates concepts of MFHs based on newly described categories and suggests useful diagnostic approaches for uncertain sarcomatoid soft tissue tumours in canines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aactin 3acase studies 3adesmin 3aelectron microscopy 3agiant cells 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amuscles 3atissues 3aultrastructure 3avimentin1 aKim, HJ1 aChoi, YM1 aKim, JW1 aPark, C.1 aDO, SH0 tVeterinární medicína.g, v. 58, no. 12 p.621-627dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21422x0375-84277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/7181-vetmed3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245013200167520121100299592002801510650001901538650001801557650001601575650001301591650001001604650001201614650001601626650001101642650001401653650001601667650002201683700002301705700002601728773012101754856008001875852000901955655001201964IND60794229120221122185612.0220922e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079422912DNAL7 a10.3390/insects130908062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMessikh, Chaïma 10aPirenzepine Binding Sites in the Brain of the Honeybee Apis mellifera: Localization and Involvement in Non-Associative Learning  aMuscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) play a central role in learning and memory in mammals as in honeybees. The results obtained in the honeybee Apis mellifera are based on the detrimental effects of the mAChR antagonists, atropine and scopolamine, on olfactory associative memory. Binding sites for the mAChR antagonist BODIPY® FL pirenzepine were localized in the brain of the honeybee forager. Pirenzepine binding sites were detected indifferently in several somata and neuropilar areas. The highest binding site densities were present in the central complex and in somata of the dorsomedial border of the antennal lobes. An additional binding pattern was found in somata of the subesophageal ganglion. By contrast, Kenyon cell (KC) somata were not stained. Pirenzepine (PZ) effects on non-associative learning were evaluated. Treated animals required more trials for the habituation of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) than controls, and the duration of the PER increased after PZ brain injection. These results suggest that the network mediating habituation of the PER involves PZ binding sites that are not necessarily present on the circuitry mediating olfactory conditioning of the PER.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aacetylcholine 3aantagonists 3aatropine 3abrain 3aganglia 3ahabituation 3amemory 3aproboscis 3ascopolamine 3aworker honey bees1 aGauthier, Monique 1 aArmengaud, Catherine 0 tInsects.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects130908063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245008300211300001600294506010400310506007600414520107700490592002801567506003701595650001101632650001101643650001901654650001201673650001501685650003201700650001201732650001601744650001701760653002201777653001101799653001501810653002701825653001901852653001901871653002601890653001501916653002201931653002901953700001901982700001702001773009902018856008502117852000902202655001202211IND60780632720221207073954.0220706e20220617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078063272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.oneear.2022.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakkaloglu, Semra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0476-192910aMethane emissions along biomethane and biogas supply chains are underestimated  ap. 724-736.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough natural gas generates lower CO₂ emissions, gas extraction, processing, and distribution all release methane, which has a greater global warming potential than CO₂. Biomethane and biogas that use organic wastes as a feedstock have emerged as alternatives to natural gas, with lower carbon and methane emissions. However, the extent to which methane is still emitted at various stages along biogas and biomethane supply chains remains unclear. Here, we adopt a Monte Carlo approach to systematically synthesize the distribution of methane emissions at each key biomethane and biogas supply chain stage using data collected from the existing literature. We show that the top 5% of emitters are responsible for 62% of emissions. Methane emissions could be more than two times of greater than previously estimated, with the digestate handling stage responsible for the majority of methane released. To ensure the climate benefits of biomethane and biogas production, effective methane-mitigation strategies must be designed and deployed at each supply chain stage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiogas 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3afeedstocks 3agas production (biological) 3amethane 3anatural gas 3asupply chain 0amethane emissions 0abiogas 0abiomethane 0asupply chain emissions 0aglobal warming 0aclimate change 0abiogas sustainability 0arenewables 0aenergy transition 0adecarbonization strategy1 aCooper, Jasmin1 aHawkes, Adam0 tOne earth.g2022 June 17, v. 5, no. 6 p.724-736dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27390x2590-33227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2022.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245014700154300001600301500001400317500002000331520179400351592002802145596007602173596007802249596009502327650002102422650002302443650001702466650001802483650001902501650003102520650001202551650001602563650001302579650001502592650001202607650001202619650002802631650001802659650001102677650001102688700001302699700001602712700001502728700001202743700001502755700001202770700001302782773014902795856007302944852000903017655001203026IND60719736320221119100115.0201205e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071973632DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.65282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Chen10aHigh‐cell‐density fermentation of Escherichia coli for expression of a recombinant phenylalanine dehydrogenase mutant and its purification  ap. 199-206.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Phenylalanine dehydrogenase (PheDH; l‐phenylalanine: NAD⁺ oxidoreductase, deaminating (EC 1.4.1.20)) is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry. It is the main biocatalyst in the enantioselective synthesis of l‐phenylalanine, related l‐amino acids as well as some non‐natural amino acids which are important pharmaceutical intermediates. However, growing demands for PheDH and its limited production result in the shortage of the enzyme's supply so that it is necessary to explore and establish an industrial production process for PheDH. RESULTS: In this study, the high‐cell‐density fermentation of recombinant Escherichia coli for expression of an engineered mutant R272M/E331Q/E196N of PheDH was investigated, which is a key catalyst with improved catalytic capability during the important intermediate production of saxagliptin. Cultivation media and induction conditions of recombinant E. coli were tested in shake flask experiments. A fed‐batch fermentation strategy using MR2 as cultivation medium and lactose as inducer was developed in a 30 L fermenter. After 24 h of cultivation, the dry cell weight reached 52.32 g L–¹ (based on OD₆₀₀), and the specific activity of crude extracts was 0.49 U mg–¹. By applying the aqueous two‐phase system strategy, a purified PheDH productivity of 191.96 mg·L⁻¹·h⁻¹ was obtained. The specific activity, recovery, yield and purification fold of PheDH were 3.21 U mg–¹, 104.19%, 84.53% and 6.55, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the application of high‐cell‐density fermentation in conjunction with aqueous two‐phase system strategy provides vital support for large‐scale production of recombinant PheDH. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI)  aPublisher supplied data  a2016‐XT00‐00023‐GXcChengdu Science and Technology Bureau project  a2017HH0011cScience and Technology Department of Sichuan Province Project  aMMLKF14‐01cState Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 3aEscherichia coli 3abatch fermentation 3abiocatalysts 3abiotechnology 3aculture flasks 3aenantioselective synthesis 3aenzymes 3aexhibitions 3aextracts 3afermenters 3alactose 3amutants 3apharmaceutical industry 3aphenylalanine 3asupply 3aweight1 aWang, Lu1 aLi, Duanhua1 aLi, Jinjun1 aGe, Yan1 aLiang, Tao1 aZhu, Yu1 aYu, Rong0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2021 Jan., v. 96, no. 1 p.199-206dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.65283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010700158520131100265592002801576650001301604650001501617650001301632650001601645650002401661651001001685700001701695700001801712773012001730856007401850852000901924655001201933IND60757989920221122020404.0211125e20211121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075798992DNAL7 a10.3390/w132232972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xuehan 10aInfluence of Filter Tube of Pumping Well on Groundwater Drawdown during Deep Foundation Pit Dewatering  aThe partial penetrating waterproof curtain combined with pumping wells is widely applied to deep foundation pit dewatering engineering. The filter tube of the pumping well plays a critical role on the environment effect that resulted from foundation pit dewatering. This paper investigated the impact of the filter tube on the groundwater drawdown outside the pit to provide a theoretical basis for the foundation pit dewatering design. Three patterns according to the relative position of the waterproof curtain and the filter tube, which are called wall-well patterns, namely the full-closed pattern, part-closed pattern, and none-closed pattern, have been analyzed. By taking a practice engineering case in Shanghai as an example, the relationship among the proportion of the filter tube length to the dewatering aquifer thickness, the buried depth difference of the wall-well, and the groundwater drawdown difference at both sides of the waterproof curtain are discussed by numerical simulation.

This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover study to evaluate the postprandial blood glucose and insulin responses of healthy adults (n = 28) after the consumption of a muffin top made with VERSAFIBE™ 2470 RS (11.6 g TDF fiber muffin top) or a control muffin top (0.9 g TDF).The muffin tops were matched for weight, total carbohydrate, sugars, protein, and fat. During each treatment period, subjects consumed a standard evening meal, fasted for 12 h, and arrived at the study clinic the following morning. Serum glucose, serum insulin, and capillary glucose were measured at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after muffin top consumption. The subjects completed a 7-d washout period between treatments.The consumption of the fiber muffin top resulted in a significant 33% reduction in postprandial serum glucose incremental area under the curve from 0 to 120 min and an 8% decrease in maximum glucose concentration versus the control muffin (P = 0.037 and P = 0.007, respectively). The fiber muffin top reduced postprandial serum insulin incremental area under the curve from 0 to 120 min by 38% compared with the control muffin top (P < 0.001), which aligns with the blood glucose data.This study demonstrated that the inclusion of a practical dose of dietary fiber (11.6 g TDF) from VERSAFIBE™ 2470 RS in a bakery product significantly reduced postprandial glucose and insulin responses in healthy adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acorn 3across-over studies 3adietary fiber 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3amuffins 3aresistant starch 0aResistant starch type 4 0aDietary fiber 0aPostprandial 0aBlood glucose 0aInsulin 0aCapillary glucose 0aGlycemic respons1 aZimmer, J.

Heavy-duty trucks (HDTs) are an important area to decarbonize, given the continuously rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this sector. Various low-carbon options have emerged, yet a comprehensive understanding of the extent to which these options can decarbonize HDT throughout the life cycle remains limited. Here, we adopt a life-cycle analysis to assess and compare the GHG mitigation potential ofhighly efficient diesel engines, battery-electrics, and hydrogen fuel cells for China’s class-8 HDTs in 2030. Results show that all three options could enable >38% life-cycle GHG reductions. The battery-electric option, however, requires well-established fast-charging infrastructures to maintain the freight-carrying capacity that will otherwise be compromised by larger batteries. Hydrogen fuel cells can attain 80% reduction when paired with low-carbon hydrogen. Hybrid strategies, including improving engine efficiency, decarbonizing power grids, optimizing freight logistics, and incentivizing behavioral changes, are necessary for the efficient and effective HDT decarbonization that is key to China achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3afreight 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen fuels 3alife cycle assessment 3apollution control 3aChina 0alife cycle assessment 0aLCA 0aheavy-duty truck 0aChina 0anet zero 0agreenhouse gases 0aGHG 0aclimate change 0abattery electric 0afuel cell 0ahydrogen 0alow-carbon fuel1 aGordillo Zavaleta, Victor1 aLi, Yang1 aSarathy, S.

The results showed that 135 of tested isolates of A. oligospora reduced the development of trichostrongylide larvae in feces by 90–99.99%, 11 isolates by 80–89.46% and 11 isolates by 14.58–78.82%. To understand their capacity of passing through gastrointestinal tract of sheep, 50 native isolates of A. oligospora were selected and assessed in sheep. Among these isolates, 16 isolates significantly reduced the number of larvae developing in the feces (P < 0.05); their percentage reduction of L3 ranged from 42.87% to 99.51% and the isolates tested were harvested in 5 g sub-samples of from sheep in each treatment group, indicating that these isolates had the capacity of preying larvae of trichostrongylides after the passage through gastrointestinal tract of sheep. The remaining isolates of A. oligospora were not able to survive after passage through gastrointestinal tract of sheep. In the following, the 16 isolates that presented more or less viability after sheep gastrointestinal passage were selected and assessed in goats. The results showed that the 11 isolates out of them could be able to pass through the digestive tract of goats without loss of ability of preying larvae of trichostrongylides in feces and their efficacies ranged from 53.88% to 94.28%, and that the isolates tested were harvested in 5 g sub-samples of feces from goats in each treatment group. In the current study, these isolates which demonstrated outstanding properties in vitro and could survive in the passage through the alimentary tract of sheep and goat should be potential candidates as a possible feed additive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrobotrys oligospora 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aTrichostrongylus colubriformis 3adigestive tract 3afeces 3afeed additives 3agastrointestinal system 3agoats 3alarvae 3asheep 3aviability 3aChina 0aNematophagous fungi 0aArthrobotrys oligospora 0aSheep 0aGoat 0aBiological control1 aWang, Feng-Hui1 aWang, Gangying,1 aLiu, Jun-Lin1 aWang, Bo-bo1 aXu, Qiang1 aXue, Yu-Jia1 aWang, Fan1 aZhang, Chao1 aFang, Wen-Xiu1 aCai, Bin1 aLiu, Yan-Qiu1 aCao, Xin1 aMa, Zhong-Ren0 tExperimental parasitology.g2017 June, v. 177 p.104-111dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2017.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014200167520158200309592002801891650004401919650002501963650001301988650003602001650001702037650002302054650001502077650001802092650001802110650002302128650001902151650002002170650003302190650002302223650001602246650001302262650003702275650003702312653001802349653003102367653002502398653002002423653001902443700001802462700002602480700002202506773012102528856008302649852000902732655001202741IND60644355320221120051801.0190624e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064435532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1011542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasheed, Tahir10aBiogenic synthesis and characterization of cobalt oxide nanoparticles for catalytic reduction of direct yellow-142 and methyl orange dyes  aThe synthesis of cobalt oxide nanoparticles (CoNPs) using plant extracts is convenient, cheap, eco-friendly, less energy-intensive, and eliminate the use of toxic materials. Naturally occurring phytoconstituents such as flavonoids and phenolics in the Taraxacum officinale (T. officinale) plant extract can act as capping and stabilizing agents during CoNPs formation process. This study presents the biogenic synthesis of CoNPs using T. officinale plant extract using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as a reducing agent. As developed T. officinale CoNPs were designated as TO-CoNPs and initially characterized using various instrumental techniques including UV–Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A broad peak at 319 nm region confirms the successful synthesis of TO-CoNPs. The optimally yielded TO-CoNPs were then employed to test their dye degradation potential against azo dyes, i.e., direct yellow-142 and methyl orange. The time-dependent degradation process was performed for 60 min, and sampling was done with each 15 min interval. As compared to the control sample (trialed in the absence of TO-CoNPs), both test sample (trialed in the presence of TO-CoNPs) showed complete degradation of direct yellow-142 and methyl orange dyes at the end of 60 min treatment cycle. In conclusion, the degradation of both azo dyes suggests that TO-CoNPs may also be exploited against other related and emerging contaminants in an eco-benign and cost-effective manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aTaraxacum officinale 3aazo dyes 3achemical constituents of plants 3acobalt oxide 3acost effectiveness 3aflavonoids 3amethyl orange 3ananoparticles 3aphenolic compounds 3aplant extracts 3areducing agents 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium borohydride 3astabilizers 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aBio-catalysis 0aCobalt oxide nanoparticles 0aTaraxacum officinale 0aBio-degradation 0aSynthetic dyes1 aNabeel, Faran1 aVēlāyutan̲, T.

The inclusion of new agents and their interests, mechanisms of governance, and motivational foundations strengthened analyses of environmental challenges and outcomes. But the revolution of environmental governance remains incomplete. To address the complex, interrelated, non-linear socio-environmental sustainability challenges threatening societies and ecosystems, we call for a shift from environmental governance to governance for sustainability. Such a shift will fundamentally change how scholarship on socio-environmental challenges analyzes causes, processes, outcomes, and proposed solutions. It will attend closely to the interlinkages between social, economic, and environmental systems and their causes, processes, and patterns of outcomes. It will recast governance from analyses of rules and institutions to a field concerned with choices and actions aimed at transformational change toward sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental governance 3aenvironmental policy 3afields 3agovernment agencies 3asociety 3astate government 3awills1 aBrandhorst, Sidney1 aJain, Meha1 aLiao, Chuan1 aPradhan, Nabin1 aSolomon, Divya0 tOne earth.g2022 June 17, v. 5, no. 6 p.615-621dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27390x2590-33227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2022.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245009700209300001600306520154200322592002801864650001201892650001201904650003001916650001501946650001201961650001901973650001501992650002902007650001902036650001102055650001802066650002902084650000902113650002302122650001202145653001802157653001902175653002402194653004302218700001502261700001602276700001502292700001702307700005402324700001702378700001602395700001902411773012702430856008802557852000902645655001202654IND60628372120221120190802.0210112e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062837212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kerou1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5648-897110aSpatial and temporal variations of N2O emissions from global forest and grassland ecosystems  ap. 129-139.  aA process-based dynamic ecosystem model of TRIPLEX-GHG was used to estimate the spatial and temporal patterns of N₂O fluxes from global forest and grassland ecosystems under the effects of global warming and elevated CO₂ concentrations. From 1992 to 2015, the estimated average N₂O emissions from forests and grasslands were 3.62 ± 0.16 Tg N yr⁻¹ and 1.40 ± 0.03 Tg N yr⁻¹, respectively. Tropical regions made large contributions (83.9% for forests and 74% for grasslands) to the total N₂O budgets, which were due to the larger N₂O flux values and large natural forest and grassland areas. The regional variations in N₂O emissions mainly resulted from the differences in the spatial distributions of climate characteristics, especially the precipitation patterns. In addition, anomalous years when N₂O emissions were relatively low/high were mainly due to the changes in climate patterns, which may have been induced by El Niño/La Niña events with different strengths and frequencies. Soil N₂O emissions from forests showed a positive effect on the atmospheric N₂O concentrations during June to November (R²: 0.14˜0.28), while those from grasslands showed a positive effect during the growing seasons (R²: 0.17˜0.28). Although natural N₂O sources (forests and grasslands in this study) showed slightly increasing trends, with 9.9 Gg N increment per year for forests and 2.1 Gg N increment per year for grasslands, they were not the main contributors to the elevated N₂O concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aglobal warming 3agrasslands 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agrowing season 3amodels 3anitrous oxide 3anitrous oxide production 3asoil 3atemporal variation 3atropics 0aNitrous oxide 0aClimate change 0aProcess-based model 0aGlobal forest and grassland ecosystems1 aZhu, Qiuan1 aLiu, Jinxun1 aWang, Meng1 aZhou, Xiaolu1 aLi, Mingxu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8325-69971 aWang, Kefeng1 aDing, Juhua1 aPeng, Changhui0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 266-267 p.129-139dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245008000159300001800239500002000257520168300277592002801960596005901988650001602047650001002063650002002073650002202093650001002115700001902125700001402144700001502158700001402173700001502187700001602202700001502218700001502233700001502248700005602263773012002319856007802439852000902517655001202526IND60747591720221119190944.0210816e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074759172DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2020002382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Huan14aThe effect of infertile semen on the mRNA‐based body fluid identification  ap. 1614-1622.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the past decade, mRNA markers have been well demonstrated as promising molecular markers in forensic body fluid identification (BFI), and successfully used in wide applications. Several studies have assessed the performance of semen‐specific mRNA markers in distinguishing semen from other common body fluids at the crime scene. Infertility has been reported as a global health problem that is affecting approximately 15% of couples worldwide. Therefore, it is important for forensic researchers to consider the impact of infertility on semen identification. This study aimed to explore the effect of semen from infertile men (hereinafter “infertile semen”) on BFI and to identify semen‐specific mRNAs that can efficiently and accurately distinguish normal and infertile semen samples from other body fluids. Results showed that the selected five mRNAs (KLK3, TGM4, SEMG1, PRM1, and PRM2) performed a significantly high semen specificity in normal semen. Moreover, KLK3 was slightly influenced by infertile semen samples with over 98% positive results in all semen samples. The accuracy to predict normal semen reached up to 96.6% using the discrimination function Y1 with KLK3 and PRM1. However, when the infertile semen samples were included in discrimination function (function Y2 with KLK3), the accuracy rate of semen identification (including the normal and infertile semen) was down to 89.5%. Besides, the sensitivity of multiplex assay could reach down to 50pg. Our results suggest that it is important to consider the presence of infertile semen when using mRNAs to identify semen samples, which would have a far‐reaching impact in forensic identification.  aPublisher supplied data  a81671870cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3abody fluids 3acrime 3aelectrophoresis 3aforensic sciences 3asemen1 aHuang, Sicheng1 aBai, Peng1 aXiao, Xiao1 aPeng, Duo1 aZhao, Huan1 aLiu, Yuqing1 aFeng, Qian1 aLiao, Miao1 aLi, Fuping1 aLiang, Weibo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8487-35750 tElectrophoresis.g2021 Aug., v. 42, no. 16 p.1614-1622dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2020002383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01663naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007100170300001600241520045800257592002800715650002600743650001700769650001900786650001800805653002400823653001900847653001700866653001100883653002200894653002500916653003200941653001600973653002400989653002601013773014501039856008401184852000901268655001201277IND60112790520221122235948.0161024e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011279052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2012.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuda, Tomoko10aRecent progress in biocatalysis using supercritical carbon dioxide  ap. 233-241.  aThe latest advances in biocatalysis using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) are reviewed.

The growth and development potential of the yellow mealworm was evaluated by using chicken feed (CF), rapeseed meal (RM), wheat bran (WB), and willowleaf sunflower (WS) to obtain inexpensive and various sources of feed. The results showed that the fastest growth with shorter larval development time (74.7 days) was found for insects fed a WB 100 diet. Regarding the final fresh weight of larvae, the highest values were found for larvae grown on WB diets. However, the lowest FCR (1.53 to 1.59) was found for larvae fed RM diets mixed with CF and on the control diet (CF 100). In most cases, it was found that byproduct diets mixed with CF improve the ECI of mealworms, thus contributing to an efficient bioconversion of byproducts into edible sources of nutrients. Thus, except for pure WS as a feed, these byproducts can be used to grow yellow mealworm larvae and may be added to the versatile list of substrates and feed used by small- and large-scale insect producers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aTenebrio molitor 3abiotransformation 3achickens 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3agrowth performance 3ainsects 3alarval development 3arapeseed meal 3awheat bran1 aKrzyżaniak, Michał,1 aStolarski, Mariusz Jerzy0 tInsects.g2022 Sept. 06, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects130908103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03483naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015900166300001600325520175300341592002802094596006002122650002402182650001902206650002202225650002202247650001402269650002402283650001302307650001402320650001902334650001202353650000902365650002502374650001602399650002602415650001302441700001502454700001902469700001902488700001802507700001602525700001802541700001702559700001802576700002202594700002302616700007602639773013402715856008302849852000902932655001202941IND60762078820221118192742.0220107e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076207882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-021-01231-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaroha, Ankit10aAgro-morphological variability and genetic diversity in linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) germplasm accessions with emphasis on flowering and maturity time  ap. 315-333.  aAssessment of genetic diversity and extent of trait variation among germplasm accessions facilitate the effective use of genetic resources for varietal development. In linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.), early maturity is desirable as it helps avoid several biotic and abiotic stress. In present study, genetic variability of 220 accessions of linseed was studied using 25 agro-morphological traits for 2 years, 2017–2018 and 2018–2019. Remarkable variability was observed for flowering, maturity and other economically important traits such as thousand seed weight, capsule number, seed, and capsule area. Based on 2-year evaluation data for flowering and maturity traits, a panel of 34 accessions was constructed to study genetic diversity using SSR markers. Total 89 alleles were amplified with a mean of 3.069 alleles per locus. Polymorphism information content value ranged from 0.20 to 0.66 with mean of 0.42. Clustering based on SSR data followed the flowering-maturity trait pattern to a large extent. Genetic population structure analysis showed two populations in similarity with the trait groups. Analysis of molecular variance revealed 16% variance among the populations. Shannon's diversity information index within population I and II were 0.67 and 0.78, respectively. Additionally, allelic variation in a putative floral homeotic gene encoding APETALA2 transcription factor was studied in two early and two late accessions by PCR amplification and sequencing. Total 12 SNPs were identified, of which six could distinguish early and late accessions. The genetic and genomic resources identified here are expected to aid in linseed genetic improvement programme targeted to specific traits, especially, early flowering and maturity.  aPublisher supplied data  aECR/2017/001280cScience and Engineering Research Board 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aabiotic stress 3aallelic variation 3aearly development 3aevolution 3agenetic improvement 3agenomics 3agermplasm 3ahomeotic genes 3alinseed 3aloci 3apopulation structure 3aseed weight 3atranscription factors 3avariance1 aPal, Deepa1 aKaur, Vikender1 aKumar, Sandeep1 aBartwal, Arti1 aAravind, J.1 aRadhamani, J.1 aRajkumar, S.1 aKumar, Rajesh1 aGomashe, Sunil S.1 aSengupta, Abhishek1 aWankhede, Dhammaprakash Pandhari1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6384-86640 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2022 Jan., v. 69, no. 1 p.315-333dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49569x0925-98647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-021-01231-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03578naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002300188245012200211300001600333520159900349592002801948650001601976650001701992650001002009650001902019650001602038650001402054650001702068650001702085650001202102650002302114650001402137650002202151650000902173650002502182650001202207650002702219650003902246650003102285650005802316650005202374650002402426650002902450650002102479650004502500650000902545650005502554700002502609700002802634700001802662700003202680700002702712773010002739856008102839990002302920852000902943655001202952IND60089846120221119130843.0141102e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008984612DNAL7 a211149622pmid7 aPMC37774032pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bcp.2010.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Mas, Mahmoud M.10aPioglitazone abrogates cyclosporine-evoked hypertension via rectifying abnormalities in vascular endothelial function  ap. 526-533.  aIn addition to insulin sensitization, the thiazolidenedione drug pioglitazone exhibits favorable circulatory effects. Here, we hypothesized that pioglitazone protects against the hypertension and related vascular derangements caused by the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine (CSA). Compared with vehicle (olive oil)-treated rats, chronic treatment with CSA (20mg/kg/day s.c., for 14 days) increased blood pressure (BP), reduced the aortic protein expression of phosphorylated eNOS (p-eNOS), and impaired responsiveness of isolated aortas to endothelium-dependent vasorelaxations induced by carbachol. The effects of CSA on BP, aortic p-eNOS, and carbachol relaxations were abolished upon concurrent administration of pioglitazone (2.5mg/kg/day). Serum levels of adiponectin, an adipose tissue-derived adipokine, were not altered by CSA but showed significant elevations in rats treated with pioglitazone or pioglitazone plus CSA. The possibility that alterations in the antioxidant and/or lipid profile contributed to the CSA-pioglitazone BP interaction was investigated. Pioglitazone abrogated the oxidative (aortic superoxide dismutase), lipid peroxidation (aortic malondialdyde), and dyslipidemic (serum LDL levels and LDL/HDL ratio) effects of CSA. Histologically, CSA caused focal disruption in the endothelial lining of the aorta and this effect disappeared in rats co-treated with pioglitazone. Collectively, pioglitazone abrogates the hypertensive effect of CSA via ameliorating detrimental changes in vascular endothelial NOS/NO pathway and oxidative and lipid profiles caused by CSA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3aantioxidants 3aaorta 3ablood pressure 3ablood serum 3acarbachol 3acyclosporine 3ahypertension 3ainsulin 3alipid peroxidation 3aolive oil 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxanalysis 2aAortaxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aCyclosporinexpharmacology 2aEndothelium, Vascularxdrug effectsxphysiopathology. 2aHypertensionxchemically inducedxdrug therapy. 2aHypoglycemic Agents 2aImmunosuppressive Agents 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type IIIxanalysis 2aRats 2aThiazolidinedionesxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use.1 aEl-Gowelli, Hanan M.1 aAbd-Elrahman, Khaled S.1 aSaad, Evan I.1 aAbdel-Galil, Abdel-Galil A.1 aAbdel-Rahman, Abdel A.0 tBiochemical pharmacology.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 81, no. 4 p.526-533dElsevier Inc.x0006-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2010.11.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245011600177300001600293520127300309592002801582650001601610650002301626650001801649650001301667650001501680650002101695650001301716650002301729650001601752650001901768650002001787653001701807653003201824653002901856653002001885653004301905700001501948700002201963773012601985856008802111852000902199655001202208IND60628372320221120190648.0190326e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062837232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaruyama, Toshisuke10aAbnormal data rejection range in the Bowen ratio and inverse analysis methods for estimating evapotranspiration  ap. 323-334.  aFirst, this paper proposes a definition of the abnormal data that occur as the Bowen ratio (B0) approaches −1. The data are defined as α times of the heat flux supply (Rn-G), thus indicating the rejection range for the B0. The method is applied to observed data. Second, we compare the results of the B0 method with those of the inverse analysis of Bowen ratio method (IABM). The IABM can estimate the sensible and latent heat flux using temperature and humidity observed at a single height above the ground by optimization. Third, the estimation of the monthly evapotranspiration required for water resources and irrigation planning is adequate for α = 1˜3 in the B0 method and IABM, and the initial humidity for IABM is adequate for 80% of the observed humidity plus 20%. Fourth, the features of the analysis of both methods regarding the direction of latent heat flux (lE) and sensible heat flux (H) associated with temperature difference (ΔT) and vapor pressure (Δe) clarified. And we found that the number of the rejected data in hourly and monthly is remarkably large in B0 method than IABM. Based on above results, the IABM has almost the same performance compared with the B0 method excluding initial value determination in the optimization process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBowen ratio 3aevapotranspiration 3aheat transfer 3ahumidity 3airrigation 3alatent heat flux 3aplanning 3asensible heat flux 3atemperature 3avapor pressure 3awater resources 0aHeat balance 0aBowen ratio’s singularity 0aBowen ratio optimization 0aRejection range 0aSingle-height temperature and humidity1 aIto, Kouzo1 aTakimoto, Hiroshi0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2019 May 15, v. 269-270 p.323-334dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245013500205300001800340500002000358520171300378592002802091650001202119650001902131650003402150650001902184650002002203650002002223650001902243650001102262650001702273700002402290700002102314700001902335773012002354856007802474852000902552655001202561IND60747591920221119190925.0210816e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074759192DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2021000302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmer Cid, Íngrid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0486-121710aMeasurement of the amplitude and phase of the electrophoretic and electroosmotic mobility based on fast single‐particle tracking  ap. 1623-1635.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe electrophoretic mobility of micron‐scale particles is of crucial importance in applications related to pharmacy, electronic ink displays, printing, and food technology as well as in fundamental studies in these fields. Particle mobility measurements are often limited in accuracy because they are based on ensemble averages and because a correction for electroosmosis needs to be made based on a model. Single‐particle approaches are better suited for examining polydisperse samples, but existing implementations either require multiple measurements to take the effect of electroosmosis into account or are limited in accuracy by short measurement times. In this work, accurate characterization of monodisperse and polydisperse samples is achieved by measuring the electrophoretic mobility on a particle‐to‐particle basis while suppressing electroosmosis. Electroosmosis can be suppressed by measuring in the middle of a microchannel while applying an AC voltage with a sufficiently high frequency. An accurate measurement of the electrophoretic mobility is obtained by analyzing the oscillating particle motion for 1.5s per particle with a high‐speed camera measuring at 850Hz, synchronized to the applied electric field. Attention is paid to take into account the effect of the rolling shutter and the non‐uniform sampling in order to obtain the accurate amplitude and phase of the electrophoretic mobility. The accuracy of method is experimentally verified and compared with a commercial apparatus for polystyrene microspheres in water. The method is further demonstrated on a range of particle materials and particle sizes and for a mixture of positively and negatively charged particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3aelectric field 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectroosmosis 3aelectrophoresis 3afood technology 3amicroparticles 3amodels 3apolystyrenes1 aUssembayev, Yera Ye1 aNeyts, Kristiaan1 aStrubbe, Filip0 tElectrophoresis.g2021 Aug., v. 42, no. 16 p.1623-1635dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2021000303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245018100156300001600337500001400353500002000367520171500387592002802102596005502130596004102185650002402226650001202250650001802262650001402280650002302294650002602317650001202343650001302355650002602368650001202394650001302406650001702419650001902436650001202455650001602467650001102483700001102494700005402505773014902559856007302708852000902781655001202790IND60719736720221119100301.0201205e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071973672DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.65222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chenyu10aUsing taurine to increase mesopores in Ce‐based metal–organic framework for enhancing the production of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural and 5‐ethoxymethylfurfural from fructose  ap. 163-171.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 5‐ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) are biomass‐based value‐added chemicals. Various catalytic systems have been studied for converting fructose into HMF and EMF. A more efficient and stable solid acid catalyst is highly desirable for the conversion process. RESULTS: In this study, a novel taurine‐involved Ce metal organic framework material (T‐CeMOF) was synthesized by coordinating Ce to 1,3,5‐benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) in the presence of taurine. T‐CeMOF was analyzed with Fourier‐transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscoy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis. Results showed that the presence of taurine makes T‐CeMOF have a much larger specific pore volume than Ce based metal‐organic framwork (CeMOF), which was synthesized by coordinating Ce with the ligand BTC in absence of taurine. It is implied that T‐CeMOF has many more swinging carboxyl groups on the surface than CeMOF. In addition, the sulfonic acid group of taurine is introduced into T‐CeMOF. All of these contribute toward making sure that T‐CeMOF is effective for the conversion of fructose to HMF and EMF in ethanol. Under the catalysis of T‐CeMOF, the total yield of HMF and EMF reached 78.4% within 1 h. T‐CeMOF could be recycled and the catalytic activity of the catalyst was maintained after five cycles. CONCLUSION: T‐CeMOF can be synthesized at room temperature and it achieved a high total yield of HMF and EMF in ethanol within 1 h. T‐CeMOF opens a new route for one‐pot conversion of abundant and cheap fructose‐based biomass into promising biochemicals. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI)  aPublisher supplied data  a21476023cthe National Science Foundation of China  cNational Science Foundation of China 3aambient temperature 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoordination polymers 3aethanol 3afructose 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3aligands 3anitrogen 3aspectroscopy 3asulfonic acids 3ataurine 3avalue added 3avolume1 aLi, Ke1 aJi, Peijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1994-16390 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2021 Jan., v. 96, no. 1 p.163-171dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.65223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012300159520208600282592002802368650002302396650001202419650001302431650002402444650001002468650001302478650002302491650001102514650002602525650001302551650001902564650001602583650001402599650001202613650001302625650001002638700002202648700002002670773012002690856007402810852000902884655001202893IND60757990320221121042732.0211125e20211122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075799032DNAL7 a10.3390/w132233002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeff, Alexis N.10aPassive Treatment for Acid Mine Drainage Partially Restores Microbial Community Structure in Different Stream Habitats  aThe assessment of the degree to which biological communities in streams impaired by acid mine drainage (AMD) are restored by passive treatment has focused primarily on eukaryotic-cell organisms and microbial processes. The responses of microbial community structure to passive treatment have received much less attention, even though functional processes such as nutrient cycling and organic matter decomposition depend on taxonomic composition. Our objective was to determine the degree to which passive treatment restored microbial communities in three types of habitats: aqueous, leaf, and sediment. To assess their recovery, we compared the community composition in these habitats based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing at three different stream sites: an untreated AMD site (U), a remediated site below AMD passive treatment (T), and an unimpaired reference site (R). The acidity, conductivity, and soluble metal concentrations at T were found to be elevated compared to R, but generally 1–2 orders of magnitude less than at U. Microbial community composition was found to be synergistically affected by habitat type and AMD impact, with the similarity among communities in the three habitats increasing with the severity of the AMD. Sediment- and leaf-associated microbial communities at U were characterized by taxa that are tolerant to severe AMD. The absence of the nitrogen oxidizing bacterium Nitrospira in sediment communities at T and U was found to correspond to higher NH₄⁺ concentrations compared to R, possibly because of the presence of iron oxyhydroxide precipitate. In contrast, the microbial composition was found to be similar between the T and R sites for both aqueous and leaf communities, indicating that passive treatment was more able to restore these communities to the reference condition than sediment communities. The remediation of AMD streams should consider the habitat-specific responses of microbial community composition and be guided by future studies that empirically couple changes in taxonomic composition to measured functional processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3aacidity 3abacteria 3acommunity structure 3agenes 3ahabitats 3airon oxyhydroxides 3aleaves 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aremediation 3asediments 3astreams 3ataxonomy 3awater1 aDeNicola, Dean M.1 aMaltman, Chris 0 tWater.g2021 Nov. 22, v. 13, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w132233003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245012400169300001400293520133900307592002801646650003001674650001301704650001601717650001501733650001201748650002101760650001401781650001701795650002501812650001601837650001401853700001401867700002001881700002401901700002901925700002601954773013301980856007502113852000902188655001202197IND60765426520221117205207.0220714e20140112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076542652DNAL7 a10.17221/7189-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalgado-Hernández, E.G.10aMetabolites of vitamin D and minerals in blood and colostrum of primiparous and multiparous dairy cows postpartum&nbsp;  ap. 11-18.  aConcentrations of calcidiol, calcitriol, and minerals in blood serum and colostrum of 14 primiparous and 16 multiparous Holstein dairy cows during short-period prepartum and postpartum were determined and compared. Blood samples were collected between days 5 and 2 prepartum and 6 h, 12 h, 7 and 21 days postpartum. Nearly 66% of primiparous and 71% of multiparous cows had subclinical postpartum hypocalcemia. Prepartum serum calcium (Ca) and inorganic phosphorus (P) were higher in primiparous cows; Ca decreased in both groups at 6 and 12 h and returned to baseline values 7 days postpartum. Calcidiol and calcitriol concentrations were equal on day 5 prepartum in both groups. In multiparous cows, calcidiol and calcitriol concentration increased at 6 h postpartum and remained elevated at 12 h postpartum; there were no changes in primiparous cows for these analytes. The total secretion of Ca in the colostrum from the first milking was similar in both groups and positively correlated with serum Ca at 6 and 12 h after calving. It is concluded that postpartum increases in the calcidiol and calcitriol concentration were a normal response to the decrease of serum calcium concentration only in multiparous cows. The total Ca secretion in the colostrum of the first milking postpartum does not reflect the grade of hypocalcemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3aHolstein 3ablood serum 3acalcitriol 3acalcium 3achemical species 3acolostrum 3ahypocalcemia 3ainorganic phosphorus 3ametabolites 3asecretion1 aBouda, J.1 aVilla-Godoy, A.1 aRomano-Muñoz, J.L.1 aGutiérrez-Chávez, A.J.1 aVelásquez-Forero, F.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 59, no. 1 p.11-18dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/7189-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010700167300001400274520134800288592002801636650002001664650001301684650002001697650002501717650002401742650001401766650001801780650003401798650001701832650003001849650002301879650001501902650002401917650001601941653003101957653002301988653001002011653001702021653000802038653001702046700002202063700002302085700002502108700002302133700001902156700002202175700002002197700001902217773009202236856008102328852000902409655001202418IND60611179120221116163919.0180830e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061117912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2018.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShivappa, Nitin10aAssociation between dietary inflammatory index and Hodgkin's lymphoma in an Italian case-control study  ap. 43-48.  aThe components of a diet can modulate inflammation and may have an effect on the development of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). Little is known about the inflammatory potential of diet in relation to HL.Data from an Italian multicenter case-control study that was conducted between 1992 and 2008 were used to estimate the relation between a dietary inflammatory index (DII®) and the risk of HL. The data included 179 cases with incident, histologically confirmed HL and 186 control cases who were hospitalized for acute non-neoplastic diseases. The DII was computed on the basis of a validated, 78-item, food-frequency questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios that were adjusted for age, sex, total energy intake, center, body mass index, years of education, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption.No significant association was observed between an increasing DII and the risk of HL when used either as a continuous or categorical variable. The multivariate odds ratio for the highest versus the lowest DII tertile was 1.20 (95% confidence interval: 0.71–2.04). Similarly, no positive association was observed when analyses were carried out by different strata of selected covariates.These results do not support the hypothesis that the inflammatory potential of a diet plays a major role in the development of HL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHodgkin disease 3aalcohols 3abody mass index 3acase-control studies 3aconfidence interval 3aeducation 3aenergy intake 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ainflammation 3anutrition risk assessment 3anutritional status 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3atobacco use 0aDietary inflammatory index 0aHodgkin's lymphoma 0aItaly 0aCase-control 0aFFQ 0aMulti-center1 aHebert, James R.,1 aTaborelli, Martina1 aZucchetto, Antonella1 aMontella, Maurizio1 aLibra, Massimo1 aLa Vecchia, Carlo1 aSerraino, Diego1 aPolesel, Jerry0 tNutrition.g2018 Sept., v. 53 p.43-48dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2018.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006800153245009500221300001600316520107100332592002801403650002101431650001201452650001501464650002601479650001501505650001501520650001401535651001101549653001701560653001901577653001801596700007101614700002501685700003601710700003201746700002901778700002501807700002701832773012701859856008801986852000902074655001202083IND60628372420221120175918.0210112e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062837242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEugenio, Fernando Coelho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1148-116710aCausal, temporal and spatial statistics of wildfires in areas of planted forests in Brazil  ap. 157-172.  aWildfires are the result of a complex interaction between climate, vegetation, topography and socioeconomic factors (BEDIA et al., 2012). The present study aims at analyzing how the relations between the meteorological and physical variables of the terrain correlate with the parameters of occurrence of wildfires in areas of planted forests in Brazil. The analysis of the wildfire regime in the study area was divided into three important aspects: temporal, spatial and causal. There are two periods of wildfire occurrence in the studied area, and for the first season, subzone 1 is from December to March; for the subzone 2 is from January to March; and, for subzone 3, is in the months of January and February. The second season, for all subzones, is between the months of August and October. Most climatic variables, isolated, do not present a direct relation with the occurrence of wildfires for both subzones, excepting some variables in some subzones. Considering both subzones, approximately 80% of the fires analyzed correspond to areas smaller than 4 ha.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3aforests 3alandscapes 3asocioeconomic factors 3astatistics 3atopography 3awildfires 3aBrazil 0aForest fires 0aGeotechnologys 0aGeostatistics1 aSantos, Alexandre Rosa dos,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2617-94511 aPedra, Beatriz Duguy1 aMacedo Pezzopane, José Eduardo1 aMafia, Reginaldo Gonçalves1 aLoureiro, Edmilson Bitti1 aMartins, Lima Deleon1 aSaito, Nathália Suemi0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 266-267 p.157-172dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03640naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245020000184300001600384520178900400592002802189650003302217650001602250650001302266650001602279650001002295650001102305650001702316650001802333650001802351650001702369650002002386650002902406650002602435650004602461650003002507650001402537650001102551650004202562650002502604650002402629650002602653650002802679650004202707650004602749700001602795700002002811700003002831773010002861856008102961990002303042852000903065655001203074IND60089846220221119130930.0141102e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008984622DNAL7 a211465042pmid7 a10.1016/j.bcp.2010.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarroso, Emma14aThe peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ (PPARβ/δ) agonist GW501516 prevents TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in human HaCaT cells by reducing p65 acetylation through AMPK and SIRT1  ap. 534-543.  aNuclear factor (NF)-κB is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor controlling the expression of numerous genes involved in inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) β/δ prevented TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in human HaCaT keratinocytes and, if so, to determine the mechanism involved. The PPARβ/δ agonist GW501516 inhibited the increase caused by TNF-α in the mRNA levels of the NF-κB target genes interleukin 8 (IL-8), TNF-α and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Likewise, GW501516 prevented the increase in NF-κB DNA-binding activity observed in cells exposed to TNF-α. The reduction in NF-κB activity following GW501516 treatment in cells stimulated with TNF-α did not involve either increased IκBα protein levels or a reduction in the translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. In contrast, GW501516 treatment decreased TNF-α-induced p65 acetylation. Acetylation of p65 is mainly regulated by p300, a transcriptional co-activator that binds to and acetylates p65. Of note, AMP kinase (AMPK) activation phosphorylates p300 and reduces its binding to p65. GW501516 increased AMPK phosphorylation and the subsequent p300 phosphorylation, leading to a marked reduction in the association between p65 and this transcriptional co-activator. In addition, treatment with the PPARβ/δ agonist increased SIRT1 protein levels. Finally, the reduction in IL-8 mRNA levels following GW501516 treatment in TNF-α-stimulated cells was abolished in the presence of the PPARβ/δ antagonist GSK0660, the AMPK inhibitor compound C and the SIRT1 inhibitor sirtinol, indicating that the effects of GW501516 on NF-κB activity were dependent on PPARβ/δ, AMPK and SIRT1, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aacetylation 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-8 3akeratinocytes 3apharmacology 3aphosphorylation 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 2aAMP-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aAcetylationxdrug effects 2aCell Line 2aHumans 2aNF-kappa Bxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPPAR deltaxagonists 2aPPAR-betaxagonists 2aSirtuin 1xmetabolism 2aThiazolesxpharmacology 2aTranscription Factor RelAxmetabolism 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxpharmacology1 aEyre, Elena1 aPalomer, Xavier1 aVázquez-Carrera, Manuel,0 tBiochemical pharmacology.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 81, no. 4 p.534-543dElsevier Inc.x0006-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2010.12.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011800167300001800285520163300303592002801936650001501964650002101979650001502000650002202015650002802037650001302065650001002078650001302088650001502101650001102116650001402127650001502141650002602156650001902182700001502201700001802216700002502234700002202259773011002281856008602391852000902477655001202486IND60530458420221121195158.0160721e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053045842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b047152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Sze-yin10aImpact of Adsorption on Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy Voltammetry and Implications for Nanogap Measurements  ap. 3272-3280.  aScanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is a powerful tool that enables quantitative measurements of fast electron transfer (ET) kinetics when coupled with modeling predictions from finite-element simulations. However, the advent of nanoscale and nanogap electrode geometries that have an intrinsically high surface area-to-solution volume ratio realizes the need for more rigorous data analysis procedures, as surface effects such as adsorption may play an important role. The oxidation of ferrocenylmethyl trimethylammonium (FcTMA⁺) at highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) is used as a model system to demonstrate the effects of reversible reactant adsorption on the SECM response. Furthermore, the adsorption of FcTMA²⁺ species onto glass, which is often used to encapsulate ultramicroelectrodes employed in SECM, is also found to be important and affects the voltammetric tip response in a nanogap geometry. If a researcher is unaware of such effects (which may not be readily apparent in slow to moderate scan voltammetry) and analyzes SECM data assuming simple ET kinetics at the substrate and an inert insulator support around the tip, the result is the incorrect assignment of tip–substrate heights, kinetics, and thermodynamic parameters. Thus, SECM kinetic measurements, particularly in a nanogap configuration where the ET kinetics are often very fast (only just distinguishable from reversible), require that such effects are fully characterized. This is possible by expanding the number of experimental variables, including the voltammetric scan rate and concentration of redox species, among others.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3afinite element analysis 3ageometry 3aglass 3agraphene 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aprediction 3aquantitative analysis 3athermodynamics1 aZhang, Jie1 aBond, Alan M.1 aMacpherson, Julie

If these altered abiotic factors and species interactions occur as discrete events in time, such complications may occur because of the events’ relative timing. One such discrete abiotic factor is the short-duration, large magnitude increase in temperature called a heat shock. This study investigates how the timing of heat shocks affects the successful attack and reproduction of a parasitoid wasp (Aphidius ervi) attacking its host, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum). We tested three relative timings: 1) heat shock before the wasp attacks hosts, 2) heat shock while the wasp is foraging, and 3) heat shock after the wasp has attacked hosts. In each scenario we compared wasp mummy production (pupal stage) with and without a heat shock. Our results showed that a heat shock had the largest effect when it occurred while wasps actively foraged, with fewer mummies produced when exposed to a heat shock compared to the no heat shock control. Follow-up behavioral tests suggest this was caused by wasps becoming inactive during heat shocks. In contrast, when heat shocks were applied three days before or after foraging, we found no difference in mummy production between the heat shock treatment and no heat shock control. These results show the potential importance of timing when considering the ramifications of an altered abiotic factor, especially with relatively discrete abiotic events and interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUniversity of Notre Damedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000081090 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3aAphidius ervi 3aenvironmental factors 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aparasitic wasps 3apupae 3areproduction 3atemperature 3awasps 0aExtreme heat 0aFecundity 0aParasitoid wasp1 aKral-O’Brien, Katherine1 aKopco, James1 aHarmon, Jason P.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2020 May, v. 90 p.102596-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.1025963Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245010200193300001400295500001400309500002000323520169900343592002802042596004202070596004002112650001702152650002302169650002102192650001802213650002702231650001402258650001502272650001702287650001302304650001602317650001502333650000902348650001402357650001402371650000902385650001502394650001002409700001802419773014702437856007302584852000902657655001202666IND60719736820221119100524.0201205e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071973682DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.65442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUre, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8346-286214aThe removal of inorganic phosphate from water using carboxymethyl cellulose‐iron hydrogel beads  ap. 38-47.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Inorganic phosphate (Pᵢ) is key to improved crop yields; however, agricultural drainage leads to the accumulation of this nutrient in aquatic ecosystems and promotes the formation of harmful algal blooms. The aim of this study was to produce a hydrogel with high binding capacity and affinity towards Pᵢ produced from carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and iron (III) chloride (FeCl₃). RESULTS: CMC was converted to CMC‐Fe composites by incubation with FeCl₃. The half‐lives (t₁/₂) of CMC functionalization with 25 mmol L⁻¹ FeCl₃ were 11.56 min (1.5% CMC) and 13.91 min (3.0% CMC). The apparent dissociation constants (KD Aₚₚ) of CMC‐Fe were estimated to be 33.99 μmol L⁻¹ (1.5% CMCFe) and 24.81 μmol L⁻¹ (3.0% CMC‐Fe). The phosphate binding capacity (PBC) of the hydrated hydrogels were 74.0 ± 3.06 mg g⁻¹ (1.5% CMCFe) and 91.4 ± 4.51 mg g⁻¹ (3.0% CMC‐Fe). Laboratory‐scale continuous flow filtration studies showed an average removal of 91.3% (mixed filter) and 52.5% (unmixed filter). Batch type treatment of agricultural drainage showed a reduction in Pᵢ content from 0.40 to 0.11 mg L⁻¹ (1.5% CMC‐Fe) and 0.17 mg L⁻¹ (3.0% CMC‐Fe). The amount of bound‐Pᵢ was 26.7 ± 0.63 μg g⁻¹ (1.5% CMC‐Fe) and 32.8 ± 1.31 μg g⁻¹ (3.0% CMC‐Fe). The iron leached from 1.5% and 3.0% CMC‐Fe beads was 11.98 ± 1.80 and 3.57 ± 1.63 mg g⁻¹, respectively. CONCLUSION: The CMC‐Fe hydrogel shows great promise as a Pᵢ‐adsorbing material with applications in the treatment of agricultural drainage. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI)  aPublisher supplied data  cBruce Peninsula Biosphere Association  cEssex Region Conservation Authority 3aalgal blooms 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abinding capacity 3abiotechnology 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3achlorides 3acrop yield 3adissociation 3adrainage 3aexhibitions 3afiltration 3aflow 3ahalf life 3ahydrogels 3airon 3aphosphates 3awater1 aMutus, Bulent0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2021 Jan., v. 96, no. 1 p.38-47dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.65443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03908naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100008100152245012000233500001900353520206000372592002802432650002002460650001702480650002102497650001602518650001902534650001702553650002602570650000902596650001602605650001302621650001102634650002802645650000702673650001402680650002202694650002102716650001902737650001102756653001502767653001402782653001902796653002202815653001702837653001302854700006002867700007502927700002303002700003903025700003603064700002903100773010503129856008703234852000903321655001203330IND60688788520221122065148.0200601e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068878852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.1025932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaçanha, Débora Andréa Evangelista1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0917-154610aAre locally adapted goats able to recover homeothermy, acid-base and electrolyte equilibrium in a semi-arid region?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the thermoregulatory responses, acid-basic and electrolytic equilibrium of locally adapted goats under natural heat conditions in a semi-arid region. Ten (10) Canindé goats aged between 2 and 3 years, non-lactating, non-pregnant and having a body weight (BW) of 22.90 ± 2.70 kg were used in this study. Air temperature (AT) and relative humidity (RH) were measured, and the radiant heat load (RHL) was subsequently calculated. Rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR), sweating rate (SR) and heat shock (S) were recorded at 1-h intervals for 24 continuous hours. Hydrogen potential (pH), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO₂), partial pressure of oxygen (PO₂), bicarbonate (HCO₃), base excess (BE), total carbon dioxide concentration (TCO₂), oxygen saturation (SO₂), sodium (Na⁺) and potassium (K⁺) were recorded at three moments during the day (5 a.m.; 1 p.m.; 6 p.m.). There were also significant differences between the means of hours of the day for AT and RH. RR was the thermoregulatory response which most closely followed RHL, with important elevations in the periods between 10 a.m. to noon. It was observed that the goats activated their SR mechanism before RR, more precisely between the hours of 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. The acid-base and electrolytic equilibrium for the goats which showed great association with the first components contributed the most to the total variation of the data. The most important variables in the adaptive profile of these animals in order of importance were: SO₂, PO₂, RR, RT, SR, HCO₃, BE, TCO₂ and pH. An association between all variables grouped in each period was observed, where the thermoregulatory responses in the periods of 5 a.m. and 6 p.m. were closer than when compared to 1 p.m., showing a physiological return to the initial state. Therefore, the variation in thermoregulatory responses, acid-base and electrolytic equilibrium indicated that the goats have the ability to recover after a challenging environmental condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abicarbonates 3abody temperature 3abody weight 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectrolytes 3aenvironmental factors 3aheat 3aheat stress 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3aoxygen partial pressure 3apH 3apotassium 3arelative humidity 3arespiratory rate 3asemiarid zones 3asodium 0aAdaptation 0aBlood gas 0aCanindé goats 0aDaily rhythmicity 0aMultivariate 0aAnalysis1 aFerreira, Josiel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5927-05451 aSilveira, Robson Mateus Freitas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2285-96951 aNunes, Talyta Lins1 ade Oliveira, Maria Gláucia Carlos1 ade Sousa, José Ernandes Rufino1 ade Paula, Valéria Veras0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2020 May, v. 90 p.102593-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.1025933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012800169300001400297520137300311592002801684650001901712650002001731650002301751650002001774650001301794650002001807650001601827650001301843650001001856650001301866650001601879650000901895650004201904650001801946650002001964653002001984653001202004653002702016653002202043700001302065700002002078700001202098700001802110700002002128700001802148700001502166773009002181856008502271852000902356655001202365IND60567957320221120161047.0170709e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056795732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2017.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Zuoyong10aChanges of cecal microflora in chickens following Eimeria tenella challenge and regulating effect of coated sodium butyrate  ap. 73-81.  aEimeria tenella, one of the most important parasitic protozoa in the genus Eimeria, is responsible for chicken caecal coccidiosis resulting in huge economic losses to poultry industry. The present study investigated the changes in caecal microflora of E. tenella-infected chickens and the regulating effect of coated sodium butyrate, a potential alternative to antibiotics. Using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA V3-V4 region of bacteria we found significant changes in caecal microflora of E. tenella-infected chickens indicated by an increase of Firmicutes (mainly Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and vadin BB60) and Proteobacteria (mainly Enterobacteriaceae) and a decrease of Bacteroidetes (predominantly Bacteroidaceae). Inclusion of coated sodium butyrate in the diet of chickens per se had no significant effect on caecal microflora of normal healthy chickens but significantly prevented the increase in Firmicute abundance and decrease of Bacteroidetes abundance in E. tenella-infected birds. No significant changes to caecal microflora were observed at the phylum level between control and E. tenella-infected birds given coated sodium butyrate. In conclusion, our results show that coated sodium butyrate can balance the disorders of cecal microflora caused by E. tenella; thus, it can be a useful supplement for the control of avian coccidiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidaceae 3aEimeria tenella 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aLachnospiraceae 3aProtozoa 3aRuminococcaceae 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3acecum 3achickens 3acoccidiosis 3adiet 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aribosomal RNA 3asodium butyrate 0aEimeria tenella 0aChicken 0aCoated sodium butyrate 0aCaecal microflora1 aNie, Kui1 aHuang, Qingzhou1 aLi, Kai1 aSun, Yingying1 aZhou, Rongqiong1 aWang, Zhiying1 aHu, Shijun0 tExperimental parasitology.g2017 June, v. 177 p.73-81dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2017.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245012600170300001800296500002000314520146800334592002801802650001901830650002701849650002701876650002101903650001001924650002601934650002701960650002901987650002002016650001102036650001202047650002202059650001302081650001302094650002102107650002502128650002402153650002802177650002102205650002102226650000902247650002102256700001902277700002102296700001702317700002002334773013002354856007302484852000902557655001202566IND60571401420221122223359.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057140142DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.79832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrameda‐Medina, Yurena10aZn‐biofortification enhanced nitrogen metabolism and photorespiration process in green leafy vegetable Lactuca sativa L  ap. 1828-1836.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Excessive rates of nitrogen (N) fertilizers may result in elevated concentrations of nitrate (NO₃ ⁻) in plants. Considering that many programs of biofortification with trace elements are being performed, it has become important to study how the application of these elements affects plant physiology and, particularly, N utilization in leaf crops. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether the NO₃ ⁻ accumulation and the nitrogen use efficiency was affected by the application of different doses of Zn in Lactuca sativa plants. RESULTS: Zn doses in the range 80–100 µmol L⁻¹ produced an increase in Zn concentration provoking a decrease of NO₃ ⁻ concentration and increase of the nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, as well as the photorespiration processes. As result, we observed an increase in reduced N, total N concentration and N utilization efficiency. Consequently, at a dose of 80 µmol L⁻¹ of Zn, the amino acid concentration increased significantly. CONCLUSION: Adequate Zn fertilization is an important critical player in lettuce, especially at a dose of 80 µmol L⁻¹ of Zn, because it could result in an increase in the Zn concentration, a reduction of NO₃ ⁻ levels and an increase the concentration of essential amino acids, with all of them having beneficial properties for the human diet. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3aamino acid composition 3aaspartate transaminase 3abiofortification 3acrops 3aessential amino acids 3afertilizer application 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3ahuman nutrition 3aleaves 3alettuce 3anitrate reductase 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrogen metabolism 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphotorespiration 3aplant physiology 3azinc 3azinc fertilizers1 aLentini, Marco1 aEsposito, Sergio1 aRuiz, Juan M1 aBlasco, Begoña0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2017 Apr., v. 97, no. 6 p.1828-1836dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.79833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245015300174300001200327520193100339592002802270650002002298650002602318650001402344650001002358650002102368650002202389650001802411650002902429650001302458650002502471650001802496650002802514650001502542650001802557650001502575650002302590650001602613653001302629653000902642653000902651653000902660653002402669653000902693700006102702700002602763700002102789700002302810700002802833700002402861773009202885856008702977852000903064655001203073IND60567957420221120160928.0190206e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056795742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.04.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrena, Iskander10aSoil water content modulates the effect of the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) on nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria  ap. 1-8.  aIn the last decades, intensive agriculture management and the application of nitrogen fertilizer have led to high nitrogen losses to the environment. Among these losses is the soil emission of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) which is mainly produced by the soil microbial processes of nitrification and denitrification. The use of nitrification inhibitors with ammonium based fertilizers can be an efficient mitigation strategy to decrease these nitrogen losses. Soil water content and temperature are major factors controlling N2O production and, so, also the efficiency of the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) to reduce these emissions. In this work we study the effect of soil water content and temperature on the abundance of soil bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria, and on the performance of DMPP modulating these different bacterial populations responsible for N2O production/consumption. The effect of DMPP on the abundance of the different bacterial populations was dependent on soil water content. Under 40% of soil water filled pore space (WFPS), the application of DMPP caused an expected decrease of the target amoA gene abundance while narG, nirK and nosZ gene abundances also decreased probably due to an indirect effect induced by the lack of substrate for denitrifiers. Under 80% of WFPS, while the application of DMPP did not induce any change in the amoA gene abundance, an unexpected increase in non-target denitrifying gene abundances (narG, nirK and nosZ) was observed at either 10°C or 20°C incubation temperatures. This finding opens a new gate of research in the use of DMPP, where nitrous oxide reductase enzyme gene (nosZ) abundance and expression should be studied in the future in order to better understand the performance of DMPP not only inhibiting nitrification, but also affecting the non-target denitrification process.  aPublisher supplied data 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying bacteria 3aemissions 3agenes 3agreenhouse gases 3aintensive farming 3anitrification 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3anitrous-oxide reductase 3aphosphates 3asoil bacteria 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atemperature 0a16S rRNA 0aamoA 0anarG 0anirK 0aNitrous oxide (N2O) 0anosZ1 aMenéndez, Sergio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2245-90881 aCorrea-Galeote, David1 aVega-Mas, Izargi1 aBedmar, Eulogio J.1 aGonzález-Murua, Carmen1 aEstavillo, José M.0 tGeoderma.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 303 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.04.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008500167500001900252520147500271592002801746650001101774650002601785650001601811650001501827650001001842650001401852650001201866650001001878653002101888653002101909653002501930653000801955653000801963653000801971700002001979700002101999773009202020856008602112852000902198655001202207IND60688788620221122050119.0200607e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068878862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2020.1018942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tongzhe14aThe impact of expiration dates labels on hedonic markets for perishable products  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study draws inferences from a pre-registered field experiment to investigate how expiration dates impact consumer preferences for food products with different ages. Based on a power analysis, we recruited 373 adult participants for the experiment. The results demonstrate that expiration dates largely influenced the perceived freshness of a food product as they seem to indicate a quality standard. When no explicit expiration date was present, consumers believed that the product’s quality decreased monotonically as time passed. However, in the presence of an expiration-date label, consumers initially perceived the product as more acceptable, but then that perception changed quickly after the date of expiration to levels more consistent with what they would perceive if the expiration date was not present. These results support policies that label expiration dates for consumers, as these labels benefit consumers, producers, and the public, especially for times prior to the expiration date. These results also suggest that it is important to craft policy and market strategies for products that are past the expiration date, but are still safe to consume. Policies that set the expiration dates to the time where the taste quality begins to worsen would likely benefit both consumers and producers, while policies that set the expiration dates to the time where the food is no longer safe probably improve the public outcomes as it minimizes food waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3afield experimentation 3afood policy 3afood waste 3afoods 3afreshness 3amarkets 3ataste 0aProduct labeling 0aExpiration dates 0aConsumer preferences 0aD12 0aQ18 0aK321 aMesser, Kent D.1 aKaiser, Harry M.0 tFood policy.g2020 May, v. 93 p.101894-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl9768x0306-91927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2020.1018943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008400167506011700251506007600368520160700444592002802051506003702079650000802116650002202124650002202146650001602168650001102184650002502195650001602220653001702236653001702253653002902270653002702299653004502326700002202371700001902393700001702412700002202429700001902451700002002470700001702490700002102507700002402528773011002552856008302662852000902745655001202754IND60780633720221207074002.0220628e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078063372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsir.2022.1002812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlfieri, Jacob12aA new implementation of a semi-continuous method for DNA mixture interpretation  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA new calculation module within the PopStats module of the CODIS software package, based on the underlying mathematics presented in the MixKin software package, has been developed for assigning the Likelihood Ratio (LR) of DNA mixture profiles. This module uses a semi-continuous model that allows for population structure and allelic drop-out and drop-in but does not require allelic peak heights or other laboratory-specific parameters. This new implementation (named SC Mixture), like MixKin, does not specify or estimate a probability of drop-out. Instead, each contributor to a mixture has an independent drop-out rate, and the probability of the mixture profile for a specified proposition concerning the contributors is integrated over the range of possible drop-out rates. The allelic drop-in rate and the population structure parameter, theta, used by the software are specified by the user. The user can examine up to five contributors to a mixture, however, conditioning on assumed contributors and limiting the number of unknowns in both numerator and denominator hypotheses greatly improves performance. We report results from an extensive validation study performed for ten mixtures with each of one (single source), two, three, four, or five contributors, with four combinations of drop-in rate and a population structure parameter. Each mixture was run as a complete profile or with the random removal of alleles to simulate drop-out. All 1620 combinations were evaluated with PopStats, MixKin, and LRmix and considerable consistency was found among the results with all three packages.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3acomputer software 3aforensic sciences 3amathematics 3amodels 3apopulation structure 3aprobability 0aForensic DNA 0aDNA mixtures 0aProbabilistic Genotyping 0aMixture interpretation 0aSemi-continuous method, Likelihood Ratio1 aCoble, Michael D.1 aConroy, Carole1 aDahl, Angela1 aHares, Douglas R.1 aWeir, Bruce S.1 aWolock, Charles1 aZhao, Edward1 aKingston, Hanley1 aZolandz, Timothy W.0 tForensic science international.g2022 Dec., v. 6 p.100281-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27285x2665-91077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsir.2022.1002813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245013100177300001600308520152000324592002801844596005701872650002801929650001301957650001401970650002201984650001302006650000902019650002902028650001402057650001602071651001202087700002402099700002502123700003102148700002402179700006002203773013402263856008302397852000902480655001202489IND60762079520221118192724.0220107e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076207952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-021-01237-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhang, Nguyen Hoang Minh10aGenetic characterization of coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) varieties conserved in Vietnam through SCoT marker-based polymorphisms  ap. 385-398.  aCoconut (Cocos nucifera L.) production sustains millions of smallholder farmers and their families around the globe, and also powers a thriving industry of climate-adaptive nutrition and biomaterials. Demand for high-quality planting materials has risen sharply in recent years, calling for greater understanding and potential utilization of the genetic diversity in coconut populations. Genetic diversity among several conserved coconut varieties in Vietnam was investigated to assess the suitability of 15 start codon targeted (SCoT) primers for future selective breeding programs. Amplification of 15 SCoT primers in 57 individuals from 19 coconut varieties revealed high intra-varietal diversity (Nei’s genetic diversity index = 0.237, Shannon’s Information index = 0.352), especially among the Vietnamese Dwarfs. Intriguingly, inter-varietal differentiation accounted for only 9.41% of total genetic variation. The designated SCoT primers were moderately informative. On average, each primer had 9.5 reproducible polymorphic bands per reaction. Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) per locus ranged between 0.217 and 0.390, with Resolving power (Rp) between 0.271 and 0.599. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) and Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) analyses revealed distinct clusters for non-native Dwarf, native Dwarf, and Tall varieties.

We present an ultra-high resolution crystal structure of caprine βlg complemented by analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering data. In both solution and crystalline states caprine βlg is dimeric (KD<5μM); however, our data suggest a flexible quaternary arrangement of subunits within the dimer.

Nevertheless, the scarcity of soil information in Spain precludes its use in irrigation management and, particularly, in the on-going irrigation modernization process. The Violada Irrigation District (VID) comprises 5234ha and is located in a semi-arid gypsum-rich region in northeast Spain. VID has been under flood irrigation since the mid-20th Century and has been modernized recently to sprinkler irrigation. Since the early 1980s water balances in VID have been based on average soil properties and bulk irrigation data. The current irrigation system provides detailed irrigation data at plot level, thus allowing for performing distributed balances (in hydrologic homogenous zones) that require detailed or semi-detailed soil information in the form of a soil map. The objective of this two-part study is to define homogeneous zones in relation to hydrological properties relevant for irrigation management, first defining the soil variability within the VID and then analyzing the soils hydrologic and salinity features (in a companion paper). The specific objectives of this paper were (i) to draw the VID semi-detailed soil map; (ii) to explain the variability of soil properties; and (iii) to map the main soil characteristics related to irrigation management. Thirty four soil pits, located on all the different geomorphological areas, were opened and described. Samples were taken from all the horizons and analyzed for chemical and physical properties. The limits of soil units were drawn with the aid of 32 additional auger holes, the data from 72 pits opened during the irrigation transformation works, and all the previous soil information available. Finally the soils were classified down to family level. The main soil formation processes in VID were carbonation and gypsification. Thirteen soil units were defined, included in five soil subgroups and six particle size families. “Fine” particle sizes were dominant along the gypsum-rich valley bottoms. Coarser textures were found on the heights and showed higher CaCO3 equivalent content and no presence of gypsum accumulations. A priori, the main limitation for irrigation in the valley soils was the limited drainage (due to fine textures and reduced slope) while in the highland soils it might be constrained by their low retention capacity. The high gypsum and carbonate content of the VID soils may prevent the development of infiltration problems. The soil properties map in this work will be the basis for a companion paper delineating the hydrologic properties of the soils, the basis for improved soil water balances.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbonation 3adrainage 3aflood irrigation 3ageomorphology 3agypsum 3airrigation management 3amodels 3amodernization 3aparticle size 3aplanning 3asalinity 3asoil formation 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil water 3asprinkler irrigation 3aSpain 0aANOVA 0aAWUA 0aCCE 0aECe 0aET 0aFC 0aGC 0aLSD 0aOM 0aSAR 0aVID 0aWP 0aWUA 0aSoil mapping 0aSoil variability 0aSoil classification 0aCarbonation 0aGypsification 0aIrrigation1 aIsidoro, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6251-39741 aUsón, A.0 tGeoderma.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04295naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245011500177500002200292520217300314592002802487650001202515650002502527650001902552650001102571650002702582650002202609650002202631650001502653650001402668650001802682650001902700650002702719650001302746650002102759650002302780650001502803650002402818650001202842650001202854650001802866651001002884653002702894653002802921653002702949653002402976653001303000653002203013653001003035653000803045653000903053653000703062653000803069653000703077653000803084653000803092653001003100653000803110653000703118653000703125653000803132653000703140653000803147653000603155653000603161653000703167653000803174653000903182653000803191653000803199653000803207653000803215653000703223653000803230700001603238700001403254773005403268856008603322852000903408655001203417IND60567957720221120160828.0170627s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056795772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiménez-Aguirre, M.10aSoil variability in La Violada Irrigation District (Spain): II characterizing hydrologic and salinity features  aPre-press version  aThe recent modernization of 1.1Mha of irrigated land in Spain calls for the evaluation of these transformations in terms of environmental impact and resource use efficiency. The available data for this evaluation has increased with the transformation (better, digital and spatially distributed data) allowing for the use of distributed soil water and solute movement models. But most hydrological models require soil hydrologic properties that are costly and time-consuming to gather and soil information in Spain is generally scarce. This paper focuses in analyzing the soil hydrologic features in La Violada Irrigation District (VID; a 5234ha semi-arid irrigated area recently modernized in northeast Spain) usable in soil water models for the evaluation of the new irrigation system.The recent soil map of the VID (presented in a companion paper) gathered the hydrologic and salinity properties of the horizons in the described soil units. The hydraulic conductivity (Ks) of the horizons was also assessed by the inverse auger-hole method. From these data, the VID was disaggregated in three homogeneous units according to their hydrologic features and Pedotransfer Functions (PTFs) were built for the whole VID (General Model) and separately for the homogeneous soil units (Distributed Model). These PTFs allowed for obtaining field capacity (FC) and wilting point (WP) from texture and organic matter, while Ks depended upon texture and gypsum content.Apparently, there were no salinity issues in VID soils due to irrigation. The high Ca2+ and Mg2+ levels in the saturation extract resulted in generally low SAR, what along with the high gypsum and carbonate contents may help to prevent soil degradation by sodicity.As a result, the homogeneous hydrologic zones defined in VID may be used to recommend specific irrigation practices and as the basis for the application of distributed soil water movement models. These hydrologic properties may be applied directly as inputs to the models while the PTFs may allow for setting adequate parameters in nearby areas with similar soils from more readily available soil information (texture, organic matter and gypsum).  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3aenvironmental impact 3afield capacity 3agypsum 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ahydrologic models 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3amagnesium 3amodernization 3aorganic matter 3apedotransfer functions 3asalinity 3asoil degradation 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil water 3asoil water movement 3asolutes 3atexture 3awilting point 3aSpain 0aPedotransfer Functions 0aAvailable Water Content 0aHydraulic conductivity 0aSoil water balances 0aSalinity 0aGypsum rich soils 0aANOVA 0aAWC 0aAWUA 0aBD 0aCCE 0aCE 0adfE 0adfT 0aEC1:5 0aECe 0aFC 0aGC 0aIRF 0aKs 0aLSD 0an 0aN 0aOM 0aPTF 0aRMSE 0aSAR 0aSSE 0aSST 0aVID 0aWP 0aWUA1 aIsidoro, D.1 aUsón, A.0 tGeoderma.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245011200157300001400269520172000283592002802003650001002031650001002041650001302051650002302064650001702087650002102104650001402125650001402139650001102153650001402164650001802178651001902196700001402215700001902229773012702248856007702375852000902452655001202461IND60765427120221120022541.0220422e20090218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076542712DNAL7 a10.17221/72/2008-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKantor, P.10aDevelopment of foliage biomass of young spruce and beech stands in the mountain water balance research area  ap. 51-62.  aThe investigation of foliage biomass development including LAI and the growth of spruce and beech stands in the juvenile stage (age 1 to 21 years) represents a special complementary study to long-term research of water balance components on the experimental forest hydrology area Deštné Mountainside. The experiment is located in the Orlické hory Mts. at the altitude of 900 m on a clear-felled area. In 1982 the spruce plantation was established at 1.5 ´ 1.5 m spacing (4,600 plants/ha) and the beech plantation at 1.0 ´ 1.0 m (10,000 plants/ha). According to tending programs applicable to forest stands in the Czech Republic, two improvement fellings were carried out (1995 and 2001) in spruce and none in beech. In 2002, some 1,550 spruce trees/ha (mean height 10.1 m) and 7,440 beech trees/ha (mean height 4.8 m) were recorded. At the end of the first vegetation season in 1982, the dry matter (DM) of foliage in spruce and beech amounted to 35 and 70 kg/ha, respectively. Five years later (1987), these values increased to 770 and 360 kg/ha in spruce and beech, respectively. At a stand age of 21 years, foliage DM was determined to be 11,940 kg/ha for spruce and 3,050 kg/ha for beech. At the same time, the leaf-area index (LAI) was calculated to be 5.55 and 5.94 in spruce and beech, respectively. The method of foliage biomass quantification, based on the determination of foliage DM of mean sample trees and stand density, enabled to acquire complementary data usable in long-term research of the water regime of spruce and beech and simultaneously to provide information on the potential of biomass production and LAI value of both main commercial species in mountain forests of the Czech Republic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aPicea 3aaltitude 3abiomass production 3aclearcutting 3aforest hydrology 3ajuveniles 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3astand age 3astand density 3aCzech Republic1 aŠach, F.1 aČernohous, V.0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 55, no. 2 p.51-62dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/72/2008-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245010000177300001800277500002000295520123200315592002801547650002301575650002001598650002301618650001701641650002001658650002301678650001301701650002401714650002001738650001701758650001201775650001201787650001801799650001501817650001801832650002301850650002301873650002301896650002001919651001001939700002201949700002601971700002001997773009902017852000902116856007302125655001202198IND4431196220221122045516.0160620e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443119622DNAL7 a199678782pmid7 a10.1890/08-1481.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoyle, J.

The model is a hierarchical model composed of two components: a point process model describing the distribution of individuals in space (or their home range centers) and a model describing the observation of individuals in traps. We suppose that trap‐ and individual‐specific capture probabilities are a function of distance between individual home range centers and trap locations. We show that the models can be regarded as generalized linear mixed models, where the individual home range centers are random effects. We adopt a Bayesian framework for inference under these models using a formulation based on data augmentation. We apply the models to camera trapping data on tigers from the Nagarahole Reserve, India, collected over 48 nights in 2006. For this study, 120 camera locations were used, but cameras were only operational at 30 locations during any given sample occasion.

The effect of functionalised nanoparticles on triple helical conformational changes in collagen has not been understood well. For understanding the role of functionalization on collagen conformation, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) prepared through wet chemical methods and functionalized with organic molecules (F-AuNPs) such as self-assembled monolayer (SAM), (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES), Polysaccharides (pectin and chitosan) and Poly(amido amine) PAMAM dendrimer (G₀), were characterised and their interaction with collagen was studied. Protein conformational changes assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) reveals that triple helical conformation of collagen was retained in presence of functionalized gold nanoparticle. The biocompatibility of functionalized gold nanoparticle was analysed against keratinocytes (HaCaT) cell by using (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) MTT assay. The result suggested that dendrimer functionalized gold nanoparticle exhibited higher cell viability when compared to other molecules functionalized gold nanoparticles studied. Based on the outcome of this study it can be envisioned that dendrimer functionalized gold nanoparticle mediated collagen materials are highly suitable for tissue engineering and cosmetic application.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3acell viability 3achitosan 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acollagen 3adendrimers 3akeratinocytes 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apectins 3atissue engineering 3atoxicity testing 0aCollagen 0aGold nanoparticle 0aDendrimer 0aRpn ratio 0aCell viability1 aNair, Balachandran Unni1 aSreeram, Kalarical Janardhanan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1748-87540 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 123 p.1211-1220dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.1793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002000181245012600201300001800327506007600345520147800421592002801899506003701927650002101964650001901985650002102004650001202025650001502037650001102052650001702063650002002080650001702100650001502117650002002132650001502152650001602167650001302183650001902196650001202215650001302227650002302240650004102263650006102304650004602365650001102411650000902422650003902431650004202470650001402512650002302526650004502549700001902594700001902613700001802632700002302650700001802673700002002691700001702711773014902728856004302877852000902920655001202929IND4488190020221207064740.0120320e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448819002DNAL7 a222909772pmid7 aPMC33183422pmcid7 a10.1128/AAC.05402-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández, Ana10aExpression of OXA-Type and SFO-1 β-Lactamases Induces Changes in Peptidoglycan Composition and Affects Bacterial Fitness  ap. 1877-1884.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aβ-Lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) have evolved from a common ancestor. β-Lactamases are enzymes that degrade β-lactam antibiotics, whereas PBPs are involved in the synthesis and processing of peptidoglycan, which forms an elastic network in the bacterial cell wall. This study analyzed the interaction between β-lactamases and peptidoglycan and the impact on fitness and biofilm production. A representative set of all classes of β-lactamases was cloned in the expression vector pBGS18 under the control of the CTX-M promoter and expressed in Escherichia coli MG1655. The peptidoglycan composition of all clones was evaluated, and quantitative changes were found in E. coli strains expressing OXA-24, OXA-10-like, and SFO-1 (with its upstream regulator AmpR) β-lactamases; the level of cross-linked muropeptides decreased, and their average length increased. These changes were associated with a statistically significant fitness cost, which was demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. The observed changes in peptidoglycan may be explained by the presence of residual DD-endopeptidase activity in these β-lactamases, which may result in hydrolysis of the peptide cross bridge. The biological cost associated with these changes provides important data regarding the interaction between β-lactamases and the metabolism of peptidoglycan and may provide an explanation for the epidemiology of these β-lactamases in ENTEROBACTERIACEAE.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3abeta-lactamase 3abinding proteins 3abiofilm 3acell walls 3aclones 3acrosslinking 3aenzyme activity 3aepidemiology 3ahydrolysis 3ain vivo studies 3ametabolism 3apenicillins 3apeptides 3apeptidoglycans 2aAnimals 2aBiofilms 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aMice 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aPeptidoglycanxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPhenotype 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2abeta-Lactamasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics.1 aPérez, Astrid1 aAyala, Juan A.1 aMallo, Susana1 aRumbo-Feal, Soraya1 aTomás, Maria1 aPoza, Margarita1 aBou, Germán0 tAntimicrobial agents and chemotherapy.g2012 Apr., v. 56, no. 4 p.1877-1884dAmerican Society for MicrobiologywJournal:jnl3501x0066-48047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AAC.05402-11  aDNAL 7aarticle01858naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245010000201300001800301520083400319592002801153650001101181650001901192650001801211650001201229650001901241700001701260700001901277773017101296856008001467852000901547655001201556IND60600961220221121115208.0180705e20170809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060096122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b013522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0938-627510aHeat Transfer and Fluidization Characteristics of Lignite in a Pulsation-Assisted Fluidized Bed  ap. 8995-9005.  aTo address the problem of low drying efficiency increasing lignite dryer size, a pulsation-assisted fluidized bed with horizontal tube bundles was built for investigating the heat transfer in lignite particles with the goal of enhancing the lignite drying rate by introducing a pulsed flow to increase the heat transfer rate. Results showed that the pulsation-assisted flow increased the heat transfer rates by a maximum of 50–100%. The heat-enhancement effect increased as the gas velocity increased, with 3 and 5 Hz pulsation-assisted flows demonstrating higher heat transfer rates than a 1 Hz flow. Local heat transfer rates showed a maximum value at the tube top for lignite. Simulation was conducted to analyze the details of the lignite particles and bubble movements to explain the heat transfer rate enhancement effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrying 3afluidized beds 3aheat transfer 3alignite 3aprocess design1 aLiu, Zhihong1 aOhara, Hiroaki0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Aug. 09, v. 56, no. 31 p.8995-9005dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b013523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010000165300001600265520111800281592002801399650002701427650002201454650001901476650001001495650001601505650001901521650001901540650002301559650002101582650002601603650001401629650000901643650001701652650002001669650001201689651001001701651001001711651001601721700002001737700002001757700001901777700001901796700002001815773010901835856008101944852000902025655001202034IND60439177320221120201153.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043917732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-015-0608-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Sang-Yun12aA nationwide survey and genetic analysis of rice stripe virus in South Korea during 2012–2013  ap. 390-398.  aRice stripe virus (RSV) is a major rice-infecting virus in Korea that has caused a severe resurgence in the western provinces in 2007–2008. The outbreak of RSV in rice was caused by the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus (an RSV vector), which overwinters in temperate climates. Mass immigration of its insect vector from China has been proposed as a critical risk factor in development of the disease. A nationwide survey was done in June and July 2012–2013 in 30 Korean provinces to confirm RSV sequence variation. The sequence of the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) gene and the intergenic region (IR) of RSV RNA3 was analyzed. A phylogenetic analysis of the NCP gene and the IR demonstrated that the 33 isolates were closely related to earlier reported isolates from Japan and China, but the secondary IR structure showed strong geographic clustering. This is the first report on a nationwide RSV survey of Korea. The results will provide information on the relationships among RSV isolates to understand the epidemiology of this rice disease and the effect of climate changes and insect migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaodelphax striatellus 3aRice stripe virus 3aclimate change 3agenes 3aimmigration 3ainsect vectors 3aintergenic DNA 3amigratory behavior 3anational surveys 3anucleocapsid proteins 3aphylogeny 3arice 3arisk factors 3atemperate zones 3aviruses 3aChina 3aJapan 3aSouth Korea1 aJeong, Rae-Dong1 aYoon, Young-Nam1 aShin, Dong Bum1 aKang, Hang-Won1 aLee, Bong Choon0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2015 Sept., v. 81, no. 5 p.390-398dSpringer Japanx1345-26307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-015-0608-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245019700167300001600364520134300380592002801723650001101751650001601762650001501778650002401793650000901817650001401826650000901840650002301849650002201872651001601894700002501910700001901935700001601954700001701970700002001987700002102007773010102028856008102129852000902210655001202219IND60439177420221120211315.0170725e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043917742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-014-0423-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLampayan, R.

This necessitates the development of innovative techniques that reduce water input and increase water productivity (WPI₊R) of rice. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation and use of older seedlings may help reduce the input water requirement of rice. We evaluated the effects of AWD at different threshold levels (irrigation when perched water table drops to 15, 25, or 30 cm below soil surface) in comparison with continuous flooding (CF) and of rice plant seedling ages (S) on grain yield, water input, and WPI₊R of lowland rice during the 2010 and 2011 dry seasons. In both years, there was no effect of water management and a significant effect of S. 21-day-old seedlings gave the highest yields. Water savings using AWD ranged from 42.8 to 53.7 % of total water input in comparison with CF, without yield loss, but there was little difference in water input among AWD treatments. Due to shorter duration of growth in the main field, water input with 30-day-old seedlings was lower than with younger seedlings, but with a corresponding yield loss. Total water productivities in AWD treatments were higher than those with CF. Among S, 21-day-old seedlings gave the highest WPI₊R and 30-day-old seedlings gave the lowest.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrying 3agrain yield 3airrigation 3aperched water table 3arice 3aseedlings 3asoil 3awater conservation 3awater requirement 3aPhilippines1 aSamoy-Pascual, K.

Impacted by reclamation activity, however, changes in water regimes and salinity have resulted in wetland degradation. To mitigate such reclamation impacts on coastal wetlands, it is vital to understand the role of SW-GW interactions involved in maintaining the integrity of coastal wetlands. The objectives of this review were to: (i) outlining SW-GW interactions; (ii) addressing ecological responses to changes in water regimes and salinity; and (iii) exploring modeling techniques used to ascertain interactions between groundwater and coastal wetlands. Key findings are as follows: SW-GW interactions control water regimes and salinity while maintaining the integrity of coastal wetlands; the combined effects of water and salinity have an impact on ecological processes and patterns disturbed by hydrological pulses; and the distribution of physically-based models is an approach that can provide a profound means by which to understand the vital role in maintaining hydrological connectivity. Further research is required to fully reveal SW-GW interactions in maintaining coastal wetlands integrity and the mitigating effects reclamation has on coastal wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological restoration 3agroundwater 3amodels 3asalinity 3asurface water 3awetlands1 aMou, Xia0 tWetlands.g2016 Mar., v. 36, no.

DESIGN: Research animal study. SETTING: Research laboratory and teaching hospital. PATIENT(S): Adult female rhesus macaques (8–14 years of age; n = 21) and two women (24 and 27 years of age) undergoing gynecologic surgery for benign reasons, after informed consent and approval. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Ovarian histologic analysis, ovarian reserve measurements, and fertility in mating trials. RESULT(S): Rapid ovarian failure was induced in female macaques by ovarian application of 15 Gy of radiation. Females given S1P or FTY720 by direct intraovarian cannulation for 1 week before ovarian irradiation rapidly resumed menstrual cycles because of maintenance of follicles, with greater beneficial effects achieved using FTY720. Monkeys given the S1P mimetic before ovarian irradiation also became pregnant in mating trials. Offspring conceived and delivered by radioprotected females developed normally and showed no evidence of genomic instability, as measured by micronucleus frequency in reticulocytes. Adult human ovarian cortical tissue xenografted into mice also exhibited a reduction in radiation-induced primordial oocyte depletion when preexposed to S1P. CONCLUSION(S): S1P and its analogs hold clinical promise as therapeutic agents to preserve ovarian function and fertility in female cancer patients exposed to cytotoxic treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacaca mulatta 3aadults 3aanimal ovaries 3acytotoxicity 3afemale fertility 3afemales 3ahumans 3airradiation 3alaboratory animals 3amice 3amonkeys 3aoocytes 3apatients 3aprogeny 3aradiotherapy 3areticulocytes 3asurgery 3awomen1 aMurphy, Mark K.1 aLawson, Maralee S.1 aJurisicova, Andrea1 aPau, K.

Soils were assessed for the spatial and temporal distributions of metals (As, Ni, Cr, Zn, Pb, Cd and Cu) and the potential risk to the T. chinensis wetland. Our results showed that the mean contents for all metals exceeded the background values of the Yellow River Delta, except for Pb and Zn. Arsenic content exceeded the probable effect level values at all sampling sites during the four periods. A multivariate analysis indicated that As, Cd, Pb and Zn were derived from the same origin, Cr and Ni mainly originated from parent rocks, whereas Cu and Pb have another same origin. The geoaccumulation index (I gₑₒ) indicated that there was no Cu, Pb or Cr pollution at five sampling sites during all sampling periods. The average toxic units (TU) of metals in this region followed the order As > Ni > Cr > Zn > Pb > Cd > Cu. Three metals contributed more to the ∑TUs (sum of the toxic units) than other metals, as follows: As (40 %), Ni (20 %) and Cr (20 %).  aPublisher supplied data 3aTamarix chinensis 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3alead 3amultivariate analysis 3anickel 3aparent rock 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3ariver deltas 3asoil 3atoxicity 3awetlands 3azinc 3aChina 3aYellow River1 aBai, Junhong1 aGao, Zhaoqin1 aZhao, Qingqing1 aWang, Junjing0 tWetlands.g2016 Mar., v. 36, no.

It is normally broadcasted and plowed into soil, but it is not clear if it has a potential as a placement fertilizer. A rhizobox experiment was conducted to investigate the placement effect of SS and mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer on shoot and root growth as well as nutrient uptake of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The treatments included localized SS, mixed SS, localized SS and ammonium, localized ammonium, and a control without addition of SS and ammonium to examine the effect of SS placement and, further, if ammonium co‐localization would enhance the placement effect. The results show that SS fertilization improved soil N and P availability, which significantly increased plant N and P uptake and enhanced shoot growth, while root length was significantly reduced compared to the control. Localized SS increased root proliferation in the placement region, resulting in enhanced uptake of P from the SS patch compared to homogenous application. However, co‐localized application of ammonium with SS significantly depressed plant shoot and root growth. Localized ammonium markedly restricted root proliferation in the placement region and reduced soil pH in both bulk soil and placement region, contributing to decreased nutrient uptake and plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aammonium 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient uptake 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aplowing 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asewage sludge 3ashoots 3asoil 3aspring wheat1 aJensen, Lars Stoumann1 aMagid, Jakob0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2016 Dec., v. 179, no. 6 p.689-695dWILEY‐VCH VerlagwJournal:jnl64178x1436-87307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2016001533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245009200178300001600270520152400286592002801810650001501838650001301853650001201866650001101878650001101889650001301900650001301913650001701926650001201943650001501955650001101970650001601981651001301997653002102010653001602031653001802047653001502065700002402080700001902104700002102123773016102144856008802305852000902393655001202402IND60685371120221117160820.0200303e20200302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068537112DNAL7 a10.3161/15081109ACC2019.21.2.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoigt, Christian C.10aSkyrocketing Flights as a Previously Unrecognized Behaviour of Open-Space Foraging Bats  ap. 331-339.  aThe airspace of the lower troposphere is an important habitat for many animals, including open-space foraging bats. Yet, we are missing a detailed understanding of how bats forage in the seemingly unstructured open space. As part of an exploratory study, we present data on flight activity for Taphozous theobaldi (Dobson 1872), an aerial insectivore known to hunt in the open space close to mountain ridges in central Thailand. Using logger data from five individuals, covering a total period of 26 observation days, we show that T. theobaldi remained airborne for 4.8 ± 3.1 h per night (mean ± SD). We confirmed that T. theobaldi performed altitudinal flights with quick ascents, short horizontal flights followed by descents. Each night, T. theobaldi engaged on average in 2.9 ± 1.4 altitudinal flights during which they reached an average peak altitude of 306 ± 53 m above cave elevation. On average, bats spent about 14% of the total foraging time in altitudinal flights. We conclude that T. theobaldi is a regular, but most likely not an obligatory exploiter of high altitudes. We speculate that T. theobaldi may ascend to higher altitudes in search for insects, for example migrating or dispersing insects at higher air layers or swarms of hill-topping insects. Short altitudinal flights with fast ascents and descents (a slender bell-shaped flight trajectory over several 100 m altitude) may present a so far unrecognized flight behaviour of bats that may be more widespread among other aerial insectivores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aaltitude 3aanimals 3aflight 3aforage 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3ainsectivores 3ainsects 3aopen space 3aswarms 3atroposphere 3aThailand 0amovement ecology 0aaeroecology 0athermal winds 0aaerosphere1 aKravchenko, Kseniia1 aLiechti, Felix1 aBumrungsri, Sara0 tActa chiropterologica.g2020 Mar. 2, v. 21, no. 2 p.331-339dMuseum and Institute of Zoology at the Polish Academy of SciencewJournal:2176x1733-53297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15081109ACC2019.21.2.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013400162300001800296500002000314520159300334592002801927650001701955650002501972650002401997650001902021650002002040650001102060650001302071650000702084650001302091650001502104650001302119650001802132700002002150700002302170700002302193700002302216700002102239773011602260856007902376852000902455655001202464IND60784411720221120135224.0220726e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078441172DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2003057872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllsten, Sara12aA polyamine coating for enhanced capillary electrophoresis‐electrospray ionization‐mass spectrometry of proteins and peptides  ap. 2090-2099.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA procedure for enhanced capillary electrophoresis‐electrospray ionization‐mass spectrometry (CE‐ESI‐MS) of proteins is presented. The use of a newly presented capillary coating, PolyE‐323, provided fast separations of typically a few minutes with high efficiency, good deactivation, and no bleeding into the mass spectrometer. Capillaries coated with PolyE‐323 showed high stability over a range of pH 2–10, and tolerance towards methanol and acetonitrile, two modifiers commonly used in CE‐ESI‐MS. Due to the speed and simplicity of the coating procedure, the polymeric surface could, if necessary, easily be regenerated. This capability is especially valuable when working with samples of complex matrix, where a capillary surface cleaning step might be desired in order to eliminate possible memory effects. The potential of PolyE‐323‐coated capillaries in bioanalysis using CE‐ESI‐MS was demonstrated by analyzing peptides and proteins up to 66 kDa using time of flight (TOF)‐MS. Due to the stable, anodal electroosmotic flow generated by the coating, the use of a sheathless ESI interface was enabled, demonstrated in peptide analysis with attomole sensitivity. The fast on‐line CE‐ESI‐TOF system using PolyE‐323‐coated capillaries provided efficient separation and detection of a large number of peaks in a short time, exemplified by the analysis of a tryptic digest of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The capability of the developed capillary surface coating was demonstrated by the separation of human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3abovine serum albumin 3acerebrospinal fluid 3aelectroosmosis 3aelectrophoresis 3ahumans 3amethanol 3apH 3apeptides 3apolyamines 3apolymers 3aspectrometers1 aZuberovic, Aida1 aWetterhall, Magnus1 aHardenborg, Emilia1 aMarkides, Karin E.1 aBergquist, Jonas0 tElectrophoresis.g2004 July, v. 25, no. 13 p.2090-2099dWILEY‐VCH VerlagwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2003057873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245013200177506010400309506007600413520112400489592002801613506003701641650001201678650001401690650002401704650001101728650001601739650001501755650001401770650001301784650001301797650001601810653002101826653001901847653001801866653001501884653001501899700002201914700002501936700002301961700001801984700001902002700002202021773011902043856008802162852000902250655001202259IND60766300820221207114222.0220606e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076630082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1537012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorinaldesi, Cinzia10aChanges in coral forest microbiomes predict the impact of marine heatwaves on habitat-forming species down to mesophotic depths  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlobal warming is causing the increase in intensity and frequency of heatwaves, which are often associated with mass mortality events of marine organisms from shallow and mesophotic rocky habitats, including gorgonians and other sessile organisms. We investigated the microbiome responses of the gorgonians Paramuricea clavata, Eunicella cavolini, and the red coral Corallium rubrum to the episodic temperature anomalies detected in the North Western Mediterranean, during August 2011. Although the investigated corals showed no signs of visible necrosis, the abundance of associated Bacteria and Archaea increased with increasing seawater temperature, suggesting their temperature-dependent proliferation. Coral microbiomes were highly sensitive to thermal anomaly amplitude and exhibited increased bacterial diversity to greater thermal shifts. This effect was explained by the decline of dominant bacterial members and the increase of new, rare and opportunistic taxa, including pathogens, revealing a direct effect of heatwave-induced alteration of the microbiomes and not a secondary consequence of coral necrosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArchaea 3aEunicella 3aParamuricea clavata 3acorals 3aenvironment 3amicrobiome 3amortality 3anecrosis 3aseawater 3atemperature 0aCoral microbiome 0aClimate change 0aMetabarcoding 0aOctocorals 0aHolobionts1 aVarrella, Stefano1 aTangherlini, Michael1 aDell'Anno, Antonio1 aCanensi, Sara1 aCerrano, Carlo1 aDanovaro, Roberto0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 June 01, v. 823 p.153701-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1537013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245011900202300001600321500002000337520170900357592002802066596004702094596007102141596010302212650001602315650001602331650002102347650001502368650001302383650001102396650001102407650002402418650001302442650001602455650002002471650001302491651001302504651002902517700002402546700002302570700002102593773013502614856007402749852000902823655001202832IND60685691320221119120448.0200305e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068569132DNAL7 a10.1111/icad.123992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelitz, Michael W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8162-599810aLandscape‐level environmental stressors contributing to the decline of Poweshiek skipperling (Oarisma poweshiek)  ap. 187-200.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a1. The Poweshiek skipperling [Oarisma poweshiek (Parker, 1870; Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae)] is a federally endangered butterfly that was historically common in prairies of the upper Midwestern United States and Southern Manitoba, Canada. Rapid declines over the last 20 years have reduced the population numbers to four verified extant sites. The causes of Poweshiek skipperling decline are unknown. 2. We aggregated all known Poweshiek skipperling occurrence records to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of Poweshiek skipperling decline. Ecological niche models were developed for five time frames (1985, 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005) and three spatial extents (eastern occupied range, western occupied range and total occupied range). We used a backward elimination method to investigate the effects of climate and land use on the ecological niche of Poweshiek skipperling. 3. Predictors of occurrence changed over time and across the geographical extent of Poweshiek skipperling. Land use covariates were retained in east models. In the west and total extent, climate variables contributed the most to model predictive power for the 1985, 1990 and 1995 models; land use variables contributed the most to model predictive power in the 2000 and 2005 models. 4. During the rapid decline in Poweshiek skipperling population numbers occurring at the turn of the century, probability of Poweshiek skipperling presence was being driven by proportion of natural land cover and distance to nearest grassland/wetland. Our results suggest that these land use variables are important landscape‐level variables to consider when developing risk assessments of extant populations and potential reintroduction sites.  aPublisher supplied data  aDBI‐1730526cNational Science Foundation  cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Great Lakes Restoration Initiative  cCentral Michigan University – College of Science and Engineering's Dean's Research Assistantship 3aHesperiidae 3abutterflies 3aclimatic factors 3aland cover 3aland use 3amodels 3aniches 3apopulation dynamics 3aprairies 3aprobability 3arisk assessment 3awetlands 3aManitoba 3aMidwestern United States1 aMonfils, Michael J.1 aCuthrell, David L.1 aMonfils, Anna K.0 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2020 Mar., v. 13, no. 2 p.187-200dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000087x1752-458X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.123993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010000159300001600259520179800275592002802073650001202101650002302113650001202136650001402148650001702162650001402179650001702193650001302210650001402223650002602237650001702263650001402280650001302294650001502307650002202322650001902344650001002363651001402373700001802387700001402405700002102419773012902440856007402569852000902643655001202652IND60617726220221118005245.0181026e20180124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061772622DNAL7 a10.1039/c7em00523g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWannaz, Cedric10aSource-to-exposure assessment with the Pangea multi-scale framework – case study in Australia  ap. 133-144.  aEffective planning of airshed pollution mitigation is often constrained by a lack of integrative analysis able to relate the relevant emitters to the receptor populations at risk. Both emitter and receptor perspectives are therefore needed to consistently inform emission and exposure reduction measures. This paper aims to extend the Pangea spatial multi-scale multimedia framework to evaluate source-to-receptor relationships of industrial sources of organic pollutants in Australia. Pangea solves a large compartmental system in parallel by block to determine arrays of masses at steady-state for 100 000+ compartments and 4000+ emission scenarios, and further computes population exposure by inhalation and ingestion. From an emitter perspective, radial spatial distributions of population intakes show high spatial variation in intake fractions from 0.68 to 33 ppm for benzene, and from 0.006 to 9.5 ppm for formaldehyde, contrasting urban, rural, desert, and sea source locations. Extending analyses to the receptor perspective, population exposures from the combined emissions of 4101 Australian point sources are more extended for benzene that travels over longer distances, versus formaldehyde that has a more local impact. Decomposing exposure per industrial sector shows petroleum and steel industry as the highest contributing industrial sectors for benzene, whereas the electricity sector and petroleum refining contribute most to formaldehyde exposures. The source apportionment identifies the main sources contributing to exposure at five locations. Overall, this paper demonstrates high interest in addressing exposures from both an emitter perspective well-suited to inform product oriented approaches such as LCA, and from a receptor perspective for health risk mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aairshed 3aat-risk population 3abenzene 3abreathing 3acase studies 3aemissions 3aformaldehyde 3aindustry 3aingestion 3alife cycle assessment 3aoil refining 3apetroleum 3aplanning 3apollutants 3apollution control 3arisk reduction 3asteel 3aAustralia1 aFantke, Peter1 aLane, Joe1 aJolliet, Olivier0 tEnvironmental science.g2018 Jan. 24, v. 20, no. 1 p.133-144dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7em00523g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245010400178520181000282592002802092650002002120650001202140650001702152650001602169650001502185650002102200650003302221651001202254653002802266653002102294653001502315653002202330653002802352700002202380700001802402773011002420856009002530852000902620655001202629IND60746017620221119185648.0210916e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074601762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1042002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndabaka, Marijana10aPrivate forest owners’ sense of landownership: Motives, influential factors and landscape context  aLegal ownership of land defines the formal relationship between a landowner and land. Besides legal ownership, there is also psychological ownership which landowners can develop toward land. Despite the abundant literature on the relationships between landowners and land, it remains unclear under which circumstances a sense of ownership over land occurs and what impacts individual feelings may have on landscape dynamics if aggregated or scaled up. Building upon the psychological ownership theory, we interviewed 442 private forest owners in Croatia about the benefits of landownership. By using a Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) structural equation model and local spatial autocorrelation statistics, we 1) analyzed whether landownership benefits correlate to three motives for psychological ownership, i.e. having a place, efficacy and effectance, and self-identity; 2) analyzed the factors stimulating the motives; and 3) located the areas of spatial concentration of psychological landownership (i.e. hotspots/coldspots). Landownership benefits showed a strong association with the corresponding motives indicating that private forest owners experience landownership as a connection between the self and forest. Physical work in the forest and tending young forests increase psychological landownership. The land tenure system and duration of ownership plays no role. The biggest hotspot appeared in the most developed area, possibly preventing land transfer. Coldspots, in contrast, emerged across the country, pointing to land which could potentially change ownership after the land market regulation expires in 2023. The findings expand the understanding of land possession beyond the dis(investment) paradigm and help predict hotspots of land transfers at local to regional scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3aforests 3aland markets 3aland tenure 3alandscapes 3aprivate forestry 3astructural equation modeling 3aCroatia 0aPsychological ownership 0aPlace attachment 0aLandowners 0aRelational values 0aSpatial autocorrelation1 aTeslak, Krunoslav1 aFicko, Andrej0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2021 Nov., v. 215 p.104200-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1042003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245013100166300001600297520187800313592002802191650000802219650001402227650001302241650002302254650001502277650001102292650001202303650001902315650001402334650001402348650001302362650003102375651001102406700002202417773012902439856007402568852000902642655001202651IND60617726320221118005528.0181026e20180124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061772632DNAL7 a10.1039/c7em00524e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanagopoulos, Dimitri12aA critical assessment of the environmental fate of linear and cyclic volatile methylsiloxanes using multimedia fugacity models  ap. 183-194.  aWe apply multimedia models to systematically evaluate the fate profile of cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes (VMS) D₄, D₅ and D₆, and the linear VMS L₄ and L₅ using recently reported measurements of their partition ratios between organic carbon and water (KOC), their salting out constants (Kˢ), and their enthalpy of sorption to organic carbon (ΔHOC). Our assessment follows a multi-stage strategy where the environmental fate of the chemicals is explored in generic regional models with increasing fidelity to the real system and in a region-specific model. Modeled emissions of VMS to air remained in air and were degraded or advected out of the system with overall residence times ranging from 2.4 to 2.5 days, while emissions to water resulted in accumulation in sediment and longer residence times ranging from 29.5 to 1120 days. When emitted to water the modeled residence times of VMS in the sediment exceeded the REACH criterion for persistence in freshwater sediments. Reported KOC measurements for D₅ differ by 1 log unit, which results in a 500-day difference in the overall residence times calculated in the generic regional modeling. In the specific-region modeling assessment for Adventfjorden, Svalbard in Norway, the different KOC measurements of D₅ resulted in a 200-day difference in overall residence times. Model scenarios that examined combinations of previously published ΔHOC or enthalpy of phase change between octanol and water (ΔHOW) for D₅ in combination with the range of the KOC measurements resulted in 1100-days difference in overall residence times. Our results demonstrate that residence times of VMS in aquatic systems are highly sensitive to their degree of sorption to organic carbon, and that residence times of VMS likely exceed several persistence criteria and therefore they cannot be considered as non-persistent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aemissions 3aenthalpy 3aenvironmental fate 3afreshwater 3amodels 3aoctanol 3aorganic carbon 3asediments 3asiloxanes 3asorption 3avolatile organic compounds 3aNorway1 aMacleod, Matthew,0 tEnvironmental science.g2018 Jan. 24, v. 20, no. 1 p.183-194dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7em00524e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245008300172520163000255592002801885650002601913650001501939650002101954650002001975650001601995650001802011650001702029650002202046650001702068650001102085653002702096653002602123653002502149653001602174653000902190653001502199700001702214773011902231856008802350852000902438655001202447IND60766301020221122040921.0220816e20220610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076630102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1537042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgnusdei, G.P.10aSustainable agrifood supply chains: Bibliometric, network and content analyses  aNowadays the agrifood system requires major transformations aimed at promoting sustainability, reducing waste and stimulating a change toward healthy sustainable diets. The scientific literature on the transition to sustainable food models continues to develop rapidly and there is an urgent need to systematize its knowledge structure and thus make future research more vigorous. Recently, several studies have focused on certain aspects of supply chain, such as traceability or decision-making frameworks, but a systematic review of the role of sustainability within the agrifood supply has never been carried out. Through a bibliometric analysis combined with network and content analyses, the present study is aimed at identifying homogeneous areas in the field of agrifood supply chains, investigating the role of innovation technology in the transition to sustainability. The bibliometric results showed that sustainable agrifood supply chains are experiencing an evolving positive trend and represent a challenging research topic which is capturing the attention of scholars. From the network and overlay visualization of keyword co-occurrences four different research clusters were identified and the blockchain emerged as central topic in the field of food security and safety. The content analysis highlighted greater attention to the environmental pillar, compared to the economic and social pillars of the sustainability paradigm. A lack of studies was also observed on the post-consumption phase of the agrifood supply chain, which could represent a research gap to be fulfilled in the light of circular economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abibliometric analysis 3ablockchain 3acircular economy 3adecision making 3aenvironment 3afood security 3asupply chain 3asystematic review 3atraceability 3awastes 0aSustainable transition 0aInnovation technology 0aProduction processes 0aAgriculture 0aFood 0aResilience1 aColuccia, B.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 June 10, v. 824 p.153704-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1537043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245018400164300001800348520191600366592002802282650001402310650002102324650003302345650001302378650002802391650001202419650001802431650002702449650001402476650004402490650001702534650001302551650001502564650001302579650001802592650001502610650002102625650001302646650002602659650001502685650002002700650001502720650001502735650002502750700001502775700001502790700001402805700001902819700001302838773011502851856008102966852000903047655001203056IND60120224620221121053141.0150131e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012022462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-014-6288-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Dandan10aGranulation, control of bacterial contamination, and enhanced lipid accumulation by driving nutrient starvation in coupled wastewater treatment and Chlorella regularis cultivation  ap. 1531-1541.  aBacterial contamination and biomass harvesting are still challenges associated with coupling of microalgae and wastewater treatment technology. This study investigated aggregation, bacterial growth, lipid production, and pollutant removal during bacteria contaminated Chlorella regularis cultivation under nutrient starvation stress, by supposing the C/N/P ratios of the medium to 14/1.4/1 (MB₂.₅) and 44/1.4/1 (MB₄.₀), respectively. Granules of 500–650 μm were formed in the bacteria contaminated inoculum; however, purified C. regularis were generally suspended freely in the medium, indicating that bacterial presence was a prerequisite for granulation. Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) analysis showed that polysaccharides were dominant in granules, while protein mainly distributed in the outer layer. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) results revealed Sphingobacteriales bacterium and Sphingobacterium sp. are vital organisms involved in the flocculation of microalgae, and nitrifiers (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) could co-exist in the granular. Both EPS and DGGE results further supported that bacteria played key roles in granulation. C. regularis was always dominant and determined the total biomass concentration during co-cultivation, but bacterial growth was limited owing to nutrient deficiency. Starvation strategy also contributed to enhancement of lipid accumulation, as lipid content in MB₄.₀with a greater C/N/P led to the greatest increase in the starvation period, and the maximum lipid productivity reached 0.057 g/(L·day). Chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen removal in MB₄.₀reached 92 and 96 %, respectively, after 3 days of cultivation. Thus, cultivation of microalgae in high C/N/P wastewater enabled simultaneous realization of biomass granulation, bacterial overgrowth limitation, enhanced lipid accumulation, and wastewater purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aSphingobacterium 3aStenotrophomonas maltophilia 3abacteria 3abacterial contamination 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoculture 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aflocculation 3agranules 3aharvesting 3ainoculum 3alipid content 3amicroalgae 3amicrobial growth 3anitrogen 3anutrient deficiencies 3apollutants 3apolysaccharides 3astarvation 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aLi, Yunbao1 aYang, Yang1 aWang, Yao1 aZhang, Chaofan1 aWang, Di0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 Feb., v. 99, no. 3 p.1531-1541dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-014-6288-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006800150245007600218300001400294520108900308592002801397650001101425650001201436650002001448650001601468650001101484650003501495650001401530650000901544650001601553650002101569650001101590650001301601650005001614650004301664650001701707650001101724650001601735650001101751651001901762653004001781653002101821653001101842653002201853700001701875700002501892773009401917856008502011852000902096655001202105IND60525288820221118022713.0190318e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052528882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2016.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzevedo, Juliana Antunes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9354-771210aUrban heat and residential electricity consumption: A preliminary study  ap. 59-67.  aThe Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a well-documented phenomenon occurring in cities across the world resulting in city centres often being several degrees warmer than their surroundings. This local elevation in temperatures could potentially impact upon local energy consumption, with residents in the warmer central section of the city using more energy to cool their homes in summer and less energy to warm them in winter. This study uses a combination of Geographical Information System techniques and Remote Sensing data (MODIS LST and NDVI), as a preliminary investigation, to assess the spatial relationship between UHI, urban greenspace, household income and electricity consumption in Birmingham, UK. It provides simple and repeatable steps, based on freely available datasets, for urban planners, industry, human and physical geographers, and non-specialists to reproduce the analyses. The results show that, the present impact of the UHI is limited and instead highlights the dominance of household income over local climate in explaining consumption patterns across Birmingham.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3ageographic information systems 3ageography 3aheat 3aheat island 3ahousehold income 3ahumans 3aindustry 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aspatial data 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 3aUnited Kingdom 0aResidential electricity consumption 0aUrban greenspace 0aIncome 0aUrban heat island1 aChapman, Lee1 aMuller, Catherine L.0 tApplied geography.g2016 May, v. 70 p.59-67dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2016.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012100162300001600283520159000299592002801889650000801917650001201925650001701937650003101954650001501985650002602000650002202026650001102048650001902059650003002078650002302108650001602131650001502147700002002162700002302182773012902205856007402334852000902408655001202417IND60617726420221118005237.0181026e20180124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061772642DNAL7 a10.1039/c7em00530j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorselli, Melissa10aDo environmental dynamics matter in fate models? Exploring scenario dynamics for a terrestrial and an aquatic system  ap. 145-156.  aNowadays, there is growing interest in inserting more ecological realism into risk assessment of chemicals. On the exposure evaluation side, this can be done by studying the complexity of exposure in the ecosystem, niche partitioning, e.g. variation of the exposure scenario. Current regulatory predictive approaches, to ensure simplicity and predictive ability, generally keep the scenario as static as possible. This could lead to under or overprediction of chemical exposure depending on the chemical and scenario simulated. To account for more realistic exposure conditions, varying temporally and spatially, additional scenario complexity should be included in currently used models to improve their predictive ability. This study presents two case studies (a terrestrial and an aquatic one) in which some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were simulated with the SoilPlusVeg and ChimERA models to show the importance of scenario variation in time (biotic and abiotic compartments). The results outlined the importance of accounting for planetary boundary layer variation and vegetation dynamics to accurately predict air concentration changes and the timing of chemical dispersion from the source in terrestrial systems. For the aquatic exercise, the results indicated the need to account for organic carbon forms (particulate and dissolved organic carbon) and vegetation biomass dynamics. In both cases the range of variation was up to two orders of magnitude depending on the congener and scenario, reinforcing the need for incorporating such knowledge into exposure assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiomass 3acase studies 3aecological differentiation 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental science 3aexposure scenario 3amodels 3aorganic carbon 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3atemporal variation 3atroposphere 3avegetation1 aTerzaghi, Elisa1 aDi Guardo, Antonio0 tEnvironmental science.g2018 Jan. 24, v. 20, no. 1 p.145-156dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7em00530j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245009100208300001400299520106500313592002801378650002201406650001401428650001801442650001601460650001401476650002901490650002401519650002401543650001001567651001201577653001601589653000801605653001601613653001901629653001101648653002301659700001801682773009401700856008501794852000901879655001201888IND60525288920221118022731.0190318e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052528892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2016.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jeongseob1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9578-334810aUnending foreclosure crisis: Uneven housing tenure trajectories of post-REO properties  ap. 49-58.  aThe purpose of this study is to explore the housing tenure trajectories of post-REO properties, with a focus on their sales processes and neighborhood spillover effects over time. This study suggests that the renter occupancy of post-REO properties in minority communities could lead to continuing negative spillover effects. Between 2006 and 2013, REO properties were geographically concentrated in low-income Black communities and moderate-income Hispanic neighborhoods in Orange County, Florida. The resale duration of the REO properties in poor African American communities tended to be longer and the post-REO properties in these neighborhoods are more likely to be renter-occupied. In spite of comparatively short resale durations for REOs in Hispanic neighborhoods, post-REO properties were often renter-occupied. The renter-occupancy of post-REO properties might reinforce racial segregation, but it could also be a source of affordable housing. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the trajectories of post-REO properties and their spillover effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aHispanics 3aaffordability 3aforeclosure 3ageography 3alow-income neighborhoods 3aminorities (people) 3aresidential housing 3asales 3aFlorida 0aForeclosure 0aREO 0aSegregation 0aHousing tenure 0aRenter 0aAffordable housing1 aCho, Gi-Hyoug0 tApplied geography.g2016 May, v. 70 p.49-58dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2016.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011800164300001600282520113900298592002801437650001901465650002101484650002601505650002701531650002301558650002201581650001801603650002201621650001601643650003301659650001001692700001901702700001801721700001501739773010701754856008101861852000901942655001201951IND4473255920221118032839.0141110e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447325592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2011.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhan-Nan10aQuality evaluation of Semen persicae (seed of Prunus persica L.

The fatty acid composition of the seeds was analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The aim was to evaluate whether genetic and environmental factors influenced the chemical profile of fatty acids in Semen persicae. Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were present at 4.8-8.7% and 90.7-94.8% of total fatty acids, respectively. Oleic and linoleic acids were dominant in all samples and ranged from 59.3 to 81.4% and from 11.6 to 31.0%, respectively. All samples had high levels of unsaturated fatty acids. Hierarchical clustering analysis and principal components analysis were performed to differentiate and classify the samples based on the contents of the characteristic fatty acid constituents. This study provides evidence that metabolites may reflect genetic and environmental similarities, such as management practices used in cultivars (irrigation, fertilization and sanitary treatments), and evidence of the variability of genetic make up and local environmental conditions in samples grown in the wild.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus persica 3acluster analysis 3aenvironmental factors 3afatty acid composition 3agas chromatography 3agenetic variation 3alinoleic acid 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3aprincipal component analysis 3aseeds1 aLuo, Shi-Qiong1 aYu, Zheng-Wen1 aZhao, Chao0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g2011 June, v. 39, no. 3 p.183-192dElsevier Ltdx0305-19787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2011.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245005200171520179300223592002802016650001402044650001402058650001802072650001902090650001102109653001302120653001402133653001602147653001502163653001302178653001402191653001402205700002002219700001602239700002202255773009802277856008702375852000902462655001202471IND60746018020221119190102.0210820e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074601802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2021.1078702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrierley, Gary14aThe dark art of interpretation in geomorphology  aThe process of interpretation, and the ways in which knowledge builds upon interpretations, has profound implications in scientific and managerial terms. Despite the significance of these issues, geomorphologists typically give scant regard to such deliberations. Geomorphology is not a linear, cause-and-effect science. Inherent complexities and uncertainties prompt perceptions of the process of interpretation in geomorphology as a frustrating form of witchcraft or wizardry — a dark art. Alternatively, acknowledging such challenges recognises the fun to be had in puzzle-solving encounters that apply abductive reasoning to make sense of physical landscapes, seeking to generate knowledge with a reliable evidence base. Carefully crafted approaches to interpretation relate generalised understandings derived from analysis of remotely sensed data with field observations/measurements and local knowledge to support appropriately contextualised place-based applications. In this paper we develop a cognitive approach (Describe-Explain-Predict) to interpret landscapes. Explanation builds upon meaningful description, thereby supporting reliable predictions, in a multiple lines of evidence approach. Interpretation transforms data into knowledge to provide evidence that supports a particular argument. Examples from fluvial geomorphology demonstrate the data-interpretation-knowledge sequence used to analyse river character, behaviour and evolution. Although Big Data and machine learning applications present enormous potential to transform geomorphology into a data-rich, increasingly predictive science, we outline inherent dangers in allowing prescriptive and synthetic tools to do the thinking, as interpreting local differences is an important element of geomorphic enquiry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3aevolution 3ageomorphology 3aremote sensing 3arivers 0aLandform 0aLandscape 0aExplanation 0aPrediction 0aBig Data 0aFieldwork 0aModelling1 aFryirs, Kirstie1 aReid, Helen1 aWilliams, Richard0 tGeomorphology.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 390 p.107870-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2021.1078703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007000167300001800237520130800255592002801563650002101591650003801612650001701650650001201667650001601679650002201695650001001717650001601727650001701743650001101760650000701771650002201778700002201800700001801822700002001840700002001860700003401880700002001914773011501934856008102049852000902130655001202139IND60120224920221121042128.0150131e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012022492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-014-5983-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZajkoska, Petra10aImmobilised whole-cell recombinant monoamine oxidase biocatalysis  ap. 1229-1236.  aThis work demonstrates the first example of the immobilisation of MAO-N whole cells to produce a biocatalyst that remained suitable for repetitive use after 11 months of storage and stable up to 15 months after immobilisation. The production of Escherichia coli expressing recombinant MAO-N was scaled up to bioreactors under regulated, previously optimised conditions (10 % DO, pH 7), and the amount of biomass was almost doubled compared to flask cultivation. Subsequently, pilot immobilisation of the whole-cell biocatalyst using LentiKats® technology was performed. The amount of the immobilised biomass was optimised and the process was scaled up to a production level by immobilising 15 g of dry cell weight per litre of polyvinyl alcohol to produce 3 kg of whole-cell ready-to-use biocatalyst. The immobilised biocatalyst retained its initial activity over six consecutive biotransformations of the secondary amine model compound 3-azabicylo [3,3,0]octane, a building block of the hepatitis C drug telaprevir. Consecutive cultivation cycles in growth conditions not only increased the initial specific activity of biocatalyst produced on the industrial plant by more than 30 %, but also significantly increased the rate of the biotransformation compared to the non-propagated biocatalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aamine oxidase (flavin-containing) 3abiocatalysts 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3abiotransformation 3adrugs 3ahepatitis C 3amicrobiology 3aoctane 3apH 3apolyvinyl alcohol1 aRosenberg, Michal1 aHeath, Rachel1 aMalone, Kirk J.1 aStloukal, Radek1 aTurner, N.

Over an entire river continuum, spatiotemporal patterns of the two algal communities reflect specificity in habitat preference determined by geomorphic structure, hydroclimatic controls, and spatiotemporal heterogeneity in nutrient loads from point- and diffuse-sources. By representing these complex interactions between geomorphic, hydrologic, geochemical, and ecological processes, we present here a new river-network-scale dynamic model (CⁿANDY) for pelagic (A) and benthic (B) algae competing for energy and one limiting nutrient (phosphorus, P). We used the urbanized Weser River Basin in Germany (7th-order; ~8.4 million population; ~46 K km²) as a case study and analyzed simulations for equilibrium mass and concentrations under steady median river discharge. We also examined P, A, and B spatial patterns in four sub-basins. We found an emerging pattern characterized by scaling of P and A concentrations over stream-order ω, whereas B concentration was described by three distinct phases. Furthermore, an abrupt algal regime shift occurred in intermediate streams from B dominance in ω≤3 to exclusive A presence in ω≥6. Modeled and long-term basin-scale monitored dissolved P concentrations matched well for ω>4, and with overlapping ranges in ω<3. Power-spectral analyses for the equilibrium P, A, and B mass distributions along hydrological flow paths showed stronger clustering compared to geomorphological attributes, and longer spatial autocorrelation distance for A compared to B. We discuss the implications of our findings for advancing hydro-ecological concepts, guiding monitoring, informing management of water quality, restoring aquatic habitat, and extending CⁿANDY model to other river basins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aaquatic habitat 3aautocorrelation 3acase studies 3adynamic models 3aenergy 3ageomorphology 3ahabitat preferences 3aphosphorus 3aresearch 3ariparian areas 3ariver flow 3arivers 3aurbanization 3awater 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aGermany 0aEutrophication 0aRegime shifts 0aHortonian scaling 0aSpatial autocorrelation1 aBertuzzo, Enrico1 aBüttner, Olaf1 aBorchardt, Dietrich1 aRao, P. Suresh C.0 tWater research.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 193 p.116887-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.1168873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03834naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008800166520206600254592002802320650002802348650004402376650002502420650001502445650001802460650001502478650001302493650001102506650002202517650001002539650004402549650002602593650001402619650001502633650001302648650001302661650002002674650002402694650001802718650002002736650002802756650002502784650001902809653002102828653003702849653004702886653001602933653001302949653001202962700002202974700002302996700002103019773010903040856008603149852000903235655001203244IND60688221920221118134623.0200503e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068822192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.1077852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuhra, Tom10aEarthworm mucus contributes to the formation of organo-mineral associations in soil  aEarthworms are considered as “ecosystem engineers” impacting soil properties as well as nutrient and element cycles. As they move through soil, earthworms secrete cutaneous mucus which is metabolized by soil microorganisms and a source of plant-available nutrients. Earthworm-processed soil contains carbon enriched, earthworm-specific soil aggregates (e.g. casts and middens) in comparison to earthworm unaffected soil. The reason could be that organic polymeric substances in earthworm mucus bind to soil minerals. The objective of this study was to investigate the small-scale interactions between earthworm mucus and secondary soil minerals, e.g. goethite and illite, leading to the formation of organo-mineral associations. We characterized the chemical composition of earthworm mucus by FTIR and ¹³C-NMR spectroscopy and compared spectra of mucus to microbial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), an abundant and well-known type of organic matter that binds with soil minerals. Mucus from anecic (Lumbricus terrestris L.) and endogeic (Aporrectodea caliginosa Sav.) earthworm species was dominated by proteins and carbohydrates. Between 21 and 36% of the total organic carbon in the mucus containing treatments adsorbed to illite and goethite, and most of the binding with goethite was associated with phosphorus containing mucus compounds. The surface charge of newly-formed organo-mineral associations was determined by measuring the isoelectric point (IEP). The IEP of mucus-goethite associations was 6.8, which was lower than the bare goethite IEP of 8.4. The zeta potential of mucus-illite associations was greater than bare illite. We conclude that the specific adsorption of earthworm mucus constituents to soil minerals leads to the formation of mucus-mineral associations. These associations contribute to retention of organic substances from earthworm mucus in soil (micro-)aggregates and explain the altered physicochemical properties of earthworm-formed aggregates in comparison to the earthworm unaffected “bulk” soil material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAporrectodea caliginosa 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLumbricus terrestris 3aadsorption 3acarbohydrates 3aearthworms 3agoethite 3aillite 3aisoelectric point 3amucus 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apolymers 3aproteins 3asoil aggregates 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil minerals 3asoil properties 3asoil-plant interactions 3atotal organic carbon 3azeta potential 0aMucus adsorption 0aAlteration of surface properties 0aCompletely mixed batch reactor experiments 0aLumbricidae 0aFTIR-ATR 0a13C-NMR1 aStolze, Katharina1 aSchweizer, Steffen1 aTotsche, Kai Uwe0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2020 June, v. 145 p.107785-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.1077853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01433naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007300165300001200238506002800250520046600278592002800744506003700772650001700809650001000826650001400836651002400850773017800874856008201052852000901134655001201143IND60784506620221207133325.0211230e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078450662DNAL7 a10.37940/AJVS.2021.14.2.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Reda10aVertebral Anatomic Variations in Thoroughbred Racehorses in Trinidad  ap. 1-4.  aResource is Open Access  aReports of the occurrence of lumbar vertebrae variants in horses in Trinidad are rare in the literatures.

However, limitations of ODs like high energy expenditure and increased sludge sedimentation hinder its wide application. In this study, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model integrated with Activated Sludge Model No. 2 (ASM2) was proposed and applied in a full-scale OD. The integrated model provided heterogeneous information on the characteristics of hydrodynamics and biokinetics of OD, especially with respect to the simulation of total phosphorus removal by CFD-ASM2 integration model for the first time. The simulated values of flow velocities, suspended solids (SS), dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, and total phosphorus concentrations were well validated with the measured results, with the standard deviation errors of less than 5.56%, 0.28%, 0.74%, 7.39%, 3.17%, 5.27%, and 7.40%, respectively. Based on the integrated model, four different operational strategies were simulated. The proposed operational strategy of operating 7 surface aerators and 10 submerged impellers not only met the standard discharge requirements (GB 18918–2002) but also consumed less energy by 22.3%, compared with the original strategy of operating 9 surface aerators and 13 submerged impellers. Meanwhile, this proposed operational strategy also reduced the SS concentrations in the second and fourth channels, which was beneficial to elimination of sludge sedimentation. Moreover, the proposed operational strategy was successfully applied and validated in full-scale OD. The foregoing results collectively suggest that the CFD-AMS2 integration model is numerically capable to optimize the operational strategy of ODs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aammonium nitrogen 3achemical oxygen demand 3adissolved oxygen 3aenergy expenditure 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aresearch 3astandard deviation 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awastewater treatment 3awater 0aOxidation ditch 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aActivated sludge model no. 2 0aBiokinetics 0aTotal phosphorus removal1 aWan, Yanlei1 aWu, Qiongxiang1 aXiao, Keke1 aYu, Wenbo1 aLiang, Sha1 aZhu, Yuwei1 aHou, Huijie1 aLiu, Bingchuan1 aHu, Jingping1 aYang, Yin1 aYang, Jiakuan0 tWater research.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 193 p.116888-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.1168883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012700168500001900295520144700314592002801761650001701789650001401806650002001820650002201840650002401862650001301886650001501899650001001914651001401924653002401938653002501962653001301987653002502000653001002025700002002035700001902055700002802074700005802102700006102160700002302221700002202244700003102266700005802297700002102355700001502376700002002391700001602411700002002427700001802447773009702465856008502562852000902647655001202656IND60727491020221120063036.0210305e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072749102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2021.1168912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBade, Richard10aInternational snapshot of new psychoactive substance use: Case study of eight countries over the 2019/2020 new year period  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThere is considerable concern around the use of new psychoactive substances (NPS), but still little is known about how much they are really consumed. Analysis by forensics laboratories of seized drugs and post-mortem samples as well as hospital emergency rooms are the first line of identifying both ‘new’ NPS and those that are most dangerous to the community. However, NPS are not necessarily all seized by law enforcement agencies and only substances that contribute to fatalities or serious afflictions are recorded in post-mortem and emergency room samples. To gain a better insight into which NPS are most prevalent within a community, complementary data sources are required. In this work, influent wastewater was analysed from 14 sites in eight countries for a variety of NPS. All samples were collected over the 2019/2020 New Year period, a time which is characterized by celebrations and parties and therefore a time when more NPS may be consumed. Samples were extracted in the country of origin following a validated protocol and shipped to Australia for final analysis using two different mass spectrometric strategies. In total, more than 200 were monitored of which 16 substances were found, with geographical differences seen. This case study is the most comprehensive wastewater analysis study ever carried out for the identification of NPS and provides a starting point for future, ongoing monitoring of these substances.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ahospitals 3alaw enforcement 3amass spectrometry 3apsychotropic agents 3aresearch 3awastewater 3awater 3aAustralia 0aWastewater analysis 0aSynthetic cathinones 0aNew Year 0aInternational trends 0aDrugs1 aWhite, Jason M.1 aChen, Jingjing1 aBaz-Lomba, Jose Antonio1 aBeen, Frederic1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5910-32481 aBijlsma, Lubertus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7005-87751 aBurgard, Daniel A.1 aCastiglioni, Sara1 aSalgueiro-Gonzalez, Noelia1 aCelma, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9763-87371 aChappell, Andrew1 aEmke, Erik1 aSteenbeek, Ruud1 aWang, Degao1 aZuccato, Ettore1 aGerber, Cobus0 tWater research.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 193 p.116891-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.1168913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003200144245016700176300001800343500002000361520201400381592002802395650001602423650002102439650003002460650001702490650002202507650001502529650001502544650001502559650002002574650002202594650001702616650000702633650001502640650001702655650003202672650001302704650001602717700003702733700003902770700002502809773011602834856007902950852000903029655001203038IND60784412820221122003205.0220726e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078441282DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2004059382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández‐Borges, Javier10aHighly sensitive analysis of multiple pesticides in foods combining solid‐phase microextraction, capillary electrophoresis‐mass spectrometry, and chemometrics  ap. 2065-2076.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA highly sensitive procedure to detect multiple pesticides at trace levels in foods is presented. Initially a comparative study between capillary electrophoresis (CE)‐UV and CE‐mass spectrometry (MS) is carried out analyzing five pesticides not studied up to now (pyrimethanil, pyrifenox, cyprodinil, cyromazine, and pirimicarb). The comparison between CE‐UV and CE‐MS is established in terms of separation efficiency, speed of analysis, reproducibility, and sensitivity. A good separation of these compounds is achieved by both techniques using a volatile aqueous buffer containing 0.3 M ammonium acetate/acetic acid at pH 4. Time analysis reproducibility is studied for the same day (n = 5) and three different days (n = 15), showing no significant differences between CE‐UV and CE‐MS. The study on peak areas reproducibility shows a slightly worse reproducibility for CE‐MS compared with CE‐UV. The best limit of detection (LOD) that can be achieved for these pesticides using CE‐UV was 0.6 μg/mL. CE‐MS provides LODs one order of magnitude better than CE‐UV. Chemometrics are used to optimize the multiple parameters that play a role in solid‐phase microextraction (SPME) and CE‐MS analysis (e.g., extraction and desorption times, nebulizer pressure, dry gas flow, dry gas temperature, percentage of organic solvent and acid in the sheath liquid, etc.). The combined use of chemometrics and SPME‐CE‐MS clearly improves the LODs that can be achieved allowing the detection of pesticides at concentrations down to 15 ng/mL. The usefulness of this approach is demonstrated detecting multiple pesticides in different food samples as grapes and orange juice in a single run. The concentrations detected are below the maximum residue limits (MRLs) permitted for these pesticides in foods corroborating the value of our approach. This work demonstrates, to our knowledge for the first time, the good possibilities of the combined use of SPME‐CE‐MS and chemometrics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aammonium acetate 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achemometrics 3acomparative study 3acyprodinil 3acyromazine 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3amass spectrometry 3aorange juice 3apH 3apirimicarb 3apyrimethanil 3asolid phase microextraction 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aRodríguez‐Delgado, Miguel Á.1 aGarcía‐Montelongo, Francisco J.1 aCifuentes, Alejandro0 tElectrophoresis.g2004 July, v. 25, no. 13 p.2065-2076dWILEY‐VCH VerlagwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2004059383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03716naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245011400203506010400317506007600421520177400497592002802271506003702299650001902336650001702355650000902372650001702381650001002398650001802408650001502426650003202441650001102473650001302484650002802497650001902525650002802544650002002572650002002592653002102612653002802633653002002661653001802681653001602699653001702715653001702732700002002749700001802769700002702787700002402814700002002838700001802858700001902876700002702895773010102922856008203023852000903105655001203114IND60788717120221207145102.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078871712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gfs.2022.1006482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeip, Adrian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7616-502910aHalving nitrogen waste in the European Union food systems requires both dietary shifts and farm level actions  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe pivotal role of nitrogen to achieve environmental sustainable development goals and transform our food system is recognized in an ambitious nitrogen waste reduction target in the Farm to Fork Strategy of the European Commission. But is this a realistic objective and if so, what are the pathways that lead to success? To answer these questions, we first established, as a baseline, an updated food system nitrogen budget for the EU for the year 2015. The EU used 20 Tg of virgin (new) N to deliver 2.5 Tg N in food and 1.2 Tg N in fibres to consumers, yielding a food-system nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of 18%. We then built a simple model to combine intervention options that (a) increase farm level nitrogen use efficiencies, (b) reduce food waste increase recycling of waste and improve waste treatment, or (c) achieve a dietary shift towards healthier dietary patterns. The largest potential to increase N efficiency of the current agro-food system was found to lie in the livestock sector. From 144 possible combinations of intervention options analysed, we found that 12 combinations of interventions would reduce nitrogen losses by about 50%, 11 involving diet change. We further carried out an assessment of the societal appreciation of combinations of interventions considering private and public costs of the intervention measures, public benefit through effects on health and increased biodiversity of ecosystems, and public costs for overcoming socio-cultural barriers. Results show that a combination of moderate intervention options achieve halving of N losses at lowest societal costs. We conclude that systemic approaches are paramount to achieve deep nitrogen reduction targets and diet change appears to be an essential condition for success.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEuropean Union 3abiodiversity 3adiet 3afarm to fork 3afarms 3afood security 3afood waste 3alivestock and meat industry 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3asocial benefit 3asustainable development 3awaste reduction 3awaste treatment 0aNitrogen budgets 0aNitrogen use efficiency 0aNitrogen losses 0aDietary shift 0aDiet change 0aFood systems 0aFarm to fork1 aCaldeira, Carla1 aCorrado, Sara1 aHutchings, Nicholas J.1 aLesschen, Jan Peter1 aSchaap, Martijn1 ade Vries, Wim1 aWesthoek, Henk1 avan Grinsven, Hans JM.0 tGlobal food security.g2022 Dec., v. 35 p.100648-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21608x2211-91247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2022.1006483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04783naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100003200157245021300189300001600402506002800418520356400446592002804010506003704038653001404075653001004089653001604099653002204115653001204137653001804149700002604167773016304193856009204356852000904448655001204457IND60784507220221207123209.0200108e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078450722DNAL7 a10.21498/2518-1017.15.4.2019.1892952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aВедмедєва, К.

Установити вплив генів Dw, Fr, sp, що контролюють морфологічні маркерні ознаки ліній соняшника, на господарсько-цінні показники їхніх гібридів першого покоління. Методи. Польовий дослід, опис за морфологічними ознаками, статистичний аналіз. Результати. Проведено схрещування ліній та їхніх аналогів за генами: sp (ложкоподібна форма листка), Fr (бахрома краю листка) і Dw (низькорослість) і вихідних селекційних ліній зі стерильними лініями. Отримані гібриди ліній та їхніх аналогів оцінені в польових умовах за проявом маркерної ознаки, врожайності, олійності, маси 1000 насінин, висоти, діаметра кошика, кількості листків. Показники гібридів ліній з морфологічними маркерами порівняли з показниками гібридів з вихідними лініями. Рецесивний алель гену sp обумовлює ложкоподібну форму листка. Ця ознака в гібридів першого покоління не спостерігалась. Ген Fr у домінантному стані обумовлює хвилясто-зубчастий край листка. У гібридів першого покоління теж спостерігались зміни краю форми листка. Ознака «висота соняшника» обумовлена геном Dw, який у домінантному гомозиготному стані обумовлює висоту рослин до 90–100 см. Для створення ліній аналогів за кожною з трьох ознак як генетичну основу було використано три селекційні лінії: ‘ЛВО7В’, ‘ЗЛ678В’ та ‘Л06Б’. Для схрещування з лініями аналогами використано шість материнських стерильних ліній. Вивчали гібриди за врожайністю, олійністю, масою 1000 насінин, висотою рослин, діаметром кошика, кількістю листків. Висновки. Встановлено високу вірогідність негативного впливу домінантного алелю гену Dw (dwarfishness – низькорослість) на врожайність гібридів. Встановлено високу вірогідність позитивного впливу рецесивного алелю гену sp (spoon – ложка) на врожайність, олійність і кількість листків гібридів з лінією носієм рецесивної гомозиготи. Встановлено помірні та низькі вірогідності різниці рівня ознак гібридів з домінантним алелем гену Fr (fringe – бахрома краю листка) та гібридів з вихідними лініями.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 0asunflower 0ayield 0aoil content 0a1000 seeds weight 0ahybrids 0aanalogue line1 aМахова, Т.

While historically viewed as a passive site for energy storage, we now appreciate that adipose tissue regulates many aspects of whole-body physiology, including food intake, maintenance of energy levels, insulin sensitivity, body temperature, and immune responses. A crucial property of adipose tissue is its high degree of plasticity. Physiologic stimuli induce dramatic alterations in adipose-tissue metabolism, structure, and phenotype to meet the needs of the organism. Limitations to this plasticity cause diminished or aberrant responses to physiologic cues and drive the progression of cardiometabolic disease along with other pathological consequences of obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3abody temperature 3aenergy 3afood intake 3ainsulin resistance 3ametabolism 3aobesity 3aphenotype 3aplasticity 0aadipocyte 0aadipocyte progenitor 0abrown fat 0abeige fat 0athermogenesis 0adiabetes1 aDe Siqueira, Mirian Krystel1 aSeale, Patrick1 aVillanueva, Claudio,0 tCell.g2022 Feb. 03, v. 185, no. 3 p.419-446dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.12.016  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010100164300001800265520159400283592002801877650003201905650001201937650002601949650001301975650002301988650001802011650001002029650001102039650001102050650001302061650001702074650001402091650003002105650001702135700001602152700001602168700002402184700002402208773011502232856008102347852000902428655001202437IND60120225420221120143316.0150131e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012022542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-014-5985-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Feng,10aDirected arginine deiminase evolution for efficient inhibition of arginine-auxotrophic melanomas  ap. 1237-1247.  aArginine deiminase (ADI) is a therapeutic protein for cancer therapy of arginine-auxotrophic tumors. However, ADI’s application as anticancer drug is hampered by its low activity for arginine under physiological conditions mainly due to its high “KM” (S₀.₅) values which are often 1 magnitude higher than the arginine concentration in blood (0.10–0.12 mM arginine in human plasma). Previous evolution campaigns were directed by us with the aim of boosting activity of PpADI (ADI from Pseudomonas plecoglossicida, kcₐₜ = 0.18 s⁻¹; S₀.₅ = 1.30 mM), and yielded variant M6 with slightly reduced S₀.₅values and enhanced kcₐₜ(S₀.₅ = 0.81 mM; kcₐₜ = 11.64 s⁻¹). In order to further reduce the S₀.₅value and to increase the activity of PpADI at physiological arginine concentration, a more sensitive screening system based on ammonia detection in 96-well microtiter plate to reliably detect ≥0.005 mM ammonia was developed. After screening ~5,500 clones with the ammonia detection system (ADS) in two rounds of random mutagenesis and site-directed mutagenesis, variant M19 with increased kcₐₜvalue (21.1 s⁻¹; 105.5-fold higher compared to WT) and reduced S₀.₅value (0.35 mM compared to 0.81 mM (M6) and 1.30 mM (WT)) was identified. Improved performance of M19 was validated by determining IC₅₀values for two melanoma cell lines. The IC₅₀value for SK-MEL-28 dropped from 8.67 (WT) to 0.10 (M6) to 0.04 μg/mL (M19); the IC₅₀values for G361 dropped from 4.85 (WT) to 0.12 (M6) to 0.05 μg/mL (M19).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas plecoglossicida 3aammonia 3aantineoplastic agents 3aarginine 3aarginine deiminase 3abiotechnology 3ablood 3aclones 3ahumans 3amelanoma 3amicrobiology 3ascreening 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atherapeutics1 aZhu, Leilei1 aLue, Hongqi1 aBernhagen, Jürgen,1 aSchwaneberg, Ulrich0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 Feb., v. 99, no. 3 p.1237-1247dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-014-5985-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245012300163520149500286592002801781650001601809650004901825650001701874650001601891650001001907650001901917650001901936650001301955653001101968653002801979653003302007653001602040653003102056700001602087700001402103700001602117773010402133856008502237852000902322655001202331IND60731299420221120132710.0220929e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073129942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2021.1109252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wei10aEfficient photocatalytic degradation of doxycycline by coupling α-Bi2O3/g-C3N4 composite and H2O2 under visible light  aAntibiotic pollutants have posed a huge threat to the ecological environment and human health. In this work, α-Bi₂O₃/g-C₃N₄ composite was prepared and coupled with H₂O₂ for the rapid and efficient degradation of doxycycline (DOX) in water under visible light irradiation. The composite exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity and 80.5% of DOX could be degraded in 120 min. The addition of H₂O₂ significantly improved the degradation efficiency of DOX under visible light, resulting in 79.0% of it degraded within 30 min, and the degradation rate constant of DOX was 3.6 times than that without H₂O₂. On the one hand, the Z-scheme heterojunction of α-Bi₂O₃/g-C₃N₄ promoted the separation rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the composite. On the other hand, the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency also benefited from the extra hydroxyl radicals generated by the reaction of photogenerated electrons with H₂O₂ in the photocatalytic system. Free radicals trapping experiments and electron spin resonance tests proved that ▪ played prominent role in the degradation process. After adding H₂O₂, OH also became important active species. Cyclic degradation experiments demonstrated the recyclability of the composite photocatalyst in DOX elimination applications. This work provides an efficient, clean, and recyclable purification strategy for removing antibiotic contaminants from water.  aPublisher supplied data 3adoxycycline 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ahuman health 3airradiation 3alight 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aresearch 0ag-C3N4 0aComposite photocatalyst 0aVisible light photocatalysis 0aDoxycycline 0aAdvanced oxidation process1 aLi, Zhaohua1 aKang, Qun1 aWen, Lilian0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 June, v. 197 p.110925-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1109253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245009100171300001400262506002800276520150600304592002801810506003701838650002501875650001901900650000901919650000901928650001201937650001401949650001801963650001001981650001201991650001202003650001602015650001302031650001402044650001302058650002102071650001502092650001002107650001402117651001002131651001802141651002902159653002702188653002102215653001402236653002102250653001202271700002402283700002402307700002302331773012102354856008402475852000902559655001202568IND60784507420221207135048.0170517e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078450742DNAL7 a10.6092/issn.2465-311X/55902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGinetti, Beatrice10aBiological and epidemiological aspects of the quarantine pathogen Phytophthora ramorum  ap. 18-30.  aResource is Open Access  aPhytophthora ramorum is a quarantine pathogen that causes leaf blight and shoot dieback of the crown, bark cankers and death on a number of both ornamental and forest trees, especially in North America and northern Europe, where it has produced severe outbreaks.In Italy it was first reported in 2002, on Rhodondendron yakushimanum in a Piedmont nursery; after that it seemed to have disappeared, only to re-emerge in 2013 when numerous isolates were detected on batches of Viburnum tinus plants growing in some nurseries in the Pistoia area (Tuscany), which is an important district in the trade of nursery plants world-wide. This work reports on a number of laboratory tests that were carried out on isolates from infected plant samples. The micromorphological and macromorphological characteristics of the pathogen growing on carrot agar (CA), corn meal agar (CMA), malt extract agar (MEA) potato dextrose agar, and V8 agar with added PARPNH (see text) were determined, as was the growth rate at 10º, 15º, 20º, 25°, 30º, 32º and 35ºC. Molecular analysis was employed to identify the isolates more precisely. Inoculation trials under the bark were also carried out to ascertain the isolate virulence and the Koch’s Postulates.The Plant Protection Service of the Tuscan Region (SFR, Servizio Fitosanitario Regionale) was alerted as soon as the pathogen infection was detected and it took the prescribed steps to eradicate the infection in the field and prevent the recurrence of an epidemic.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhytophthora ramorum 3aViburnum tinus 3aagar 3abark 3acarrots 3acorn meal 3aculture media 3adeath 3adieback 3aforests 3aleaf blight 3amycology 3apathogens 3apiedmont 3aplant protection 3aquarantine 3atrade 3avirulence 3aItaly 3aNorth America 3aNorthern European region 0aleaf and shoot blights 0ableeding cankers 0anurseries 0aornamental trees 0acontrol1 aCarmignani, Stefano1 aRagazzi, Alessandro1 aMoricca, Salvatore0 tItalian journal of mycology.g2015 Dec., v. 44, no. 1 p.18-30dUniversity of BolognawJournal:27887x2531-73427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.6092/issn.2465-311X/55903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245012100178300001100299520127000310592002801580596008201608596008201690596008201772650001401854650001601868650001001884650001601894650001401910650001701924650002201941650002001963651001101983700002401994700002502018700002102043773012202064856008302186852000902269655001202278IND60685372720221121002735.0220130e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068537272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-020-01659-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Jadson J.

This prompts the perspective of a pluralistic view in how characterizing structures of the pileipellis and cheilocystidia to replace the paradigmatic dichotomy Rotalis-Siccus in classification.  aPublisher supplied data  aFAPESP 2011/02269-1cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  aFAPESP 2012/21793-6cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  aFAPESP 2009/53272-2cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aMarasmius 3abasidiomata 3afungi 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3arain forests 3aspecies diversity 3atemperate zones 3aBrazil1 aMoncalvo, Jean-Marc1 aMargaritescu, Simona1 aCapelari, Marina0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2020 Apr., v. 306, no. 2 p.31-31dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6813x0378-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-020-01659-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012800155300001800283520075300301592002801054650001101082650001301093650001301106650001301119650001701132650001201149650002201161650001401183650002301197650001601220700001501236700001301251700001501264700001801279700001701297700001801314773014101332856007401473852000901547655001201556IND60685083820221119162341.0200227e20200225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068508382DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta11203k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Zhijie10aSurface coating of LiMn₂O₄ cathodes with garnet electrolytes for improving cycling stability of solid lithium batteries  ap. 4252-4256.  aSpinel lithium manganese oxide (LiMn₂O₄) is an attractive cathode material, and has advantages including low cost, environmental friendliness, and easy synthesis as well as shortcomings including inferior cycling stability at elevated temperatures above 55 °C. In this work, LiMn₂O₄ cathodes are coated with Li₆.₃₇₅La₃Zr₁.₃₇₅Nb₀.₆₂₅O₁₂ (LLZNO) electrolytes. Such cathodes in solid batteries consisting of garnet ceramic electrolytes and Li anodes exhibit a discharge capacity retention of 81.3% after 100 cycles at 0.2C and 55 °C. This superior performance is attributed to the unique interface between LiMn₂O₄ and LLZNO, which is not only ionically conductive but also helpful to suppress Mn reactivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3aceramics 3acoatings 3aelectrolytes 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amanganese 3amanganese monoxide 3atemperature1 aZhao, Ning1 aMa, Lina1 aShi, Chuan1 aFu, Zhengqian1 aXu, Fangfang1 aGuo, Xiangxin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Feb. 25, v. 8, no. 8 p.4252-4256dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta11203k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01321naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245006000153300001600213500002000229520052200249592002800771650002000799650000900819650000900828650001400837773011100851856007200962852000901034655001201043IND60784413220221120115950.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078441322DNAL7 a10.1002/inpr.912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrehy, Mary10aNutritional management of urolithiasis in dogs and cats  ap. 316-327.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBackground: An increasing number of techniques are becoming available for the management of canine and feline uroliths.

In this study, a novel Ca–Mn-impregnated biochar (CMBC) composite was synthesized by co-pyrolysis at 600 °C for P recovery from solution. The efficiency of P-sorbed CMBC as a fertilizer was assessed via pot experiments. Kinetic experiments exhibited a higher phosphate sorption efficiency for the CM₁BC and CM₂BC composites. Pot experiments revealed that P-sorbed CMBC treatment significantly improved plant growth and yield. Compared with those of the control, the dry weight, fresh weight, and P content of rape leaf (root) P₅₀–CMBC₁.₀% treatment increased by 108.6% (350%), 88.7% (396%), and 132.8% (109.3%), respectively. This may be due to the porous surface structures that develop during the treatment and Ca–P precipitation on P-sorbed biochar partly dissolved in the slightly acidic soil (pH: 6.25). The maximum P adsorption values fitted by the Langmuir isotherm model were up to 9.15, 3.19, 15.58, and 20.84 mg g⁻¹ for CBC, MBC, CM₁BC, and CM₂BC, respectively. The mechanism of phosphate recovery mainly includes electrostatic attraction, surface precipitation, and the formation of inner-sphere complexes with hydroxyl groups that were assessed using BET, zeta potential, SEM-EDS, FTIR, and XPS analyses. These mechanisms suggest that phosphate may be desorbed from the P-laden sorbent, which was consistent with the results of the pot experiments and desorption experiments in aqueous media. These results imply that P-sorbed modified biochar has the potential to be a promising P fertilizer in soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3adesorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aeutrophication 3aleaves 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aplant growth 3apyrolysis 3asorbents 3asorption isotherms 3azeta potential1 aQiu, Cheng1 aSong, Zhengguo1 aGao, Minling0 tEnvironmental science.g2022 Mar. 23, v. 24, no. 3 p.474-485dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1em00511a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245010300204300001300307506007600320520183100396592002802227506003702255650003102292650004202323650001202365650001302377650002102390650002602411650001402437650002602451650002902477650001802506650001602524700001702540700002002557700001702577700001302594773010602607856007902713852000902792655001202801IND60119378320221207081227.0141214e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011937832DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-1-r62doi7 aPMC26877942pmcid7 a191467102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Yuanyuan10aCharacterization and comparative profiling of the small RNA transcriptomes in two phases of locust  ap. 2156.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: All the reports on insect small RNAs come from holometabolous insects whose genome sequence data are available. Therefore, study of hemimetabolous insect small RNAs could provide more insights into evolution and function of small RNAs in insects. The locust is an important, economically harmful hemimetabolous insect. Its phase changes, as a phenotypic plasticity, result from differential gene expression potentially regulated at both the post-transcriptional level, mediated by small RNAs, and the transcriptional level. RESULTS: Here, using high-throughput sequencing, we characterize the small RNA transcriptome in the locust. We identified 50 conserved microRNA families by similarity searching against miRBase, and a maximum of 185 potential locust-specific microRNA family candidates were identified using our newly developed method independent of locust genome sequence. We also demonstrate conservation of microRNA*, and evolutionary analysis of locust microRNAs indicates that the generation of miRNAs in locusts is concentrated along three phylogenetic tree branches: bilaterians, coelomates, and insects. Our study identified thousands of endogenous small interfering RNAs, some of which were of transposon origin, and also detected many Piwi-interacting RNA-like small RNAs. Comparison of small RNA expression patterns of the two phases showed that longer small RNAs were expressed more abundantly in the solitary phase and that each category of small RNAs exhibited different expression profiles between the two phases. CONCLUSIONS: The abundance of small RNAs in the locust might indicate a long evolutionary history of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation, and differential expression of small RNAs between the two phases might further disclose the molecular mechanism of phase changes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agene expression regulation 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3alocusts 3amicroRNA 3aphase transition 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aphylogeny 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atransposons1 aChen, Shuang1 aYang, Pengcheng1 aMa, Zongyuan1 aKang, Le0 tGenome biology.g2009 Jan., v. 10, no. 1 p.2156-2156dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2009-10-1-r63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01742naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245008100165300001400246520074800260592002801008650001201036650001301048650002101061650002101082650002201103650002701125650000901152700002001161700001801181700002101199700002101220773009401241856004801335852000901383655001201392IND4450699420221118124450.0121003e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445069942DNAL7 a10.3103/S00954527110100632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBezugliy, M.

In this study, an ASM3 modeling study was conducted to simulate and optimize a practical coking wastewater treatment plant (CWTP). First, respirometric characterizations of the coking wastewater and CWTP biomasses were conducted to determine the specific kinetic and stoichiometric model parameters for the consecutive aeration-anoxic-aeration (O-A/O) biological process. All ASM3 parameters have been further estimated and calibrated, through cross validation by the model dynamic simulation procedure. Consequently, an ASM3 model was successfully established to accurately simulate the CWTP performances in removing COD and NH4–N. An optimized CWTP operation condition could be proposed reducing the operation cost from 6.2 to 5.5 €/m3 wastewater. This study is expected to provide a useful reference for mathematic simulations of practical industrial WWTPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiological treatment 3achemical oxygen demand 3adynamic models 3amodel validation 3aoperating costs 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aActivated sludge model no. 3 (ASM3) 0aIndustrial wastewater treatment plants 0aCoking wastewater 0aParameter estimation 0aSensitivity analysis1 aYang, Yang1 aWu, Gaoming1 aMao, Juan1 aZhou, Tao0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 165 p.235-242dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.09.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245006800172300001400240520112400254592002801378650001201406650001301418650002601431650001801457650002101475650001901496650002101515650003701536653001901573653003501592653000801627700001901635700002001654700001701674700002101691773013301712856008701845852000901932655001201941IND60622686420221122055325.0220214e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062268642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.10.2052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhatun, Suparna10aRepulsive interaction induces fibril formation and their growth  ap. 20-25.  aIn a type-II diabetes disease, amylin protein takes an incorrect structure that leads to the formation of the amyloid fibril. The conversion mechanism of amyloid fibril is not well understood. We have observed a repulsive interaction, in terms of second virial co-efficient (A₂), between protein molecules in their native state in the PBS buffer through laser light scattering technique. The A₂ switches from repulsive (positive A₂) to attractive (negative A₂) interactions with elapsed time favoring the formation and growth of the fibril. We report aggregation and fibril growth kinetics of amylin protein in different environmental conditions. The measurement of shape factor (ρ) through light scattering experiment shows a transition from coil-like structure to rod-like growth. In addition to rod-like growth, sheet-like growth of fibril is also observed through analytical and high-resolution TEM imaging techniques. The nucleation leading to elongation of fibrils as well as stacking of individual fibril perpendicular to the fibril axis is held by hydrogen bonding observed through high-resolution TEM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3adiabetes 3aenvironmental factors 3agrowth models 3ahydrogen bonding 3aimage analysis 3alight scattering 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aAmylin protein 0aSecond virial-coefficient (A2) 0aTEM1 aShikha, Kumari1 aGanguly, Agneyo1 aPawar, Nisha1 aGupta, Amar Nath0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 123 p.20-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.10.2053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245017200203300001300375506007600388520149500464592002801959506003701987650002302024650000902047650001302056650002202069650001302091650001702104650001902121650002402140650003302164700002902197700002502226700002502251773010602276856007902382852000902461655001202470IND60119378420221207081122.0141214e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011937842DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-1-r72doi7 aPMC26877952pmcid7 a191616192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeed, Anna C12aA genome-wide genetic signature of Jewish ancestry perfectly separates individuals with and without full Jewish ancestry in a large random sample of European Americans  ap. 2157.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: It was recently shown that the genetic distinction between self-identified Ashkenazi Jewish and non-Jewish individuals is a prominent component of genome-wide patterns of genetic variation in European Americans. No study however has yet assessed how accurately self-identified (Ashkenazi) Jewish ancestry can be inferred from genomic information, nor whether the degree of Jewish ancestry can be inferred among individuals with fewer than four Jewish grandparents. RESULTS: Using a principal components analysis, we found that the individuals with full Jewish ancestry formed a clearly distinct cluster from those individuals with no Jewish ancestry. Using the position on the first principal component axis, every single individual with self-reported full Jewish ancestry had a higher score than any individual with no Jewish ancestry. CONCLUSIONS: Here we show that within Americans of European ancestry there is a perfect genetic corollary of Jewish ancestry which, in principle, would permit near perfect genetic inference of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. In fact, even subjects with a single Jewish grandparent can be statistically distinguished from those without Jewish ancestry. We also found that subjects with Jewish ancestry were slightly more heterozygous than the subjects with no Jewish ancestry, suggesting that the genetic distinction between Jews and non-Jews may be more attributable to a Near-Eastern origin for Jewish populations than to population bottlenecks.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEuropean Americans 3aJews 3aancestry 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3agrandparents 3aheterozygosity 3apopulation dynamics 3aprincipal component analysis1 aKasperavičiūtė, Dalia1 aCirulli, Elizabeth T1 aGoldstein, David B.,0 tGenome biology.g2009 Jan., v. 10, no. 1 p.2157-2157dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2009-10-1-r73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245008000171300001800251520124600269592002801515650001901543650001001562650001901572650001101591650002801602650001801630650001301648650001401661700002001675700001601695700001601711700001701727700001601744773010101760856008801861990002301949852000901972655001201981IND60098502920221120021409.0141104e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009850292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarhi, Jacob10aNeurotrophin 4 enhances in vitro follicular assembly in human fetal ovaries  ap. 1267-1271.  aOBJECTIVE: To investigate the in vitro effect of neurotrophin 4 (NT-4) on follicular assembly in human fetal ovaries. DESIGN: Human ovarian tissue from fetuses at 19-20 gestational weeks was placed in organ culture for two weeks with NT-4. Control groups were cultured with a neutralizing antibody against NT-4. SETTING: Infertility unit at an university-affiliated tertiary medical center. PATIENT(S): Four patients who underwent pregnancy terminations at 19–20 gestational weeks. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Histologic findings of follicular assembly. RESULT(S): Follicular assembly was significantly increased in the specimens cultured with NT-4 than in the uncultured specimens, the samples cultured without NT-4, and samples cultured with the neutralizing antibody. In the second week of culture, additional follicular assembly was promoted in the presence of 100 ng/mL NT-4 but not with 10 ng/mL NT-4. CONCLUSION(S): This is the first report showing that NT-4 seems to promote human follicular assembly in fetal ovaries, probably in a dose-dependent manner. Follicular assembly is regulated by multiple signals, and additional studies on the effects of other growth factors in combination with NT-4 are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3afetus 3agrowth factors 3ahumans 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aorgan culture 3apatients 3apregnancy1 aFisch, Benjamin1 aGaror, Roni1 aPeled, Yoav1 aPinkas, Haim1 aAbir, Ronit0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 95, no. 4 p.1267-1271dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.03.0513Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013900169300001600308520111500324592002801439650000801467650002001475650002001495650001501515650002201530650001601552650000901568650001801577650002201595650001101617653001801628653002101646653001501667653003401682653003401716700001701750700002001767773009701787856008601884852000901970655001201979IND60561831020221121024948.0170124e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056183102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.10.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShe, Xiaohui10aThermodynamic analysis of a novel energy-efficient refrigeration system subcooled by liquid desiccant dehumidification and evaporation  ap. 286-296.  aA new energy-efficient refrigeration system subcooled by liquid desiccant dehumidification and evaporation was proposed in this paper. In the system, liquid desiccant system could produce very dry air for an indirect evaporative cooler, which would subcool the vapor compression refrigeration system to get higher COP than conventional refrigeration system. The desiccant cooling system can use the condensation heat for the desiccant regeneration. Thermodynamic analysis is made to discuss the effects of operation parameters (condensing temperature, liquid desiccant concentration, ambient air temperature and relative humidity) on the system performance. Results show that the proposed hybrid vapor compression refrigeration system achieves significantly higher COP than conventional vapor compression refrigeration system, and even higher than the reverse Carnot cycle at the same operation conditions. The maximum COPs of the hybrid systems using hot air and ambient air are 18.8% and 16.3% higher than that of the conventional vapor compression refrigeration system under varied conditions, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair temperature 3acooling systems 3adesiccants 3aenergy efficiency 3aevaporation 3aheat 3arefrigeration 3arelative humidity 3avapors 0aRefrigeration 0aLiquid desiccant 0aSubcooling 0aCondensation heat utilization 0aEnergy efficiency improvement1 aYin, Yonggao1 aZhang, Xiaosong0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Feb., v. 78 p.286-296dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.10.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245011600209520156100325592002801886650001101914650001801925650001801943650002001961650001401981650002001995650002402015650001802039650001102057651001302068653002502081653002302106653002202129700002502151700002502176700002702201700002502228700006802253773009402321856008102415852000902496655001202505IND60725100120221123031344.0210124e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072510012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1043402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRauf, Hafiz Tayyab1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1515-318712aA citrus fruits and leaves dataset for detection and classification of citrus diseases through machine learning  aPlants are as vulnerable by diseases as animals. Citrus is a major plant grown mainly in the tropical areas of the world due to its richness in vitamin C and other important nutrients. The production of the citrus fruit has been widely affected by citrus diseases which ultimately degrades the fruit quality and causes financial loss to the growers. During the past decade, image processing and computer vision methods have been broadly adopted for the detection and classification of plant diseases. Early detection of diseases in citrus plants helps in preventing them to spread in the orchards which minimize the financial loss to the farmers. In this article, an image dataset citrus fruits, leaves, and stem is presented. The dataset holds citrus fruits and leaves images of healthy and infected plants with diseases such as Black spot, Canker, Scab, Greening, and Melanose. Most of the images were captured in December from the Orchards in Sargodha region of Pakistan when the fruit was about to ripen and maximum diseases were found on citrus plants. The dataset is hosted by the Department of Computer Science, University of Gujrat and acquired under the mutual cooperation of the University of Gujrat and the Citrus Research Center, Government of Punjab, Pakistan. The dataset would potentially be helpful to researchers who use machine learning and computer vision algorithms to develop computer applications to help farmers in early detection of plant diseases.

We tested the hypotheses that: (1) seed burial only favours the emergence of round seeds; and (2) straw mulching improves soil moisture and prevents the emergence of the invasive grass Urochloa decumbens, promoting the establishment of native tree seedlings. LOCATION: Experimental field, Central Brazil. Savanna, recently dominated by exotic pasture. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of seed burial (surface and buried) and mulching (no‐mulch, 5‐cm straw mulch and 10‐cm straw mulch) on the emergence, survival and growth of 16 species of native Cerrado tree species with variable seed sizes and shapes and seedling types. Thirty seeds of each species were sown per treatment combination in three blocks. RESULTS: Seed burial did not affect the emergence of species with round seeds, but negatively affected species with flat seeds and phanerocotylar–epigeal–foliaceous seedlings. Straw mulching reduced the emergence of flat seeds and phanerocotylar seedlings, but increased soil moisture and strongly reduced U. decumbens emergence, resulting in a higher growth rate of tree seedlings up to 1 yr for five species. CONCLUSION: Direct seeding is an effective technique to plant a mixture of Cerrado tree species for restoration, provided the soil is well prepared and there are mechanisms to control invasive species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrochloa decumbens 3aburied seeds 3acerrado 3adirect seeding 3afield experimentation 3agermination 3ainvasive species 3amulching 3apastures 3asavannas 3aseed size 3aseedlings 3asoil water 3astraw mulches 3atrees 3aBrazil1 aVieira, Daniel L.M.0 tApplied vegetation science.g2017 July, v. 20, no. 3 p.410-421dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58701x1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avsc.123053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01684naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010900163300001800272520044100290592002800731650002300759650001500782650001000797650001900807650001200826650001200838650002400850650001200874653002300886653001900909653002400928653002600952653002200978700001701000700002401017773015601041856008001197852000901277655001201286IND60522632920221121032707.0160603e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052263292DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1980-11-12472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRembold, H.,10aInhibition of Allatotropic Activity and Ovary Development in Locusta migratoria by Anti-Brain-Antibodies  ap. 1117-1119.  aEvidence for an immunogenic allatotropic factor in the brain of Locusta migratoria is presented.

The accumulated chemicals are later emitted during courtship display, presumably to lure conspecific females for mating. We analyzed tibial fragrances of males of 15 sympatric Panamanian species in the genus Euglossa to test whether communities of euglossine bees are chemically structured, and to elucidate whether male fragrance signals evolve to convey premating isolation. Our analysis revealed substantial chemical disparity among all lineages. Disparity was mediated by compounds that were exclusive to certain species but also by differences in relative quantity of shared compounds. We mapped tibial fragrance compounds present in each species on a DNA‐based phylogeny (reconstructed using partial sequences of COI, EF1‐α, ArgK, and Pol‐II) and found that most dominant compounds were highly homoplasious. In an analysis of chemical differentiation in relation to phylogenetic divergence through time, disparity was greater than expected from a null model at any point during evolutionary history, suggesting that diversifying selection has shaped fragrance phenotypes. Notably, chemical disparity was greater within recently diverged lineages than among them, suggesting that chemical preferences in orchid bees evolved rapidly in the early stages of species divergence. We postulate communication interference as the possible mechanism behind the observed fragrance differentiation, which may be the product of reproductive character (fragrance) displacement. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that male fragrance signals evolve to convey premating isolation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuglossa 3ainsect behavior 3aphenotype 3asex pheromones 3atropics 3amales 3achemical analysis 3aphylogeny 3aflowers 3acourtship 3aDNA 3aodors 2aAnimals 2aBeesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEcosystem 2aFemale 2aGeography 2aMale 2aOrchidaceae 2aPhylogeny 2aSex Attractantsxchemistryxphysiology. 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxphysiology 2aSpecies Specificity 3aPanama 0aPanama 0aApidae1 aRamírez, Santiago R.1 aEltz, Thomas0 tEcology.g2009 Nov., v. 90, no. 11 p.2994-3008dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-1858.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02352naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245018700169300002000356520072600376592002801102650001601130650002301146650001901169650002001188650003301208650001201241650002201253650001401275700001901289700002601308700002001334700002501354700001301379700002201392700002201414700006201436700006001498700006001558700006401618773013601682856007901818852000901897655001201906IND60718140020221118083155.0201120e20200706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071814002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c009742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZimmerman, Amber N.10aDiastereoselective Synthesis of P-Stereogenic Secondary Phosphine Oxides (SPOs) Bearing a Chiral Substituent by Ring Opening of (+)-Limonene Oxide with Primary Phosphido Nucleophiles  ap. 14516-14526.  aKinetic separation of the commercially available cis/trans-(+)-limonene oxide mixture by ring opening with primary phosphido nucleophiles LiPHR (R = ferrocenyl, Ph, Cy, t-Bu, Mes* (Mes* = 2,4,6-(t-Bu)₃C₆H₂)), followed by treatment with aqueous NH₄Cl and H₂O₂, gave unreacted cis-(+)-limonene oxide and diastereoenriched mixtures of the secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs) PHR(trans-(+)-Lim–OH)(O), which could be separated by chromatography and/or recrystallization.

These peptides play an important role in regulation of energy homeostasis and their secretion is disturbed under condition of eating disorders. As various types of consumed macronutrients may induce different plasma hormone responses, so we examined these responses in women patients with eating disorders and compared them with those of healthy controls. METHODS: We examined plasma hormone responses to HC and HP breakfast in patients with AN (n = 14; age: 24.6 ± 1.8 years, BMI: 15.3 ± 0.7), BN (n = 15; age: 23.2 ± 1.7 years, BMI: 20.5 ± 0.9) and healthy controls (n = 14; age: 24.9 ± 1.4 years, BMI: 21.1 ± 0.8). Blood samples were drawn from the cubital vein, the first blood drawn was collected before meal, and then 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min after breakfast consumption. Plasma hormone levels were determined by commercially available RIA kits. RESULTS: Fasting and postprandial plasma obestatin levels were significantly increased in both AN and BN patients, while plasma ghrelin levels were significantly increased in AN patients only. After breakfast consumption, plasma levels of ghrelin and obestatin decreased, although they were still above the range of values of healthy controls. Fasting NPY plasma levels were significantly increased in AN and BN patients and did not change postprandially. Fasting PYY levels were comparable in AN, BN and healthy controls, but postprandially significantly increased after HP breakfast in AN and BN patients. Different reactions to breakfast consumption was found for ghrelin and PYY among investigated groups, while for obestatin and NPY these reactions were similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Significant increase of obestatin and NPY in AN and BN patients may indicate their important role as the markers of eating disorders. Different reactions of ghrelin and PYY to breakfast consumption among groups suggest that role of these hormones in regulation of energy homeostasis can be adjusted in dependence to acute status of eating disorder.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinging 3aenergy 3asecretion 3awomen 3ablood sampling 3ahomeostasis 3apatients 3aghrelin 3abody mass index 3aanorexia nervosa 3abreakfast 0abulimia1 aPažoutová, Jana,d1977-1 aPapežová, Hana,1 aHainer, Vojtech1 aKvasnickova, Hana1 aHill, Martin1 aNedvidkova, Jara0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2012 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.481-481dSpringer-Verlagx1743-70757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-9-52  aDNAL 7aarticle01419naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012600163300001800289520029500307592002800602650001500630650001400645650002300659650002300682650002300705650001000728700001900738700001900757700002100776700001700797700002800814700002400842773010700866856007500973852000901048655001201057IND60578752820221119221242.0170814e20140905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057875282DNAL7 a10.1021/ol501990t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Shūichi,10aDesymmetrization of meso-Aziridines with TMSNCS Using Metal Salts of Novel Chiral Imidazoline–Phosphoric Acid Catalysts  ap. 4452-4455.  aHighly enantioselective desymmetrization of aziridines with TMSNCS has been developed.

While increasingly sophisticated measurement methods (such as microbial source tracking) assist in the management of bathing water resources, the use of deterministic predictive models for this purpose, while having the potential to provide decision making support, remains less common.This study explores an integrated, deterministic catchment-coastal hydro-environmental model as a decision-making tool for beach management which, based on advance predictions of bathing water quality, can inform beach managers on appropriate management actions (to prohibit bathing or advise the public not to bathe) in the event of a poor water quality forecast. The model provides a ‘moving window’ five-day forecast of Escherichia coli levels at a bathing water compliance point off the Irish coast and the accuracy of bathing water management decisions were investigated for model predictions under two scenarios over the period from the 11th August to the 5th September, 2012. Decisions for Scenario 1 were based on model predictions where rainfall forecasts from a meteorological source (www.yr.no) were used to drive the rainfall–runoff processes in the catchment component of the model, and for Scenario 2, were based on predictions that were improved by incorporating real-time rainfall data from a sensor network within the catchment into the forecasted meteorological input data. The accuracy of the model in the decision-making process was assessed using the contingency table and its metrics.The predictive model gave reasonable outputs to support appropriate decision making for public health protection. Scenario 1 provided real-time predictions that, on 77% of instances during the study period where both predicted and E. coli concentrations were available, would correctly inform a beach manager to either take action to mitigate for poor bathing water quality or take no action. However, Scenario 1 also provided data to support a decision to take action (when none was necessary – a type I error) in 4% of instances and to take no action (when action was required – a type II error) in 19% of the instances analysed. Type II errors are critical in terms of public health protection given that for this error, bathers can be exposed to risks from poor bathing water quality. Scenario 2, on the other hand, provided predictions that would support correct management actions for 79% of the instances but would result in type I and type II errors for 4% and 17% of the instances respectively.Comparison of Scenarios 1 and 2 for this study indicate that Scenario 2 gave a marginally better overall performance in terms of supporting correct management decisions, as it provided data that could result in a lower occurrence of the more critical type II errors.Given that the 28 member states of the European Union are required to engage with the public health provisions of the revised Bathing Water Directive, issues of compliance, pertaining particularly to the management of bathing water resources, remain topical. Decision supports for managing bathing waters in the context of the Directive are likely to become the focus of much attention and although, the current study has been validated in bathing waters off the east coast of Ireland, the approach of using a deterministic and integrated catchment-coastal model for such purposes is easily transferable to other bathing water jurisdictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aEuropean Union 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3acompliance 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3ahealth promotion 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apollution 3aprediction 3arain 3arisk 3awater management 3awater quality 3awater resources 3awatersheds 3aIreland 0aFaecal indicator bacteria (FIB) 0aPrediction 0aBathing water quality management 0aCoastal and catchment modelling 0aRevised EU Bathing Water Directive1 aCorkery, Aisling1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8603-24491 aO'Sullivan, John J.1 aDeering, Louise A.1 aDemeter, Katalin1 aMeijer, Wim G.1 aO'Hare, Gregory1 aMasterson, Bartholomew0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 167 p.49-58dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.10.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245013600216300001600352520172900368592002802097650001502125650002002140650001902160650001402179650001502193650002402208650001302232650001902245650001402264650001102278650001902289650001902308650003102327650002902358650001402387650001302401653001102414653001502425653001202440653002402452653002002476653001802496700002702514700002102541700002102562700001802583700002102601700001702622700002202639773009702661856008502758852000902843655001202852IND60629805320221120132129.0191004e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062980532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2019.01.1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHojamberdiev, Mirabbos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5233-256310aSynergistic effect of g-C3N4, Ni(OH)2 and halloysite in nanocomposite photocatalyst on efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation  ap. 434-444.  aHere, we develop a strategy to improve the visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of g-C3N4 by compositing it with low-cost Ni(OH)2 nanoplatelets and inexpensive and earth-abundant halloysite nanotubes. The Ni(OH)2@g-C3N4/halloysite nanocomposite photocatalysts with different amounts of Ni(OH)2 (0.5–10 wt%) were prepared, and a synergistic effect of Ni(OH)2 platelets and halloysite nanotubes on physicochemical properties and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of g-C3N4 was investigated. As expected, the Ni(OH)2@g-C3N4/halloysite nanocomposite photocatalyst prepared with 1 wt% Ni(OH)2 exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (18.42 μmol h−1) which is much higher than that of g-C3N4 (0.43 μmol h−1) and Ni(OH)2@g-C3N4 (9.12 μmol h−1). Such enhancement in photocatalytic activity of Ni(OH)2@g-C3N4/halloysite nanocomposite photocatalyst is attributed to efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons from the g-C3N4 to Ni(OH)2 cocatalyst interface and trapping of photogenerated holes on the negatively charged surfaces of halloysite nanotubes. In addition, adsorption affinity of the water and methanol molecules was modeled using different surfaces of Ni(OH)2, halloysite-7Å, and g-C3N4 and it is found that combining the g-C3N4 with halloysite-7Å and Ni(OH)2 can significantly improve the adsorption of water and methanol molecules on the surface of the developed nanocomposite. This study offers a simple approach for developing an efficient and inexpensive nanocomposite for effective and applied photocatalytic water splitting methodology for hydrogen production and other possible optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ablood platelets 3acarbon nitride 3aelectrons 3ahalloysite 3ahydrogen production 3amethanol 3ananocomposites 3ananotubes 3anickel 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphysicochemical properties 3arenewable energy sources 3asynergism 3atrapping 0ag-C3N4 0aHalloysite 0aNi(OH)2 0aHydrogen production 0aWater splitting 0aNanocomposite1 aKhan, Mohammad Mansoob1 aKadirova, Zukhra1 aKawashima, Kenta1 aYubuta, Kunio1 aTeshima, Katsuya1 aRiedel, Ralf1 aHasegawa, Masashi0 tRenewable energy.g2019 Aug., v. 138 p.434-444dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.01.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245011400203520129400317592002801611650001601639650001601655650001601671650002101687650001201708650003101720650001301751650002001764650001901784650001001803650002201813650001901835650001701854650000901871650001501880650002901895650002001924653001501944653001901959653001601978653001101994653001802005653002102023653001002044653001102054653000902065653000702074653000802081653000802089653000802097653000902105653000802114653001002122653000902132653000802141653000802149653000802157700005402165700002002219700001802239700001602257700001902273773011302292856008202405852000902487655001202496IND60783405920221122030850.0220809e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078340592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2022.1133022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarter, L.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1905-496010aGenomic analysis of Fisher F344 rat kidneys from a reproductive study following dietary ochratoxin A exposure  aOchratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by species of Penicillium and Aspergillus, and is found in many commodities including cereal grains, nuts, and coffee. OTA is a renal carcinogen and nephrotoxin at high concentrations, targeting the proximal tubules. This study uses transcriptomics and the previously reported apical data (Bondy et al., 2021) to infer mode-of-action of OTA toxicity in male and female rats exposed to low doses of OTA in utero and throughout development. Our findings support a male-specific activation of the innate and adaptive immune responses in F1 pups to OTA exposure. This was not found in the female F1 pups, and may be due to female-specific increased p38 activity and VDR signaling. Differentially expressed genes related to karyomegaly, MAPK activity, and immune activation appears to develop from in utero exposure to OTA whereas those related to decreased kidney and liver function, and changes to reproductive pathways occur in both rat generations. Together, these transcriptional results confirm that dietary exposure to OTA causes renal toxicity as well as alterations to hepatic and reproductive pathways in rats. In utero exposure of rats to OTA results in sex-specific alterations in immune response pathways, VDR signaling, and p38 activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aPenicillium 3acarcinogens 3adietary exposure 3afemales 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3aimmune response 3aliver function 3amales 3amaternal exposure 3anephrotoxicity 3aochratoxin A 3arats 3atoxicology 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 0aOchratoxin 0aToxicogenomics 0aFischer rat 0aKidney 0aGene ontology 0aPathway analysis 0aCon A 0aCYP450 0aDEGs 0aGO 0aGss 0aIPA 0aLPS 0aMAPK 0aMOA 0aNOAEL 0aNOEL 0aOTA 0aPND 0aVDR1 aBugiel, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7627-96481 aNunnikhoven, A.1 aVerster, A.J.1 aBondy, G.S.1 aCurran, I.H.A.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2022 Sept., v. 167 p.113302-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2022.1133023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245016900167300001600336520092700352592002801279650001901307650002701326650002001353650002101373650002501394650002701419650002601446650001201472650002601484650002501510650001801535650001001553650001101563650003501574650001601609650004401625651001001669653001201679653001101691653001501702653001801717653001601735653001801751653001601769653004401785700002301829700002101852700002201873700002301895700002301918700002901941700002201970773011001992856007902102852000902181655001202190IND60522633320221121032725.0160807e20160701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052263332DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2016.00272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFratianni, Florinda10aBiochemical Characterization and Antimicrobial and Antifungal Activity of Two Endemic Varieties of Garlic (Allium sativum L.) of the Campania Region, Southern Italy  ap. 686-691.  aExtracts of the bulbs of the two endemic varieties “Rosato” and “Caposele” of Allium sativum of the Campania region, Southern Italy, were analyzed.

The amount of ascorbic acid and allicin in the two extracts was similar. Polyphenol extract exhibited antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and (only by the extract of Rosato) against Bacillus cereus. The extract of Caposele was more effective in inhibiting the growth of Aspergillus versicolor and Penicillum citrinum.

This metal is an endocrine disruptor, and one well established role in teleosts is the suppression of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated cortisol biosynthesis by the interrenal tissue. However the mechanism(s) leading to this steroid suppression is poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that cadmium targets genes encoding proteins critical for corticosteroid biosynthesis, including melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). To test this, head kidney slices (containing the interrenal tissues) were incubated in vitro with cadmium chloride (0, 10, 100 and 1000nM) for 4h either in the presence or absence of ACTH (0.5IU/mL). In the unstimulated head kidney slices, cadmium exposure did not affect basal cortisol secretion and the mRNA levels of MC2R and P450scc, while StAR gene expression was significantly reduced. Cadmium exposure significantly suppressed ACTH-stimulated cortisol production in a dose-related fashion. This cadmium-mediated suppression in corticosteroidogenesis corresponded with a significant reduction in MC2R, StAR and P450scc mRNA levels in trout head kidney slices. The inhibition of ACTH-stimulated cortisol production and suppression of genes involved in corticosteroidogenesis by cadmium were completely abolished in the presence of 8-Bromo-cAMP (a cAMP analog). Overall, cadmium disrupts the expression of genes critical for corticosteroid biosynthesis in rainbow trout head kidney slices. However, the rescue of cortisol production as well as StAR and P450scc gene expressions by cAMP analog suggests that cadmium impact occurs upstream of cAMP production. We propose that MC2R signaling, the primary step in ACTH-induced cortocosteroidogenesis, is a key target for cadmium-mediated disruption of cortisol production in trout.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aaquatic environment 3abiosynthesis 3acadmium 3acorticotropin 3acortisol 3acytochrome P-450 3agene expression 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3asecretion 3atrout 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxtoxicity 2aCholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzymexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEndocrine Disruptorsxtoxicity 2aFish Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aHydrocortisonexantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aKidneyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aOncorhynchus mykissxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhosphoproteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aReceptor, Melanocortin, Type 2xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSuppression, Genetic 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aVijayan, Mathilakath M.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2011 May, v. 103, no. 1-2 p.92-100dElsevier B.V.x0166-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2011.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245014400174300001600318520113500334592002801469650001401497650004401511650001101555650002201566650001201588650002101600650001401621650001801635650003301653650001401686650002701700650001401727653003101741653001401772653001301786700005801799773013501857856008701992852000902079655001202088IND60622687120221122055355.0190131e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062268712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.1812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiang, Chia-Fang10aEffect of enzyme-assisted extraction on the physicochemical properties of mucilage from the fronds of Asplenium australasicum (J.

Thus, mucilage from Asplenium australasicum was extracted with xylanase, glucanase and simultaneous application of both enzymatic preparations then investigated for their physicochemical properties. It was observed that compared to the control, the yield of mucilage increased significantly by EAE (from 3.64% to 6.04–6.86%), while the average molecular weight also increased slightly. SEM results showed that enzymes can erode the raw material which contributed to the higher extraction efficiency of polysaccharide. Furthermore, EAE modified the monosaccharide composition profile of A. australasicum mucilage considerably, especially there was a significant increase in glucose and galacturonic acid content. Although the FT-IR fingerprint did not change pronouncedly due to the action of the enzymes, but the degree of polysaccharide branching seemed to be more complicated, thus significantly reducing the intrinsic viscosity and water holding capacity of mucilage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsplenium 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3afronds 3agalacturonic acid 3aglucose 3amolecular weight 3amucilages 3araw materials 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aviscosity 3awater holding capacity 3axylanases 0aEnzyme-assisted extraction 0aGlucanase 0aXylanase1 aLai, Lih-Shiuh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5741-10840 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 124 p.346-353dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.1813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002200156245006900178300001800247500002000265500001500285520148000300592002801780650000901808650002201817650001001839650001101849650001201860650002601872650002301898650001401921650001301935650001101948650001201959650001401971650002501985650002002010650002402030650001702054650002002071651001702091651002302108651001702131653001102148653001802159700002202177773009902199852000902298856007302307655001202380IND4431194320221122045315.0160620e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443119432DNAL7 a199678602pmid7 a10.1890/08-1957.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrving, Andrew D.10aTrait‐dependent modification of facilitation on cobble beaches  ap. 3042-3050.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aFundamental gaps remain in our knowledge of how positive species interactions, such as facilitation and mutualism, structure and maintain populations and communities. Foundation species create extensive biogenic habitats, but we know little of how their traits, such as density, age, and patch size, modify their ability to facilitate other species. We tested the role of facilitator traits in cobble beach plant communities in New England, USA. In this system, intertidal beds of the cordgrass Spartina alterniflora facilitate populations of halophytic forbs at higher shore elevations by buffering wave action, stabilizing cobbles, and limiting physical disturbance. Using descriptive and experimental techniques, we tested the hypotheses that (1) the density and height of cordgrass shoots modify the strength of the cordgrass–forb facilitation, and (2) cordgrass peat alone contributes to the facilitation of forbs. Increased shoot density, as well as the combination of cordgrass peat and shoots, positively affected two life history stages (seedling and adult) of the abundant forb Suaeda linearis, demonstrating that cordgrass traits modify the strength of facilitation in this system. Since the expression of traits varies within and among patches of any given foundation species, traits can and should be used to predict the strength of facilitation, to guide the development of conservation strategies, and to develop more accurate models of species interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3apeat 3aplant communities 3aforbs 3ashoots 3abeaches 3aSpartina alterniflora 3apopulation density 3amutualism 3ahabitats 3aSuaeda 2aAnimals 2aEcosystem 2aFabaceaexphysiology 2aOceans and Seas 2aPoaceaexphysiology 2aTime Factors 2aWater Movements 3aRhode Island 3aNew England region 0aRhode Island 0atraits 0aplant ecology1 aBertness, Mark D.0 tEcology.g2009 Nov., v. 90, no. 11 p.3042-3050dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-1957.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03320naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245011400176300001800290500002000308500001500328520182900343592002802172650001502200650002202215650001102237650001702248650001002265650001302275650002202288650001802310650001802328650002602346650003102372650001402403650002202417650003602439650001702475650002202492651001102514651001102525653001902536700002202555700002402577700002002601773009902621852000902720856007302729655001202802IND4431194620221122045321.0160620e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443119462DNAL7 a199678632pmid7 a10.1890/08-0813.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVitousek, Peter10aLandscape‐level variation in forest structure and biogeochemistry across a substrate age gradient in Hawaii  ap. 3074-3086.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aWe compared forest canopy heights and nitrogen concentrations in long‐term research sites and in 2 × 2 km landscapes surrounding these sites along a substrate age gradient in the Hawaiian Islands. Both remote airborne and ground‐based measurements were used to characterize processes that control landscape‐level variation in canopy properties. We integrated a waveform light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system, a high‐resolution imaging spectrometer, and a global positioning system/inertial measurement unit to provide highly resolved images of ground topography, canopy heights, and canopy nitrogen concentrations (1) within a circle 50 m in radius focused on a long‐term study site in the center of each landscape; (2) for the entire 2 × 2 km landscape regardless of land cover; and (3) after stratification, for our target cover class, native‐dominated vegetation on constructional geomorphic surfaces throughout each landscape. Remote measurements at all scales yielded the same overall patterns as did ground‐based measurements in the long‐term sites. The two younger landscapes supported taller trees than did older landscapes, while the two intermediate‐aged landscapes had higher canopy nitrogen (N) concentrations than did either young or old landscapes. However, aircraft‐based analyses detected substantial variability in canopy characteristics on the landscape level, even within the target cover class. Canopy heights were more heterogeneous on the older landscapes, with coefficients of variation increasing from 23–41% to 69–78% with increasing substrate age. This increasing heterogeneity was associated with a larger patch size of canopy turnover and with dominance of most secondary successional stands by the mat‐forming fern Dicranopteris linearis in the older landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3atopography 3alandscape ecology 3acanopy 3aforest trees 3alidar 3anitrogen 3asecondary forests 3aforest stands 3aDicranopteris 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aglobal positioning systems 2aEcosystem 2aFernsxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 2aTreesxphysiology 3aHawaii 0aHawaii 0aforest ecology1 aAsner, Gregory P.1 aChadwick, Oliver A.1 aHotchkiss, Sara0 tEcology.g2009 Nov., v. 90, no. 11 p.3074-3086dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0813.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02672naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006400168300001800232520153500250592002801785650002101813650002601834650001101860650002301871650001401894650001501908650002501923650000901948650001201957650001701969650002101986650001102007700002202018700002402040700002702064773009302091856008102184852000902265655001202274IND60119091820221122220333.0141130e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011909182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-014-0366-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGantes, Patricia10aPlant secondary succession age-related changes in landfills  ap. 1209-1218.  aSanitary landfills are widely used for large-scale final disposal of municipal wastes. The material covering the wastes is diverse in nature and bears propagules of different plant species, which develops spontaneously on the sites after waste disposal stops. The aim of this study was to detect the main patterns of vegetation secondary succession over the landfill cells, despite the differences in area and surface work intensity at the landfills. Over the span of two years, eight samplings were carried out on each of the 13 cells from the three active landfills in Buenos Aires. The relative cover for each plant species and the soil’s mechanic resistance were registered. The vegetation cover reached 80 % after five years and a decrease in soil´s mechanic resistance was observed 5 years after closure. Regarding the floristic composition of the assemblages, most of the herbaceous species found were native (42 %) and perennials (62 %). The dominant species in all the cells was Cynodon dactylon. The heterogeneity of the assemblages between the three places prevented the configuration of an age linked pattern. However, some regularities arise: exotics are dominant along the whole succession; meanwhile, natives gain in proportionality consistently with the age of the cells. Most of the dominant species are characteristic of perturbed environments, but in the oldest cells some species belong to the climax pampean steppe; so, an orientated human intervention would be necessary to achieve a dominance of natives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3abotanical composition 3ahumans 3aintroduced species 3alandfills 3aperennials 3asecondary succession 3asoil 3asteppes 3asurface area 3avegetation cover 3awastes1 aFalco, Liliana B.1 aCoviella, Carlos E.1 aCaro, Aníbal Sánchez0 tUrban ecosystems.g2014 Dec., v. 17, no. 4 p.1209-1218dSpringer-Verlagx1083-81557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-014-0366-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03234naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012000167520151200287592002801799650002801827650001401855650002101869650001601890650002401906650001401930650001401944650001601958650003001974650000902004650002102013650001602034650001802050650001502068650001402083650001502097650001402112650001502126650001602141653003502157653000902192653001802201653001902219653002202238700001502260700001702275700001602292700002002308700001802328700001802346700001802364700005802382773011302440856008202553852000902635655001202644IND60783406220221122030819.0220809e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078340622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2022.1133082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yun-tʻing,10aLactobacillus plantarum WSJ-06 alleviates neurobehavioral injury induced by lead in mice through the gut microbiota  aChronic lead exposure can result in cognitive dysfunction and behavioral disorders. However, the current treatments for alleviating lead poisoning have many side effects. Previous studies have suggested that probiotics may have the potential to ameliorate neurotoxicity caused by lead exposure. This study determines the alleviating effects of Lactobacillus plantarum WSJ-06 on neurological disorders induced by chronic lead exposure from the perspective of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites. The results showed that treatment with Lactobacillus plantarum WSJ-06 alleviated memory dysfunction and reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum and hippocampus induced by lead exposure. In addition, Lactobacillus plantarum WSJ-06 partially restored the lead-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis. It also increased the proportion of some beneficial metabolites in the serum, such as arachidonic acid, tryptophan hydroxylase, serotonin, vitamin B12, trehalose, and kynurenic acid, and decreased some metabolites in the serum, such as LPS 20:5 and L-kynurenine. A correlation analysis further indicated that lead-induced neurobehavioral disorders were related to intestinal microbiota (the [Eubacterium]_siraeum_group, Roseburia, Lactobacillus, etc) and serum metabolites (LPS 20:5, serotonin, vitamin B12, etc). In conclusion, Lactobacillus plantarum WSJ-06 alleviated neuroinflammation and memory impairment caused by lead exposure by modulating the gut microbiota and metabolites in the serum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aRoseburia 3aarachidonic acid 3ablood serum 3acognitive disorders 3acytokines 3adysbiosis 3ahippocampus 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alead 3amemory disorders 3ametabolites 3aneurotoxicity 3aprobiotics 3aserotonin 3atoxicology 3atrehalose 3atryptophan 3avitamin B12 0aLactobacillus plantarum WSJ-06 0aLead 0aNeurotoxicity 0aGut microbiota 0aSerum metabolites1 aLiu, Anfei1 aChen, Lixuan1 aXiang, Yang1 aHuang, Dingbang1 aHuang, Wanwen1 aChen, Zhenhui1 aFan, Hongying1 aMeng, Xiaojing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4327-44100 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2022 Sept., v. 167 p.113308-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2022.1133083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010300167300001400270520127000284592002801554650002501582650003001607650002601637650001001663650002001673650001901693650001001712650001101722650001201733650002201745650001701767650002601784700001601810700002601826700002301852700001901875700002301894773010601917852000902023856008102032930003302113946001102146655001202157IND60439175420221121014652.0151024e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043917542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-007-0054-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatō, Hiroaki,10aInvolvement of NbNOA1 in NO production and defense responses in INF1-treated Nicotiana benthamiana  ap. 15-23.  aDuring defense responses, plant cells produce nitric oxide (NO), which may control many physiological processes. In a previous study, we reported that nitrate reductase (NR) is responsible in part for INF1 elicitor-induced NO production in Nicotiana benthamiana, but the possibility remains that other NO-generating system(s) contribute to NO production. In mammalian cells, NO production is catalyzed by NO synthase (NOS). However, NOS-like enzyme(s) have never been identified in plants, and only the gene for Arabidopsis thaliana nitric oxide-associated 1 (AtNOA1) has been identified as a putative regulator of NOS activity in plants. In this study, we cloned NbNOA1, a homolog of AtNOA1, from N. benthamiana and investigated its involvement in NO production induced by INF1. The NbNOA1 gene was silenced by a virus-induced gene-silencing (VIGS) technique. NbNOA1-silenced plants had yellowish leaves. Silencing NbNOA1 partially decreased INF1-induced NO production, while overexpressing NbNOA1 did not affect NO production. Silencing NbNOA1 suppressed INF1-induced PR1a gene expression and increased susceptibility to Colletotrichum lagenarium. These results suggest that NbNOA1 is involved in INF1-mediated NO production and is required for defense responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aColletotrichum orbiculare 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3acells 3agene expression 3agene silencing 3agenes 3aleaves 3amammals 3anitrate reductase 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase1 aAsai, Shuta1 aYamamoto-Katou, Ayako1 aYoshioka, Hirofumi1 aDoke, Noriyuki1 aKawakita, Kazuhito0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2008 Feb., v. 74, no. 1 p.15-23dSpringer Japanx1345-26307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-007-0054-43Available from publisher's site  a20080127b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01824naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245015700202520062700359592002800986650005001014650003001064650002001094650001401114650002001128650001801148650002601166653001401192653001801206653002201224653002001246700002401266773009401290856008101384852000901465655001201474IND60725101120221123031324.0210124e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072510112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1043502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOda, Hiroki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4424-988X10aMicroarray data on the comparison of transcript expression between normal and Pt-Delta RNAi embryos in the common house spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum  aWe conducted a custom microarray experiment to detect the differences in the transcript expression levels between untreated (normal) and Pt-Delta-RNAi embryos at late stage 6 in the common house spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum.

A simplified model was created to investigate the experimentally observed FTS and HC performance in the presence of larger amounts of liquid. It is assumed that part of the catalyst would be blocked if the liquid fraction exceeds a threshold. The liquid blocking would cause enlarged diffusion resistance or even inaccessible regions in the catalyst bed, particularly in microstructured reactors with broad flat channels such as the annular geometry of this study. Significant mass transfer limitation was observed for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis in the assumed liquid-filled spots. Hydrocracking exhibits limited response to internal diffusion limitation. Good agreement with experimental data was obtained here by assuming inaccessible local regions in the packed bed. Identical cross section-averaged effectiveness factors of 0.6–0.7 were obtained for the liquid-filled sections in both FTS and HC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFischer-Tropsch reaction 3acatalysts 3ageometry 3ahydrocarbons 3aliquids 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aprocess design1 aLuo, Zhuohui1 aChoudhary, Akash1 aPfeifer, Peter1 aDittmeyer, Roland1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3110-69890 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 56, no. 45 p.13075-13085dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b013263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010200164300001600266520132800282592002801610650001401638650001201652650001501664650002201679700001501701700001201716700001701728700001701745773011001762856008101872852000901953655001201962IND60515192620221120230906.0160312e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051519262DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-015-1905-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Fucheng10aRational Substitution of Surface Acidic Residues for Enhancing the Thermostability of Thermolysin  ap. 725-738.  aSolvent-exposed acidic/amide residue (Asp/Glu or Asn/Gln) exerts great effects on the thermostability of protein; however, experimental attempts appear to be time-consuming, so a more scientific, simple, and effective rational strategy is necessary. In this study, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was performed to analyze two surface acidic residues (Asp37 and Glu119) of thermolysin (TLN) in mediating its thermostability. Root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) was calculated to evaluate the thermosensitivity effect by acidic/amide substitutions. The wild-type TLN and three mutants (TLM1, TLM2, and TLM) presented significantly different thermostability effect. Four profiles of RMSD values demonstrated that the thermal insensitivity of variants were TLM2 > TLM > TLN > TLM1. As expected, the thermostability and half-life (at 60 °C) behavior of enzyme variants showed the same trends with the computational predictions, and it was worth noting that the half-life of TLM2 showed 3.1-fold longer than that of wild-type. The T ₘ and T ₅₀ of TLM2 were 9 and 7 °C higher, respectively, than that of wild-type enzyme. Rational substitution of acidic/amide residue in regulation of thermostability using MD simulation would be an efficient approach for instructional design to improve the thermostability.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahalf life 3amutants 3aprediction 3athermal stability1 aZhuang, Yu1 aWu, Bin1 aLi, Jiahuang1 aHe, Bingfang0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2016 Feb., v. 178, no. 4 p.725-738dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-015-1905-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245009300162300002000255520107700275592002801352650001501380650001601395650001901411650001301430650002401443650001101467650001901478650001001497650001901507700001701526700005401543700001701597773017301614856008001787852000901867655001201876IND60600959920221122002745.0180705e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060095992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b013272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Dang10aNumerical Simulation of Turbulent Flow and Mixing in Gas–Liquid–Liquid Stirred Tanks  ap. 13050-13063.  aThe turbulent flow and macro-mixing processes in gas–liquid–liquid stirred vessels agitated by a Rushton turbine have been numerically simulated, based on the Eulerian multifluid approach. Both the isotropic k–ε model and anisotropic Reynolds stress model are used for turbulence modeling. The numerical models are validated by comparing simulated flow field of agitated immiscible liquid–liquid dispersions to the corresponding experimental data from the literature. The predicted time traces of normalized concentration of inertial tracer and mixing time in gas–liquid–liquid stirred tanks are compared to the experimentally measured ones as well. Both turbulence models correspond reasonably well to the experimental data in liquid–liquid and gas–liquid–liquid stirred tanks, and the Reynolds stress model produces better results, in terms of flow field, homogenization curve, and mixing time, than the k–ε model. The information reported in this work is useful for chemical/process engineers when undertaking relevant engineering process designs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3adispersions 3ahomogenization 3aisotropy 3amathematical models 3amixing 3aprocess design 3atanks 3aturbulent flow1 aWang, Steven1 aYang, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6067-75051 aMao, Zai-Sha0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 56, no. 45 p.13050-13063dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b013273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002800156245009300184300001800277500002000295520111800315592002801433650001401461650002501475650002101500650001601521650003201537650002301569650001701592650001501609650003001624650001201654650004201666650001501708650002301723650003001746650002401776650002301800650002501823650001201848650001701860650002801877700002401905700002001929700003101949700002001980773009902000852000902099856007302108655001202181IND4431194820221122045447.0160620e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443119482DNAL7 a199678652pmid7 a10.1890/08-2377.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteiner, Christopher F.10aPeriodically forced food‐chain dynamics: model predictions and experimental validation  ap. 3099-3107.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDespite the recognition of the importance of seasonal forcing in nature, remarkably few studies have theoretically explored periodically forced community dynamics. Here we employ a novel approach called “successional state dynamics” (SSD) to model a seasonally forced predator–prey system. We first generated analytical predictions of the effects of altered seasonality on species persistence and the timing of community state transitions. We then parameterized the model using a zooplankton–phytoplankton system and tested quantitative predictions using controlled experiments. In the majority of cases, timing of zooplankton and algal population peaks matched model predictions. Decreases in growing‐period length delayed algal blooms, consequently delaying peaks in zooplankton abundance. Predictions of increased probability of predator extinction at low growing‐period lengths were also upheld experimentally. Our results highlight the utility of the SSD modeling approach as a framework for predicting the effects of altered seasonality on the structure and dynamics of multitrophic communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood webs 3aenvironmental models 3amodel validation 3azooplankton 3apredator-prey relationships 3aseasonal variation 3aalgal blooms 3aprediction 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 2aAnimals 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixphysiology 2aFood Chain 2aModels, Biological 2aPhytoplanktonxphysiology 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aPredatory Behavior 2aRotiferaxphysiology 2aSeasons 2aTime Factors 2aZooplanktonxphysiology1 aSchwaderer, Anne S.1 aHuber, Veronika1 aKlausmeier, Christopher A.1 aLitchman, Elena0 tEcology.g2009 Nov., v. 90, no. 11 p.3099-3107dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-2377.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02546naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245006300165300001800228520161400246592002801860650001001888650001301898650001301911650001701924650001301941650001401954650001601968650002901984650000902013700002102022773010802043856004802151852000902199655001202208IND4466516620221118124524.0121003e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446651662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-011-0945-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEntry, James A.10aMatrix-Based Fertilizers Reduce Pesticide Leaching in Soil  ap. 1295-1302.  aThe presence of pesticides in groundwater has been documented in several large-scale studies and numerous small-scale investigations. Pesticide leaching through soil has been identified as a major cause for the occurrence of these chemicals in surface and groundwater. We developed matrix-based fertilizers (MBFs) that have been shown to reduce N and P leaching. We tested the efficacy of the ionic bonds in the MBFs to reduce 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), metolachlor, thiophanate methyl, carbaryl, diazinon, and malathion leaching in soil columns. After 7 days 2,4-D, thiophanate methyl, carbaryl, and malathion did not leach in sufficient quantities to determine if the MBF fertilizers reduced leaching compared with the control and the slow-release fertilizer Polyon®. The MBF fertilizers leached from five to 30 times less metolachlor than the control and Polyon® treatment. Treatments with MBF fertilizers leached from two to 72 times less diazinon than the control treatment. The MBF fertilizer treatment leached from eight to 268 less diazinon than columns receiving Polyon®. The MBF formulations allow compounds with both anionic and cationic charges to bind with the Al(SO4)3 3H2O and/or Fe2(SO4)3 3H2O-lignin-cellulose matrix. When pesticides are added to the soil amended with matrix-based fertilizers, the ion exchange matrix will likely bind the metolachlor and diazinon to the Al(SO4)3 3H2O and/or Fe2(SO4)3 3H2O-starch-cellulose-lignin matrix thereby substantially reducing leaching. The MBFs could be used to limit both nutrients and pesticide leaching from agricultural fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3acarbaryl 3adiazinon 3aion exchange 3aleaching 3amalathion 3ametolachlor 3aslow-release fertilizers 3asoil1 aSojka, Robert E.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2012 Mar., v. 223, no. 3 p.1295-1302dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-011-0945-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245015700171300001800328500001500346520157200361592002801933650002101961650002001982650001602002650001102018650001402029650002102043650000902064650001002073650001302083650001602096650001202112650003702124653002002161700002402181700002102205700002002226700002202246773010102268856008802369990002302457852000902480655001202489IND60098504320221120021518.0141104e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009850432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ho-Joon10aIn vitro maturation (IVM) of murine and human germinal vesicle (GV)–stage oocytes by coculture with immortalized human fallopian tube epithelial cells  ap. 1344-1348.  a2019-12-06  aOBJECTIVE: To improve the maturation rate of murine and human germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes using human tubal epithelial cells (hTECs). DESIGN: Murine and human GV oocytes were randomized to human tubal fluid (HTF) media alone or cocultured with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or primary hTECs or immortalized hTECS (ihTECs) for various times. Rates of maturation to meiosis II (MII) were compared between groups. INTERVENTION(S): TECs were isolated from discarded salpingectomy specimens. One batch was immortalized with TERT and SV40 large T-antigen. GV oocytes (n = 710) were isolated from 8-week-old-mice at 40 hours after pregnant mare’s serum gonadotropin stimulation. Discarded human GV oocytes (n = 62) were obtained from intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycle IVF center patients. Oocytes were cultured in HTF media alone or with MEFs, hTECs, or ihTECs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Maturation rates were assessed by standard morphological criteria and compared. RESULT(S): The maturation rate of murine GV oocytes to MII at 12 and 24 hours increased significantly in coculture with hTECS and ihTECS compared with MEF and HTF media alone. In addition, the development rate after IVF was significantly higher with hTECS and ihTECS than in MEF and HTF media alone. Maturation of human GV oocytes to MII at 24 and 48 hours was significantly higher in hTECS and ihTECS compared with HTF media alone. CONCLUSION(S): Coculture with either primary or immortalized TECs might improve oocyte quality and significantly raise in vitro maturation rates for GV oocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3agerminal vesicle 3afallopian tubes 3ablood serum 3ahumans 3acoculture 3aepithelial cells 3amice 3amares 3apatients 3afibroblasts 3ameiosis 3aintracytoplasmic sperm injection 0aFallopian tubes1 aQuaas, Alexander M.1 aWright, Diane L.1 aToth, Thomas L.1 aTeixeira, Jose M.0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 95, no. 4 p.1344-1348dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.08.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01895naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245011200159300002000271520088400291592002801175650002201203650001301225650001101238650002201249700001901271700001901290700005901309773013701368856007901505852000901584655001201593IND60718141220220413000000.0201120e20200921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071814122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c015142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Zeyu10aIsolable Phosphaalkenes Bearing 2,4,6-Trimethoxyphenyl and 2,6-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl as P-Substituents  ap. 14643-14652.  aThe multistep synthesis and characterization of new P═C analogues of olefins from readily available starting materials is reported.

The study documented changes in the soil seed-bank along riparian corridors before and after a major flood event in January 2011 in southeast Queensland, Australia. The study site was a major river (the Mooleyember creek) near Roma, Central Queensland impacted by the extreme flood event and where baseline ecological data on riparian seed-bank populations have previously been collected in 2007, 2008 and 2009. After the major flood event, we collected further soil samples from the same locations in spring/summer (November–December 2011) and in early autumn (March 2012). Thereafter, the soils were exposed to adequate warmth and moisture under glasshouse conditions, and emerged seedlings identified taxonomically. Flooding increased seed-bank abundance but decreased its species richness and diversity. However, flood impact was less than that of yearly effect but greater than that of seasonal variation. Seeds of trees and shrubs were few in the soil, and were negatively affected by the flood; those of herbaceous and graminoids were numerous and proliferate after the flood. Seed-banks of weedy and/or exotic species were no more affected by the flood than those of native and/or non-invasive species. Overall, the studied riparian zone showed evidence of a quick recovery of its seed-bank over time, and can be considered to be resilient to an extreme flood event.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3aburied seeds 3agraminoids 3ahabitats 3aintroduced species 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3astreams 3asummer 3atrees 3avegetation 3aQueensland1 aAli, Sadiq1 aNguyen, Hang T.,1 aPerrett, Christine1 aShabbir, Asad1 aNavie, Sheldon1 aBelgeri, Amalia1 aDhileepan, K.1 aAdkins, Steve0 tEcological research.g2014 Nov., v. 29, no. 6 p.1115-1129dSpringer-Verlagx0912-38147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-014-1198-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245017400173300001600347520135200363592002801715650002201743650001501765650001501780650001401795650002101809650001301830650001501843650001701858650001401875650001401889650001901903650001101922650001801933650000701951650002301958650001601981650001901997653001902016653001502035653002802050700002302078700002002101700001502121773013502136856008702271852000902358655001202367IND60622687920221122064408.0220214e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062268792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoukhalfa, Nadia10aKinetics, thermodynamics, equilibrium isotherms, and reusability studies of cationic dye adsorption by magnetic alginate/oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes composites  ap. 539-548.  aMagnetic beads (AO-γ-Fe₂O₃) of alginate (A) impregnated with citrate coated maghemite nanoparticles (γ-Fe₂O₃) and oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (OMWCNTs) were synthesized and used as adsorbent for the removal of methylene blue from water. The XRD analysis revealed that the diameter of γ-Fe₂O₃ is 10.24 nm. The mass saturation magnetization of AO-γ-Fe₂O₃ and γ-Fe₂O₃ were found to be 27.16 and 42.63 emu·g⁻¹, respectively. The adsorption studies revealed that the data of MB isotherm were well fitted to the Freundlich model. The Langmuir isotherm model exhibited a maximum adsorption capacity of 905.5 mg·g⁻¹. The adsorption was very dependent on initial concentration, adsorbent dose, and temperature. The beads exhibited high adsorption stability in large domain of pH (4–10). The thermodynamic parameters determined at 283, 293, 303, and 313 K revealed that the adsorption occurring was spontaneous and endothermic in nature. Adsorption kinetic data followed the intraparticle diffusion model. The AO-γ-Fe₂O₃ beads were used for six cycles without significant adsorptive performance loss. Therefore, the eco-friendly prepared AO-γ-Fe₂O₃ beads were considered as highly recyclable and efficient adsorbent for methylene blue as they can be easily separated from water after treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aalginates 3acarbon nanotubes 3acitrates 3aendothermy 3aferric oxide 3amaghemite 3amagnetism 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aMethylene blue 0aAdsorption 0aMagnetic alginate beads1 aBoutahala, Mokhtar1 aDjebri, Nassima1 aIdris, Ani0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 123 p.539-548dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146040001800165100002200183245015200205300001600357506007600373520140900449592002801858506003701886650002301923650001401946650001101960650001301971650001401984650001101998650001702009650002702026650001302053700002402066700002502090700001802115773009102133856008202224852000902306655001202315IND4487143620221207081500.0120502e20120222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448714362DNAL7 a10.1098/rspb.2011.10352doi7 aPMC32487222pmcid7 a217528202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuill-Stephan, E.10aHigh potential for formation and persistence of chimeras following aggregated larval settlement in the broadcast spawning coral, Acropora millepora  ap. 699-708.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn sessile modular marine invertebrates, chimeras can originate from fusions of closely settling larvae or of colonies that come into contact through growth or movement. While it has been shown that juveniles of brooding corals fuse under experimental conditions, chimera formation in broadcast spawning corals, the most abundant group of reef corals, has not been examined. This study explores the capacity of the broadcast spawning coral Acropora millepora to form chimeras under experimental conditions and to persist as chimeras in the field. Under experimental conditions, 1.5-fold more larvae settled in aggregations than solitarily, and analyses of nine microsatellite loci revealed that 50 per cent of juveniles tested harboured different genotypes within the same colony. Significantly, some chimeric colonies persisted for 23 months post-settlement, when the study ended. Genotypes within persisting chimeric colonies all showed a high level of relatedness, whereas rejecting colonies displayed variable levels of relatedness. The nearly threefold greater sizes of chimeras compared with solitary juveniles, from settlement through to at least three months, suggest that chimerism is likely to be an important strategy for maximizing survival of vulnerable early life-history stages of corals, although longer-term studies are required to more fully explore the potential benefits of chimerism.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcropora millepora 3achimerism 3acorals 3agenotype 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3alife history 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aspawning1 avan Oppen, M.

Using aqueous electrolytes, usually high ion concentrations are required to generate high capacitances and power densities. Herein, we report an anomalous electrochemical charge storage behavior of supercapacitors in a very diluted electrolyte and even pure water, enabled by a densely N- and O-doped ultra-hydrophilic carbon (DUT-108). Minimizing the electrolyte concentration from 1 down to 0.001 M, the capacitance of DUT-108 only decreases from 192 to 147 F/g; while a commercially available model carbon (ROX) decreases considerably in capacitances (i.e., 90 to 32 F/g). More interestingly, when using water, DUT-108 still reaches 137 F/g in contrast to hydrophobic ROX (27 F/g). Impedance analysis further confirms low resistance change by showing a significantly higher ion diffusion ability of charge carriers within DUT-108. We hypothesize that this phenomenon could be driven by proton hopping on the amphoteric N- and O-groups and the abrupt passing of protons to neighboring water molecules. These findings are quite interesting, since water is environmentally friendly, safe and biocompatible as compared with corrosive acid/base and organic electrolytes. Therefore, the proof-of-concept pure water electrolyte could open new avenues for applications in bioelectronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3ahydrophobicity 0aCarbon 0aDoping 0aSupercapacitors 0aElectrode materials 0aAqueous electrolytes1 aXu, Fei1 aPaasch, Silvia1 aKensy, Christian1 aZhai, Yi Xuan1 aYang, Jiaying1 aBrunner, Eike1 aKaskel, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4572-03030 tCarbon.g2021 June 30, v. 178 p.540-551dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245013700165300001600302520124700318592002801565650001801593650001301611650001201624650001101636650001201647650001201659650001101671650002601682650001701708650001501725650000901740650001001749650000901759650001101768650001801779650001401797650001401811650001501825650001501840650002901855650001401884650001301898650000901911651001601920700001701936700002101953773012901974856007402103852000902177655001202186IND60617724620221118005500.0181026e20180221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061772462DNAL7 a10.1039/c7em00477j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCouture, Raoul-Marie10aEmerging investigator series: geochemistry of trace elements associated with Fe and Mn nodules in the sediment of limed boreal lakes  ap. 406-414.  aThousands of boreal lakes were limed for decades in Scandinavia to counteract the effect of anthropogenic acidification. We measured the concentrations of alkali earth metals (Ca, Mg, Ba), metals (Mn, Fe, Al, Co, Cd, Pb, Zn), metalloids (As, Mo) and phosphorus (P) in 165 surface sediment samples from 17 limed lakes, as well as the sediment column and porewater of two lakes chosen from this set. We report that formation of ferromanganese nodules is widespread in limed lakes, and that those nodules are enriched in trace elements, reaching for example 11 500, 908 and 40 μg g⁻¹ for Ba, Mo and As, respectively. Nodules are more abundant between the littoral and the profundal zones. Intense redox cycling of Fe and Mn at the sediment–water interface has redistributed trace elements in the sediment column. Ba, Co, Mo, Pb and Zn partitioned with Mn (oxy)hydroxides and As and P with Fe (oxy)hydroxides. Fe, Mo, Co and As remobilized to the porewater also diffused downward and were likely sequestrated with sulfides. We conclude that the diagenetic redistribution and partitioning of trace elements onto Fe–Mn nodules, rather than direct inputs from liming, is the cause of the elevated trace element burden in surface sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3abarium 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acobalt 3aenvironmental science 3ageochemistry 3ahydroxides 3airon 3alakes 3alead 3aliming 3alittoral zone 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3aphosphorus 3asediment-water interface 3asediments 3asulfides 3azinc 3aScandinavia1 aHindar, Atle1 aRognerud, Sigurd0 tEnvironmental science.g2018 Feb. 21, v. 20, no. 2 p.406-414dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7em00477j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245010900178300001400287520107800301592002801379650001401407650001001421650002401431650001301455650001501468650002201483650001401505651000901519653002101528653000901549653001701558653001401575653002001589653002601609700001501635700003201650773012101682856005101803852000901854655001201863IND50086606820221116174622.0140412e20110314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008660682DNAL7 a10.1080/01650521.2010.5465672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRíos, Steven Sevillano10aBird species richness, diversity and abundance in Polylepis woodlands, Huascaran biosphere reserve, Peru  ap. 69-76.  aWe examined patterns in bird community composition across a fragmented high-Andean Polylepis landscape currently afforded protection within the Huascaran Biosphere Reserve, Peru. Across five different locations we found significant between-site differences in all broad habitat characteristics, where Polylepis woodlands dominated the landscape, surrounded by a non-woodland puna matrix. Bird species richness and relative abundance was greatest in medium-sized woodlands whereas bird diversity was surprisingly greatest in significantly smaller woodland areas. All five sites were home to subpopulations of 14 conservation-important species, but the number and type of species varied. Our study confirms that the Huascaran Biosphere Reserve represents a critical area for high-Andean bird conservation. Further quantitative landscape evidence on the influence of the surrounding matrix, the Polylepis–matrix interface, and woodland habitat quality on bird community composition will be crucial in designing sustainable management strategies within the Biosphere Reserve.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosphere 3abirds 3acommunity structure 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aspecies diversity 3awoodlands 3aPeru 0abird communities 0aPeru 0apoint counts 0aPolylepis 0aprotected areas 0awoodland conservation1 aLloyd, Huw1 aValdés-Velásquez, Armando0 tStudies on neotropical fauna and environment.g2011 Mar. 14, v. 46, no. 1 p.69-76dTaylor & Francisx1744-51407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650521.2010.546567  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010300166300001600269520132600285592002801611650001101639650001101650650001801661650001701679650002101696650001101717650001101728650001601739653001101755653001601766653001801782653002501800653002701825653002101852700001701873700001201890700001901902700002001921700001301941700002101954700001701975700006001992773009002052856008502142852000902227655001202236IND60731296320221120224340.0220103e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073129632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Yi-Feng10aPre-oxidation of lignin precursors for hard carbon anode with boosted lithium-ion storage capacity  ap. 243-255.  aLignin-derived hard carbon (HC) has great potential as energy storage materials. However, it is difficult to obtain desired electrochemical performances by direct carbonization of lignin. Herein, we demonstrate a pre-oxidation strategy to enhance the reversible capacity of hard carbon with lignin as precursor. The pre-oxidation mechanism and its influence on the microstructures of the resulted hard carbon are systematically studied. Based on in-situ FT-IR and ¹³C NMR spectrum, etc., it is confirmed that three dominant configurations of oxygen-containing functional groups are formed during the process, and the content of the desired carbonyl groups (CO) reaches a maximum value at a pre-oxidation temperature of 200 °C. Meanwhile, the alkyl groups are transformed into peroxides or alcohols, contributing to intermolecular cross-linkage within lignin. As a result, the obtained material with highly random orientation nanotexture gives a much larger d₀₀₂ and abundant porous structure. Benefiting from these structural merits, the optimized lignin-derived hard carbon enables excellent Li-ion storage performance with a reversible capacity of 584 mA h g⁻¹ at 50 mA g⁻¹. This work provides insights into the rational design of high-performance hard carbon anodes for Li-ion batteries and beyond.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3acrosslinking 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3alignin 3atemperature 0aLignin 0aHard carbon 0aPre-oxidation 0aStructural evolution 0aHigh specific capacity 0aLi-ion batteries1 aSun, Guo-Hua1 aLi, Yan1 aCheng, Jia-Yao1 aChen, Jing-Peng1 aSong, Ge1 aKong, Qing-Qiang1 aXie, Li-Jing1 aChen, Cheng-Meng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4259-99230 tCarbon.g2021 June 30, v. 178 p.243-255dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01807naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011500171300001600286520068800302592002800990650001401018650001301032650001401045650001701059650001201076650001801088651001401106653001401120653001601134653002201150653002301172653001701195700002101212773014001233856005101373852000901424655001201433IND50086607020221116175124.0140412e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008660702DNAL7 a10.1080/01650521.2011.5626852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBardi, Christian10aVoltinism in the melanopline grasshopper Dichroplus elongatus Giglio-Tos (Orthoptera: Acrididae: Melanoplinae)  ap. 143-145.  aAlthough Dichroplus elongatus is a common grasshopper of wide distribution and economic importance in southern South America, contradictory information still existed regarding its voltinism.

A cross-sectional study of undernourished children aged between 12 and 60 months in Kalembe-Lembe hospital was carried out. Blood samples were collected for the analyses of malaria parasite, haemoglobin and haematocrit levels. HIV serostatus was determined with rapid HIV antibody tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify clinical predictors of HIV seropositivity. Of 225 children, 88.9% had malaria; the parasite loads were 16 000 para per μL (38.0%); 24 400 para per μL (56.8%), P < 0.001 and malaria and associated HIV infection accounted for 29.2%. In children aged >12 months, HIV seroprevalence was 29.3%; 86.0% had undernutrition and malaria, 6.8% had undernutrition and HIV and 4.3% had undernutrition, HIV and malaria (P < 0.001). The occurrence of at least three or more symptoms was highly specific (96.4–100.0%) for HIV seropositivity (P < 0.05). The overall mortality rate was 18.4%, higher in children with malaria and HIV (39.6% vs 12.2%, P < 0.001) and those with lower weight gain (4.3 vs 7.5 g kg⁻¹ day⁻¹, P < 0.001). There was high prevalence of malaria and HIV and mortality among severely undernourished children with malaria and HIV.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHIV seropositivity 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aantibodies 3ablood sampling 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3ahospitals 3amalaria 3amalnutrition 3amixed infection 3amortality 3aparasite load 3aparasites 3aregression analysis 3aseroprevalence 3aweight gain 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo 0aCo-infection 0aHIV 0aparasite density 0aundernutrition1 aMahamane Salissou, MaibougeTanko1 aKaswiyi, Lufuluabo1 aGuan, Fei1 aLei, Jiahui0 tParasitology.g2020 Feb., v. 147, no. 2 p.248-253dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820190015133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006900140245008300209500002000292520129300312592002801605596007701633650001401710650002401724650001401748650001801762650001601780650000901796650001001805650002301815650002801838650001201866700004501878700006301923773014301986856007502129852000902204655001202213IND60784410120221122030933.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078441012DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.167312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilani, Talita Maira Goss1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5191-529210aThiamine as a new ingredient for obtaining textured soy protein with meat odor  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThiamine was used for producing textured soy protein (TSP) with meat odor. The effects of the moisture of soy protein concentrate (SPC) and screw speed on the physical, technological, and sensory characteristics of the TSP were evaluated and the effects of thiamine were evaluated on the same characteristics as well. The SPC moisture‐affected hue, protein solubility, emulsion stability, meat odor intensity, and ideal of the intensity of meat odor of TSP while the screw speed affected hue and emulsion stability. At the center point of the experimental design, the SPC moisture enhanced the intensity of the meat odor and the ideal of the intensity of the meat odor of TSP. The addition of thiamine enhanced all the sensory characteristics and did not impair the physical and technological properties of TSP. The use of thiamine before extrusion represents a new option as an ingredient for obtaining TSP with meat odor. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: Thiamine has been used for producing textured soy protein (TSP) and it improved the sensory characteristics related to the meat odor. The addition of thiamine did not impair the physical and technological properties of TSP. Such results are relevant to academia and to the food industry, contributing to the area of plant‐based foods.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013/24590‐1cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aemulsions 3aexperimental design 3aextrusion 3afood industry 3aingredients 3ameat 3aodors 3aprotein solubility 3asoy protein concentrate 3athiamin1 aMenis‐Henrique, Michele Eliza Cortazzo1 aConti, Ana Carolina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8139-96870 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2022 July, v. 46, no. 7 p.e16731-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.167313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013200169300001600301520131900317592002801636650001901664650002101683650002401704650001201728650001201740650001101752650002401763650001601787650001201803650001401815650003301829650002701862650001601889653000701905653001201912653000901924653000701933653001101940653001101951653000901962653000701971653000801978653000801986653000801994653000802002653000602010653000602016653000602022653000802028653000902036653000902045653003402054653003102088653003302119653001502152653001102167653004202178700001102220700001802231700001802249773011702267856008602384852000902470655001202479IND60605408320221120052917.0190620e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060540832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.06.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Xiao-Qian10aMicrowave and enzyme co-assisted aqueous two-phase extraction of polyphenol and lutein from marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) flower  ap. 296-302.  aIn this study, a novel method of simultaneous extraction and enrichment of total polyphenol (TP) and lutein from marigold flower was developed by microwave and enzyme co-assisted aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) (MEAATPE). In this study, ethanol/ammonium sulfate was chosen to construct aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) due to its fine partition and recycling behaviors. The optimal MEAATPE condition was obtained, that is, 28% (w/w), ethanol/20% (w/w) ammonium sulfate, 0.45 U/g enzyme concentration, enzymolysis time of 150 min, enzymolysis temperature of 45 °C, microwave time of 120 s, and microwave power of 270 W, by investigating the effects of ATPS composition and other factors on the yield of target products. Under this optimal condition, the yields of TP and lutein reached 84.61 and 7.32 mg/g with the corresponding recovery rates of 95.35% and 99.85%, respectively. Compared with enzyme-assisted ATPE, microwave-assisted ATPE, ATPE, and Soxhlet extraction (SE), the extraction yield of TP by MEAATPE was the highest, which is 71.14% higher than that of SE. Scanning electron microscopy analysis further showed an optative pretreatment effect of marigold flower powders. Thus, MEAATPE was an efficient, rapid, and environmental-friendly method used for the extraction of natural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTagetes erecta 3aammonium sulfate 3aenzymatic treatment 3aethanol 3aflowers 3alutein 3amicrowave treatment 3apolyphenols 3apowders 3arecycling 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolid phase extraction 3atemperature 0aTP 0aMEAATPE 0aATPS 0aSD 0aEAATPE 0aMAATPE 0aATPE 0aSE 0aAMD 0aMAE 0aEAE 0aDHP 0aY 0aR 0aK 0aSEM 0aIC50 0aDPPH 0aMicrowave-assisted extraction 0aEnzyme-assisted extraction 0aAqueous two-phase extraction 0aPolyphenol 0aLutein 0aScanning electron microscopy analysis1 aMa, Na1 aSun, Wei-Peng1 aDang, Yan-Yan0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 123 p.296-302dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.06.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245010800158300001800266520163000284592002801914650001501942650001401957650002301971650002501994650001902019650002102038650001502059650001302074650002302087650002502110650001302135650001402148650001902162700001802181700001602199700001402215700005202229773013602281856008102417852000902498655001202507IND60771487620221120133008.0220325e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077148762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c006322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Ke10aRevealing the Origin of Nitrogen Electroreduction Activity of Molybdenum Disulfide Supported Iron Atoms  ap. 5180-5188.  aDespite encouraging progress in electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) catalyst development, efficient NRR has proven extremely challenging to achieve in practice, underscoring the fact that N₂ is a highly stable, non-polar molecule. Hence, discovering electrocatalysts with considerable yields for NRR is highly desired. In this work, combining the state-of-the-art ab initio molecular dynamics and the computational standard hydrogen electrode method, we studied the thermodynamics and kinetics of NRR on Feₓ@MoS₂ (x = 1–3) electrocatalysts under an applied electrochemical environment. NH₂–NH₂ was determined to be an important intermediate, and its N–N bond breaking was proposed as the rate-determining step. On Fe₁@MoS₂, we demonstrated that the NRR activity of Fe₁@MoS₂ can be attributed to the electric field effect, which triggers the dynamical orientation of NH₂–NH₂ from side-on adsorption mode to end-on one. The induced interaction between the dipole moment of the titled N–N bond with the local electric field facilitates the N–N bond cleavage. On the contrary, such an electric field effect on Fe₂@MoS₂ and Fe₃@MoS₂ is minor. Two Fe sites synergistically interacting with NH₂–NH₂ leads to more efficient N–N bond activation than Fe₁@MoS₂. This work not only illuminates the NRR activity origin of single, double, and triple Fe sites supported by MoS₂ but also proposes two valuable strategies from the perspective of kinetics to accelerate the catalysis of NRR: one is by the electric field effect, the other is to use the synergistic effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acleavage (chemistry) 3aelectric field 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen 3amolecular dynamics 3amolybdenum disulfide 3anitrogen 3asynergism 3athermodynamics1 aWang, Feiteng1 aWei, Fenfei1 aZhao, Jia1 aLin, Sen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2288-54150 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 126, no. 11 p.5180-5188dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c006323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245012000165300001800285520132100303592002801624650001501652650002401667650001901691650001301710700001501723700001701738700002201755773012001777856008201897852000901979655001201988IND60568292320221120060625.0170504e20170504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056829232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b010282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Rongfeng10aDynamics in a Water Interfacial Boundary Layer Investigated with IR Polarization-Selective Pump–Probe Experiments  ap. 4530-4537.  aThe dynamics of water molecules near the surfactant interface in large Aerosol-OT reverse micelles (RMs) (w₀ = 16–25) was investigated with IR polarization-selective pump–probe experiments using the SeCN– anion as a vibrational probe. Linear absorption spectra of RMs (w₀ = 25–2) can be decomposed into the weighted sum of the SeCN– spectra in bulk water and the spectrum of the SeCN– anion interacting with the interfacial sulfonate head groups (w₀ = 1). The spectra of the large RMs, w₀ ≥ 16, are overwhelmingly dominated by the bulk water component. Anisotropy decays (orientational relaxation) of the anion for w₀ ≥ 16 displayed bulk water relaxation (1.4 and 4.5 ps) plus an additional slow decay with a time constant of ∼13 ps. The amplitude of the slow decay was too large to be associated with SeCN– in contact with the interface on the basis of the linear spectrum decomposition. The results indicate that the observed slow components arise from SeCN– in a water boundary layer, in which water molecules are perturbed by the interface but are not directly associated with it. This layer is the transition between water in direct contact with the interface and bulk water in the large RM cores. In the boundary layer, the water dynamics is slow compared to that in bulk water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanionic surfactants 3adirect contact 3amicelles1 aYan, Chang1 aNishida, Jun1 aFayer, Michael D.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 May 04, v. 121, no. 17 p.4530-4537dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.7b010283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001900187245015600206300001800362506007600380520095400456592002801410506003701438650001001475650001601485650004901501650001301550650002301563650001601586700002001602700002401622700002401646700002101670700002001691700003101711700001901742700002101761700002301782773013501805856008001940852000902020655001202029IND60568292420221207091636.0171004e20170504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056829242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b010502doi7 aPMC56289102pmcid7 a284225042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerolin, Marco10aIntegrated Computational Approach to the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Characterization of Rigid 310-Helical Peptides with TOAC Nitroxide Spin Labels  ap. 4379-4387.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe address the interpretation, via an integrated computational approach, of the experimental continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (cw-EPR) spectra of a complete set of conformationally highly restricted, stable 3₁₀-helical peptides from hexa- to nonamers, each bis-labeled with nitroxide radical-containing TOAC (4-amino-1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-4-carboxylic acid) residues. The usefulness of TOAC for this type of analysis has been shown already to be due to its cyclic piperidine side chain, which is rigidly connected to the peptide backbone α-carbon. The TOAC α-amino acids are separated by two, three, four, and five intervening residues. This set of compounds has allowed us to modulate both the radical···radical distance and the relative orientation parameters. To further validate our conclusion, a comparative analysis has been carried out on three singly TOAC-labeled peptides of similar main-chain length.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacids 3aamino acids 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apeptides 3aphysical chemistry 3apiperidines1 aZerbetto, Mirco1 aMoretto, Alessandro1 aFormaggio, Fernando1 aToniolo, Claudio1 avan Son, Martin1 aShabestari, Maryam Hashemi1 aHuber, Martina1 aCalligari, Paolo1 aPolimeno, Antonino0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 May 04, v. 121, no. 17 p.4379-4387dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-61067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b010503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245007900175300001600254506010400270506007600374520106300450592002801513506003701541650002501578650002601603650001601629650001501645650002001660650001501680650001401695650002401709650002101733650001401754650001701768650001701785653002501802653002801827653002201855653002501877653002601902653002501928700002301953773011501976856008602091852000902177655001202186IND60746016020221207104708.0220420e20210910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074601602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudnik-Jansen, Imke10aFcRn expression in cancer: Mechanistic basis and therapeutic opportunities  ap. 248-257.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is an urgent need to identify new cellular targets to expand the repertoire, potency and safety of cancer therapeutics. Neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn)-driven cellular recycling plays a predominant role in the prolonged serum half-life of human serum albumin (HSA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) exploited in long-acting cancer drug designs. FcRn-mediated HSA and IgG uptake in epithelial cells and dendritic cell antigen presentation offers new therapeutic opportunities beyond half-life extension. Altered FcRn expression in solid tumours accounting for HSA catabolism or recycling supports a role for FcRn in tumour metabolism and growth. This review addresses the mechanistic basis for different FcRn expression profiles observed in cancer and exploitation for targeted drug delivery. Furthermore, the review highlights FcRn-mediated immunosurveillance and immune therapy. FcRn offers a potential attractive cancer target but in-depth understanding of role and expression profiles during cancer pathogenesis is required for tailoring targeted drug designs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantigen presentation 3aantineoplastic agents 3ablood serum 3acatabolism 3adendritic cells 3aepithelium 3ahalf life 3ahuman serum albumin 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aneoplasms 3apathogenesis 3atherapeutics 0aNeonatal Fc Receptor 0aTargeted cancer therapy 0aTumour metabolism 0aAlbumin-drug designs 0aAntibody-drug designs 0aCancer immunotherapy1 aHoward, Kenneth A.0 tJournal of controlled release.g2021 Sept. 10, v. 337 p.248-257dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03903naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002000167245019800187300001400385520210000399592002802499650002402527650001102551650002602562650001002588650001702598650001502615650001202630650001802642650003802660650003802698650003102736650004402767650002402811650005802835650003202893650004202925650004902967651001203016651001203028700002103040700001803061700002003079700001903099700001703118700001503135700001903150773009903169856008403268852000903352655001203361IND4458588020221120190230.0141111e20110705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445858802DNAL7 a214708002pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClegg, Tracy A.10aUsing latent class analysis to estimate the test characteristics of the γ-interferon test, the single intradermal comparative tuberculin test and a multiplex immunoassay under Irish conditions  ap. 68-76.  aConsiderable effort has been devoted to improving the existing diagnostic tests for bovine tuberculosis (single intradermal comparative tuberculin test [SICTT] and γ-interferon assay [γ-IFN]) and to develop new tests. Previously, the diagnostic characteristics (sensitivity, specificity) have been estimated in populations with defined infection status. However, these approaches can be problematic as there may be few herds in Ireland where freedom from infection is guaranteed. We used latent class models to estimate the diagnostic characteristics of existing (SICTT and γ-IFN) and new (multiplex immunoassay [Enferplex-TB]) diagnostic tests under Irish field conditions where true disease status was unknown. The study population consisted of herds recruited in areas with no known TB problems (2197 animals) and herds experiencing a confirmed TB breakdown (2740 animals). A Bayesian model was developed, allowing for dependence between SICTT and γ-IFN, while assuming independence from the Enferplex-TB test. Different test interpretations were used for the analysis: SICTT (standard and severe interpretation), γ-IFN (a single interpretation), and a range of interpretations for the Enferplex-TB (level-1 [high sensitivity interpretation] to level-5 [high specificity interpretation]). The sensitivity and specificity (95% posterior credibility intervals; 95% PCI) of SICTT[standard] relative to Enferplex-TB[level-1] and γ-IFN were 52.9–60.8% and 99.2–99.8%, respectively. Equivalent estimates for γ-IFN relative to Enferplex-TB[level-1] and SICTT were 63.1–70.1% and 86.8–89.4%, respectively. Sensitivity of Enferplex-TB[level-1] (95% PCI: 64.8–71.9%) was superior to the SICTT[standard], and specificity of the Enferplex-TB[level-5] was superior to γ-IFN (95% PCI: 99.6–100.0%). These results provide robust measures of sensitivity and specificity under field conditions in Ireland and suggest that the Enferplex-TB test has the potential to improve on current diagnostics for TB infection in cattle. The extent of that potential will be assessed in further studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine tuberculosis 3acattle 3adiagnostic techniques 3aherds 3aimmunoassays 3atuberculin 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aCattleximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aImmunoassayxmethodsxveterinary. 2aInterferon-gammaxanalysis 2aIntradermal Testsxmethodsxveterinary. 2aModels, Statistical 2aMolecular Diagnostic Techniquesxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTuberculin Testxmethodsxveterinary. 2aTuberculosis, Bovinexdiagnosisximmunology. 3aIreland 0aIreland1 aDuignan, Anthony1 aWhelan, Clare1 aGormley, Eamonn1 aGood, Margaret1 aClarke, John1 aToft, Nils1 aMore, Simon J.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2011 July 5, v. 151, no. 1-2 p.68-76dElsevier B.V.x0378-11357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245014900203300001600352520155800368592002801926650002001954650002101974650002001995650001302015650001002028650001202038650001302050650002002063650001302083651001002096651001802106653001902124653002302143653002802166700001802194700001502212700001902227700001702246700001202263773011702275856008102392852000902473655001202482IND60685368020221121033148.0200302e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068536802DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820190015372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yanyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8061-565110aSpatiotemporal pattern analysis of schistosomiasis based on village level in the transmission control stage in lake and marshland areas in China  ap. 199-212.  aHubei Province is one of the endemic regions with severe schistosomiasis in China. To eliminate schistosomiasis in lake and marshland regions, this study detected hotspots of schistosomiasis cases both spatially and spatiotemporally on the basis of spatial autocorrelation; clustering and outlier, purely spatial and spatiotemporal cluster analyses at the village level from 2013 to 2017 in Hubei Province. The number of cases confirmed positive by an immunodiagnostic test and etiological diagnosis and advanced schistosomiasis cases dramatically declined during the study period. Significant global spatial autocorrelation of schistosomiasis patients was found at the village level in the whole province in 5 years. Clustering and outlier analysis showed that most HH villages were mainly concentrated along the Yangtze River, especially in Jianghan Plain. Spatial and spatiotemporal cluster analyses showed that significant clusters of the schistosomiasis cases were detected at the village level. In general, space and spatiotemporal clustering of schistosomiasis cases at the village level demonstrated a downward trend from 2013 from 2017 in Hubei Province. High-risk regions included Jianghan Plain along the middle reach of Yangtze River and Yangxin County in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in Hubei Province. To eliminate schistosomiasis, precise control and management of schistosomiasis cases should be strictly implemented. Moreover, comprehensive prevention and control measures should be continuously strengthened in these regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3acluster analysis 3acontrol methods 3aetiology 3alakes 3amarshes 3apatients 3aschistosomiasis 3avillages 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aHubei province 0aspatial clustering 0aspatiotemporal analysis1 aLiu, Jianbing1 aXiao, Ying1 aZhong, Chenhui1 aWei, Fenghua1 aLiu, Si0 tParasitology.g2020 Feb., v. 147, no. 2 p.199-212dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820190015373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03806naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245011400170500002000284520197400304592002802278596003302306596004402339650001402383650001602397650001702413650002002430650001702450650001202467650001402479650002302493650001602516650002302532650001802555650001102573650001502584650001602599650003402615650001002649650002102659650001802680651001002698700007602708700002502784700006702809700002902876700002202905700003702927700006102964773014303025856007503168852000903243655001203252IND60784410320221122030741.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078441032DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.166362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPraveen Kumar, Gonugodugu10aQuality evaluation of vacuum‐pack ready‐to‐eat hot smoked pangasius fillets during refrigerated storage  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, Pangasius was evaluated as a candidate species for hot smoked ready‐to‐eat product, and its quality and shelf life were assessed during refrigerated storage under vacuum packing. Initially, smoking conditions were optimized based on analysis of water‐phase salt and sensory scores. The optimized conditions were dipping fillets in 20% brine solution for 60 min, pre‐drying at 50°C for 30 min, and smoking at 80°C for 3 h. The optimized vacuum‐packed smoked and nonsmoked fillets were analyzed for proximate, biochemical and instrumental, amino acid, and fatty acid degradation, microbiological, and sensory parameters at refrigerated temperature (4 ± 1°C). Benzopyrene content was analyzed for optimized salted smoked fish in comparison with salted nonsmoked fish. The major changes observed in total volatile base nitrogen, total viable count, and sensory scores on the 49th and 63rd day of storage were 41.86 and 35.89 mg N/100 g, 7.21 and 6.54 log CFU/g, and 4.83 and 5.88 for nonsmoked and smoked Pangasius, respectively. During storage, the saturated fatty acids in both smoked and nonsmoked samples increased and unsaturated fatty acids values decreased, which might be due to lipid oxidation. Sensorily, salted nonsmoked (control) and salted‐smoked fillets were acceptable for 35 and 63 days. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: Though Pangasius has good demand in the international market, Pangasius cultured in India is having low demand and the production cost is more than the selling price. Hot smoking can be an alternative method of preservation to increase the utilization of Pangasius and create demand in the international market. Smoked fishery products are a delicacy in many countries, especially hot smoked products prepared from salmon, trout, whitefish are being exported to many countries. Pangasius being a major export item from Asian countries can be used as an alternate species for hot smoked products.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity Grants Commission  cIndian Council of Agricultural Research 3aPangasius 3aamino acids 3abenzopyrenes 3abrine solutions 3acold storage 3aexports 3afisheries 3alipid peroxidation 3aplate count 3aready-to-eat foods 3arefrigeration 3asalmon 3ashelf life 3atemperature 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 3atrout 3avacuum packaging 3aworld markets 3aIndia1 aXavier, Kochery Augustine Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5879-40161 aNayak, Binaya Bhusan1 aKumar, Hirekudel Sanath1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0223-90691 aVenkateshwarlu, Gudipati1 aBenerjee, Kaushik1 aPriyadarshini, Mocherla Bhargavi1 aBalange, Amjad K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0659-82800 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2022 July, v. 46, no. 7 p.e16636-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.166363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245011400179520194200293592002802235650001002263650001602273650001902289650002002308650001602328650001502344650001002359650001502369650002602384650002902410650001302439653002002452653001402472653001202486653001402498653001302512700002902525700002302554700002802577700002602605700001802631773011902649856008802768852000902856655001202865IND60766299520221122233658.0220606e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076629952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1536772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Haro, Monica10aDetermination of glyphosate exposure in the Iberian hare: A potential focal species associated to agrosystems  aGlyphosate is the most used herbicide worldwide. It is a small and highly polar pesticide whose physicochemical properties makes its analytical determination difficult. Here, a procedure based on liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) was developed for glyphosate determination in samples of gastric content from wildlife. Iberian hare (Lepus granatensis), a herbivorous mammal species, strongly associated to agrosystems was selected as model species. The procedure involves direct analysis of sample without derivatization or instead of neither further cleaning steps. The procedure was validated by inter-day accuracy and precision studies with gastric content of hare spiked with glyphosate at ecologically relevant concentrations for the species (0.1–6 μg/g), and with 1 μg/g of isotopically labelled internal standard (glyphosate-2-¹³C,¹⁵N). Finally, glyphosate residues in hunted animals from pesticide-treated and pesticide-free areas (n = 75 and 28, respectively), as well as from hares found dead in the field (n = 11) were analysed. The linearity of both standards in extraction solutions and procedural calibration curves with spiked samples was similar, both with determination coefficients (r²) higher than 0.99. Satisfactory recoveries in spiked samples were achieved within the range of 95% to 118% (CV ≤ 20%). The limit of detection of glyphosate in hare gastric content was 0.03 μg/g. Prevalence of glyphosate in hunted animals from pesticide-treated areas ranged between 9 and 22%, increasing to 45% in animals found dead. The glyphosate concentrations detected in the gastric content of hares ranged from 0.11 to 16 μg/g. No residues were detected in animals from pesticide-free areas. In practice, the developed methodology may be particularly useful in the context of research and other work on the exposure in wildlife of one of the most used pesticides nowadays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepus 3acalibration 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3aenvironment 3aglyphosate 3ahares 3aherbivores 3aliquid chromatography 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awildlife 0aGastric content 0aHerbicide 0aLC-HRMS 0aPesticide 0aWildlife1 aChinchilla, José Manuel1 aCamarero, Pablo R.1 aViñuelas, Jose Alberto1 aCrespo, María Jesús1 aMateo, Rafael0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 June 01, v. 823 p.153677-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1536773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01893naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006800150245009600218520055400314592002800868650002800896650001600924650002400940650001200964650001900976653002500995653002901020653003801049653002501087700002501112700002201137700002001159700001901179700002101198700002001219700006001239773010201299856008501401852000901486655001201495IND60727488620221121153149.0210401e20210330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072748862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2021.1529122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharnay-Pouget, Florence1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3540-957312aA short synthesis of both enantiomers of 2-aminobicyclo[3.2.0]heptane-2,7-dicarboxylic acid  aA concise method is reported for the synthesis of 2-aminobicyclo[3.2.0]heptane-2,7-dicarboxylic acid, a close analogue of the glutamate receptor ligand LY354740, in both enantiomeric forms.

Herein, we report soybean roots-derived mesoporous hard carbon constructed by N, P co-doping (NPDCs) with enlarged interlayer distance and more active sites for high-performance SIBs and PIBs. As a result, the optimized NPDC achieves an excellent cyclic stability (197 mA g⁻¹ after 2000 cycles at 2.0 A g⁻¹) for SIBs, superior rate capability (a high reversible capacity of 179 mAh g⁻¹ at 5.0 A g⁻¹) for PIBs. Kinetic and first-principles calculation studies further demonstrate the dual-doping improves the Na (K) ions diffusion and adsorption as well as electrons transport. This work provides a facile and sustainable strategy to realize advanced carbon-based materials with heteratoms doping in application for energy storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanodes 3acarbon 3aenergy 3aporous media 3asodium 3asoybeans 0aHard carbon 0aSoybean roots 0aN/P Co-Doping 0aSodium-ion batteries 0aPotassium-ion batteries1 aXu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8006-23991 aZheng, Jihui1 aKong, Fanjun1 aCui, Peixin1 aWu, Dajun1 aQian, Bin1 aChen, Shuangming1 aSong, Li0 tCarbon.g2021 June 30, v. 178 p.233-242dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002400186245004700210300001300257500001500270506007600285520143400361592002801795506003701823650001301860650003701873650001601910650002401926650002001950650001701970650000801987650001101995650001602006650001702022650001502039650001702054650001202071650001402083650002302097650001202120650001802132650006702150650003802217650004702255650001102302650002302313650002202336650002802358650003602386653001502422700001802437773008302455856004802538852000902586655001202595IND4482572520221207053035.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448257252DNAL7 a220481642pmid7 aPMC32604242pmcid7 a10.1007/s00412-011-0347-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobs, Angelika L.10aDNA glycosylases: in DNA repair and beyond  ap. 1-20.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe base excision repair machinery protects DNA in cells from the damaging effects of oxidation, alkylation, and deamination; it is specialized to fix single-base damage in the form of small chemical modifications. Base modifications can be mutagenic and/or cytotoxic, depending on how they interfere with the template function of the DNA during replication and transcription. DNA glycosylases play a key role in the elimination of such DNA lesions; they recognize and excise damaged bases, thereby initiating a repair process that restores the regular DNA structure with high accuracy. All glycosylases share a common mode of action for damage recognition; they flip bases out of the DNA helix into a selective active site pocket, the architecture of which permits a sensitive detection of even minor base irregularities. Within the past few years, it has become clear that nature has exploited this ability to read the chemical structure of DNA bases for purposes other than canonical DNA repair. DNA glycosylases have been brought into context with molecular processes relating to innate and adaptive immunity as well as to the control of DNA methylation and epigenetic stability. Here, we summarize the key structural and mechanistic features of DNA glycosylases with a special focus on the mammalian enzymes, and then review the evidence for the newly emerging biological functions beyond the protection of genome integrity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aimmunity 3aequipment maintenance and repair 3aepigenetics 3amechanism of action 3aDNA methylation 3acytotoxicity 3aDNA 3agenome 3adeamination 3amutagenicity 3aDNA repair 3aglycosylases 3amammals 3aoxidation 3achemical structure 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Glycosylasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDNA Repairxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGenomic Instabilityxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0aalkylation1 aSchär, Primo0 tChromosoma.g2012 Feb., v. 121, no. 1 p.1-20dSpringer-Verlagx0009-59157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-011-0347-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005100147245009300198300001600291520094200307592002801249650002101277650002501298650001401323650002301337650003201360650002601392650001401418650002401432650002301456651001001479653002001489653002801509653001501537653000801552653000801560653000801568653000801576700001601584700001401600700001701614773013701631856008101768852000901849655001201858IND60685368220221121033147.0200302e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068536822DNAL7 a10.1017/S1355770X190002632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8394-421510aChina's fiscal decentralization and environmental quality: theory and an empirical study  ap. 159-181.  aAs a wide-reaching institutional reform, China's fiscal decentralization was launched in the early 1980s to encourage provincial economic growth by granting more financial autonomy to provincial governments. In this paper, the impact of fiscal decentralization on China's environmental quality is investigated both theoretically and empirically. A neoclassical model is developed based on the primary characteristics of China's fiscal decentralization. Using provincial panel data for the period 1995-2015, a two-equation regression model is employed to empirically verify the three propositions of the theoretical model: (1) there exists an inverted-U shaped relationship between fiscal decentralization and GDP per capita; (2) fiscal decentralization is positively related to GDP per capita at the steady state; (3) there is an inverted-U shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve relationship between pollution emissions and economic growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecentralization 3aeconomic development 3aemissions 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental Kuznets curve 3aenvironmental quality 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3atheoretical models 3aChina 0aeconomic growth 0afiscal decentralization 0apanel data 0aE60 0aQ53 0aQ54 0aQ561 aChen, Yu-Fu1 aLiao, Hua1 aWei, Yiming,0 tEnvironment and development economics.g2020 Apr., v. 25, no. 2 p.159-181dCambridge University PresswJournal:2151x1469-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X190002633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245011900183300001800302520094900320592002801269650005701297650003701354650001701391650001501408650002201423650001401445650001501459650001201474650001201486650003201498650001401530650003001544650006501574650003801639650006601677650001401743650001701757700002001774700001701794700002301811700002101834700002001855700002101875700001901896700002301915773009901938856004802037852000902085655001202094IND50059819720221119210127.0121102e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005981972DNAL7 a227142722pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-012-0971-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jae Man10aEstablishment of a Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) hyper-sensitive cell line from the silkworm e21 strain  ap. 1773-1779.  aBaculoviral expression systems, including those of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV), are used for recombinant protein production. Four B. mori-derived (BmN4, Bm5, Bmc140, and Bme21) cell lines were infected with recombinant BmNPV viruses expressing firefly luciferase or EGFP as reporters under the control of a viral polyhedrin promoter. Bme21 exhibited significantly higher (100-fold) luciferase activity than BmN4 and Bm5. With the EGFP reporter protein, Bme21 cells showed a marked increase in the ratio of EGFP-positive cells, reaching 90 % on day 4 post-infection, while Bm5 and BmN4 cells had a slow increase in the ratio of their EGFP-positive population. The viral titer in a supernatant of Bme21 cell culture increased faster than those of Bm5 and BmN4 cells.

Initiation and termination are two rate limiting steps of translation. Circular RNA as a class of RNA is defined by covalent joining of terminal ends to give a closed loop structure. By encoding a gene lacking a stop codon on a circular RNA molecule an infinite open reading frame is generated permitting continuously translating circular mRNA (CTC mRNA). CTC mRNAs have shown promise in enhancing the production of multimeric polyproteins in bacterial cell-free expression systems. Problems arise when homogenous, functional post-translationally modified protein is required. To produce post-translationally modified, secreted protein from an CTC mRNA we investigated co-translational cleavage of nascent polypeptide chains by incorporating a 2 A “self-cleavage” peptide motif. Using a model recombinant human glycoprotein Erythropoietin (EPO) we demonstrate for the first time the ability to produce secreted protein from an infinite circular mRNA in live mammalian cells.

A remarkable increase of the volumetric capacitance value, with respect to the activated nanoporous electrode without gold nanoparticles, was observed. Interestingly, the electrochemical series resistances of the symmetric cell decreased up to one order of magnitude in comparison with the unmodified carbon material. The incorporation of gold nanoparticles overcomes the characteristic irreversible charge storage of activated carbon electrodes containing surface oxygenated groups. All these findings pave the way to a novel synthetic route of highly-dense carbon nanocomposites for the design of new electrode architectures with potential application in electrical double-layer capacitor development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abiomass 3acapacitance 3acarbon electrodes 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrochemistry 3amicrostructure 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananopores1 aArenas-Esteban, Daniel1 aOtero-Díaz, L.

The microgels were synthesized by one-step cross-linking of antifouling segment, poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA), and electrostatic repulsion segment, methylacrylic acid (MAA). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicated that large amounts of PEGMA and MAA polymers had been enriched on the membranes surface. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicated that the spherical PEGMA-MAA (PM) microgels might form interpenetrating structure with the membrane matrixes, and substantially increased the pore size of the membranes. Water contact angle (WCA), pore size distributions and ultrafiltration tests suggested that the hydrophilicity, porosity, water flux, and antifouling property for the modified membranes were significantly enhanced. More importantly, systematic anti-adhesion investigations of plasma proteins, platelets, bacteria and vein endothelial cells confirmed that the modified membranes owned strong resistance capability to the bioadhesion of various organisms. The results revealed that highly robust and effective anti-bioadhesion ultrafiltration membranes could be prepared via the proposed blending of PM microgels with membrane matrix, thus this approach should be potential in various biomedical or industrial filtration fields where anti-bioadhesion properties were highly demanded.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abacteria 3ablood proteins 3acolloids 3acontact angle 3acrosslinking 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aendothelial cells 3ahydrophilicity 3amixing 3apolyethylene glycol 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aultrafiltration 0aPM microgels 0aUltrafiltration membrane 0aAntifouling 0aBioadhesion resistance 0aAntibacterial1 aCheng, Chong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6872-22401 aWang, Rui1 aHe, Chao1 aMa, Lang1 aZhao, Changsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2390-03890 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 139 p.199-210dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245007600165300002000241520129000261592002801551650001501579650002401594650001901618650001401637650001301651650001101664650001301675650001701688650001001705650001901715650001901734650001701753650001601770650002001786650001701806650002101823650002501844700002601869773012401895856007402019852000902093655001202102IND60669219820221118234622.0190920e20150826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066921982DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra14547c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThankam Thomas, Reny10aTemplate free synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride/titania mesoflowers  ap. 72683-72690.  aAn efficient solar active catalyst is in immense demand for water splitting, waste water treatment and environmental remediation applications due to the growing energy crisis. The key to improving the activity of these materials is to increase the surface area, use a dopant and reduce the charge carrier recombination. This growing concern can be addressed by graphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄) which has excellent visible light activity. In the present work a mesoporous flower like arrangement of carbon nitride–titania nanocomposites obtained through a solvothermal method without the use of any templates at ambient temperature is reported. A detailed investigation on the formation of these mesoflowers has been studied. The properties of the nanocomposite such as efficient absorption in the visible regime and delayed recombination of charge carriers make it an apt material for solar light photocatalysis for the degradation of organic contaminants. The high surface area of 147 m² g⁻¹ of the mesoflowers has been utilized for heavy metal removal such as Cr(vi) with a sorption percentage of 81% within 2 minutes of contact time in simulated water samples. This report paves the way for a new class of mesoflower nanocomposites for various environmental applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aambient temperature 3acarbon nitride 3acatalysts 3achromium 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aheavy metals 3alight 3ananocomposites 3aphotocatalysis 3aporous media 3aremediation 3asolar radiation 3asurface area 3atitanium dioxide 3awastewater treatment1 aSandhyārāṇi, En.,0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 26, v. 5, no. 89 p.72683-72690dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra14547c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245015000170520143900320592002801759650002401787650001601811650001701827650001201844650001701856650001701873650002401890650001801914650001601932650002001948650001101968650001401979650001901993650001102012650001802023650002002041650001402061653002402075653001402099653001202113653002602125653001702151653002002168700002102188700002202209700002702231700002702258700002402285700003102309700001802340700005502358773009602413856008702509852000902596655001202605IND60770848120221119115720.0220412e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077084812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1089642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yu Kyung10aAntibiofilm effects of quercetin against Salmonella enterica biofilm formation and virulence, stress response, and quorum-sensing gene expression  aSalmonellosis is a prevalent food poisoning disease caused by Salmonella spp. that affects millions of people throughout the world. Contamination of chicken meat and processing equipment with Salmonella is a major issue in the food industry. Therefore, it is necessary to study not only food but also food contact surfaces [plastic (PLA) and rubber gloves (RG)] that can cause cross-contamination during processing. The inhibitory activities of quercetin, an antioxidant and antibacterial compound, were tested against S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis on PLA, RG, and chicken skin during biofilm. When quercetin (0–125 μg/mL) was supplemented, the inhibitory effect was 1.50–2.61 log CFU/cm² (125; 1/2, 62.5; 1/4, and 31.25 μg/mL; 1/8 MIC). Furthermore, the initial biofilm formation rate of both bacteria was greater on the chicken skin surface than on the food contact surfaces. The inhibitory impact was visually observed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The swimming and swarming motility was also found to be inhibited from 1/8 MIC. As determined by qRT-PCR, quercetin downregulated the expression levels of virulence (avrA, and hilA), stress response (rpoS), and quorum-sensing (luxS) genes. Our findings suggest that plant-derived quercetin is a possible antibiofilm agent against Salmonella spp. biofilm formation, as well as biofilm caused by other bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella enterica 3aantibiotics 3aantioxidants 3abiofilm 3achicken meat 3achicken skin 3across contamination 3afood industry 3afood safety 3agene expression 3apeople 3aquercetin 3aquorum sensing 3arubber 3asalmonellosis 3astress response 3avirulence 0aSalmonella enterica 0aQuercetin 0aBiofilm 0aFood contact surfaces 0aChicken skin 0aGene expression1 aRoy, Pantu Kumar1 aAshrafudoulla, Md1 aMahmud, Shamsun Nahar,1 aToushik, Sazzad Hossen1 aHossain, Md.

Fresh-cut cantaloupes were coated with various coating materials. The coated fresh-cut cantaloupes were packed in polypropylene bag and exposed to RPL treatment with a fluence of 0.9Jcm−2 every 48h up to 28d of storage at 4±1°C. The microbiological quality, headspace gas composition, physical quality (firmness, fluid loss and colour), chemical quality (pH, titratable acidity, total soluble solids, total phenolic content and ascorbic acid content) and coating homogeneity and adherence of these fresh-cut cantaloupes were determined. The combination of pectin, alginate and gellan coatings with RPL treatment was effective to reduce fluid loss and retain firmness of fresh-cut cantaloupes compared to control samples while maintaining the desired headspace gas composition for fresh-cut cantaloupe throughout storage. Chitosan-based coating enhanced the microbiological quality of fresh-cut cantaloupes but increased its fluid loss and reduction of ascorbic acid content. Colour, pH, titratable acidity, total soluble solids and total phenolic content were maintained throughout the storage for coated fresh-cut cantaloupes treated with RPL. In conclusion, a combination of alginate and RPL treatment was the most effective treatment condition to extend the shelf life of fresh-cut cantaloupes by maintaining microbiological quality up to 28d with significantly reduced fluid loss and enhanced firmness compared to samples treated with RPL alone. Alginate coating adhered well to the surfaces of fresh-cut cantaloupes and retained its physicochemical and nutritional quality when combined with RPL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis melo 3aalginates 3aascorbic acid 3acantaloupes 3acoatings 3acolor 3aedible films 3afirmness 3afresh-cut produce 3aheadspace analysis 3alight 3amicrobiological quality 3anutritive value 3apH 3apectins 3apolypropylenes 3ashelf life 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 0aFresh-cut cantaloupe 0aEdible coating 0aRepetitive pulsed light 0aShelf life 0aFruit1 aNoranizan Mohd.

The oils obtained were analysed using gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of essential oils was evaluated using a microdilution broth assay. The results revealed that the microwave-assisted hydrodistillation produced 2.02% (w/w) yield of oil compared to 1.77% from hydrodistillation and 1.50% from steam distillation. There were significant differences in the content of main components in the essential oils obtained from the different extraction methods. Overall, bornyl acetate (30.01% - 38.18%), camphor (17.53% - 20.91%), borneol (9.21% - 14.68%), D-limonene (6.61% - 9.67%), camphene (4.14% - 8.51%), and β-myrcene (3.85% - 5.16%) were the main components in all the oil samples. The highest amounts of borneol, bornyl acetate, and camphor were obtained from the microwave-assisted hydrodistilled oil. In addition, the essential oil samples were tested for antimicrobial activity and were shown to inhibit the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 100 to 200 μg/mL, and the microwave-assisted hydrodistilled oil exhibited higher antimicrobial activity. In summary, this research revealed that microwave-assisted hydrodistillation is an outstanding method of extracting essential oils from the fruits of A. villosum var. xanthioides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aWurfbainia villosa 3aantimicrobial properties 3aborneol 3abornyl acetate 3acamphene 3acamphor 3achemical composition 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrodistillation 3alimonene 3amicrowave treatment 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aoils 3asteam distillation 0aAmomum villosum var. xanthioides 0aEssential oil 0aExtraction method 0aAntimicrobial assay 0aMicrowave-assisted hydrodistillation1 aChac, Le D.1 aHanh, Do H.1 aKorneeva, Alevtina A.1 aHung, N.1 aIgoli, John O.0 tJournal of essential oil-bearing plants.g2022 Jan. 02, v. 25, no. 1 p.28-37dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12282x0976-50267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0972060X.2022.20498933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03989naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245014700164300001300311520207400324592002802398650002602426650002102452650001902473650001302492650002202505650002702527650001302554650001902567650001402586650001602600650001702616650001502633650001102648650002202659650002302681650001102704650001702715650001702732650001302749650001302762650002902775650003902804650001602843653002602859653000802885653000902893653002202902653002602924700001402950700001602964700001502980700001902995700001503014700001303029700001703042700001203059700002003071773014303091856008403234852000903318655001203327IND60629353620221116230221.0190321e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062935362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2019.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Junjun10aConstruction of artificial micro-aerobic metabolism for energy- and carbon-efficient synthesis of medium chain fatty acids in Escherichia coli  ap. 1-13.  aMedium-chain (C6-C10) chemicals are important components of fuels, commodities and fine chemicals. Numerous exciting achievements have proven reversed β-oxidation cycle as a promising platform to synthesize these chemicals. However, under native central carbon metabolism, energetic and redox constraints limit the efficient operation of reversed β-oxidation cycle. Current fermentative platform has to use different chemically and energetically inefficient ways for acetyl-CoA and NADH biosynthesis, respectively. The characteristics such as supplementation of additional acetate and formate or high ATP requirement makes this platform incompatible with large-scale production. Here, an artificial micro-aerobic metabolism for energy and carbon-efficient conversion of glycerol to MCFAs was constructed to present solutions towards these barriers. After evaluating numerous bacteria pathways under micro-aerobic conditions, one synthetic metabolic step enabling biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA and NADH simultaneously, without any energy cost and additional carbon requirement, and reducing loss of carbon to carbon dioxide-emitting reactions, was conceived and successfully constructed. The pyruvate dehydrogenase from Enterococcus faecalis was identified and biochemically characterized, demonstrating the most suitable characteristics. Furthermore, the carbon and energy metabolism in Escherichia coli was rewired by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference system, inhibiting native fermentation pathways outcompeting this synthetic step. The present engineered strain exhibited a 15.7-fold increase in MCFA titer compared with that of the initial strain, and produced 15.67 g/L MCFAs from the biodiesel byproduct glycerol in 3-L bioreactor without exogenous feed of acetate or formate, representing the highest MCFA titer reported to date. This work demonstrates this artificial micro-aerobic metabolism has the potential to enable the cost-effective, large-scale production of fatty acids and other value-added reduced chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aEscherichia coli 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aacetates 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abacteria 3abeta oxidation 3abiodiesel 3abioreactors 3abiosynthesis 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acarbon metabolism 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3afermentation 3aformates 3aglycerol 3amedium chain fatty acids 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 3avalue added 0aβ-oxidation reversal 0aATP 0aNADH 0aSynthetic biology 0aMetabolic engineering1 aWang, Zhe1 aDuan, Xuguo1 aZhou, Peng1 aLiu, Pingcheng1 aPang, Zhen1 aWang, Yu1 aWang, Xuejun1 aLi, Wei1 aDong, Mingsheng0 tMetabolic engineering.g2019 May, v. 53 p.1-13dElsevier Inc.aInternational Metabolic Engineering SocietywJournal:12015x1096-71767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2019.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245011300160300001600273506011700289506007600406520108500482592002801567506003701595650001001632650001701642650002501659650001101684650001701695650001101712650001301723650001701736650001301753650001201766650002101778653002701799653001101826653002501837653002801862700001501890700001601905773011901921856004902040852000902089655001202098IND60776166920221207065007.0220502e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077616692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fshw.2022.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Aqi10aEffect of electrical stimulation on red meat Neu5Gc content reduction: a combined experimental and DFT study  ap. 982-991.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe hazardous substance Neu5Gc (N-glycolylneuraminic acid), which is rich in red meat, is related to chronic inflammation but is hard to eliminate. Here, electrical stimulation, as a food-friendly nonthermal processing technology, was applied to red meat samples to reduce the Neu5Gc content. To explore the Neu5Gc structure changes during this process, electronic structure parameters were evaluated, and AIM (atom in molecules) theory and DFT (density function theory) calculations were further used. The results showed that the content of Nue5Gc in red meat can be reduced by (74.24 ± 0.69)% at 120V for 50s, with little impact on the meat texture and color. Theoretical calculations indicated that the Neu5Gc molecule becomes very unstable under electrical stimulation by increasing the OH bond length, reactive activity, strength of intermolecular dipole forces and total energy through reducing the values of bond dissociation energy and strength of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Overall, this research provides an economical method to effectively control red meat safety.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acolor 3adissociation 3aelectrical treatment 3aenergy 3afood science 3ahumans 3ahydrogen 3ainflammation 3ared meat 3atexture 3atoxic substances 0aelectrical stimulation 0aNeu5Gc 0aelectronic structure 0adensity function theory1 aChang, Rui1 aZhu, Qiujin0 tFood science and human wellness.g2022 July, v. 11, no. 4 p.982-991dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23299x2213-45307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fshw.2022.03.023  aDNAL 7aarticle04339naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014500168520203400313592002802347650002302375650002902398650002602427650001802453650001902471650002502490650001802515650002402533650001602557650004102573650003102614650001302645650001302658650001202671650001602683650001702699650001702716650001302733650002102746650001302767650001702780650001102797650001302808650001902821650001702840650002902857650001102886650003102897650001002928651001002938653002902948653003102977653001803008653001303026653002303039653001003062653001003072653000803082653000803090653000803098653000803106653000803114653000803122653000803130653000803138653000803146653000903154653000703163700006103170700001803231700002003249700001903269700001703288773009603305856008703401852000903488655001203497IND60770848320221119115957.0220412e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077084832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1089672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yan-Nan10aLinalool, the main volatile constituent from Zanthoxylum schinifolium pericarp, prevents growth of Aspergillus flavus in post-harvest grains  aPlant volatile organic compounds (PVOCs) have shown great potential as alternatives to synthetic insecticides or fungicides for stored grain management. Zanthoxylum schinifolium pericarp, a traditional Chinese spice, is conventionally buried in grain piles to prevent fungal spoilage of stored grains in China. However, the chemical basis and antifungal mechanism of PVOCs from Z. schinifolium pericarp by which they inhibit spoilage remain unclear. In this study, the effectiveness of PVOCs from Z. schinifolium pericarp against Aspergillus flavus growth in high-moisture wheat grains was studied under simulated storage conditions. The growth of A. flavus in the grains was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The chemical composition of PVOCs from Z. schinifolium pericarp was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; linalool (50.31%) and d-limonene (20.92%) were the two main components. An antifungal experiment showed that 0.571 and 1.2 μL/mL concentrations of linalool completely inhibited A. flavus growth upon vapor and liquid contact, respectively. d-limonene showed much lower antifungal activity, indicating that linalool is responsible for the antifungal activity of PVOCs from Z. schinifolium pericarp. Linalool treatment disrupted the cell membrane of A. flavus, resulting in increased electrolyte leakage and A₂₆₀ₙₘ in the culture supernatant. After 6 h of exposure to 1.2 μL/mL linalool, metabolomic analysis revealed 90 differentially expressed metabolites in A. flavus mycelia, including 69 upregulated and 21 downregulated metabolites. It was speculated that linalool inhibited A. flavus by disrupting the permeability and integrity of cell membranes, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and ATP binding cassette transport and by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. This study shows the potential of PVOCs from Z. schinifolium pericarp as biofumigants for stored grain management and provides a new perspective on their antifungal mechanism against A. flavus growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aZanthoxylum schinifolium 3aantifungal properties 3abiofumigation 3acell membranes 3achemical composition 3adose response 3aelectrolyte leakage 3afood safety 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agene expression regulation 3alimonene 3alinalool 3aliquids 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amitochondria 3amycelium 3aoxidative stress 3apericarp 3apermeability 3aspices 3aspoilage 3aspoilage fungi 3astored grain 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3avapors 3avolatile organic compounds 3awheat 3aChina 0aZanthoxylum schinifolium 0aOrganic volatile compounds 0aStored grains 0aLinalool 0aAspergillus flavus 0aPVOCs 0aGC-MS 0aMIC 0aMFC 0aROS 0aTCA 0aSOD 0aCAT 0aPBS 0aPCA 0aPLS 0aOPLS 0aSD1 aZhang, Shuai-Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1770-33221 aLv, Yang-Yong1 aZhai, Huan-Chen1 aCai, Jing-Ping1 aHu, Yuan-Sen0 tFood control.g2022 July, v. 137 p.108967-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1089673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002500191245009000216300001700306506007600323520108600399592002801485506003701513650000801550650002001558650001301578650001701591650002401608650002001632650001201652650002301664650001101687650001601698653002001714653001401734653002001748653001501768653001101783653001101794653001001805700001601815700002401831700001501855700001801870700001801888700002501906700002001931700002401951700002301975773010601998856008402104852000902188655001202197IND60629353820221207060506.0190131e20190103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062935382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2018.10.0062doi7 aPMC64076162pmcid7 a304159482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoddard, Caitlin I.12aA Nucleosome Bridging Mechanism for Activation of a Maintenance DNA Methyltransferase  ap. 73-83.e6.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA methylation and H3K9me are hallmarks of heterochromatin in plants and mammals, and are successfully maintained across generations. The biochemical and structural basis for this maintenance is poorly understood. The maintenance DNA methyltransferase from Zea mays, ZMET2, recognizes dimethylation of H3K9 via a chromodomain (CD) and a bromo adjacent homology (BAH) domain, which flank the catalytic domain. Here, we show that dinucleosomes are the preferred ZMET2 substrate, with DNA methylation preferentially targeted to linker DNA. Electron microscopy shows one ZMET2 molecule bridging two nucleosomes within a dinucleosome. We find that the CD stabilizes binding, whereas the BAH domain enables allosteric activation by the H3K9me mark. ZMET2 further couples recognition of H3K9me to an increase in the specificity for hemimethylated versus unmethylated DNA. We propose a model in which synergistic coupling between recognition of nucleosome spacing, H3K9 methylation, and DNA modification allows ZMET2 to maintain DNA methylation in heterochromatin with high fidelity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aZea mays 3aactive sites 3aelectron microscopy 3aheterochromatin 3amammals 3amethyltransferases 3amodels 3anucleosomes 0aDNA methylation 0achromatin 0aheterochromatin 0anucleosome 0aH3K9me 0aplants 0amaize1 aFeng, Suhua1 aCampbell, Melody G.1 aLiu, Wanlu1 aWang, Haifeng1 aZhong, Xuehua1 aBernatavichute, Yana1 aChʻeng, I-fan,1 aJacobsen, Steven E.1 aNarlikar, Geeta J.0 tMolecular cell.g2019 Jan. 03, v. 73, no. 1 p.73-83.e6dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010500170300001600275520167300291592002801964650002201992650001402014650001102028650001702039650001502056650001002071650002602081650001702107650002002124650002202144650001302166650001402179650002002193650001602213700002202229700001902251700001802270700002202288773010802310856008302418990002302501852000902524655001202533IND60099201720221117215427.0141105e20130915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009920172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygcen.2013.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarasco, Valeria10aDevelopmental post-natal stress can alter the effects of pre-natal stress on the adult redox balance  ap. 239-246.  aAcross diverse vertebrate taxa, stressful environmental conditions during development can shape phenotypic trajectories of developing individuals, which, while adaptive in the short-term, may impair health and survival in adulthood. Regardless, the long-lasting benefits or costs of early life stress are likely to depend on the conditions experienced across differing stages of development. Here, we used the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) to experimentally manipulate exposure to stress hormones in developing individuals. We tested the hypothesis that interactions occurring between pre- and post-natal developmental periods can induce long-term shifts on the adult oxidant phenotype in non-breeding sexually mature individuals. We showed that early life stress can induce long-term alterations in the basal antioxidant defences. The magnitude of these effects depended upon the timing of glucocorticoid exposure and upon interactions between the pre- and post-natal stressful stimuli. We also found differences among tissues with stronger effects in the erythrocytes than in the brain in which the long-term effects of glucocorticoids on antioxidant biomarkers appeared to be region-specific. Recent experimental work has demonstrated that early life exposure to stress hormones can markedly reduce adult survival (Monaghan et al., 2012). Our results suggest that long-term shifts in basal antioxidant defences might be one of the potential mechanisms driving such accelerated ageing processes and that post-natal interventions during development may be a potential tool to shape the effects induced by pre-natally glucococorticoid-exposed phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoturnix japonica 3aadulthood 3aadults 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3abrain 3aenvironmental factors 3aerythrocytes 3aglucocorticoids 3along term effects 3aoxidants 3aphenotype 3asexual maturity 3avertebrates1 aSpencer, Karen A.1 aRobinson, Jane1 aHerzyk, Pawel1 aCostantini, David0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 191 p.239-246dElsevier Inc.x0016-64807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2013.07.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010000172520193900272592002802211650001102239650001802250650002102268650000902289650001802298650002302316650001202339650001102351650001402362650001502376650001202391650002502403650001302428650001502441653002702456653001402483653001802497653003402515653003402549653001202583700002702595700002402622700001702646700001802663700002302681773009502704856008402799852000902883655001202892IND60687653120221118083054.0200621e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068765312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2020.1046912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJospe, Michelle R.10aTeaching people to eat according to appetite – Does the method of glucose measurement matter?  aHunger training teaches people to eat according to their appetite using pre-prandial glucose measurement. Previous hunger training interventions used fingerprick blood glucose, however continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) offers a painless and convenient form of glucose monitoring. The aim of this randomised feasibility trial was to compare hunger training using CGM with fingerprick glucose monitoring in terms of adherence to the protocol, acceptability, weight, body composition, HbA1c, psychosocial variables, and the relationship between adherence measures and weight loss.40 adults with obesity were randomised to either fingerpricking or scanning with a CGM and followed identical interventions for 6 months, which included 1 month of only eating when glucose was under their individualised glucose cut-off. For months 2–6 participants relied on their sensations of hunger to guide their eating and filled in a booklet.90% of the fingerpricking group and 85% of the scanning group completed the study. Those using the scanner measured their glucose an extra 1.9 times per day (95% CI 0.9, 2.8, p < 0.001) compared with those testing by fingerprick. Both groups lost similar amounts of weight over 6 months (on average 4 kg), were satisfied with the hunger training program and wanted to measure their glucose again within the next year. There were no differences between groups in terms of intervention acceptability, weight, body composition, HbA1c, eating behaviours, or psychological health. Frequency of glucose testing and booklet entry both predicted a clinically meaningful amount of weight loss.Either method of measuring glucose is effective for learning to eat according to hunger using the hunger training program. As scanning with a CGM encouraged better adherence to the protocol without sacrificing outcome results, future interventions should consider using this new technology in hunger training programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood glucose 3abody composition 3adiet 3aeating habits 3aeducation programs 3aglucose 3ahunger 3aingestion 3amonitoring 3aobesity 3apsychosocial factors 3ascanners 3atechnology 0aFood intake regulation 0aAdherence 0aAcceptability 0aBlood glucose self-monitoring 0aContinuous glucose monitoring 0aObesity1 ade Bruin, Willemijn E.1 aHaszard, Jillian J.1 aMann, Jim I.1 aBrunton, Mark1 aTaylor, Rachael W.0 tAppetite.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 151 p.104691-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.1046913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01581naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245006400158300002000222520067900242592002800921650001200949650001200961650002600973650002200999650001301021700002001034700001801054773012401072856007401196852000901270655001201279IND60669220220221118232101.0190920e20150814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066922022DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra14554f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Jia-Neng10aBio-based solvents for the Baylis–Hillman reaction of HMF  ap. 69238-69242.  aThe Baylis–Hillman reaction of HMF was investigated in various bio-based solvent systems and in water. Although pure water is able to promote the reaction, aqueous mixtures with ethanol, isopropanol, methyl-THF (MeTHF), tetrahydrofurfuryl-alcohol (THFA) show better overall efficacy for the HMF Baylis–Hillman reaction than pure water or the pure bio-based solvent. Such solvent systems can replace THF or dioxane, often used for BH reactions. However, pure bio-based solvents can be used in the case of the more polar glucosyloxymethylfurfural (GMF). These results show that the most appropriate medium must also take into account the polarity of the starting aldehyde.  aPublisher supplied data 3adioxane 3aethanol 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3aisopropyl alcohol 3asolvents1 aAhmar, Mohammed1 aQueneau, Yves0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 14, v. 5, no. 85 p.69238-69242dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra14554f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100007400152245016600226506010400392506007600496520123100572592002801803506003701831650002701868650002701895650001301922650001601935650004301951650002001994653001902014653002102033653001802054653001302072653001902085653001302104700002902117700007202146773009602218856008702314852000902401655001202410IND60770848520221207110001.0220412e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077084852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1089712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRíos-Castillo, Abel Guillermo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9416-647910aDetection by real-time PCR and conventional culture of Salmonella Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes adhered to stainless steel surfaces under dry conditions  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study evaluated the capacity of real-time PCR and conventional culture methods to detect Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes adhered to stainless steel surfaces used as food contact surfaces. The adhesion of the microorganisms to the surfaces was performed under dry conditions to represent the stress to which these pathogens can be subjected in the food processing environment. The samples were analyzed with various pre-enrichment times: S. Typhymurium (0, 6, and 18 h) and L. monocytogenes (0, 6, and 25 h) and with procedures concentrating or not concentrating the samples after the pre-enrichments. The results showed that real-time PCR obtained increased capacity than the conventional method to detect a low number of both pathogens, and real-time PCR even detected samples without pre-enrichment. However, pre-enrichment is recommended to avoid the detection of false positives from dead cells during adhesion and to ensure the absence of false negatives due to low initial concentrations. The concentration of the adhering bacteria increased the frequency in the detection of positive results for S. Typhimurium, but this effect was not observed in the case of L. monocytogenes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aadhesion 3afood safety 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astainless steel 0aS.

However, yield penalties, specific yield risks, or higher nutrient requirements may counteract the positive effects of reduced tillage. This study investigates long-term tillage effects (moldboard plow, and deep and shallow chisel plow) and their interactions with N fertilizer input on yields and economic performance in a corn (Zea mays L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)-wheat rotation in southern Germany. Conventional tillage (CT) and reduced tillage systems provided comparable economic returns. The systems of reduced tillage required higher surface-dribbled urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) fertilizer to corn and potato to be as efficient as the CT system. This may have implications for the overall environmental assessment of reduced tillage systems. For moderate- and higher-risk-averse producers, CT with usual fertilizer practice was more efficient than all other management options for the whole rotation. Farmers' risk aversion has no impact on the choice of the most efficient tillage and fertilizer management for potato (CT with usual fertilizer practice) and for corn (reduced tillage with increased fertilizer level). For wheat, the results show a high impact of risk aversion on the optimal choice of the tillage and fertilizer system. With increased energy prices, the economic savings of the reduced tillage systems due to reduced fuel use may be offset by higher fertilizer requirements since nitrous fertilizer prices are highly determined by energy costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprofitability 3aSolanum tuberosum 3awheat 3apotatoes 3aplowing 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3aland application 3arisk management 3aconventional tillage 3aurea ammonium nitrate 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer rates 3achiseling 3along term effects 3aenvironmental impact 3aGermany1 aGandorfer, Markus1 aGerl, Georg1 aKainz, Max0 tAgronomy journal.g2009 Nov., v. 101, no. 6 p.1538-1547dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2008.0126x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01614naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245006000157300001600217520069000233592002800923650001600951650002300967650002100990650002101011650002801032650002401060650000901084650000901093650001801102773011101120856004801231852000901279655001201288IND4468485420221121120230.0120315e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446848542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-012-1666-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Rui10aOat fibre: overview on their main biological properties  ap. 563-569.  aOat is a species of cereal grain grown for its seed and widely accepted to contain many valuable constituents.

The first increase in plasma 17b-estradiol (E₂), testosterone (T) and gonadosomatic index (GSI) was recorded in January; E₂ rose up to one month prior to ovulation, while T and GSI kept increasing until ovulation. Pituitary luteinizing hormone beta (lhb) transcript levels peaked at the time of ovulation. Except for transient changes before and after ovulation, ovarian follicle stimulating hormone receptor (fshr) transcript amounts were relatively stable at a high level. By contrast, luteinizing hormone receptor (lhcgr) transcript levels started out low and increased in parallel to GSI and plasma E₂ levels. Exposure to continuous light (LL) induced a bimodal response where maturation was accelerated or arrested. The LL-arrested females showed previtellogenic oil droplet stage follicles or primary yolk follicles only, and fshb and E₂ plasma levels collapsed while fshr increased. The LL-accelerated females showed elevated lhb transcript levels and slightly elevated E₂ levels during early vitellogenesis, and significantly elevated lhcgr E₂ and GSI levels in late vitellogenesis. We conclude that Fsh-dependent signaling stimulates recruitment into and the sustained development through vitellogenesis. Up-regulation of lhcgr gene expression during vitellogenesis may reflect an estrogenic effect, while elevated fshr gene expression following ovulation or during LL-induced arrestment may be associated with ovarian tissue remodeling processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aestrogenic properties 3afemales 3afish 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3afollicle-stimulating hormone receptors 3agene expression 3agonadosomatic index 3aluteinization 3aluteinizing hormone 3aluteinizing hormone receptors 3aoils 3aovarian follicles 3aovulation 3aspawning 3atestosterone 3avitellogenesis1 aSchulz, Rüdiger W.1 aMale, Rune1 aBogerd, Jan1 aPatiña, Danielle1 aBenedet, Susana1 aNorberg, Birgitta1 aTaranger, Geir Lasse0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 191 p.247-258dElsevier Inc.x0016-64807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2013.07.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009400171300001700265520101100282592002801293650003201321650000801353650002501361650001301386650002301399650002101422650002301443650001401466650001501480650002001495650001901515650003601534650002901570650003901599653002601638653001901664653001001683653001701693653002401710653003001734653002301764653001901787700002201806700003001828700001901858700003101877700002201908700002001930700002301950700002201973700001501995700002102010700005702031773010602088856008402194852000902278655001202287IND60629354120221116225922.0190131e20190103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062935412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2018.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Priyanka10aArginine Citrullination at the C-Terminal Domain Controls RNA Polymerase II Transcription  ap. 84-96.e7.  aThe post-translational modification of key residues at the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNAP2-CTD) coordinates transcription, splicing, and RNA processing by modulating its capacity to act as a landing platform for a variety of protein complexes. Here, we identify a new modification at the CTD, the deimination of arginine and its conversion to citrulline by peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 (PADI2), an enzyme that has been associated with several diseases, including cancer. We show that, among PADI family members, only PADI2 citrullinates R1810 (Cit1810) at repeat 31 of the CTD. Depletion of PADI2 or loss of R1810 results in accumulation of RNAP2 at transcription start sites, reduced gene expression, and inhibition of cell proliferation. Cit1810 is needed for interaction with the P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b) kinase complex and for its recruitment to chromatin. In this way, CTD-Cit1810 favors RNAP2 pause release and efficient transcription in breast cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3aamino acid sequences 3aarginine 3aarginine deiminase 3abreast neoplasms 3acell proliferation 3achromatin 3acitrulline 3agene expression 3aneoplasm cells 3apost-translational modification 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional elongation factors 0aRNA polymerase II CTD 0acitrullination 0aPADI2 0aarginine1810 0abreast cancer cells 0aproximal promoter pausing 0acell proliferation 0aP-TEFb complex1 aLioutas, Antonios1 aFernandez-Fuentes, Narcis1 aQuilez, Javier1 aCarbonell-Caballero, José1 aWright, Roni H.G.1 aDi Vona, Chiara1 aLe Dily, François1 aSchüller, Roland1 aEick, Dirk1 aOliva, Baldomero1 aBeato, Miguel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2878-22220 tMolecular cell.g2019 Jan. 03, v. 73, no. 1 p.84-96.e7dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011200161300001400273500001400287520120000301592002801501650001501529650001201544650002001556650001001576650001401586650001301600650001401613650001601627650001101643650001501654650001101669650002001680651001201700653002601712653002601738653001501764653003101779773010001810856007901910852000901989655001201998IND60729700620221118003027.0210306e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072970062DNAL7 a10.2478/helm-2021-00082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIacob, O.

Macroscopic examination of the general cavity revealed distension of the small intestine. The sectioning of the intestinal wall revealed a variable number of parasites (1 – 12) with a whitish cylindrical body, anchored in the duodenal mucosa. The morphological study of the parasites confirmed the species as Acantocephalus ranae. The prevalence of the infection was 60 % and the average intensity was 4.83 ± 4.15. Lesions of the small intestine were characterized by catarrhal enteritis, hemorrhagic spots and ulcers on the mucosa, occlusion and obstruction of the intestinal lumen. Histologically, eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate in the glandular crypts, mucosal and submucosal edema, fibrosis and conjunctival hyperplasia, total mucosal atrophy, were found. The infection with Acanthocephalus ranae in Pelophylax ridibundus caused severe pathological changes, conditioned by the intensity of the infection, aspects revealed for the first time in Romania.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPelophylax 3aatrophy 3adigestive tract 3aedema 3aenteritis 3afibrosis 3ahelminths 3ahyperplasia 3amucosa 3aparasitism 3arivers 3asmall intestine 3aRomania 0aPelophylax ridibundus 0aAcanthocephalus ranae 0aprevalence 0ahistopathological features0 tHelminthologia.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 58, no. 1 p.68-73dSciendowJournal:jnl24740x1336-90837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/helm-2021-00083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012700168520134200295592002801637650002401665650001601689650001701705650001601722650001401738650001101752650001901763650001801782650001601800650001801816650001501834650001601849650001601865650001701881650002601898650004401924650001801968650002901986653001402015653002202029653002202051653002702073653002302100653001602123700001202139700001402151700005802165773009602223856008702319852000902406655001202415IND60770848720221119115914.0220412e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077084872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1089732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Chenxi10aNMR-based metabolomic investigation on antimicrobial mechanism of Salmonella on cucumber slices treated with organic acids  aThe potential of organic acids to inactivate foodborne pathogens in food industry has gained attention, while the sanitizing mechanism of acid stress has not been explained fully at metabolomics level. The aim of this study was to elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of low-concentration organic acids (1.5% acetic acid, 1% citric acid, and 1.5% lactic acid) on Salmonella enterica strains (ATCC 6962, ATCC 13076, and ATCC 14028) inoculated on cucumber slices. Flow cytometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) combined with multivariate data analysis revealed that the population of S. enterica reduced 1.7–2.5 log CFU/g after different organic acid treatments. Bacterial membranes (2.37–19.00%) were destroyed and nucleic acid exposed, 40.27–85.33% of membranes was partially damaged, and 44 metabolites were identified from these three strains. The amino acids (Trp, Met, and Val) decreased significantly. Conversely, the intracellular organic acids and hydrocarbon grew obviously. The flux of marked metabolites showed that metabolisms of energy, amino acids, and carbohydrates pathways were disturbed which included TCA cycle, glycolysis, and biosynthesis of amino acids. The antibacterial mechanism on S. enterica provides clue to enhance the application of organic acids in controlling foodborne pathogens on fresh produce.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella enterica 3aacetic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acitric acid 3acucumbers 3aenergy 3aflow cytometry 3afood industry 3afood safety 3afresh produce 3aglycolysis 3alactic acid 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amultivariate analysis 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anucleic acids 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0aSanitizer 0aFood metabolomics 0aFresh-cut produce 0aSanitization mechanism 0aFoodborne pathogen 0aFood safety1 aHe, Yun1 aWang, Yue1 aYang, Hongshun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2965-43530 tFood control.g2022 July, v. 137 p.108973-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1089733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009200156300002000248520090800268592002801176650002201204650003601226650002001262650001401282650002801296650001701324650000901341650001601350650001401366650002301380700001801403700001701421700001301438700002001451700001801471700002001489773012501509856007401634852000901708655001201717IND60669220520221118231815.0190920e20151119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066922052DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra14559g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, He-Rui10aHomochiral luminescent lanthanide dinuclear complexes derived from a chiral carboxylate  ap. 98097-98104.  aA new family of homochiral lanthanide dinuclear complexes based on a chiral carboxylate, namely [Ln(R-pba)₃(phen)]₂ (Ln = La (1), Ce (2), Pr (3), Nd (4), Sm (5), Eu (6), Gd (7), Tb (8), Dy (9) and Ho (10), R-pba = (R)-2-phenylbutyric acid, phen = 1,10-phenanthroline), have been synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analyses and IR spectra.

In the present study sea bream vertebral bone transcripts for PTH1R and PTH3R were identified and the action of intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP) on the proteome of vertebral bone was analysed. Treatment of immature sea bream (Sparus auratus, n=6) for 5days with homologous recombinant PTHrP(1–125; 150ng/g body weight) modified bone metabolism and caused a significant (p<0.05) reduction in both tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in relation to control fish. However, the ratio of TRACP: ALP in PTHrP treated fish (1.3 to 2.2 cf. control) suggested it had an anabolic response. A sea bream vertebral bone proteome of 157 protein spots was generated and putative identity assigned to 118 (75.2%) proteins of which 72% had homology to proteins/transcripts from teleosts many of which have not previously been reported in teleost bone. Classification of bone proteins using gene ontology revealed those with protein or metal/ion (e.g., calcium, magnesium, zinc) binding (∼53%) activities were most abundant. The expression of eight proteins was significantly (p<0.05) modified in the vertebra of PTHrP treated compared to control fish; three were up-regulated, betainehomocystein S-methyltransferase, glial fibrillary acidic protein, parvalbumin beta and five were down-regulated, annexin A5, apolipoprotein A1, myosin light chain 2, fast skeletal myosin light chain 3, troponin C. In conclusion, intermittent administration of PTHrP to sea bream is associated with an anabolic response in vertebral bone metabolism and modifies calcium binding proteins in the proteome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparus aurata 3aacid phosphatase 3aacid tolerance 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aapolipoprotein A-I 3abody weight 3abone metabolism 3acalcium 3afish 3agenes 3amagnesium 3amyosin light chains 3aparathyroid hormone 3aproteome 3askeleton 3avertebrae 3azinc1 aGomes, Ana S.1 aRedruello, Begoña1 aReinhardt, Richard1 aCanário, Adelino V.1 aPower, Deborah M.0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 191 p.102-112dElsevier Inc.x0016-64807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2013.05.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245014900201506007600350520164900426592002802075506003702103650001802140650002002158650001002178650001002188650001302198650001002211650002102221650001502242650003002257650000902287650001002296650001502306650002302321650002602344650001502370650001502385650001402400650002002414650001402434650001702448650001702465650001002482650002102492700001802513700001702531700001702548700002202565700001902587700001502606773012102621856007302742961001302815852000902828655001202837IND60650100420221207132846.0190709e20170319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065010042DNAL7 a10.3390/nu90303042doi7 aPMC53729672pmcid7 a283354852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacifici, Sarina10aIntra Amniotic Administration of Raffinose and Stachyose Affects the Intestinal Brush Border Functionality and Alters Gut Microflora Populations  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study investigates the effectiveness of two types of prebiotics—stachyose and raffinose—which are present in staple food crops that are widely consumed in regions where dietary Fe deficiency is a health concern. The hypothesis is that these prebiotics will improve Fe status, intestinal functionality, and increase health-promoting bacterial populations in vivo (Gallus gallus). By using the intra-amniotic administration procedure, prebiotic treatment solutions were injected in ovo (day 17 of embryonic incubation) with varying concentrations of a 1.0 mL pure raffinose or stachyose in 18 MΩ H<inf>2</inf>O. Four treatment groups (50, 100 mg·mL−1 raffinose or stachyose) and two controls (18 MΩ H<inf>2</inf>O and non-injected) were utilized. At hatch the cecum, small intestine, liver, and blood were collected for assessment of the relative abundance of the gut microflora, relative expression of Fe-related genes and brush border membrane functional genes, hepatic ferritin levels, and hemoglobin levels, respectively. The prebiotic treatments increased the relative expression of brush border membrane functionality proteins (p < 0.05), decreased the relative expression of Fe-related proteins (p < 0.05), and increased villus surface area. Raffinose and stachyose increased the relative abundance of probiotics (p < 0.05), and decreased that of pathogenic bacteria. Raffinose and stachyose beneficially affected the gut microflora, Fe bioavailability, and brush border membrane functionality. Our investigations have led to a greater understanding of these prebiotics’ effects on intestinal health and mineral metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGallus gallus 3abioavailability 3ablood 3acecum 3aferritin 3agenes 3ahealth promotion 3ahemoglobin 3aintestinal microorganisms 3airon 3aliver 3amicrovilli 3amineral metabolism 3anutrient deficiencies 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3araffinose 3asmall intestine 3astachyose 3astaple crops 3asurface area 3avilli 3avirulent strains1 aSong, Jaehong1 aZhang, Cathy1 aWang, Qiaoye1 aGlahn, Raymond P.1 aKolba, Nikolai1 aTako, Elad0 tNutrients.g2017 Mar. 19, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu90303043Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010500167520179700272592002802069650001602097650001002113650001402123650001902137650001702156650001402173650001202187650003102199650001102230650001102241650001602252650001002268653002202278653002202300653002802322653001702350653002402367653001702391700002202408773009502430856008402525852000902609655001202618IND60687653420221118083557.0200621e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068765342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2020.1046872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoe, Liane S.10aWhich strategies to manage problem foods were related to weight loss in a randomized clinical trial?  aIndividuals managing their weight are often faced with problem foods that are difficult to resist eating. In the context of a weight-loss intervention, we characterized the most commonly reported problem foods and the behavioral strategies used to manage them, and examined which strategies were related to weight loss. Women with overweight and obesity (N = 186) participated in a one-year randomized trial of three interventions (NCT01474759): standard advice to eat less food, choosing portions based on energy density, and using pre-portioned foods. At Months 0, 6, and 12 of the trial, participants listed the foods they found most problematic and reported the frequency of using eight behavioral strategies to control intake of these foods, including three practices for avoiding exposure to problem foods and three for consuming them but limiting intake. The responses showed that 82% of the top three problem foods were in the categories of sweet baked items, salty snacks, starchy side dishes, chocolate and candy, and ice cream. After one year, women who reported more frequently using the strategy of limiting portions of problem foods had a greater rate of weight loss (kg/week), regardless of their intervention group (p < 0.0001). Among women who limited portions of problem foods less frequently, those using pre-portioned foods had greater initial weight loss compared to the other two groups, but then regained weight at a greater rate (p < 0.0001). The three avoidance strategies for problem foods were reported to be frequently used but were not found to be related to weight loss. These results suggest that adopting and maintaining strategies to manage portions of problem foods, rather than avoiding exposure to them, can be a more useful approach for weight loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3abaked goods 3acandy 3achocolate 3aenergy density 3afood choices 3aice cream 3aobesity 3arandomized clinical trials 3asnacks 3astarch 3aweight loss 3awomen 0aWeight management 0aObesity treatment 0aBehavioral intervention 0aPortion size 0aDiscretionary foods 0aFood craving1 aRolls, Barbara J.0 tAppetite.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 151 p.104687-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.1046873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05604naa a2201081 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132040001800167100002100185245011400206300001600320506002800336506003600364506007600400506003100476520276100507592002803268596008303296506003703379650001903416650001903435650000903454650002203463650001803485650001803503650002203521650001203543650001003555650001903565650002003584650001303604650002103617650002503638650002803663650001103691650001103702650001803713650001803731650001703749650002103766651001103787653000803798653002103806653000803827653000803835653000703843653000703850653000703857653000803864653000903872653000703881653000703888653000903895653001103904653001103915653000703926653000903933653000903942653000803951653000803959653000703967653000803974653000803982653000903990653000903999653001004008653001104018653000804029653001004037653001104047653001004058653001104068653000704079653000904086653001004095653000704105653001704112653001004129653002204139653002104161653003104182653002104213700002504234700002804259773010804287856008204395903002404477852000904501655001204510IND60593662420221207115008.0201125e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059366242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2018.01.0092chorus7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2018.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrzebisz, Witold10aVirtual nitrogen as a tool for assessment of nitrogen management at the field scale: A crop rotation approach  ap. 182-194.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe efficient management of nitrogen (N) requires accurate quantification of the critical components of the N balance. N budgeting was conducted on a production farm at Górzno, Poland during the 2004–2007 growing seasons for 17 crop sequences: ten oil-seed rape and winter wheat, six maize grown for grain or silage, and one onion monoculture. The measured N components were: i) soil N mineral content measured at 0.0–0.3, 0.3–0.6, and 0.6–0.9 m depths in the soil profile prior to spring growth and immediately after harvest, ii) applied N from fertilizer and farmyard manure, and iii) N content in the harvested crop products and crop residues. Two budgeting procedures, soil surface balance (SSuB), and soil system balance (SSyB), were used to evaluate the impact of cropping sequences on N management. The total N input ranged from 223 to 313 kg N ha⁻¹, primarily derived (40–50%) from the soil mineral N (Nₘᵢₙ). The N output depended on the N content in the harvestable crop component (R² = 0.93).The average unit productivity of external N in the soil-crop system was calculated to be 35.4 kg cereal units (CU) kg⁻¹ N. The critical level, defined as that level at which N resources were fully utilized by the crop, were 51.7 kg CUs kg⁻¹ N. Concomitantly, the average productivity of the total pool of plant available N was 19.9 kg CUs kg⁻¹ N, with a critical level of 29.8 kg CUs kg⁻¹ N. The difference between the average and critical values, a measure of N inefficiency in the soil-crop system, was used to quantify the un-workable pool of N herein defined as virtual N (NV). Cropping sequences with oilseed rape and winter wheat were less efficient in utilizing externally applied N compared to maize, which greatly increased the amount of N in the harvested product. The efficiency of N present in the soil-crop system can be improved by implementing two key strategies. The first strategy reduces N fertilizer input based on the total N content in the soil-crop system at the beginning of the growing season. The second strategy targets increasing the content of N in the primary yield component, which depends on N uptake and utilization efficiency from soil pools.The concept of virtual N, based on quantification of the un-worked Nₘᵢₙ pool, is a basis for sound management of N in a particular cropping sequence. The accuracy of NV determination based on SSyB characteristics was much more reliable than the SSuB procedure. The results offer holistic tools to develop N fertilizer management practices that reduce the application of excess N, in turn improving both N use efficiency and economic return to farmers while reducing the impact of the production system.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica napus 3aanimal manures 3acorn 3acosts and returns 3acrop residues 3acrop rotation 3acropping sequence 3afarmers 3afarms 3agrowing season 3amineral content 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aonions 3asilage 3asoil minerals 3asoil profiles 3awinter wheat 3ayield components 3aPoland 0aCUs 0aCropping systems 0aOSR 0aSMA 0aSB 0aWW 0aWR 0aNos 0aNfym 0aNf 0aNI 0aNmin 0aNmin-a 0aNmin-s 0aNO 0aNres 0aNrel 0aNTI 0aNTO 0aNY 0aNNB 0aNNE 0aNTNB 0aGTNB 0aNV-NI 0aNV-NTI 0aUNP 0aUNPNI 0aUNPNTI 0aYM-NI 0aYM-NTI 0aYR 0aYGNI 0aYGNTI 0aNV 0aOilseed rape 0aMaize 0aCropping sequence 0aNitrogen balance 0aNitrogen unit productivity 0aVirtual nitrogen1 aŁukowiak, Remigiusz1 aSassenrath, Gretchen F.0 tField crops research.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 218 p.182-194dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2018.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245012600203506007600329520153600405592002801941506003701969650002302006650001602029650001602045650001402061650001402075650003402089650001102123650002102134650000802155650002302163650001602186700002602202700002902228700002802257700002202285700002002307700002202327773012102349856007302470852000902543655001202552IND60650100520221207134202.0190709e20170319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065010052DNAL7 a10.3390/nu90303052doi7 aPMC53729682pmcid7 a283354892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarbonneau, Élise10aEffects of the Mediterranean Diet before and after Weight Loss on Eating Behavioral Traits in Men with Metabolic Syndrome  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) consumed before and after weight loss on eating behavioral traits as measured by the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) in men with metabolic syndrome (MetS). In this fixed sequence study, 19 men with MetS (National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATPIII) criteria), aged between 24 and 62 years, first consumed a five-week standardized North American control diet followed by a five-week MedDiet, both under weight-maintaining controlled-feeding conditions. This was followed by a 20-week caloric restriction weight loss period in free-living conditions, without specific recommendations towards adhering to the principles of the MedDiet. Participants were finally subjected to a final five-week MedDiet phase under isoenergetic controlled-feeding conditions. The MedDiet before weight loss had no impact on eating behavioral traits. Body weight reduction by caloric restriction (−10.2% of initial weight) was associated with increased cognitive restraint (p < 0.0001) and with reduced disinhibition (p = 0.02) and susceptibility to hunger (p = 0.01). Feeding the MedDiet for five weeks under isoenergetic conditions after the weight loss phase had no further impact on eating behavioral traits. Results of this controlled-feeding study suggest that consumption of the MedDiet per se has no effect on eating behavioral traits as measured by TFEQ, unless it is combined with significant weight loss.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMediterranean diet 3abody weight 3acholesterol 3acognition 3aeducation 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahunger 3alow calorie diet 3amen 3ametabolic syndrome 3aweight loss1 aRoyer, Marie-Michelle1 aRichard, C.q(Caroline),1 aCouture, P.q(Patrick),1 aDesroches, Sophie1 aLemieux, Simone1 aLamarche, Benoît0 tNutrients.g2017 Mar. 19, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu90303053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245012600158300001400284500001400298520211400312592002802426650003002454650001302484650001202497650001502509650001802524650001502542650001402557650001502571650002102586650001502607650002202622651001302644653002802657653001502685653002302700700001502723700001302738700001602751773010002767856007902867852000902946655001202955IND60729700820221118002934.0210306e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072970082DNAL7 a10.2478/helm-2021-00102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHailu, T.10aStrongyloides stercoralis infection in Ethiopia: systematic review and meta-analysis on prevalence and diagnostic methods  ap. 17-27.  aNAL-light  aStrongyloides stercoralis is a helminthic intestinal parasite that causes the disease strongyloidiasis. Its prevalence is high in tropics and sub-tropics due to poor sanitation and hygiene. However, its true prevalence is not well known in Ethiopia as most health institutions use low sensitive diagnostic methods. This review aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of S. stercoralis at country, and regional state levels. Papers published on S. stercoralis in Ethiopia from 2010 to 2020 were collected from PubMed, Google Scholar and Science direct databases and Addis Ababa repository. Identification, screening, checking the eligibility, and inclusion of the relevant literatures were done. Articles with S. stercoralis positive results from Ethiopian populations were included. Articles which focused on Strongyloides infection in foreigners, and other than stool samples were excluded. The pooled prevalence of S. stercoralis and heterogeneity between studies and across regions were computed. From the 43 articles, the overall prevalence of S. stercoralis in Ethiopia was 1.82 %. Across regions, relatively high prevalence of S. stercoralis (8.78 %) was recorded in Addis Ababa city. High prevalence of S. stercoralis was found to be 44.02 % with a combination of formol ether concentration, Baermann concentration, and molecular methods. Low prevalence of 0.26 %, 0.31 %, and 1.20 % was evidenced respectively with Kato-Katz, direct saline microscopy, and formol ether concentration methods. Using random effect analysis, the pooled prevalence of S. stercoralis in Ethiopia, across regions and across diagnostic methods was 2.1 % (95 %CI: 1.20 – 3.60), 2.6 % (95 %CI: 0.80 – 8.20) and 3.7 % (95 %CI: 1.10 – 11.70), respectively. The heterogeneity was high (P<0.001). This review revealed that Strongyloides infection is probably underreported and its prevalence could be higher than the reported in Ethiopia. Therefore, a revision of the best combination of diagnostic methods could be advisable as it gives better diagnostic results in routine diagnosis of Strongyloides infection in Ethiopia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStrongyloides stercoralis 3aformalin 3ahygiene 3aintestines 3ameta-analysis 3amicroscopy 3aparasites 3asanitation 3astrongyloidiasis 3asubtropics 3asystematic review 3aEthiopia 0aStrongyloides infection 0aprevalence 0adiagnostic methods1 aNibret, E.1 aAmor, A.1 aMunshea, A.0 tHelminthologia.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 58, no. 1 p.17-27dSciendowJournal:jnl24740x1336-90837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/helm-2021-00103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245020500164300001800369506011700387506007600504520104000580592002801620506003701648650002101685650001701706650001601723650002001739650001701759650001701776650001101793650002001804650001601824650001001840650001001850653002401860653002301884653001401907653002701921700001401948700001501962700001601977700001201993700001502005700001902020700001602039700001702055700001802072773012102090856004902211852000902260655001202269IND60776167520221207065005.0220502e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077616752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fshw.2022.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Ying10aIsolation of a novel characterized Issatchenkia terricola from red raspberry fruits on the degradation of citric acid and enrichment of flavonoid and volatile profiles in fermented red raspberry juice  ap. 1018-1027.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHigh content of citric acid in red raspberry juice leads to poor sensory experience. This study developed a feasible method to degrade citric acid in red raspberry juice using a novel characterized Issatchenkia terricola WJL-G4 isolated from red raspberry fruits. I. terricola WJL-G4 exhibited a potent capability of reducing the citric acid contents from (22.8 ± 0.08) g/L to (6.2 ± 0.02) g/L within 36h fermentation, then completely depleted after 48h. Furthermore, the contents of phenolic compound, including neochlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, raspberry ketone, and rutin significantly increased after 36h fermentation. Fermentation increased total flavonoid contents in red raspberry juice, compared to that in control group. Volatile profiles exhibited to be enriched after fermentation, which contributed to the improvement of the juice taste. Our findings showed that Issatchenkia terricola WJL-G4 can be applied in deacidification, enrichment of flavonoid compounds and volatile profiles in fermented red raspberry juice.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPichia terricola 3aRubus idaeus 3acitric acid 3adeacidification 3afermentation 3afood science 3ahumans 3ap-coumaric acid 3araspberries 3arutin 3ataste 0aRed raspberry juice 0aPhenolic compounds 0aVolatiles 0aIssatchenkia terricola1 aLuo, Ting1 aTang, Ying1 aChen, Sirui1 aNi, Hui1 aChen, Qihe1 aSong, Xingshun1 aBao, Yihong1 aDeng, Zeyuan1 aWang, Jinling0 tFood science and human wellness.g2022 July, v. 11, no. 4 p.1018-1027dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23299x2213-45307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fshw.2022.03.029  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001300191245008400204300001900288506007600307520120700383592002801590506003701618650001301655650001401668650002001682650002501702650001801727650000901745650001201754653001301766653001301779653002201792653002701814653001801841653001001859700002601869700002401895700001901919700001401938700001801952700001901970700002701989700002202016773010802038856008502146852000902231655001202240IND60629354420221207060520.0190202e20190117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062935442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2018.10.0392doi7 aPMC63385172pmcid7 a305276622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Fei10aPromoter-Enhancer Communication Occurs Primarily within Insulated Neighborhoods  ap. 250-263.e5.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMetazoan chromosomes are sequentially partitioned into topologically associating domains (TADs) and then into smaller sub-domains. One class of sub-domains, insulated neighborhoods, are proposed to spatially sequester and insulate the enclosed genes through self-association and chromatin looping. However, it has not been determined functionally whether promoter-enhancer interactions and gene regulation are broadly restricted to within these loops. Here, we employed published datasets from murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to identify insulated neighborhoods that confine promoter-enhancer interactions and demarcate gene regulatory regions. To directly address the functionality of these regions, we depleted estrogen-related receptor β (Esrrb), which binds the Mediator co-activator complex, to impair enhancers of genes within 222 insulated neighborhoods without causing mESC differentiation. Esrrb depletion reduces Mediator binding, promoter-enhancer looping, and expression of both nascent RNA and mRNA within the insulated neighborhoods without significantly affecting the flanking genes. Our data indicate that insulated neighborhoods represent functional regulons in mammalian genomes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnimalia 3achromatin 3adata collection 3aembryonic stem cells 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aregulon 0aenhancer 0apromoter 0achromatin looping 0ainsulated neighborhood 0atranscription 0aEsrrb1 aChronis, Constantinos1 aKronenberg, Michael1 aChen, Xiao-Fen1 aSu, Trent1 aLay, Fides D.1 aPlath, Kathrin1 aKurdistani, Siavash K.1 aCarey, Michael F.0 tMolecular cell.g2019 Jan. 17, v. 73, no. 2 p.250-263.e5dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.10.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003900149245013700188300001400325500001500339520141000354592002801764650002401792650001601816650001501832650001101847650001401858650001501872650001301887650002101900650001001921650001101931650001901942650001201961650002001973653001501993700002402008700002402032700001702056700001902073773010602092856008302198990002302281852000902304655001202313IND60099202220221117215147.0141105e20130915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009920222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygcen.2013.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeshita, Rafaela Sayuri Cicalise14aThe influence of age and season on fecal dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) concentrations in Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata)  ap. 39-43.  a2019-12-06  aDehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate, DHEAS, are the most abundant steroid hormones in primates, providing a large reservoir of precursors for the production of androgens. DHEAS levels decline with age in adult humans and nonhuman primates, prompting its consideration as a biomarker of senescence. However, the mechanisms responsible for this age-related decrease and its relationship to reproduction remain elusive. This research investigated DHEAS concentrations in fecal samples in order to determine age-related changes in captive Japanese macaques, as well as to assess the possible influence of seasonality. The subjects were 25 female Japanese macaques (2weeks to 14years-old) housed outdoors in social groups at the Primate Research Institute. We collected three fecal samples from each animal during the breeding season (October to December) and three additional samples from adult females during the non-breeding season (May to June). The hormonal concentrations were determined using enzyme immunoassay. DHEAS concentration was negatively correlated with age, but we did not find a significant difference between breeding and non-breeding seasons. Neonatal macaques had the highest DHEAS concentrations of all age groups. We suggest that elevated neonatal DHEAS is possibly a residue from fetal adrenal secretion and that, as in humans, it might assist in neurobiological development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzyme immunoassays 3acorrelation 3aprasterone 3ahumans 3asecretion 3abiomarkers 3abreeding 3asteroid hormones 3afeces 3aadults 3aMacaca fuscata 3afemales 3abreeding season 0asenescence1 aHuffman, Michael A.1 aBercovitch, Fred B.1 aMouri, Keiko1 aShimizu, Keiko0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 191 p.39-43dElsevier Inc.x0016-64807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2013.05.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245008500199506007600284520113600360592002801496506003701524650002301561650001401584650002401598650002001622650001801642650001601660650001701676650002001693650002101713650001801734650001901752650001701771650001701788650002301805650003001828650001501858650002201873650002301895650001501918650002101933650001601954650001201970650002101982700002002003700002602023773012102049856007302170852000902243655001202252IND60650100620221207134159.0190709e20170320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065010062DNAL7 a10.3390/nu90303062doi7 aPMC53729692pmcid7 a283355072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeyrol, Julien10aHydroxytyrosol in the Prevention of the Metabolic Syndrome and Related Disorders  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVirgin olive oil (VOO) constitutes the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet. VOO is rich in oleic acid, displaying health-promoting properties, but also contains minor bioactive components, especially phenolic compounds. Hydroxytyrosol (HT), the main polyphenol of olive oil, has been reported to be the most bioactive component. This review aims to compile the results of clinical, animal and cell culture studies evaluating the effects of HT on the features of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) (body weight/adiposity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia/insulin resistance) and associated complications (oxidative stress and inflammation). HT was able to improve the lipid profile, glycaemia, and insulin sensitivity, and counteract oxidative and inflammatory processes. Experimental studies identified multiple molecular targets for HT conferring its beneficial effect on health in spite of its low bioavailability. However, rodent experiments and clinical trials with pure HT at biologically relevant concentrations are still lacking. Moreover, the roles of intestine and its gut microbiota have not been elucidated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMediterranean diet 3aadiposity 3abioactive compounds 3abioavailability 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3acell culture 3aclinical trials 3ahealth promotion 3ahyperglycemia 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypertension 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3alipid composition 3ametabolic syndrome 3aoleic acid 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3arodents 3avirgin olive oil1 aRiva, Catherine1 aAmiot, Marie Josèphe0 tNutrients.g2017 Mar. 20, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu90303063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001700180245013500197506007600332520136200408592002801770506003701798650001601835650002401851650002501875650002101900650001801921650004301939650002601982650001502008650001302023650001402036650002502050700001302075700001502088773012102103856007302224852000902297655001202306IND60650100720221207134159.0190709e20170320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065010072DNAL7 a10.3390/nu90303072doi7 aPMC53729702pmcid7 a283355142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Bang-An14aThe Association between Vitamin D Deficiency and Diabetic Retinopathy in Type 2 Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEmerging evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that vitamin D may play an important role in the development of diabetic retinopathy (DR), but individually published studies showed inconclusive results. The aim of this study was to quantitatively summarize the association between vitamin D and the risk of diabetic retinopathy. We conducted a systematic literature search of Pubmed, Medline, and EMBASE updated in September 2016 with the following keywords: “vitamin D” or “cholecalciferol” or “25-hydroxyvitamin D” or “25(OH)D” in combination with “diabetic retinopathy” or “DR”. Fifteen observational studies involving 17,664 subjects were included. In this meta-analysis, type 2 diabetes patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D levels <20 ng/mL) experienced a significantly increased risk of DR (odds ratio (OR) = 2.03, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.07, 3.86), and an obvious decrease of 1.7 ng/mL (95% CI: −2.72, −0.66) in serum vitamin D was demonstrated in the patients with diabetic retinopathy. Sensitivity analysis showed that exclusion of any single study did not materially alter the overall combined effect. In conclusion, the evidence from this meta-analysis indicates an association between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood serum 3aconfidence interval 3adiabetic retinopathy 3ain vitro studies 3ameta-analysis 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobservational studies 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3avitamin D 3avitamin D deficiency1 aGao, Fan1 aQin, Lu-Lu0 tNutrients.g2017 Mar. 20, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu90303073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02161naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011600171300001800287520123500305592002801540653001501568653002001583653002001603653001101623653002301634700001901657773010401676856008201780852000901862655001201871IND60560996720221121150026.0170124e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056099672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.xphs.2016.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStillhart, Cordula10aTrends in the Assessment of Drug Supersaturation and Precipitation In Vitro Using Lipid-Based Delivery Systems  ap. 2468-2476.  aThe generation of drug supersaturation close to the absorptive site is an important mechanism of how several formulation technologies enhance oral absorption and bioavailability. Lipid-based formulations belong to the supersaturating drug delivery systems although this is not the only mechanism of how drug absorption is promoted in vivo. Different methods to determine drug supersaturation and precipitation from lipid-based formulations are described in the literature. Experimental in vitro setups vary according to their complexity and proximity to the in vivo conditions and, therefore, some tests are used for early formulation screening, while others better qualify for a later stage of development. The present commentary discusses this rapidly evolving field of in vitro testing with a special focus on the advancements in analytical techniques and new approaches of mechanistic modeling. The importance of considering a drug absorption sink is particularly emphasized. This commentary should help formulators in the pharmaceutical industry as well as in academia to make informed decisions on how to conduct in vitro tests for lipid-based delivery systems and to decide on the implications of experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data 0aabsorption 0asupersaturation 0abioavailability 0alipids 0amathematical model1 aKuentz, Martin0 tJournal of Pharmaceutical Sciences.g2016 Sept., v. 105 p.2468-2476dElsevier Inc.x0022-35497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2016.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100004300139245009400182300001600276520120900292592002801501650002501529650001001554650001401564650003701578650001601615650001101631651001101642700003301653700004601686700003701732700001301769773008301782856007301865852000901938655001201947IND60424990020221119083951.0151006e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6042499002DNAL7 a10.1111/pbr.123022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Ricardo Augusto Diniz Cabral10aImplications of the number of years assessment on recommendation of common bean cultivars  ap. 599-604.  aIn the common bean crop in Brazil, the requirement of the value for cultivation and use trials is that these experiments must be conducted over two years in three locations per region. Information in regard to the necessary number of years to ensure precision in cultivar recommendation and the influence of evaluated years in the estimation of the GE interaction are still scarce. Using grain yield of five check varieties assessed over 11 years in three sowing seasons per year, the aims of this study are as follows: to measure the relative contribution of the GE interaction, evaluating the implication of the number of years in the estimates of the GE interaction, and infer how many years are needed to ensure precision in cultivar recommendation. For instances, analysis of variance was carried out involving all environments and also combinations of years. The results showed that the GE interaction was greater than all other cross‐effects involving lines. The use of at least two years allows good coincidence in cultivar recommendation compared to the whole period. Increasing the evaluation time is a good strategy, especially when it is difficult to grow three different sowing seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3abeans 3acultivars 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrain yield 3asowing 3aBrazil1 aRamalho, Magno Antonio Patto1 aToledo, Fernando Henrique Ribeiro Barrozo1 aAbreu, Angela de Fátima Barbosa1 aLink, W.0 tPlant breeding.g2015 Oct., v. 134, no. 5 p.599-604dP.

Understanding the interactions between porphyrins and cell membranes is therefore important to rationalize the uptake of photosensitizers and their passive transport through cell membranes. In this study, we consider the properties of hematoporphyrin (Hp), a well-known photosensitizer for PD and PDT, in the presence of a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayer that we use as a model system for protein-free cell membranes. For this purpose, we employed 200 ns atomic-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for five systems containing the neutral (Hp⁰) or the dianionic form (Hp²–) of Hp and the POPC bilayer. MD simulations allowed one to estimate the position, orientation, and dynamics of Hp molecules inside the membrane. The dye molecules were found to reside in the phospholipid headgroup area close to the carbonyl groups of the POPC acyl chains. Their orientations were dependent on the protonation state of two propionic groups. Hp²– was found to have a lower affinity to enter the membrane than the neutral form. The dianions, being in the aqueous phase, formed stable dimers with a strictly determined geometry. Our results fully supported the experimental data and provide a more detailed molecular-level description of the interactions of photosensitizers with lipid membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell membranes 3achemical elements 3ageometry 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aphospholipids 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aporphyrins1 aKepczynski, Mariusz1 aJamróz, Dorota1 aNowakowska, Maria1 aRissanen, Sami1 aVattulainen, I.q(Ilpo),1 aRóg, Tomasz,0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Apr. 26, v. 116, no. 16 p.4889-4897dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp300899b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04777naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005100149245010100200520310300301592002803404650002603432650001603458650003403474650002803508650002803536650002103564650001503585650001003600650001003610650001803620650001203638650001003650650001603660650001303676650001103689650003303700650001403733650001103747650001303758650001803771650003003789650002403819650001803843650001003861650001403871650002203885650002003907650001603927651001003943700001303953700001303966700001303979773010303992856008304095852000904178655001204187IND60614015520221117001926.0180919e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061401552DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-10-17-1630-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2057-930710aFirst Report of Rhizoctonia solani AG-1-IB Causing Leaf Spot on Peucedanum praeruptorum in China  aPeucedanum praeruptorum Dunn, belonging to the family Umbelliferae, is an important plant used in Chinese medicine. Its roots are often used to treat cough, bronchitis, furuncle, and other diseases. Thus, it is commonly cultivated as an economic crop in the southwest and southeast of China. In August 2016, over 40% of P. praeruptorum plants showing necrotic spots (approximately 3-cm diameter) on the leaves were observed in the field in Pan’an, Zhejiang province, China. The plants presented symptoms whereby infected leaves initially exhibited circular or irregular, tiny light brown spots and water-soaked lesions. Over time, the spots expanded to become gray, often with some small black dots and dark brown margins. Under conditions of high temperature and high humidity, leaves collapsed with soft watery rot quickly. The symptomatic leaves were surface sterilized using 70% ethanol for 1 min and then rinsed in sterile distilled water (triplicate times) and dried on sterilized filter paper. The hyphal-tipping method was used to obtain the pure cultures. Three isolates (QH1, QH4, and QH6) were then transferred onto a potato dextrose agar (PDA) plate for 3 days. All the fungal colonies were light brown in color, exhibited fast growth, and formed circular shapes with radial margins on PDA. Sclerotia were dark brown, irregularly shaped, and produced after 5 days on PDA. Hyphae were branched with right-angle and a slight septal constriction at their bases, with 5.64 to 8.96 μm (average 7.30 μm) diameter. Multinucleate structure was observed when hyphal cells were stained with 1% safranin O and 3% KOH solution for 20 s (Bandoni 1979). The morphological and cultural characteristics of the isolates associated with necrotic spots on P. praeruptorum were in accordance with those of Rhizoctonia solani AG-1-IB (Bai et al. 2014). Polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed on the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region with primers ITS1 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990). Sequence analysis revealed that the isolate QH1 (GenBank accession no. MF447834) shared 100% identity with R. solani AG-1-IB (HF678122). To test for pathogenicity, 10 healthy P. praeruptorum leaves were wound inoculated with 5-day-old PDA hyphae plugs of R. solani isolates by placing the mycelium side of these PDA plugs in contact with the upper epidermis of these leaves, and the plastic domes were covered to maintain high humidity and temperature. Ten noninoculated plants served as the controls. All plants were maintained in a greenhouse at 25 to 30°C with natural light. Three days after inoculation, all treated leaves developed spot symptoms similar to those observed on naturally infected leaves in the field, whereas the control plants remained asymptomatic. R. solani was reisolated from all inoculated plants but not any of the control plants. The fungus was previously reported on Trifolium repens and Codonopsis lanceolata in China (Bai et al. 2014; Xie et al. 2015). To our knowledge, this is the first report of R. solani AG-1-IB causing leaf spot on P. praeruptorum in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCodonopsis lanceolata 3aDNA primers 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPeucedanum praeruptorum 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aTrifolium repens 3abronchitis 3acolor 3acough 3aculture media 3aethanol 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3ahumidity 3ahyphae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apotassium hydroxide 3aribosomal DNA 3aroots 3asclerotia 3asequence analysis 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3aChina1 aFang, L.1 aWang, L.1 aWang, H.0 tPlant disease.g2018 Aug., v. 102, no. 8 p.1668-dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-10-17-1630-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245008400205300001200289520093800301592002801239650001101267650001401278650002201292650001501314650002201329650001101351650001801362650001201380650001301392650001601405650001401421653003001435653002001465653001301485653002701498653003101525700002501556700001701581700001601598700001901614773009501633856008401728852000901812655001201821IND60603369420221117070708.0180716e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060336942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHidalgo, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4983-104310aCapillary rheology studies of INVAR 36 feedstocks for powder injection moulding  ap. 1-7.  aCapillary rheology was used to determine the shear viscosities of low expansion alloy INVAR 36 feedstocks for powder injection moulding (PIM) based on gas atomized powders and cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) and poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) binders. Different variables that describe the flow behaviour were analysed, in particular, the relationships between viscosity of the melted feedstock with different conditions, such as shear rate (γ˙), temperature (T), solid loading (Φ) and particle size (PS). The viscous behaviour was physically interpreted and discussed, and a generalised rheological model was proposed that involves all of the dependant parameters: γ˙, T, Φ and PS. The particular rheological behaviour of the feedstocks, which deviates from typical pseudoplastic behaviour, has a relevant correlation with the proposed model. Moreover, the model can be used when similar behaviours are observed in other systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3abutyrates 3acellulose acetate 3afeedstocks 3ainjection molding 3amodels 3aparticle size 3apowders 3arheology 3atemperature 3aviscosity 0aPowder injection moulding 0aRheology models 0aINVAR 36 0aPoly-(ethylene glycol) 0aCellulose acetate butyrate1 aJiménez-Morales, A.1 aBarriere, T.1 aGelin, J.C.1 aTorralba, J.M.0 tPowder technology.g2015 Mar., v. 273 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013700172300001400309520166500323592002801988650002202016650002002038650001102058650001602069650001202085650001502097650001302112650001302125650001802138650003102156650001302187650001302200650001202213650001302225650001602238650001802254653002302272653002902295653002702324653002402351653002002375653001302395700001902408700002002427700002202447700001702469700001802486773009702504856008402601852000902685655001202694IND60603369520221117070905.0180716e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060336952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinnarinen, Teemu10aWet grinding of CaCO3 with a stirred media mill: Influence of obtained particle size distributions on pressure filtration properties  ap. 54-61.  aChemical and process industries utilize stirred media mills for efficient fine grinding of solids. Stirred media mills, also referred to as stirred ball or stirred bead mills, generally have a good ability to produce fine particles with a relatively narrow particle size distribution. Wet grinding with vertical stirred ball mills is typically carried out for slurries containing particles smaller than 200μm, such as industrial minerals and pigments. Filtration is an important unit operation, which is performed in order to reduce the water content of the slurry after grinding and concentration, and prior to drying and transportation. Pressure filters are used to obtain the maximum dryness of the product. A number of properties of solids affect the filtration performance. The particle size and shape, the width of particle size distribution, and the net surface charge of the particles are among the factors having a significant influence on the filtration characteristics.In this study, the dependency of the pressure filtration properties of wet ground calcium carbonate (GCC) slurries on the grinding result obtained by a stirred media mill is investigated. After grinding, subsequent filtration experiments were carried out with a laboratory-scale pressure filter. Average specific cake resistances, porosities of the filter cakes, and cake compressibility parameters were determined from the filtration data. The results showed clear correlations between the particle size data and the related filtration properties. Interesting observations were also made regarding the average porosity of the filter cakes and the uncertainty of the experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium carbonate 3acompressibility 3adrying 3afilter cake 3afilters 3afiltration 3agrinding 3aminerals 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3apigments 3aporosity 3apowders 3aslurries 3auncertainty 3awater content 0aStirred media mill 0aGround calcium carbonate 0aOperational conditions 0aPressure filtration 0aCake resistance 0aPorosity1 aTuunila, Ritva1 aHuhtanen, Mikko1 aHäkkinen, Antti,1 aKejik, Pavel1 aSverak, Tomas0 tPowder technology.g2015 Mar., v. 273 p.54-61dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02039naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008200158300001600240520088800256592002801144650002301172650003601195650003101231650001801262650001401280650002201294650002901316650002001345700001701365700001601382700001101398700001601409700001901425773013801444856007401582852000901656655001201665IND60670548320221119163103.0191002e20131203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067054832DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta13447d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuo, Hongjing10aChiral zirconia nanotubes prepared through a sol–gel transcription approach  ap. 333-338.  aChiral nanomaterials have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in the fields of asymmetric catalysis, enantioseparation and chirality sensors. Herein, left- and right-handed helical zirconia nanotubes were prepared through a sol–gel transcription approach using the self-assembly of a pair of chiral low-molecular-weight gelators (LMWGs) as templates. The handedness of the zirconia nanotubes is controlled by that of the organic self-assembly. The calcined nanotubes had mixed monoclinic and tetragonal structures. The diffuse reflectance circular dichroism spectra indicated that the zirconia nanotubes exhibited optical chirality. The pyridinium rings of the LMWGs adsorb ZrO₂ nanoparticles through electrostatic interactions, and the amide groups transfer chirality to the inner surfaces of the ZrO₂ nanotubes through a CO⋯Zr⁴⁺ interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3aoptical isomerism 3areflectance spectroscopy 3azirconium oxide1 aWang, Sibing1 aLin, Shuwei1 aLi, Yi1 aLi, Baozong1 aYang, Yonggang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Dec. 3, v. 2, no. 2 p.333-338dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta13447d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009900168300001600267520101000283592002801293650002201321650002001343650002701363650001901390650001201409650001601421650004401437650001201481653002301493653001801516653001701534653002701551653002801578700003401606700002301640700002601663700002401689773010801713856008601821852000901907655001201916IND60570205220221120130751.0190318e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057020522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.06.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomán, Yony10aAnticoagulant and antithrombotic effects of chemically sulfated fucogalactan and citrus pectin  ap. 731-739.  aCitrus pectin (CP14) from Citrus sinensis, and a fucogalactan (E) and a glucan (G16) from Agaricus bisporus were isolated and structurally characterized. CP14 was constituted by (1→4)-linked α-d-GalpA units, E was composed by a (1→6)-linked α-d-Galp main-chain, partially substituted at O-2 by non-reducing end-units of α-l-Fucp or α-d-Galp, and partially methylated at O-3, whereas G16 was composed of (1→6)-linked β-d-Glcp units. The polysaccharides were sulfated giving rise to CP14S, ESL and G16S. The APTT and PT assays showed a decreasing order of anticoagulant activity for ESL, CP14S and G16S, respectively. ESL and CP14S showed greater anticoagulant activity. However, ESL reduced thrombus formation to 32.3% at a dose of 6.0mgkg−1, whereas CP14S inhibited totally the thrombus formation at 3.0mgkg−1, in vivo. NMR and methylation analyses showed that α-d-GalAp units of CP14S were sulfated in 2,3-O-position, whereas ESL was mainly sulfated in 2-O-, 2,3-O- and 2,3,4-O-positions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aCitrus sinensis 3aanticoagulant activity 3aanticoagulants 3aglucans 3amethylation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apectins 0aChemical sulfation 0aCitrus pectin 0aFucogalactan 0aAnticoagulant activity 0aAntithrombotic activity1 ade Oliveira Barddal, Helyn P.1 aIacomini, Marcello1 aSassaki, Guilherme L.1 aCipriani, Thales R.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 174 p.731-739dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.06.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002300136245013300159300001800292520125700310592002801567653001901595653002401614653002501638653001901663653002601682700002401708773010501732856007201837852000901909655001201918IND60127118020221123021456.0151110e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012711802DNAL7 a10.1554/02-3812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPigliucci, Massimo10aPerspective: genetic assimilation and a possible evolutionary paradox: can macroevolution sometimes be so fast as to pass us by?  ap. 1455-1464.  aThe idea of genetic assimilation, that environmentally induced phenotypes may become genetically fixed and no longer require the original environmental stimulus, has had varied success through time in evolutionary biology research. Proposed by Waddington in the 1940s, it became an area of active empirical research mostly thanks to the efforts of its inventor and his collaborators. It was then attacked as of minor importance during the ““hardening”” of the neo-Darwinian synthesis and was relegated to a secondary role for decades. Recently, several papers have appeared, mostly independently of each other, to explore the likelihood of genetic assimilation as a biological phenomenon and its potential importance to our understanding of evolution. In this article we briefly trace the history of the concept and then discuss theoretical models that have newly employed genetic assimilation in a variety of contexts. We propose a typical scenario of evolution of genetic assimilation via an intermediate stage of phenotypic plasticity and present potential examples of the same. We also discuss a conceptual map of current and future lines of research aimed at exploring the actual relevance of genetic assimilation for evolutionary biology.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBaldwin effect 0aevolutionary theory 0agenetic assimilation 0amacroevolution 0aphenotypic plasticity1 aMurren, Courtney J.0 tEvolution.g2003 July, v. 57, no. 7 p.1455-1464dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F02-3813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245016600153300001600319500002000335520133300355592002801688650002701716650002601743650001001769650002501779650002901804650001401833650001401847650001401861700005501875700005601930773013301986856007302119852000902192655001202201IND60608981520221119171431.0180815e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060898152DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.138902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRidge, Y.10aHigh‐throughput screening of a collection of known pharmacologically active small compounds for inhibitors of Salmonella invasion and intracellular replication  ap. 724-730.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: The aim of this study was to screen a chemical library consisting of over 1200 pharmacologically active, already approved off‐patent compounds, to determine whether any of the compounds reduced or eliminated the invasion or intracellular replication phenotypes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). METHODS AND RESULTS: LacZ reporter and tissue culture‐based infection assays were used to screen for compounds that significantly reduced expression of key virulence genes, and were required for the invasion or intracellular replication phenotypes of S. Typhimurium in host cells. The search lead to the discovery of four compounds that reduced invasion by between 90–100%, and two compounds that reduced intracellular replication by between 65–93% at concentrations of either 2, 10 or 50 μg ml⁻¹, relative to an untreated control strain. CONCLUSIONS: We identified six compounds that significantly reduced expression of S. Typhimurium virulence genes resulting in decreased in vitro virulence. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The emergence of multidrug‐resistant strains of Salmonella poses a considerable and growing worldwide threat to human and animal health. The screening of off‐patent chemical libraries represents a potential discovery route for novel antimicrobials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aanti-infective agents 3agenes 3amedicinal properties 3amultiple drug resistance 3aphenotype 3ascreening 3avirulence1 aLandini, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0999-426X1 aThompson, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3627-27160 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2018 Sept., v. 125, no. 3 p.724-730dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.138903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245005400170300001600224520116000240592002801400650001201428650002601440650001001466650000901476650001901485650001101504650002101515650001801536650001301554650001201567653001201579653001301591653001801604653001301622653001701635700002301652700002201675700002401697700002001721700001701741700003101758773009901789856008401888852000901972655001201981IND60603369720221117071840.0180716e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060336972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasettari, Luca10aDextran and its potential use as tablet excipient  ap. 125-132.  aDextrans are a class of carbohydrate polymers extensively applied in pharmaceutical applications, particularly as drug conjugate macromolecular carriers or drug delivery systems. These polysaccharides improve the stability of the therapeutics enabling also the control of their release, via either the parenteral and or oral routes. In the latter case, due to their gel forming ability they may have potential as hydrophilic matrix tablets for sustained drug release.In this paper, we investigated the behaviour of different molecular weight (1, 40, 500 and 2300kDa) dextrans as tabletting excipients. Powder particle size and hygroscopic studies have been reported, together with tabletability, tablet stability and tablet swelling. Moreover we use tramadol as model compound to evaluate the ability of dextrans to control drug dissolution. The results suggest that dextrans with lower molecular weights may be a promising excipient to be used as filler for immediate release tablets, due to their good tabletability and fast dissolution rate, while dextrans with higher molecular weights could be an efficient disintegrant due to their swelling ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3adextran 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3agels 3ahydrophilicity 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3apowders 0aDextran 0aTramadol 0aTabletability 0aSwelling 0aDrug release1 aBonacucina, Giulia1 aMorris, Gordon A.1 aPerinelli, Diego R.1 aLucaioli, Paolo1 aCespi, Marco1 aPalmieri, Giovanni Filippo0 tPowder technology.g2015 Mar., v. 273 p.125-132dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014400166300001800310520133200328592002801660650000801688650002501696650001101721650001201732650002101744650001001765650001001775650003001785650002501815650001401840650003101854650004301885650001501928700001601943700002001959700005901979773010702038856008202145961001302227852000902240655001202249IND60614015820221117002548.0180919e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061401582DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-10-17-1662-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jing-ru10aDetection and Identification of Six Monilinia spp. Causing Brown Rot Using TaqMan Real-Time PCR from Pure Cultures and Infected Apple Fruit  ap. 1527-1533.  aBrown rot is a severe disease affecting stone and pome fruit. This disease was recently confirmed to be caused by the following six closely related species: Monilinia fructicola, M. laxa, M. fructigena, Monilia polystroma, M. mumecola, and M. yunnanensis. Because of differences in geographic distributions, some of these species are important quarantine pathogens in certain countries. In this study, we developed TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to detect and identify the six species. Primer pairs and probes were designed for Monilinia fructicola, M. fructigena, M. laxa, and Monilia polystroma based on sequence differences in the laccase-2 genes. Additionally, based on sequence differences in the elongation factor genes, primer pairs and probes were designed for Monilia mumecola and M. yunnanensis. The real-time PCR assays were able to specifically identify the target pathogens, with detection limits of 10 to 100 fg of DNA, which is equivalent to one to seven conidia. The assays were also able to detect the target pathogens in a mixed DNA sample comprising all six Monilinia spp. and related species. The real-time PCR assays accurately detected target fungi from infected apple fruit. Furthermore, the identification results were consistent with those of traditional morphological methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMonilinia fructicola 3aapples 3aconidia 3adisease severity 3afungi 3agenes 3ageographical distribution 3ahybridization probes 3apathogens 3apeptide elongation factors 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aquarantine1 aGuo, Li-yun1 aXiao, Chang-lin1 aZhu, Xiao-qiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2721-77070 tPlant disease.g2018 Aug., v. 102, no. 8 p.1527-1533dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-10-17-1662-RE3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03623naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245013500177300001600312500001500328520183600343592002802179650001102207650002502218650000902243650002002252650001302272650001402285650001402299650002102313650002702334650001502361650001702376651001102393653002702404653000702431653000702438653000802445653002502453653000802478653001802486653001402504653002702518653000802545653000602553653001002559653000802569700001702577700001602594700002702610700002202637700002202659700002602681700002502707700002302732700002102755773011502776856008502891852000902976655001202985IND60527189520221120142710.0190412e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052718952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2016.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Cristine D.B.10aPhylogenetic analysis of canine distemper virus in South America clade 1 reveals unique molecular signatures of the local epidemic  ap. 135-141.  a2019-12-06  aCanine distemper virus (CDV) is a highly contagious pathogen for domestic dogs and several wild carnivore species. In Brazil, natural infection of CDV in dogs is very high due to the large non-vaccinated dog population, a scenario that calls for new studies on the molecular epidemiology. This study investigates the phylodynamics and amino-acid signatures of CDV epidemic in South America by analyzing a large dataset compiled from publicly available sequences and also by collecting new samples from Brazil. A population of 175 dogs with canine distemper (CD) signs was sampled, from which 89 were positive for CDV, generating 42 new CDV sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the new and publicly available sequences revealed that Brazilian sequences mainly clustered in South America 1 (SA1) clade, which has its origin estimated to the late 1980's. The reconstruction of the demographic history in SA1 clade showed an epidemic expanding until the recent years, doubling in size every nine years. SA1 clade epidemic distinguished from the world CDV epidemic by the emergence of the R580Q strain, a very rare and potentially detrimental substitution in the viral genome. The R580Q substitution was estimated to have happened in one single evolutionary step in the epidemic history in SA1 clade, emerging shortly after introduction to the continent. Moreover, a high prevalence (11.9%) of the Y549H mutation was observed among the domestic dogs sampled here. This finding was associated (p<0.05) with outcome-death and higher frequency in mixed-breed dogs, the later being an indicator of a continuous exchange of CDV strains circulating among wild carnivores and domestic dogs. The results reported here highlight the diversity of the worldwide CDV epidemic and reveal local features that can be valuable for combating the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenome 3aCanine morbillivirus 3adogs 3adata collection 3amutation 3aphylogeny 3apathogens 3acanine distemper 3amolecular epidemiology 3acarnivores 3amixed breeds 3aBrazil 0aMolecular epidemiology 0aCD 0app 0aSA1 0aAmino acid signature 0aEU1 0aSouth America 0aPhylogeny 0aCanine distemper virus 0aMLE 0aH 0atMRCA 0aCDV1 aGräf, Tiago1 aIkuta, Nilo1 aLehmann, Fernanda K.M.1 aPassos, Daniel T.1 aMakiejczuk, Aline1 aSilveira, Marcos A.T.1 aFonseca, André S.K.1 aCanal, Cláudio W.1 aLunge, Vagner R.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2016 July, v. 41 p.135-141dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245009200207300001400299520141000313592002801723650001101751650001301762650001301775650001101788650001301799650002601812650001201838650001301850650001301863653001301876653002701889653002401916653002701940773009701967856008402064852000902148655001202157IND60603369920221117070730.0180716e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060336992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Aqeeli, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4634-302810aCharacterization of nano-cemented carbides Co-doped with vanadium and chromium carbides  ap. 47-53.  aCemented carbides are ultra-hard composites used in a variety of applications that call for tough and wear-resistant materials. Conventional cemented carbide typically consists of grains of tungsten carbide (WC) embedded in a cobalt (Co)-based binder matrix. Often compounds are added that inhibit the growth of the WC grains and thus ensure a fine and homogeneous grain structure, to optimize hardness and toughness. Here, we report a detailed study of the structure and properties of cemented carbides that contain combined grain-growth inhibitors, i.e. vanadium carbide (VC) and chromium carbide (Cr3C2). The concentrations were varied and the mixtures were sintered at 1200°C and 1300°C to achieve optimum combination of properties. Alloy systems with a combination of both VC and Cr3C2 grain-growth inhibitors displayed superior mechanical properties compared to those in which only one inhibitor compound was present. The inclusion of VC produced lower densification with finer grains, whereas the incorporation of Cr3C2 produced a harder and tougher carbide. The compound WC–12Co–0.2VC–0.8Cr3C2 reached nearly full densification, with an average grain size of 50nm, a microhardness of 1690Hv30 and a fracture toughness of 12.5MPa∙m¹/². It is proven in this work that achieving a balanced concentration of both inhibitors is extremely vital to reach an optimum combination of properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acarbides 3achromium 3acobalt 3ahardness 3amechanical properties 3apowders 3atungsten 3avanadium 0aWC-based 0aNanocrystalline alloys 0aMechanical alloying 0aSpark plasma sintering0 tPowder technology.g2015 Mar., v. 273 p.47-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016600166300001400332520127600346592002801622650002701650650001201677650001801689650002301707650001901730650001201749650001201761650001501773700001801788700001801806773009301824856008201917990002301999852000902022655001202031IND60092719420221116180251.0141103e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009271942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ceca.2011.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoomber, S.J.10aCalcium-dependence of Donnan potentials in glycerinated rabbit psoas muscle in rigor, at and beyond filament overlap; a role for titin in the contractile process  ap. 91-97.  aIn glycerinated rabbit psoas muscle, Donnan potential measurements demonstrated that the net electric charge on the actin–myosin matrix undergoes a sharp switch-like transition at pCa₅₀=6.8. The potentials are 2mV less negative at the lower pCa²⁺ (P<0.001). If ATP is present, the muscle contracts and breaks the microelectrode. Therefore the rigor state was studied. There is no reason to suppose a priori that a similar voltage switch does not occur during contraction, however. Calcium dependence is still apparent in muscles stretched beyond overlap (sarcomere length>3.8μm) and is also seen in the gap filaments between the A- and I-band ends; further stretching abolishes the dependence. These experiments strongly suggest that calcium dependence is controlled initially by the titin component, and that this control is lost when titin filaments break. We suppose that that effect is mediated by the titin kinase in the M-line region and may involve the extensible PEVK region of titin. There is great interest in the electric charge on proteins in muscle within the structural system. We suggest how changes in these charges may control the calcium activation process. We also suggest some simple experimental approaches that could clarify these effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acalcium 3aextensibility 3amuscle contraction 3amuscle protein 3amuscles 3arabbits 3asarcomeres1 aBartels, E.M.1 aElliott, G.F.0 tCell calcium.g2011 July, v. 50, no. 1 p.91-97dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0143-41607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceca.2011.05.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013000163300001800293520149100311592002801802653002001830653001201850653002501862653001301887653001601900653002001916700001801936700001201954700002401966773013901990856008202129852000902211655001202220IND60560997320221121052214.0170124e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056099732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.xphs.2016.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Gang10aDevelopment and Evaluation of a Novel Drug Delivery: Pluronics/SDS Mixed Micelle Loaded With Myricetin In Vitro and In Vivo  ap. 1535-1543.  aThis study is to prepare and evaluate Pluronics-modified mixed micelle (MM) to deliver polyphenolic myricetin (MYR) across the blood-brain barrier. MYR has been proven to be an effective anticancer agent against glioblastoma cells in our previous studies. However, the poor solubility of MYR limits its access to the brain. In this study, the feasibility of preparing lipid-based MM that combined sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) with Pluronic F68 (F68) and Labrasol was investigated. Furthermore, the nonionic surfactant coating technology for the protection of MYR against oxidation, and its attainment in oral bioavailability, was examined. On account of the altered biomaterial properties of F68/SDS–modified lipid-based micelles, myricetin-loaded mixed micelles (MYR-MMs) were prepared by solvent-evaporation method to self-assembly into MMs. The average size of MYR-MMs was 96.3 nm, with negatively charged potential and spherical in shape. The drug loading of MYR-MMs was high with the increased grafting ratio, the more prolonged drug release profile, and more effective killing glioblastoma cells in vitro. Moreover, MYR-MMs showed a higher preference for the brain than free MYR alone, suggesting the novel MMs loaded with MYR could promote absorption and increase relative bioavailability. Taken together, the F68/SDS–modified and Labrasol-modified lipid-based micelles may provide a promising method to deliver polyphenolic compounds across the brain to treat brain tumor.  aPublisher supplied data 0amyricetin (MYR) 0aF68/SDS 0alipid-based micelles 0aLabrasol 0abrain tumor 0abioavailability1 aWang, Jun-Jie1 aLi, Fei1 aTo, Shing-Shun Tony0 tJournal of Pharmaceutical Sciences.g2016 Apr., v. 105 p.1535-1543dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Pharmacists Association®x0022-35497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2016.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004600151245009800197300001600295520125500311592002801566650002201594650001001616650002401626650001401650650001001664650000901674650002301683650002401706650001401730650001101744650000901755653002701764653002101791653001801812653001001830700003001840700003301870700002601903700003801929700002701967773012701994856008502121852000902206655001202215IND60466596320160411000000.0151126e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046659632DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2015.10500002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva-Matos, Raissa Rachel Salustriano10aNew organic substrates and boron fertilizing for production of yellow passion fruit seedlings  ap. 445-455.  aThe identification of alternative substrates suitable for seedling production is very important, while boron nutrition is also relevant due to plant requirement and its difficult management. Thus, four experiments were carried out from October 2012 to April 2013 to evaluate the effect of substrates using decomposed buriti (Mauritia vinifera Mart.) stem (DBS) and boron fertilizing for seedling production of yellow passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims). The experimental design was completely randomized in factorial scheme 6 × 2 + 1, referring to the substrates [S1: DBS, S2: soil and sand 1:1 (20%) + DBS (80%), S3: soil and sand 1:1 (40%) + DBS (60%), S4: soil and sand 1:1 (60%) + DBS (40%), S5: soil and sand 1:1 (80%) + DBS (20%), S6: commercial substrate (additional treatment) and S7: soil, sand and manure 1:1:2] with and without boron. The seedling emergence, emergence rate, plant height, stem diameter, root length, root volume and dry mass of roots and shoots were recorded. The substrates S2 (without B fertilizing) and S4 (B fertilized with 0.5 mg dm ⁻³) produced seedlings with more than 3.0 g of shoot dry mass and at least 30 cm in height, and can be used for production of high-quality yellow passion fruit seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMauritia flexuosa 3aboron 3aexperimental design 3anutrition 3aroots 3asand 3aseedling emergence 3aseedling production 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asoil 0aPassiflora edulis Sims 0aseedling quality 0agrowing media 0aboron1 ada Silva, Gabriel Barbosa1 ade Souza Marques, Adenaelson1 aMonteiro, Maciel Lima1 aCavalcante, Ítalo Herbert Lucena1 aOsajima, Josy Anteveli0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 62, no. 3 p.445-455dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2015.10500003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002200136245010000158300001800258520157000276592002801846653002401874653002301898653001801921653002601939653002401965653002201989700002502011773010502036856007202141852000902213655001202222IND60127118520221123021454.0151110e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012711852DNAL7 a10.1554/02-5182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCahan, Sara Helms10aReproductive division of labor between hybrid and nonhybrid offspring in a fire ant hybrid zone  ap. 1562-1570.  aInterspecific hybridization can often impose a substantial fitness cost due to reduced hybrid viability or fecundity. In social insects, however, such costs disproportionately impact reproductive offspring, whereas hybrids who become sterile workers can be functional, and even beneficial, colony members. Genomic imprinting of the paternal genome in reproductive, but not worker female offspring has been proposed as a mechanism to avoid genomic incompatibilities in hybrid queens in a hybrid zone between two fire ant species, Solenopsis geminata and S. xyloni. A study of allozyme variation demonstrated differences between the worker caste displaying a hybrid phenotype, and the winged queen caste displaying only the mother's phenotype. In this study, we investigate whether these differences are caused by genomic imprinting or genetic differences between castes by comparing variability of proteins to that of microsatellite markers. Workers and winged queens differed genetically at both classes of marker, indicating that allozyme differences were caused by underlying genetic differences between castes rather than differences in gene expression due to imprinting. Workers were F₁ S. geminata ×× S. xyloni hybrids, whereas nearly all winged queens were of pure S. xyloni ancestry. Thus, S. xyloni within the hybrid zone appears to have evolved social hybridogenesis, in which the loss of worker potential in pure-species offspring necessitates hybridization for worker production, but prevents hybrids from being represented in the reproductive caste.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCaste determination 0agenomic imprinting 0ahybridization 0asocial hybridogenesis 0aSolenopsis geminata 0aSolenopsis xyloni1 aVinson, S.

Ribavirin is highly soluble, but its permeability characteristics are not well defined. Therefore according to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System, and taking a “worst case” approach, ribavirin should be assigned to class III. As ribavirin is transported across the brush border membrane of the human jejunum by hCNT2, it shows saturable uptake in the intestine. However, no common excipients have been shown to compete for ribavirin absorption, nor have problems with BE of immediate release ribavirin formulations containing different excipients and produced by different manufacturing methods been reported in the open literature. So the risk of bioinequivalence caused by these factors appears to be low. Ribavirin is considered a narrow therapeutic index drug, as judged by comparing the minimum effective concentration and minimum toxic concentrations in blood. Although ribavirin would not be eligible for approval via a Biopharmaceutical Classification System–based biowaiver procedure according to today's guidances due to its narrow therapeutic index, the risks of biowaiving should be weighed against the considerable risks associated with studying BE of ribavirin products in healthy subjects.  aPublisher supplied data 0aribavirin 0aabsorption 0aBCS 0abiowaiver 0apermeability 0asolubility1 aBarazesh Morgani, Ahmadreza1 aAbrahamsson, Bertil1 aCristofoletti, Rodrigo1 aGroot, D.W.1 aLangguth, Peter1 aMehta, Mehul U.1 aPolli, James E.1 aShah, Vinod P.1 aDressman, J.

Based on the fluorescence quenching time scale, PET in micelles is grouped into two types: (i) ultrafast electron transfer (ET) due to the close contact of the donor and acceptor in micelles and (ii) diffusion averaged dynamic electron transfer (DADET) which is controlled by the diffusion of the reactants in micellar Stern layer and diffusion of the micelles. The DADET does not affect the photoionization and solvation processes whereas ultrafast ET competes with the photoionization and faster than the solvation process. Both ultrafast and DADET shows Marcus inversion in the ET rates at the similar exergonicity and indicates that the role of diffusion and solvent reorganization is negligible toward the activation barrier for the ET reaction in micelles. The activation barrier for the ET reactions in micelles is mainly due to intramolecular reorganization energy. The intramolecular reorganization energy must be higher in CTAB due to the photoionization and subsequent recombination and also involvement of triplet state in the PET. The ET reaction between coumarin radical cation and amine is reported for the first time in the C307-amine systems in micelles which are confirmed by the effect on amine concentration of the decay of coumarin radical cation and the dynamics of the ground-state recovery of C307. A mechanism for the PET reaction between C307–amine systems is proposed in micelles including photoionization, ultrafast and dynamic ET, and solvation dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaromatic amines 3acations 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3acoumarin 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3amicelles 3asolvents1 aSelvaraju, Chellappan0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Apr. 26, v. 116, no. 16 p.4908-4920dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp301412c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011800168300001400286520131000300592002801610650001801638650001201656650002101668650002001689650002001709650001001729650001401739650001101753650001701764650001901781650001701800650001901817650002701836650001401863650002401877650003601901700001901937700002001956700001901976700002001995700001902015700001802034700002102052700002302073700001902096700002102115773009302136856008202229990002302311852000902334655001202343IND60092719620221116180644.0141103e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009271962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ceca.2011.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Wan-Chen10aHistamine regulates cyclooxygenase 2 gene activation through Orai1-mediated NFκB activation in lung cancer cells  ap. 27-35.  aHistamine, an important chemical mediator, has been shown to regulate inflammation and allergic responses. Stimulation of histamine receptors results in a significant increase in cytoplasmic Ca²⁺, which could be mediated by inositol trisphosphate (IP₃)-dependent store-operated Ca²⁺ channels (SOC). However, the link between histamine-mediated signaling and activation of inflammatory genes such as cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is still unknown. Our study indicated that the COX-2 protein was highly expressed in human lung cancer cells. Following stimulation with 10μM of histamine, both store-operated Ca²⁺ entry (SOCE) and COX-2 gene expression were evoked. Histamine-mediated COX-2 activation can be prevented by 2-APB and SKF-96365, SOC channel inhibitors. In addition, deletion analysis of the COX-2 promoter suggested that the region between −80bp and −250bp, which contains NFκB binding sites, is the key element for histamine-mediated signaling. Knocking down ORAI1, one of the essential molecules of store-operated calcium channels, attenuated histamine-mediated COX-2 expression and NFκB activation. These results indicated that ORAI1-mediated NFκB activation was an important signaling pathway, responsible for transmitting histamine signals that trigger inflammatory reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3acalcium 3acalcium channels 3agene activation 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahistamine 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3alung neoplasms 3amyo-inositol 3aneoplasm cells 3aprostaglandin synthase 3areceptors 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aChai, Chee-Yin1 aChen, Wei-Chiao1 aHou, Ming-Feng1 aWang, Yu-Shiuan1 aChiu, Yi-Ching1 aLu, Shiang-Ru1 aChang, Wen-Chang1 aJuo, Suh-Hang Hank1 aWang, Jaw-Yuan1 aChang, Wei-Chiao0 tCell calcium.g2011 July, v. 50, no. 1 p.27-35dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0143-41607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceca.2011.04.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01713naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010500159300001600264520066900280592002800949650002400977650001601001650001001017650001001027650001401037650001301051651001001064700002201074700001801096700002101114700001901135700002001154773009501174856007301269852000901342655001201351IND60424993220221119083937.0151006e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6042499322DNAL7 a10.1111/ens.121442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAoki, Shigeyuki10aNipponaphis species (Aphididae: Hormaphidinae) that form green galls on Distylium racemosum in Japan  ap. 420-434.  aSome species of the aphid genus Nipponaphis (Nipponaphidini) form green, globular or fig‐shaped galls on the evergreen Distylium racemosum, their primary host.

These salts were preferentially dissolved in the polyether phases. The ionic transport mechanism of the polyethers was discussed in terms of the diffusion coefficients and ionic transference numbers of the incorporated ions, which were estimated by means of pulsed-field gradient spin–echo (PGSE) NMR. There was a distinct difference in the ionic transport properties of each polymer electrolyte owing to the difference in the magnitude of interactions between the cations and the polyether. The anionic diffusion coefficient was much faster than that of the cation in the polyether/Li[NTf₂] electrolyte, whereas the cation diffused faster than the anion in the polyether/[C₂mim][NTf₂] electrolyte. Ionic polymer actuators, which have a solid-state electric-double-layer-capacitor (EDLC) structure, were prepared using these polymer electrolyte membranes and ubiquitous carbon materials such as activated carbon and acetylene black. On the basis of the difference in the motional direction of each actuator against applied voltages, a simple model of the actuation mechanisms was proposed by taking the difference in ionic transport properties into consideration. This model discriminated the behavior of the actuators in terms of the products of transference numbers and ionic volumes. The experimentally observed behavior of the actuators was successfully explained by this model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphysical chemistry 3aactivated carbon 3aactuators 3alithium 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3asalts 3adiffusivity 3amodels 3acations 3aacetylene 3aelectric power 3aelectrical equipment 3aionic liquids 0aelectrolytes1 aKatō, Yūichi,1 aKokubo, Hisashi1 aWatanabe, Masayoshi0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Apr. 26, v. 116, no. 16 p.5080-5089dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp301501c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02011naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011400166300001300280520073400293592002801027650001101055650002401066650001901090650001801109650001201127650003301139650002501172650002201197653002701219653001801246653002701264700001801291700001801309700001901327700001901346700001801365700001701383773009601400856008401496852000901580655001201589IND60603370020221120205714.0180716e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060337002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Lai-Ma10aPreparation and characteristics of W–1wt.% TiC alloy via a novel chemical method and spark plasma sintering  ap. 8-12.  aA chemical method was used to synthesize W/TiC composite powder.

Because of their favorable toxicologic profiles, CDs are often used in toxicologic and phase I assessments of new drug candidates. However, at relatively high concentrations, CDs can spontaneously self-assemble to form visible microparticles in aqueous mediums and formation of such visible particles may cause product rejections. Formation of subvisible CD aggregates are also known to affect analytical results during product development. How and why these CD aggregates form is largely unknown, and factors contributing to their formation are still not elucidated. The physiochemical properties of CDs are very different from simple amphiphiles and lipophilic molecules that are known to self-assemble and form aggregates in aqueous solutions but very similar to those of linear oligosaccharides. In general, negligible amounts of aggregates are formed in pure CD solutions, but the aggregate formation is greatly enhanced on inclusion complex formation, and the extent of aggregation increases with increasing CD concentration. The diameter of the aggregates formed is frequently less than about 300 nm, but visible aggregates can also be formed under certain conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 0acyclodextrin 0aaggregates 0acomplexation 0ainclusion compounds1 aDo Thi, Thao1 aStappaerts, Jef1 aBertoletti, Laura1 aKimpe, Kristof1 aSá Couto, André Rodrigues1 aSaokham, Phennapha1 aVan den Mooter, Guy1 aAugustijns, Patrick1 aSomsen, Govert W.1 aKurkov, Sergey1 aInghelbrecht, Sabine1 aArien, Albertina1 aJimidar, M.

The photoanode films were composed of submicrometer-sized beads consisting of packed TiO₂ nanocrystallites. A power conversion efficiency up to 4.05% has been achieved for a CdS/CdSe quantum dot (QD) co-sensitized solar cell, which was constructed with the mesoporous TiO₂ beads prepared with a two-step method, in which an optimal amount of ammonia was adopted to etch TiO₂ spheres and achieve the desired porosity of the beads for QD adsorption. The high conversion efficiency was ascribed to a combined effect of the mesoporous structure, light scattering ability and good electrical conduction capability of the beads. It has been found that larger pores can be created by adding more ammonia during the solvothermal treatment, leading to easy penetration of the QDs into the inner pores of the mesoporous beads. An excessive amount of ammonia would lead to a low specific surface area and decrease of light scattering capability of the films. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed a retarded charge recombination for the mesoporous TiO₂ beads treated with ammonia in view of a decreased contact area of the beads with the electrolyte, reflected in the increase of both open circuit voltage and fill factor of the solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3acadmium 3acadmium sulfide 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrolytes 3alight scattering 3ananocrystallites 3aporosity 3aporous media 3aquantum dots 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3asurface area 3atitanium dioxide1 aZhang, Qifeng1 aUchaker, Evan1 aLan, Jolin1 aYin, Min1 aCao, Guozhong0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Jan. 28, v. 2, no. 8 p.2517-2525dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta13460a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009100169300001600260520123900276592002801515650001701543650002001560650002301580650001701603650000901620650002601629650001901655650001901674650001901693650003701712650001801749650001701767650001801784650001901802650001201821650001101833651000901844653001801853653003401871653002601905653003701931653002801968653001201996700001802008700002502026700002702051773012702078856008502205852000902290655001202299IND60466596720160411000000.0151126e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046659672DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2015.10603212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamani, Javad10aOpposite effects of two organic wastes on the physical quality of an agricultural soil  ap. 413-427.  aSoil application of organic wastes (OWs) can be beneficial for soil quality, depending on the quality of the wastes as well as on the amended soil. We performed a field experiment comparing the effects of two different OWs, an industrial sewage sludge (ISS) and a municipal solid waste compost (MSWC), on the physical, chemical and biological quality of an agricultural soil cultivated with maize in central Iran. The two OWs were mixed into the topsoil of the plots at rates of 15 and 45 t ha ⁻¹ (dry matter). The analysis of soil samples taken 31, 74, 132 and 241 days after OW application showed both OW increased organic matter, microbial respiration, and urease activity and decreased bulk density. In contrast, they had opposite effects on water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity. While the MSWC increased water retention at high saturation and saturated hydraulic conductivity, the ISS decreased them. The negative effects of the ISS on physical soil quality, which may have been due to pore-clogging and hydrophobicity effects, were related to a smaller yield increase in the ISS than in the MSWC treatments, demonstrating the importance that physical OW properties can have for the quality of amended soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMSW composts 3aadverse effects 3aagricultural soils 3abulk density 3acorn 3afield experimentation 3ahydrophobicity 3aorganic matter 3aorganic wastes 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asewage sludge 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3asoil treatment 3atopsoil 3aurease 3aIran 0asewage sludge 0amunicipal solid waste compost 0awater retention curve 0asaturated hydraulic conductivity 0asoil quality indicators 0aS-index1 aAfyuni, Majid1 aSepehrnia, Nasrollah1 aSchulin, R.q(Rainer),0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 62, no. 3 p.413-427dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2015.10603213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245015000156300001600306520153600322592002801858650001901886650001301905650001501918650001801933650001901951650002101970650001001991650001502001650001402016650002002030650003302050650001102083650001302094700001802107700002002125700001902145700001802164700001902182700001702201773011002218856007302328852000902401655001202410IND60515906520221118061326.0160321e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051590652DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.121782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiena, A.

The structural and three‐dimensional characteristics of oral denticles from the rostro‐ventral surface of the sharpnose shark Rhizoprionodon lalandii were described following imaging by both light and scanning electron microscopy. The light microscopy results showed that the triangular shape of the denticles consisted of a base and an apex. Picrosirius staining showed the arrangement of collagen fibres and oral denticles, and a predominance of type‐I collagen was found in both structures under polarized light. There was a broad homogeneous distribution of denticles on the ventral surface, forming a leaf‐like shape with the cusp facing the caudal region. Interlocking, hexagonal, geometric structures on its rostral side and ridges on the rostral side of the oral denticles were observed under increased magnification. We concluded that the denticle morphology found in R. lalandii differ of others analysed species, and the descriptions of these structures therefore provide important information for the classification of the species. In this species, the main functions can be assigned to help reduce hydrodynamic drag, particularly by this being a species that uses ram ventilation, and to protect the epithelium of the oropharynx of abrasion and parasites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizoprionodon 3acollagen 3aepithelium 3ahydrodynamics 3aimage analysis 3alight microscopy 3amouth 3aoropharynx 3aparasites 3apolarized light 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asharks 3astaining1 aS.

Based on segmental monitoring, a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-variable wavelength detection method was established for simultaneous quantification of ten major flavonoids, and the quantitative data were further analyzed by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). A strong cation exchange-high performance liquid chromatography (SCX-HPLC) method combined with t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was developed to determine synephrine, the major alkaloid in AFI and AF. The essential oils were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and further processed by partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA). The results indicated that the contents of ten flavonoids and synephrine in AFI were significantly higher than those in AF, and significant difference existed in samples from different geographical origins. Also, 9 differential volatile constituents detected could be used as chemical markers for discrimination of AFI and AF. Collectively, the proposed comprehensive analysis might be a well-acceptable strategy to evaluate the quality of traditional citrus herbs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aherbs 3aalkaloids 3amonitoring 3at-test 3aessential oils 3acluster analysis 3acations 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleast squares 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprovenance 3achemometrics 3aflavonoids 3awavelengths 3aCitrus 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 0aChemometrics methods 0aAurantii Fructus 0aChromatographic analysis 0aAurantii Fructus Immaturus 0aanalysis of variance1 aZeng, Su-Ling1 aDuan, Li1 aMa, Xiao-Dong1 aDou, Li-Li1 aWang, Lan-Jin1 aLi, Ping1 aBi, Zhi-Ming1 aLiu, E-Hu0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Oct. 21, v. 1469 p.96-107dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2016.09.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01868naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002800136245010100164300001800265520088500283592002801168653002101196653002701217653001901244653002201263653001401285653002301299700002501322700002101347773010501368856007201473852000901545655001201554IND60127119120221120153425.0151110e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012711912DNAL7 a10.1554/02-6672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndréé, Jean-Baptiste10aWithin-host parasite dynamics, emerging trade-off, and evolution of virulence with immune system  ap. 1489-1497.  aVirulence is an evolutionary paradox because parasites never benefit from their host's death. The adaptive explanation of virulence is classically based upon the existence of physiological constraints that create a trade-off between parasites' epidemiological traits (virulence, transmissibility, and clearance). Here we develop an epidemiological model where infections are dynamic processes and we demonstrate how these dynamics generate a trade-off between emerging epidemiological parameters. We then study how host's immune strength modifies this trade-off and hence influences virulence evolution. We found that in acute infections, where parasites are engaged in a race with immune cells, immunity restrains more the duration of the infection than its intensity. As a consequence parasites evolve to provoke more virulent but shorter infections in strongly immunized hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAcute infections 0aevolution of virulence 0amicroparasites 0aspecific immunity 0atrade-off 0awithin-host models1 aFerdy, Jean-Baptiste1 aGodelle, Bernard0 tEvolution.g2003 July, v. 57, no. 7 p.1489-1497dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F02-6673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012500170300001400295520138600309592002801695650001201723650002201735650001601757650001001773650001701783650002101800650002101821650001401842700002201856700001701878700001601895700001601911700001701927700001501944700001801959773009301977856008202070990002302152852000902175655001202184IND60092720020221119124729.0141103e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009272002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ceca.2011.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbou-lovergne, A.10aInvestigation of the role of sigma1-receptors in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate dependent calcium signaling in hepatocytes  ap. 62-72.  aIn hepatocytes, as in other cell types, Ca²⁺ signaling is subject to complex regulations, which result largely from the intrinsic characteristics of the different inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP₃R) isoforms and from their interactions with other proteins. Although sigma1 receptors (Sig-1Rs) are widely expressed in the liver, their involvement in hepatic Ca²⁺ signaling remains unknown. We here report that in this cell type Sig-1R interact with type 1 isoforms of the InsP₃ receptors (InsP₃R-1). These results obtained by immunoprecipitation experiments are confirmed by the observation that Sig-1R proteins and InsP₃R-1 colocalize in hepatocytes. However, Sig-1R ligands have no effect on InsP₃-induced Ca²⁺ release in hepatocytes. This can be explained by the rather low expression level expression of InsP₃R-1. In contrast, we find that Sig-1R ligands can inhibit agonist-induced Ca²⁺ signaling via an inhibitory effect on InsP₃ synthesis. We show that this inhibition is due to the stimulation of PKC activity by Sig-1R, resulting in the well-known down-regulation of the signaling pathway responsible for the transduction of the extracellular stimulus into InsP₃ synthesis. The PKC sensitive to Sig-1R activity belongs to the family of conventional PKC, but the precise molecular mechanism of this regulation remains to be elucidated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalcium signaling 3ahepatocytes 3aliver 3amyo-inositol 3aprecipitin tests 3aprotein kinase C 3areceptors1 aCollado-Hilly, M.1 aMonnet, F.P.1 aKoukoui, O.1 aPrigent, S.1 aCoquil, J.F.1 aDupont, G.1 aCombettes, L.0 tCell calcium.g2011 July, v. 50, no. 1 p.62-72dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0143-41607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceca.2011.05.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245008800181300001400269520141400283592002801697650002101725650001501746650001901761650003401780650000801814650002401822650001301846650001301859650001201872650001401884650001701898650001601915650002201931650002101953650000901974653002101983653002402004653002402028653000902052653003102061700001902092700002102111773009702132856008402229852000902313655001202322IND60603370420221120205734.0180716e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060337042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazmierczak-Razna, Justyna14aThe use of microwave radiation for obtaining activated carbons enriched in nitrogen  ap. 71-75.  aThe activated carbons were synthesized from hay with CO2 as an activating agent. Furthermore hay and the chars obtained by pyrolysis were treated with urea, in order to introduce nitrogen to their structure, and then subjected to physical activation. The porous structure of activated carbons before and after impregnation was characterised by nitrogen adsorption using BET and BJH methods. The thermal properties of the samples were investigated by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and differential thermogravimetry (DTG).The final products were activated carbons of low surface area varying from 84 to 196m²/g and showing basic character of the surface. The impregnation of hay and chars with urea leads to a decrease in activated carbon surface area and pore volume. However, the materials modified by urea show a very high content of nitrogen (from 8.1 to 12.8wt.%), which could be achieved thanks to the use of microwave heating as this method of heating permits a considerable reduction of the temperatures of pyrolysis and activation and a shortening of the time of activation. Following the character of TG and DTG curves, the nitrogen functional groups introduced into the activated carbon structure have relatively low thermal stability, as evidenced by the distinct loss of mass above the temperature of approximately 400°C, observed both for unmodified carbon and the carbon enriched in nitrogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3adifferential thermal analysis 3ahay 3amicrowave radiation 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3apowders 3apyrolysis 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3aurea 0aActivated carbon 0aMicrowave radiation 0aPhysical activation 0aUrea 0aPhysicochemical properties1 aNowicki, Piotr1 aPietrzak, Robert0 tPowder technology.g2015 Mar., v. 273 p.71-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011300163300001600276520091500292592002801207650001201235650001101247650002201258650002301280650001601303650001701319650001401336650001401350650001201364650001601376650002101392653002101413653005201434653003301486653002701519700001501546700001501561700001501576700001101591773009601602856008401698852000901782655001201791IND60556438220221121154132.0170711e20161014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055643822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2016.09.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Xue10a7,10-Diphenylfluoranthene grafted polysiloxane as a highly selective stationary phase for gas chromatography  ap. 192-199.  aA novel 7,10-diphenylfluoranthene grafted polysiloxane (DPFP) was synthesized and statically coated on a fused-silica capillary column. High column efficiency (3864 plates per m) was achieved for naphthalene at 120°C. Thermo-gravimetric analysis showed that the DPFP polymer began to decompose at 380°C. The chromatogram of polyethylene pyrolysis products indicated that the maximum allowable temperature of the DPFP column could reach 360°C. By relying on its specific π-π stacking and dipole-induced dipole interactions with aromatic solutes, the DPFP stationary phase achieved excellent resolution for substituted benzene and aromatic hydrocarbons with satisfactory peak shapes, as well as showed superiority to current stationary phases that failed to resolve some critical pairs. Moreover, DPFP also showed good selectivity and resolving ability for Grob test mixtures, fatty acid esters, and ethers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3aethers 3afatty acid esters 3agas chromatography 3anaphthalene 3apolyethylene 3apyrolysis 3asiloxanes 3asolutes 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 0aStationary phase 0a7,10-Diphenylfluoranthene grafted polysiloxanes 0aCapillary gas chromatography 0aSeparation performance1 aWang, Huan1 aHe, Xinxin1 aWang, Bing1 aWu, Bo0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Oct. 14, v. 1468 p.192-199dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2016.09.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012800167300001400295520104600309592002801355650001201383650001701395650001701412650002301429650001301452650001101465650001001476650001901486650001001505650004101515650001501556650001001571650001301581650002101594650000901615650002601624650002501650650001201675651002101687653001701708653002101725653002201746653001401768653001701782653001001799653001801809700001801827773011501845856008501960852000902045655001202054IND60466596920221119160529.0151126e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046659692DNAL7 a10.1080/0972060X.2014.10011842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBagci, Eyup10aComposition of the Essential Oils of Two Umbelliferae Herbs (Artedia squamata and Malabaila secacul) Growing Wild in Turkey  ap. 44-51.  aApiaceae are a family of medicinal plants widely used in traditional medicine and they are employed commercially as species or drugs because of their richness on useful secondary metabolites.

In all engineering projects, the economic aspect has been considered of paramount importance. It is cost that decides whether a certain project will be feasible or not. The problem of determining the cost of any scheme is often difficult, because the cost varies considerably with time and tariff conditions. In the present research work, a case study has been undertaken for economic analysis. In this case study, the second option of refurbishment and uprating has been explored. The new uprated capacity has been achieved in this research paper from a century old hydro power plants located in Himalayas. The major contributions of this research work have been that of increased capacity of existing power plant, and economic feasibility with minimum investment in minimum time frame. Such an approach is of great significance to society as it has least impact on both the society and environment and at the same time it results in availability of more energy and increased generation capacity. The investigations have shown that the project holds great scope for refurbishment and uprating.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aeconomic feasibility 3aenergy 3aengineering 3aexperts 3apower plants 3asociety 3atariffs 3awater power 0aCapacity addition 0aDistribution 0aGeneration 0aPresents value 0aTransmission1 aAshwani Kumar,0 tRenewable energy.g2016 Feb., v. 86 p.1197-1204dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2015.09.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012100166300001800287520146600305592002801771650001801799650002601817650001901843650001001862650002301872650000901895650001501904650001201919650001401931650001001945650001701955650004301972650001102015700001302026700001802039700001702057700001602074700001702090700001702107700001802124773012602142856008202268852000902350655001202359IND60752855920221121075245.0211224e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075285592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-020-0238-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaojuan10aScreening of stable internal reference genes by quantitative real-time PCR in humpback grouper Cromileptes altivelis  ap. 1985-1999.  aHumpback grouper Cromileptes altivelis is one commercial fish with considerable economic value. To determine the expression stabilities of six commonly used internal reference genes in C. altivelis challenged by Vibrio harveyi and viral nervous necrosis virus (VNNV) through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), the expression levels of selected genes in five immune organs stimulated with pathogenic infection were carefully evaluated using algorithms of geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The results show that the expression stabilities of the six candidate internal reference genes were different. Under normal physiological conditions, RPL13 were identified as the most stably expressed genes among five different immune organs (liver, spleen, kidney, intestine, and gill). After V. harveyi stimulation, RPL13, RPL13, EF1A, RPL13, and EF1A were identified by geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper as the most stable genes in liver, spleen, kidney, intestine, and gill, respectively. Combining these three algorithms suggested that under stimulation of VNNV, RPL13, EF1A, Actin, RPL13, and Actin were as the most stable genes in liver, spleen, kidney, intestine, and gill, respectively. These results suggest that specific experiment conditions and tissue types shall be considered when selecting the reference genes in qRT-PCR analysis. This study provided a solid foundation for future studies on gene expression of C. altivelis under different conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetanodavirus 3aCromileptes altivelis 3aVibrio harveyi 3aactin 3aeconomic valuation 3afish 3aintestines 3akidneys 3alimnology 3aliver 3aoceanography 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aspleen1 aSun, Yun1 aZhang, Panpan1 aLi, Jianlong1 aLi, Haiping1 aWei, Caoying1 aCao, Zhenjie1 aZhou, Yongcan0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2021 Sept., v. 39, no. 5 p.1985-1999dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-020-0238-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245017200166300001600338500002000354520136800374592002801742650002001770650001201790650002301802650002401825650001901849650001201868650002601880650001901906650001501925700001601940700002301956700005601979773013302035856007302168852000902241655001202250IND60608982420221119171658.0180815e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060898242DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.139092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanley‐Thomson, A.A.10aEvaluating the role of total organic carbon in predicting the treatment efficacy of biosand filters for the removal of Vibrio cholerae in drinking water during startup  ap. 917-928.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: In biosand filters (BSF), treatment is largely driven by the development of a biolayer (schmutzdecke) which establishes itself during the startup phase. In this study, the effect of changing influent total organic carbon (TOC) loading on the removal efficiency of Vibrio cholerae in laboratory‐operated BSFs was quantified. METHODS AND RESULTS: BSFs were charged with high, medium or low TOC influents and removal efficacy and schmutzdecke composition was monitored over 2 months. The highest V. cholerae removal efficiencies were observed in the BSF receiving the lowest TOC. Schmutzdecke composition was found to be influenced by influent TOC, in terms of microbial community structure and amount of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). CONCLUSIONS: Physical/chemical attachment was shown to be important during startup. The BSF receiving influent water with lower TOC had a higher attachment coefficient than the BSF receiving high TOC water, suggesting more physical/chemical treatment in the lower TOC BSF. The high TOC BSF had more EPS than did the biofilm from the low‐TOC BSF, suggesting that schmutzdecke effects may be more significant at high TOC. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Overall, this study confirms that influent water characteristics will affect BSF treatment efficacy of V. cholerae especially during the startup phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio cholerae 3abiofilm 3achemical treatment 3acommunity structure 3adrinking water 3afilters 3amicrobial communities 3aorganic carbon 3aprediction1 aHuang, E.C.1 aWorley‐Morse, T.1 aGunsch, C.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8555-03130 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2018 Sept., v. 125, no. 3 p.917-928dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.139093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008100167300001600248520179200264592002802056650003202084650001002116650002202126650002202148650001602170650001402186650001002200650001202210651001002222651001002232653003202242653002002274653000702294653001402301653002802315700001602343700001502359700001402374700001702388700001902405700001902424700001402443700001302457700001502470700001902485700001502504700001802519773011502537856008502652852000902737655001202746IND60527190520221122053441.0190412e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052719052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2016.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Wenjie10aGenetic diversity of subgenotype 2.1 isolates of classical swine fever virus  ap. 218-226.  aAs the causative agent of classical swine fever, the economically devastating swine disease worldwide, classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is currently classified into the 11 subgenotypes, of which subgenotype 2.1 is distributed worldwide and showing more genetic diversity than other subgenotypes. Prior to this report, subgenotype 2.1 was divided into three sub-subgenotypes (2.1a–2.1c). To further analyze the genetic diversity of CSFV isolates in China, 39 CSFV isolates collected between 2004 and 2012 in two Chinese provinces Guangxi and Guangdong were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis together with reference sequences retrieved from GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 190-nt and/or 1119-nt full length E2 gene fragments showed that current CSFV subgenotype 2.1 virus isolates in the world could be divided into 10 sub-subgenotypes (2.1a–2.1j) and the 39 isolates collected in this study were grouped into 7 of them (2.1a–2.1c and 2.1g–2.1j). Among the 10 sub-subgenotypes, 2.1d–2.1j were newly identified. Sub-subgenotype 2.1d isolates were circulated only in India, however the rest 9 sub-subgenotypes were from China with some of them closely related to isolates from European and neighboring Asian countries. According to the temporal and spatial distribution of CSFV subgenotype 2.1 isolates, the newly classified 10 sub-subgenotypes were further categorized into three groups: dominant sub-subgenotype, minor sub-subgenotype and silent sub-subgenotype, and each sub-subgenotype can be found only in certain geographical areas. Taken together, this study reveals the complex genetic diversity of CSFV subgenotype 2.1 and improves our understanding about the epidemiological trends of CSFV subgenotype 2.1 in the world, particularly in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClassical swine fever virus 3agenes 3agenetic databases 3agenetic variation 3ahog cholera 3aphylogeny 3aswine 3aviruses 3aChina 3aIndia 0aClassical swine fever virus 0aSubgenotype 2.1 0aE2 0aPhylogeny 0aGeographic distribution1 aWu, Jianmin1 aLu, Zongji1 aZhang, Li1 aQin, Shaomin1 aChen, Fenglian1 aPeng, Zhicheng1 aWang, Qin1 aMa, Ling1 aBai, Anbin1 aGuo, Huancheng1 aShi, Jishu1 aTu, Changchun0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2016 July, v. 41 p.218-226dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015200173300001500325520148700340592002801827650001801855650001401873650002001887650001601907650002401923650001201947650002101959653002601980653002102006653004102027653002502068700002502093700006002118773009802178856008402276852000902360655001202369IND60603370620221120205626.0180716e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060337062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanda, Brajabihari10aPhysicomechanical and physicochemical characterizations of biexponential compaction process of paracetamol in the presence of talcum-lubricated-MCC  ap. 91-101.  aParacetamol exhibits poor compressibility, poor mechanical performance and very difficult to be tableted alone by direct compression method. In the present study compaction process of paracetamol has been characterized in the presence of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) after talcum lubrication. Compressibility parameters under tapping related to apparent density were obtained by biphasic linear plots. Compacts were prepared over a compression pressure of 24.5 to 343.2MPa, and change in apparent density and tensile strength was recorded. Primary rearrangement and the secondary rearrangement were the two major steps clearly observed during particle rearrangement process, and the primary rearrangement packing rate was found faster compared to secondary packing rate in all powder formulations. First step of packing compacted to a greater extent compared to the second step during the entire tapping process. Under applied pressure, density difference due to compaction by particle rearrangement was observed to be very high compared to compaction by plastic deformation in the formulations. Solid bridge formation and mechanical interlocking were found to be more intensified as the MCC amount increased with the consequent increase of mechanical strength of the formulation. Level A correlation has been established between tensile strength and apparent density change at the same pressure. Increased loading of MCC in the compacted tablet also increased drug dissolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3acellulose 3acompressibility 3alubrication 3aplastic deformation 3apowders 3atensile strength 0aTalcum-lubricated-MCC 0aTensile strength 0aCompaction tabletability correlation 0aIn vitro dissolution1 aDigdarsini, Tanmayee1 aMallick, Subrata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6606-12230 tPowder technology.g2015 Mar., v. 273 p.91-101dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245018700156300001600343520152500359592002801884650001801912650002001930650001101950650001201961650003301973650000902006650001202015650001502027650001102042650002302053650001502076650001102091650001402102650002402116650001402140650001002154650001102164650001302175650001602188650001002204650002102214651001002235651001602245700002202261700002202283700002102305700001902326700002002345773009502365856007302460852000902533655001202542IND60424995220221119083648.0151006e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6042499522DNAL7 a10.1111/ens.121382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Wanggyu10aLife history strategy and adult and larval behavior of Macrodiplosis selenis (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), a species that induces leaf‐margin fold galls on deciduous Quercus (Fagaceae)  ap. 470-478.  aLife historical, behavioral and ecological traits of Macrodiplosis selenis, which induces leaf‐margin fold galls on Quercus serrata, Q. mongolica and Q. dentata (Fagaceae) in Japan and South Korea, were studied. Daily activity and larval development indicate that M. selenis is a diurnal and univoltine gall midge. In April, females lay their eggs both on upper and under surfaces of fresh leaves. The duration of the egg stage varies from 5 to 9 days, depending on daily temperatures. Hatched larvae crawl to the upper surface of the leaf margin, where they start to induce galls. Larvae become full‐grown in October, drop to the ground in November and overwinter in cocoons on the ground, while larvae of congeners mature in May and drop to the ground in June. A relatively long period of the second larval stadium from July to October on the host trees seems to be effective for M. selenis in avoiding summer mortalities caused by predation and aridity on the ground and by ectoparasitoids that attack mature larvae or pupae on the host leaves. The spatial distribution pattern of M. selenis leaf galls is contagious and the mean gall density per leaf is significantly correlated with the mean crowding. This study adds new insights of life history strategy and adult and larval behavioral pattern to the ecological knowledge of gall midges, and these kinds of information are essential for further studies of M. selenis population dynamics and interactions with other Quercus‐associated herbivores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCecidomyiidae 3aQuercus serrata 3aadults 3acocoons 3adry environmental conditions 3aeggs 3afemales 3aherbivores 3alarvae 3alarval development 3aleaf galls 3aleaves 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3apredation 3apupae 3asummer 3asurfaces 3atemperature 3atrees 3aunivoltine habit 3aJapan 3aSouth Korea1 aMatsunaga, Kiyoko1 aGyoutoku, Naohisa1 aMatsuo, Kazunori1 aMinami, Tsuneo1 aYukawa, Junichi0 tEntomological science.g2015 Oct., v. 18, no. 4 p.470-478dBlackwell Pub.x1343-87867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ens.121383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009500166300001400261520176800275592002802043650001802071650002202089650001202111650001002123650001602133650001402149650001202163650002302175650001202198651001202210700001902222773009102241856004802332852000902380655001202389IND50088954320221116144124.0140423e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008895432DNAL7 a10.1007/s13165-014-0065-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsai, Masayasu10aCollaborative partnerships between organic farmers in livestock-intensive areas of Denmark  ap. 63-77.  aSpecialisation within organic agriculture in many western European countries has led to the decoupling of crop and animal systems, resulting in a shortfall in manure fertilisers on most farms and a surplus on others. One solution to solve a problem has been the establishment of collaborative partnerships between specialist organic farms for manure exchange. The aim of this study is to acquire factual knowledge about existing partnerships. A survey was undertaken of dairy farms in livestock-intensive areas of Denmark, identifying and comparing 95 partnerships between organic dairy farms and organic arable farms with 144 partnerships between conventional dairy farms and conventional arable farms. In order to understand the diversity of strategies among organic farmers, five types of partnerships were identified. The character and functioning of the organic partnerships are influenced by the high demand for organic-certified manure on organic arable farms, but many organic dairy-arable partners also have strong social connections irrespective of the distances involved. The five organic partnership types showed that the organic partners’ strategies were influenced by environmental regulations as well as social connections and location. Trust and reciprocal relationships through high-quality communication and well-functioning institutional arrangements seem to play pivotal roles for partnerships to be maintained. As organic farmers are continuously facing global market conditions and tightening regulations, the development of collaborative partnerships which could contribute to adaptability and flexibility is essential. These findings are not exclusive to organic farmers and may also apply to other intensive livestock regions in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy farming 3aenvironmental law 3afarmers 3afarms 3afertilizers 3alivestock 3amarkets 3aorganic production 3asurveys 3aDenmark1 aLanger, Vibeke0 tOrganic agriculture.g2014 Mar., v. 4, no. 1 p.63-77dSpringer-Verlagx1879-42387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13165-014-0065-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245008900162300002000251520120700271592002801478650001301506650002501519650002101544650002101565650001101586650002201597650001601619650001801635650001901653650001901672650001401691650001901705650001101724650002001735650001701755650002101772650002601793700001701819700001601836700001701852773014401869856007402013852000902087655001202096IND60670549720221119163000.0191002e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067054972DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta13481d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatthe, Sanjay S.10aHigh energy electron beam irradiated TiO₂ photoanodes for improved water splitting  ap. 13567-13575.  aPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting holds great promise for harvesting solar energy. We found that the high energy electron beam irradiation has a strong influence on the photoelectrochemical water splitting performance of aerosol deposited (AD) TiO₂ thin films. A high energy electron beam with energy of 0.2 MeV was used for modifying the surface structure of TiO₂ thin films. The electron beam irradiated film showed an enhanced water splitting activity as compared to the non-irradiated, pure AD TiO₂ films. The pure TiO₂ films produced a photocurrent density of ∼40 µA cm⁻² at −0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl, whereas the electron beam irradiated TiO₂ films showed a pronounced increase in the photocurrent density of ∼205 µA cm⁻² at −0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl under UV light illumination. The chemical composition, surface morphology and roughness of the AD films were investigated. The photoresponse characteristics of the films before and after the e-beam irradiation were compared. We demonstrated that the e-beam irradiation technology can effectively alter the surface micro and nanostructure of semiconductor photocatalysts to significantly improve the water splitting activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3achemical composition 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3afilms (materials) 3airradiation 3ananomaterials 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotochemistry 3aroughness 3asemiconductors 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3asolar energy 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation1 aAn, Seongpil1 aJin, Sungho1 aYoon, Sam S.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 1, no. 43 p.13567-13575dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta13481d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002300136245013400159300001800293520120700311592002801518653001601546653001401562653002201576653002601598653001501624653001501639773010501654856007201759852000901831655001201840IND60127119520221123044956.0151110e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012711952DNAL7 a10.1554/03-0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenberg, Noah A.14aTHE shapes of neutral gene genealogies in two species: probabilities of monophyly, paraphyly, and polyphyly in a coalescent model  ap. 1465-1477.  aThe genealogies of samples of orthologous regions from multiple species can be classified by their shapes. Using a neutral coalescent model of two species, I give exact probabilities of each of four possible genealogical shapes: reciprocal monophyly, two types of paraphyly, and polyphyly. After the divergence that forms two species, each of which has population size N, polyphyly is the most likely genealogical shape for the lineages of the two species. At ∼∼1.300N generations after divergence, paraphyly becomes most likely, and reciprocal monophyly becomes most likely at ∼∼1.665N generations. For a given species, the time at which 99%% of its loci acquire monophyletic genealogies is ∼∼5.298N generations, assuming all loci in its sister species are monophyletic. The probability that all lineages of two species are reciprocally monophyletic given that a sample from the two species has a reciprocally monophyletic genealogy increases rapidly with sample size, as does the probability that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for a sample is also the MRCA for all lineages from the two species. The results have potential applications for the testing of evolutionary hypotheses.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCoalescence 0agene tree 0alabeled histories 0apopulation divergence 0aspeciation 0aYule model0 tEvolution.g2003 July, v. 57, no. 7 p.1465-1477dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F03-0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100006300180245008700243300001800330500002000348506007600368520143000444592002801874506003701902650002801939650001301967650002701980650001502007650001902022650001302041650001602054650001102070650001402081700002002095700002402115700002002139700002402159773012802183856007302311852000902384655001202393IND60608982520221207104328.0180815e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060898252DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.126822doi7 aPMC66380062pmcid7 a295693162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSperschneider, Jana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9385-858810aImproved prediction of fungal effector proteins from secretomes with EffectorP 2.0  ap. 2094-2110.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlant‐pathogenic fungi secrete effector proteins to facilitate infection. We describe extensive improvements to EffectorP, the first machine learning classifier for fungal effector prediction. EffectorP 2.0 is now trained on a larger set of effectors and utilizes a different approach based on an ensemble of classifiers trained on different subsets of negative data, offering different views on classification. EffectorP 2.0 achieves an accuracy of 89%, compared with 82% for EffectorP 1.0 and 59.8% for a small size classifier. Important features for effector prediction appear to be protein size, protein net charge as well as the amino acids serine and cysteine. EffectorP 2.0 decreases the number of predicted effectors in secretomes of fungal plant symbionts and saprophytes by 40% when compared with EffectorP 1.0. However, EffectorP 1.0 retains value, and combining EffectorP 1.0 and 2.0 results in a stringent classifier with a low false positive rate of 9%. EffectorP 2.0 predicts significant enrichments of effectors in 12 of 13 sets of infection‐induced proteins from diverse fungal pathogens, whereas a small cysteine‐rich classifier detects enrichment in only seven of 13. EffectorP 2.0 will fast track the prioritization of high‐confidence effector candidates for functional validation and aid in improving our understanding of effector biology.

This paper presents a new analytical approach by which the stress profile on a loaded conveyor belt can be modelled. We propose a new hypothesis of the dynamic movement of bulk material during conveyance based on recent experimental discovery. We investigate the internal friction within bulk material, as well as the interface behaviour between bulk material and the belt. The presented analytical approach incorporates both the stress field analysis and the Stress Discontinuity method. The resulting Stress Discontinuity model can fully characterise active and passive stress states within bulk material. Compared with results of on-site experiments and a widely accepted previous model, it shows that a good correlation can be achieved. The Stress Discontinuity model is verified by comparison to a series of experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aconveyors 3aengineering 3afriction 3amodels 3apowders 3aprediction 0aBelt conveyor 0aBulk material 0aStress profile 0aIdler 0aStress discontinuity1 aPang, Yusong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8094-34361 aLodewijks, Gabriël,0 tPowder technology.g2015 Mar., v. 273 p.102-110dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012000168300001600288520114200304592002801446650001401474650002801488650002301516650001801539650002001557650001401577650001001591650001701601650000901618653001101627653001901638653002201657653002201679653002201701700001401723700002001737700001801757700001601775700001501791773010801806856008601914852000902000655001202009IND60570206220221120113346.0190318e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057020622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.06.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shujun10aEffect of dual modification by annealing and ultrahigh pressure on properties of starches with different polymorphs  ap. 549-557.  aThe effects of dual modification by annealing (ANN) and ultrahigh pressure (UHP) on properties of wheat, yam, and potato starches were investigated. Compared with the single UHP treatment (400MPa), ANN-UHP (400MPa) treatment did not alter significantly the ordered structures of wheat starch, indicating that ANN treatment enhanced the stability and resistance of starch granules to the subsequent UHP treatment. In contrast, UHP (400MPa)-ANN treatment resulted in more severe disruption of ordered structures of wheat starch than did the single UHP treatment, showing that UHP-treated starch was more vulnerable to the subsequent ANN treatment. The dual modifications had little effect on granular structures of yam and potato starches. ANN-UHP (300 and 400MPa) and UHP (300MPa)-ANN treatments enhanced greatly the pasting viscosities of UHP-modified starches. Dual modifications altered greatly the pasting properties of yam and potato starches, as observed for the single ANN treatment. From this study, we proposed that ANN treatment enhanced stability of wheat starch by increasing interaction of starch chains in amorphous regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3ahigh pressure treatment 3apasting properties 3apotato starch 3astarch granules 3aviscosity 3awheat 3awheat starch 3ayams 0aStarch 0aDual treatment 0aOrdered structure 0aPasting viscosity 0aAmorphous regions1 aGuo, Peng1 aXiang, Fengjuan1 aWang, Jinrong1 aYu, Jinglin1 aWang, Shuo0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 174 p.549-557dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.06.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05561naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009000167300001300257520356900270592002803839596010903867650002403976650002304000650002004023650000904043650001404052650001204066650001204078650001804090650001404108650001104122650001104133650001004144650001004154650002004164650003304184650001404217650001304231650003004244650001804274650003104292650001604323650001504339650002304354650001304377650001504390650001404405650002404419650001604443650001304459650002304472650001704495650001204512650001304524650001204537650001004549650001604559651001004575700005604585700002304641773010704664856008304771852000904854655001204863IND60614016720221117001941.0180919e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061401672DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-11-17-1740-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, V.10aFirst Report of Fusarium petroliphilum Causing Fruit Rot of Butternut Squash in Spain  ap. 1662.  aSevere fruit rot of butternut squash (Cucurbita moschata Duchesne), a fruit widely consumed and cultivated in Spain, was observed in 2016 in cultivated fields and at storage conditions in Valencia Province (southeast Spain). Fruits exhibited sunken lesions that eventually extended into the flesh and led to 10 to 20% postharvest losses. Small (3 to 4 mm) pieces of rotted tissues were surface disinfected for 1 min in 1.5% NaOCl, washed twice with sterilized distilled water, and plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin sulfate (0.5 g liter–¹). Plates were incubated at 25°C in the dark for 3 to 5 days. Fusarium colonies were consistently isolated, transferred to PDA and Spezieller Nährstoffarmer Agar (SNA) culture media for morphological identification, and identified as belonging to the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) based on morphology on SNA. Sporodochial macroconidia were 3 to 4 septate in average, slender and slightly curved, 45 (34 to 51) × 4.2 (3.5 to 5) µm; aerial microconidia were abundant, borne on short monophialides, ovoid to reniform, and 8.6 (4.9 to 16.4) × 3.4 (2.7 to 4) µm. The internal transcribed spacer region and elongation factor-1α gene of isolate GIHF-146 were sequenced (using ITS1/ITS4 and EF1-728F/EF1-986R primer pairs) and deposited in GenBank with accession numbers MF535516 (ITS) and MF580776 (EF-1α), respectively. BLASTn comparison of the two sequences showed a 99% homology with those of F. petroliphilum (Q.T. Chen & X.H. Fu) D. Geiser, O’Donnell, Short & Zhang: e.g., LC184243 (ITS) and LC177308 (EF-1α). Comparison of these sequences in the Fusarium ID database (http://www.westerdijkinstitute.nl/fusarium/) exhibited similar levels of similarity. For pathogenicity tests, isolate GIHF-146 was transferred to flasks containing potato sucrose (PS) medium and maintained in agitation (130 rpm) for 2 to 3 days at 25°C in the dark. Twelve 13-day-old squash seedlings (Cucurbita ficifolia Bouché cv. Cabello de Ángel) grown in trays containing sterilized substrate (Projar, Spain) were removed and dipped into a suspension of conidia (3 × 10⁶ conidia/ml) for 2 min, and transferred to plastic pots (Teku-tainer, Pöppelmann) with sterilized substrate. Three noninoculated plants dipped in sterile water were disposed as controls. Simultaneously, five C. moschata fruits were inoculated by direct injection of 1 ml of the same conidial suspension, and one control fruit was injected with 1 ml of sterilized distilled water. Plants and fruits were placed in a growth chamber at 25°C in 16/8 h photoperiod for 20 days. Large sunken areas densely covered by a grayish mycelium surrounding the point of injection appeared 6 days post inoculation on inoculated fruits. Inoculated seedlings and control fruits remained asymptomatic. The fungus was reisolated, fulfilling Koch’s postulates. Short et al. (2013) erected F. petroliphilum to accommodate certain Fusaria from both plumbing drain biofilms and human mycotic keratitis, and is also the accepted epithet to name a group of pathogenic fungi on cucurbits (formerly named as F. solani f. sp. cucurbitae race 2) defined by its tissue specificity, causing only fruit rot on cucurbits (Tousson and Snyder 1961). To date, only Fsc race 1 had been reported from different cucurbits in Spain (Armengol et al. 2000; Gómez et al. 2008, 2014) and, to our knowledge, this is the first report of F. petroliphilum causing fruit rot of butternut squash in Spain, a species widely cultivated and employed as watermelon rootstock.  aPublisher supplied data  aResearch Project AGL2014-53398-C2-1-RcSecretaría de Estado de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación 3aCucurbita ficifolia 3aCucurbita moschata 3aFusarium solani 3aagar 3aagitation 3abiofilm 3aconidia 3aculture media 3adatabases 3afields 3afruits 3afungi 3agenes 3agrowth chambers 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3akeratitis 3amycelium 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3apathogenicity 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphotoperiod 3aplant rots 3apostharvest losses 3apotatoes 3arootstocks 3aseedlings 3asodium hypochlorite 3asporodochia 3asquashes 3astorage conditions 3astreptomycin 3asucrose 3asulfates 3atissues 3atrays 3awatermelons 3aSpain1 aArmengol, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3815-85781 aGarcés-Claver, A.0 tPlant disease.g2018 Aug., v. 102, no. 8 p.1662-1662dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-11-17-1740-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011200170300001300282520189000295592002802185650002202213650001202235650001802247650001202265650001002277650001102287650001102298650001002309650001402319650002402333650002202357650001602379651001702395653001702412653000902429653001302438653002002451653003202471700001602503700001802519700001702537700001802554773011502572856008502687852000902772655001202781IND60466597120221119160945.0160210e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046659712DNAL7 a10.1080/21683565.2015.10899662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSempore, A. W.10aSupporting better crop-livestock integration on small-scale West African farms: a simulation-based approach  ap. 3-23.  aIntegrating crop and livestock activities at the farm level is commonly proposed by research programs in sub-Saharan Africa as a way to sustainably improve farm productivity. This integration process requires farmers to change their knowledge, perceptions and practices to achieve sustainable intensification. This article presents a participatory support approach based on an analysis of farmers’ current practices and knowledge and a simulation tool designed to facilitate interaction with farmers. It was tested in western Burkina Faso with 18 farmers representing three farm types defined by their balance between crop and livestock activities. Although a low level of crop-livestock integration was observed, every farmer recognized a positive link between the production of organic fertilizer and plant production. However, only one third of the farmers linked plant production with fodder and animal production. By building and simulating various integration scenarios, every farmer developed a deeper understanding of systemic interactions between crop and livestock activities on his farm. Project scenarios including the storage of biomass and animal stabling were evaluated. Although these innovations improved the farms’ capacity to fertilize cereals and to feed herds, the structural changes involved were perceived to be difficult to implement either for economic reasons at the farm level or because they involved changes in biomass management at the community level. However, the support process led to tactical changes the following year, with 80% of the farmers increasing their storage of crop residues and organic manure. The approach was useful for farmers to evaluate and eventually implement possible innovations, and for researchers to better understand the constraints and limits farmers face when seeking to better integrate crop and livestock activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal production 3abiomass 3acrop residues 3afarmers 3afarms 3aforage 3agrains 3aherds 3alivestock 3aorganic fertilizers 3aresearch programs 3aresearchers 3aBurkina Faso 0aBurkina Faso 0afarm 0ascenario 0asimulation tool 0asustainable intensification1 aAndrieu, N.1 aLe Gal, P.

Plato under conventional production was reported in Tattnall County, Georgia, in October 2015. Approximately 10% of a 0.5 ha field was symptomatic. Infected foliage displayed severe leaf curling, petiole lesions, and mild stunting. Sections of four symptomatic leaves from infected plants were surface sterilized with a 7% sodium hypochlorite for 60 s and then placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium amended with streptomycin (100 µg/ml). After incubation at 25°C for 4 days, gray colonies with pink-colored conidiomata typical of Colletotrichum genus were observed (Damm et al. 2012). Smooth and hyaline conidia (dimensions: 14.9 to 20.2 × 6.5 to 8.0 μm) with acute apex were observed using a compound microscope (400× magnification). Three isolates were obtained from the symptomatic leaves. The ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of one fungal isolate TC-001 was amplified by PCR using the primer pair ITS1 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990), and the resulting amplicon was sequenced to confirm pathogen identity. The sequence, deposited in GenBank (accession no. KY081663), was 99% identical to that of a Colletotrichum acutata sensu lato isolate (NR144794.1). In order to confirm pathogenicity, a conidial suspension of 1 × 10⁴ conidia per ml (isolate: TC-001) was applied as a foliar spray to 6-week-old celery plants (n = 9) of cv. Conquistador (Johnny’s Selected Seed, Winslow, ME). Three plants were sprayed with sterile water and served as a control. Following inoculation, plants were covered with plastic bags and incubated at 25°C and 75% RH with a 12-h photoperiod for 5 days under greenhouse conditions. Eighty-nine percent of the inoculated plants developed symptoms of foliar curling by 4 days postinoculation (DPI). Later, symptoms progressed gradually and mild plant stunting along with necrotic lesions on petiole were observed by 21 DPI. Symptoms were not observed on plants sprayed with sterile water. The pathogen was then reisolated from infected plants at 21 DPI onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium amended with streptomycin (100 µg/ml) and displayed the same macroscopic and microscopic morphological traits as that of the inoculated isolate. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. acutata sensu lato on celery in Georgia. The presence of this pathogen on celery has been limited in the United States and appears to be an emerging pathogen (Pollok et al. 2012). Currently, management options based on fungicide applications are being evaluated in field studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApium graveolens var. dulce 3aColletotrichum 3aDNA primers 3acelery 3aconidia 3aconidiomata 3aculture media 3afoliar spraying 3afungi 3afungicides 3agreenhouse production 3agrowth retardation 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaf curling 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apesticide application 3apetioles 3aphotoperiod 3aplastic bags 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3asodium hypochlorite 3astreptomycin 3aGeorgia 3aMaine1 aCulbreath, A.

B.10aProtein Structure Validation Using Side-Chain Chemical Shifts  ap. 4754-4759.  aWe present a method of assessing the quality of protein structures based on the use of side-chain NMR chemical shifts. Because these parameters are very accurate reporters of side-chain positions and are highly sensitive to tertiary structure and packing, they are particularly useful for structure validation. To analyze a given structure, we define a quality score, QCS, that compares the chemical shifts calculated from such a structure with the corresponding experimental values in a way that takes account of the errors in the calculations. The results that we report illustrate the advantages in the examination of the quality of protein structures from the perspective of side-chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodel validation 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anucleic acid conformation 3aprotein structure1 aCavalli, Andrea1 aVranken, Wim F.1 aVendruscolo, Michele0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Apr. 26, v. 116, no. 16 p.4754-4759dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp21220543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01762naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008500159300002000244520076200264592002801026650001701054650001201071650001801083650001401101650000701115650001601122700001301138700001801151700001101169700001701180773014401197856007401341852000901415655001201424IND60670546220221119164926.0191002e20131119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067054622DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta13402d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhongcheng10aMorphology-controlled synthesis of α-MoO₃ nanomaterials for ethanol oxidation  ap. 15370-15376.  aα-MoO₃ nanobelts of about 8 nm in thickness, 60 nm in width and 0.7–7.5 μm in length were synthesized through a hydrothermal process.

Further increase in the surfactant concentration directed self-assembly of the nanobelts into hierarchical microflowers. The α-MoO₃ nanobelts showed a relatively higher activity but a lower selectivity toward acetaldehyde in ethanol oxidation than the microflowers, primarily due to the large exposure of the (010) planes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3aethanol 3ananomaterials 3aoxidation 3apH 3asurfactants1 aLi, Yong1 aZhan, Ensheng1 aTa, Na1 aShen, Wenjie0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Nov. 19, v. 1, no. 48 p.15370-15376dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta13402d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013400158300001600292520139900308592002801707650002001735650001701755650002501772650001801797650001301815650001401828650002001842650002801862650001101890650003601901650002301937650001701960650001301977650002501990650002502015651001202040700002202052700001802074773011002092856007402202852000902276655001202285IND60424985220221122094115.0151006e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6042498522DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.121592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBekir, Jalila14aThe Effect of Cultivar and Ripening on Antioxidant System and PAL Activity of Pomegranate (Punica Granatum L.) Grown in Tunisia  ap. 575-584.  aIn this study, attempts were made to evaluate and to compare antioxidative defense system of three pomegranate cultivars (Punica granatum L.) (Chetoui, Gabsi and Garsi) at three ripening stages (UR, HR and FR). We report, for the first time, a decrease in superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and PAL activities from UR to FR stages for all pomegranate cultivars, whereas glutathione reductase activity increased gradually and significantly. The highest phenolics and ascorbic acid contents were detected in UR fruits but anthocyanins and tannin contents varied greatly within cultivars. Using the DPPH assay, the free radical‐scavenging activity of Garsi cultivar decreased significantly from UR to HR stages and finally increased in ripe fruit arils, whereas it decreases continuously during ripening of Chetoui and Gabsi cultivars. Significant correlations were detected between enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants. Statistical analyses showed that stage and cultivar factors influenced significantly (P < 0.01) antioxidant system of pomegranate. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The study represents the first report on the activities of antioxidant enzymes at different stages of maturity of three cultivars of pomegranate. These results with good information to producer to make the connection with the maturity to produce pomegranates with well‐optimized properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPunica granatum 3aanthocyanins 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aascorbic acid 3acatalase 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3afree radical scavengers 3afruits 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aphenolic compounds 3apomegranates 3aripening 3astatistical analysis 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aTunisia1 aBouajila, Jalloul1 aMars, Mohamed0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2015 Oct., v. 39, no. 5 p.575-584dFood & Nutrition Pressx0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.121593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010500169300001800274520129800292592002801590653001801618653001901636653002401655653002101679653000901700653000901709653003401718700001901752700001601771773014001787856008201927852000902009655001202018IND60560994820221122195119.0170124e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056099482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.xphs.2015.10.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlesen, Niels E.10aDoes the Digestibility of Cyclodextrins Influence the In Vivo Absorption of Benzo[a]pyrene in Rats?  ap. 2698-2702.  aAn important excipient used to overcome poor solubility is cyclodextrin. However, data in the literature suggest that excessive overdosing of cyclodextrins can decrease the absorption of compounds administered with cyclodextrins, due to their lack of release from the complex. γ-Cyclodextrin is digestible in contrast to β-cyclodextrins. This could potentially limit the sensitivity toward overdose, which was evaluated using benzo[a]pyrene in this study, in which rats were administered benzo[a]pyrene and different doses of the 2 cyclodextrins. Both cyclodextrins lowered the area under the curve and therefore the absorption of benzo[a]pyrene by up to a factor of 2 when dosed in high concentrations, thus indicating that overdosing of cyclodextrins may limit the oral absorption of a compound. This limitation may be artificial because the molar ratio of benzo[a]pyrene:cyclodextrin was >1:50,000 at the concentration where a significant decrease in the absorption was observed. No difference was observed between the 2 cyclodextrins, so digestibility seemed less important. More interesting was that the decrease in absorption was relatively small when compared with literature values, suggesting that the effect of overdosing a compound with cyclodextrins was lower than anticipated.  aPublisher supplied data 0acyclodextrins 0abenzo[a]pyrene 0astability constants 0aγ-cyclodextrins 0arats 0abile 0ahydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin1 aVana, Vasiliki1 aHolm, René0 tJournal of Pharmaceutical Sciences.g2016 Sept., v. 105 p.2698-2702dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Pharmacists Association®x0022-35497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2015.10.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245015200153300001600305520075100321592002801072650001701100650001301117650002301130650001401153650001901167650001701186650001101203650001701214700001101231700001901242700001301261700001901274700001801293773013801311856007401449852000901523655001201532IND60670546320221119165023.0191002e20131203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067054632DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta13403b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ping10aCore–shell structured MgAl-LDO@Al-MS hexagonal nanocomposite: an all inorganic acid–base bifunctional nanoreactor for one-pot cascade reactions  ap. 339-344.  aA core–shell structured nanocomposite, with hexagonal Mg–Al mixed oxide nanoplates derived from LDHs as the inner core and Al-containing mesoporous silica as the outer shell, was prepared using an inorganic, low cost and simple route.

The MgAl-LDO@Al-MS nanocomposite served as an efficient acid–base bifunctional nanoreactor for one-pot multistep cascade reaction sequences, due to the good spatial separation of antagonistic sites via the core–shell structure design, confinement and enrichment effect of the reaction species endowed by the nanoreactor features.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aaluminum 3acatalytic activity 3amagnesium 3ananocomposites 3aporous media 3asilica 3asurface area1 aYu, Yu1 aHuang, Pei-Pei1 aLiu, Hua1 aCao, Chang-Yan1 aSong, Wei-Guo0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Dec. 3, v. 2, no. 2 p.339-344dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta13403b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015600171300001600327520181000343592002802153650001902181650001802200650002002218650001202238650001502250650002202265650001402287653003002301653002002331653002802351653004802379653002002427700001902447773009902466856008402565852000902649655001202658IND60603367920221117071341.0180716e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060336792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUpadhyay, Mukesh10aCFD simulation via conventional Two-Fluid Model of a circulating fluidized bed riser: Influence of models and model parameters on hydrodynamic behavior  ap. 260-268.  aA two-dimensional (2D) numerical simulation of gas–solids flow in a circulating fluidized bed riser was performed based on the Two-Fluid Model (TFM). In this model, the kinetic theory of granular flows (KTGF) was used to solve gas–solids flow behavior. Despite several published studies, the selection of proper wall boundary conditions (BC) and the appropriate closure model to simulate riser flow remains inconclusive. In this study, a number of simulations were performed to understand the influence of the wall boundary condition, solid shear viscosity model and particle–particle restitution coefficient. At first, we systematically evaluated the influence of the combined effect of the specularity and particle–wall restitution coefficients based on Johnson and Jackson [1] BC. The key point we observed was that the effect of high specularity coefficient (φ=0.001) was less at low particle–wall restitution coefficients (ew=0.8, 0.9) on the axial solid holdup profile. At lower specularity coefficient (φ=0.00001 & 0.0001) value, different particle–wall restitution coefficients (ew=0.8, 0.9, 0.99) did not show any significant effect. Moreover, the effect of the elasticity of particle collisions showed that the low particle–particle restitution coefficients gave good quantitative agreement. The effects of solid shear viscosity models on flow predictions were investigated under different solid circulation rates (Gs=39.14kg/m²s, 51.05kg/m²s, 73.21kg/m²s). Both Syamlal et al. [2] and Gidaspow [3] models gave good qualitative agreement with the experimental results. The Syamlal et al. solid viscosity model demonstrated fairly consistent results in the dilute region, whereas transition from lower to higher solid holdup was reasonably well predicted by the Gidaspow model.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluidized beds 3ahydrodynamics 3aphysical models 3apowders 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3aviscosity 0aCirculating fluidized bed 0aTwo-fluid model 0aWall boundary condition 0aParticle–particle restitution coefficient 0aSolid viscosity1 aPak, Chong-ho,0 tPowder technology.g2015 Mar., v. 272 p.260-268dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245016200167300001600329520177900345592002802124650002502152650001002177650002202187650003402209650000902243650001802252650000902270650001702279651001102296651001002307653001702317653001702334653001002351653000902361700001402370700001202384700001802396700001302414700001502427700001902442700001502461700001202476773011502488856008502603852000902688655001202697IND60527187120221123041221.0190412e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052718712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2016.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Ruifen10aGenetic variants at 18q11.2 and 8q24 identified by genome-wide association studies were not associated with pulmonary tuberculosis risk in Chinese population  ap. 214-218.  aGenome-wide association study (GWAS) recently identified several susceptibility loci in ASAP1 gene on chromosome 8q24 for tuberculosis (TB) in a Russian population, but no relevant studies have been performed to validate these findings. In addition, previous GWAS in Ghana and Gambia found that the variant rs4331426 at 18q11.2 was a susceptibility locus for TB. However, the follow-up studies reported conflicting results. Herein, we investigated the contribution of genetic variants at 8q24 and 18q11.2 to TB in Chinese population.We genotyped four genetic variants at 8q24 (rs10956514 and rs11774633) and 18q11.2 (rs4331426 and rs6507226) in a case–control study with 355 newly bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB cases and 395 healthy controls using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. Subsequently, we conducted a meta-analysis including 4 reported studies in Chinese populations and our case–control study with a total of 3118 cases and 3226 controls to further evaluate the relationship between rs4331426 at 18q11.2 and TB risk.We did not find significant association between genetic variants at 8q24 and risk of TB (rs10956514: OR=0.89, 95%CI: 0.72–1.09, P=0.253; rs11774633: OR=0.86, 95%CI: 0.69–1.08, P=0.206). We did not observe significant association for genetic variants at 18q11.2 (rs4331426: OR=0.62, 95%CI: 0.34–1.14, P=0.122; and rs6507226: OR=0.98, 95%CI: 0.80–1.20, P=0.853). Moreover, the pooled results from the Meta-analysis further supported that rs4331426 at 18q11.2 was not associated with TB risk in Chinese population (OR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.63–1.29).Our findings indicate that TB risk-associated loci at 8q24 and 18q11.2 identified by GWAS from the other populations may not contribute to TB susceptibility in Chinese population.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase-control studies 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenome-wide association study 3aloci 3ameta-analysis 3arisk 3atuberculosis 3aGambia 3aGhana 0aTuberculosis 0aPolymorphism 0aASAP1 0aGWAS1 aGe, Haibo1 aXu, Lin1 aSun, Zhaoping1 aLi, Chen1 aWang, Rong1 aDing, Songning1 aYang, Chen1 aXu, Fei0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2016 June, v. 40 p.214-218dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05057naa a2200997 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003900135040001800174100001600192245012100208300001800329506007600347520183400423592002802257506003702285650002702322650002802349650002702377650001802404650001002422650001202432650002002444650001102464650001702475650001402492650001602506650001002522650001602532650001802548650000902566650003702575650002002612650001702632650001302649650002002662650001502682650001402697650001702711650003202728650001202760650005102772650004502823650002402868650004402892650003902936650001102975650003802986650004203024650003403066650004003100650005403140650002103194650005103215650002803266650000903294650000903303650002303312650002003335650005803355650004203413650004803455650004803503650004403551650005403595653001503649653001703664653000803681653001203689653001003701700001703711700001903728700001603747700001803763700001503781700001803796700001903814700001603833773010403849856008503953852000904038655001204047IND50068450820221207133326.0161021e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006845082DNAL7 aPMC38041182pmcid7 a236185282pmid7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2013.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuhua10aLactobacillus rhamnosus GG reduces hepatic TNFα production and inflammation in chronic alcohol-induced liver injury  ap. 1609-1615.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe therapeutic effects of probiotic treatment in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) have been studied in both patients and experimental animal models. Although the precise mechanisms of the pathogenesis of ALD are not fully understood, gut-derived endotoxin has been postulated to play a crucial role in hepatic inflammation. Previous studies have demonstrated that probiotic therapy reduces circulating endotoxin derived from intestinal gram-negative bacteria in ALD. In this study, we investigated the effects of probiotics on hepatic tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) production and inflammation in response to chronic alcohol ingestion. Mice were fed Lieber DeCarli liquid diet containing 5% alcohol for 8weeks, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) was supplemented in the last 2 weeks. Eight-week alcohol feeding caused a significant increase in hepatic inflammation as shown by histological assessment and hepatic tissue myeloperoxidase activity assay. Two weeks of LGG supplementation reduced hepatic inflammation and liver injury and markedly reduced TNFα expression. Alcohol feeding increased hepatic mRNA expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and CYP2E1 and decreased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 expression. LGG supplementation attenuated these changes. Using human peripheral blood monocytes-derived macrophages, we also demonstrated that incubation with ethanol primes both lipopolysaccharide- and flagellin-induced TNFα production, and LGG culture supernatant reduced this induction in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, LGG treatment also significantly decreased alcohol-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. In conclusion, probiotic LGG treatment reduced alcohol-induced hepatic inflammation by attenuation of TNFα production via inhibition of TLR4- and TLR5-mediated endotoxin activation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aanimal experimentation 3aanimal models 3ablood 3aethanol 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aingestion 3aliquid diet 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amyeloperoxidase 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3aprobiotics 3areceptors 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAnimals 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP2E1xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEndotoxinsxadverse effectsxmetabolism. 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFlagellinxadverse effectsxmetabolism. 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aInflammationxpathologyxtherapy. 2aIntestinesxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aLacticaseibacillus rhamnosus. 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearxmetabolism 2aLipopolysaccharidesxadverse effectsxmetabolism. 2aLiverxpathology 2aLiver Diseases, Alcoholicxpathologyxtherapy. 2aMacrophagesxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPhosphorylation 2aProbioticsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aToll-Like Receptor 4xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aToll-Like Receptor 5xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxmetabolism 2ap38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 0aProbiotics 0aInflammation 0aTNF 0aAlcohol 0aLiver1 aLiu, Yanlong1 aKirpich, Irina1 aMa, Zhenhua1 aWang, Cuiling1 aZhang, Min1 aSuttles, Jill1 aMcClain, Craig1 aFeng, Wenke0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2013 Sept., v. 24 p.1609-1615dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2013.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245010900153300001600262520122200278592002801500650001201528650001101540650001001551650002101561650001101582650001401593650001701607650001101624700001701635773010701652856003901759852000901798655001201807IND50088929620221116143921.0140422e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008892962DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.26652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMay, C.

Determining the effective flow level is complicated by the trade‐off between mobilizing bed particles and retaining coarse sediment in rivers with low sediment supply. This study determined mobilization and transport distance of bed particles using motion‐sensing radio transmitting particles that approximated the reach‐average D₈₄ grain size. The distribution of shear stress at initial motion varied substantially between flood events, and suggests that the sequence of flood events and the history of under‐threshold flows may be an important determinant of bed strength and thus particle mobility. In addition, particle activity was greatest on the rising limb of each flood and was maximized at near bankfull flow. Travel distances did not vary between floods when scaled by transport event duration, and a negative exponential distribution was a good fit to the data. Results of this study provide important insight into individual particle movement, which can be used to inform flow releases and understand the effects of flood magnitude on particle mobility and transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedload 3afloods 3aradio 3ariverine habitat 3arivers 3asediments 3ashear stress 3atravel1 aPryor, B.

The experimental system that was used in this 86-day experiment consisted of 24 columns filled up to 70 cm with predominantly sandy material. Four types of columns were used (six replicates) depending on the presence of plants (Phalaris arundinacea L. var. picta L.) and the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in the influent. The influent was synthetic municipal waste water to which a mixture of 5 mg/L of diclofenac and 5 mg/L of sulfamethoxazole was added. The observed removal of diclofenac was moderate (approx. 50%) and the removal of sulfamethoxazole was relatively low (24–30%). It was found that the removal of diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole was not affected by the vegetation. The presence of diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole in the influent had significant effect on the effluent concentration of N-NO ₃ and the water loss in the columns, which in both cases were lower than in the control columns. The scope for further research was discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3aconstructed wetlands 3adrugs 3aphytoremediation 3asulfamethoxazole 3avegetation 3awastewater 0aorganic micropollutants 0aPhalaris arundinacea var. picta 0apharmaceuticals 0awaste water treatment1 aSochacki, Adam1 aFelis, Ewa1 aMiksch, Korneliusz0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2016 Feb. 1, v. 18, no. 2 p.157-163dTaylor & Francisx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2015.10736693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245012600162300001800288520145100306592002801757650001101785650001301796650001401809650001701823650001101840650001301851650001401864650001001878650001201888650001601900650001101916650001301927650002301940650001301963700001601976700001901992700002002011700002002031700002002051700001902071773012202090856008202212852000902294655001202303IND60562251720170926000000.0170204e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056225172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b056552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagy, Lajos10aGas-Phase Interaction of Anions with Polyisobutylenes: Collision-Induced Dissociation Study and Quantum Chemical Modeling  ap. 9195-9203.  aThe gas-phase interaction of anions including fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, ethyl sulfate, chlorate, and nitrate with polyisobutylene (PIB) derivatives was studied using collision-induced dissociation (CID). The gas-phase adducts of anions with PIBs ([PIB + anion]⁻) were generated from the electrosprayed solution of PIBs in the presence of the corresponding anions. The so-formed adducts subjected to CID showed a loss of anion at different characteristic collision energies, thus allowing the study of the strength of interaction between the anions and nonpolar PIBs having different end-groups. The values of characteristic collision energies (the energy needed to obtain 50% fragmentation) obtained by CID experiments correlated linearly with the binding enthalpies between the anion and PIB, as determined by density functional theory calculations. In the case of halide ions, the critical energies for dissociation, that is, the binding enthalpies for [PIB + anion]⁻ adducts, increased in the order of I– < Br– < Cl– < F–. Furthermore, it was found that the binding enthalpies for the adducts formed with halide ions decreased approximately with the square radius of the halide ion, suggesting that the strength of interaction is mainly determined by the “surface” charge density of the halide ion.

Signals were obtained from sources commonly used in phytoparasitic nematode chemotaxis studies: root tips, root exudates, and root extracts. Root tips from each plant species attracted M. incognita but H. glycines was attracted only to soybean. In contrast, root exudates prepared from marigold, pepper, or soybean seedlings were attractive to H. glycines but were repellent to M. incognita. Root extracts had the same effect as exudates. Fractionation of exudates by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (acetonitrile [CH₃CN] and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) revealed highly polar and less polar components affecting behaviors. Fractions eluting at 12% CH₃CN from all three plants attracted H. glycines and repelled M. incognita. None of the less polar HPLC fractions (>15% CH₃CN) affected H. glycines but those from G. max and T. patula repelled M. incognita. Differences among exudates and effects of fractionation on behavior are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  a31471749cNational Science Foundation of China 3aCapsicum annuum 3aGlycine max 3aHeterodera glycines 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aTagetes patula 3aacetonitrile 3achemotaxis 3afractionation 3ahosts 3anematode larvae 3apepper 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aroot exudates 3aroot tips 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aseedlings 3asoybeans 3atissues1 aMasler, Edward P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6662-08841 aRogers, Stephen T.0 tPlant disease.g2018 Sept., v. 102, no. 9 p.1733-1740dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-09-17-1445-RE3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245010800170300001800278520118200296592002801478650002401506650002001530650002101550650001101571650002301582700001801605700002501623700001901648700002401667773012201691856008201813852000901895655001201904IND60562251820170926000000.0170204e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056225182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b057542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpiegel, J. Dominik10aFailure of the IDA in FRET Systems at Close Inter-Dye Distances Is Moderated by Frequent Low κ2 Values  ap. 8845-8862.  aFörster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is analyzed in terms of distance- and orientation-dependent interactions between the transition dipole moments of the involved donor and acceptor molecules. However, the ideal dipole approximation (IDA) is known to fail at short donor–acceptor distances. In this work, we model FRET in a Cy5- and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled double-stranded RNA by means of combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum-chemical calculations involving the IDA as well as the more sophisticated monomer transition density (MTD) approach. To this end, the relaxed ground-state geometries of the dyes were fitted to the MD-based structures. Although substantial deviations between IDA and MTD results can be observed for individual snapshots, the statistical impact of the failure on the FRET rates is negligible in the chosen examples. Our results clearly demonstrate that the IDA-based Förster model can still be applied to systems with small donor–acceptor distances, provided that the dyes are not trapped in arrangements with a high IDA failure and that the distribution of the relative transition dipole orientations is fairly isotropic.  aPublisher supplied data 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescent dyes 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics1 aFulle, Simone1 aKleinschmidt, Martin1 aGohlke, Holger1 aMarian, Christel M.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 Sept. 01, v. 120, no. 34 p.8845-8862dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b057543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245019900183300001600382520147000398592002801868650001601896650002201912650002001934650002701954650001201981650001201993650001302005650001002018650001702028650002102045650002302066650001802089650001102107650001402118650001502132650002102147650001702168650004102185650002102226650000902247650002102256650001902277650001302296653002002309653002802329653001702357653001402374653002302388700003302411773011902444856008502563852000902648655001202657IND60466594520221119160504.0151126e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046659452DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2015.10736712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNdeddy Aka, Robinson Junior10aEffect of bacterial inoculation of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, alcaligenes feacalis and bacillus subtilis on germination, growth and heavy metal (cd, cr, and ni) uptake of brassica juncea  ap. 200-209.  aBacterial inoculation may influence Brassica juncea growth and heavy metal (Ni, Cr, and Cd) accumulation. Three metal tolerant bacterial isolates (BCr3, BCd33, and BNi11) recovered from mine tailings, identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa KP717554, Alcaligenes feacalis KP717561, and Bacillus subtilis KP717559 were used. The isolates exhibited multiple plant growth beneficial characteristics including the production of indole-3-acetic acid, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, insoluble phosphate solubilization together with the potential to protect plants against fungal pathogens. Bacterial inoculation improved seeds germination of B. juncea plant in the presence of 0.1 mM Cr, Cd, and Ni, as compared to the control treatment. Compared with control treatment, soil inoculation with bacterial isolates significantly increased the amount of soluble heavy metals in soil by 51% (Cr), 50% (Cd), and 44% (Ni) respectively. Pot experiment of B. juncea grown in soil spiked with 100 mg kg ⁻¹ of NiCl ₂, 100 mg kg ⁻¹ of CdCl ₂, and 150 mg kg ⁻¹ of K ₂Cr ₂O ₇, revealed that inoculation with metal tolerant bacteria not only protected plants against the toxic effects of heavy metals, but also increased growth and metal accumulation of plants significantly. These findings suggest that such metal tolerant, plant growth promoting bacteria are valuable tools which could be used to develop bio-inoculants for enhancing the efficiency of phytoextraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcaligenes 3aBacillus subtilis 3aBrassica juncea 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aammonia 3acadmium 3achromium 3afungi 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aindole acetic acid 3amine tailings 3anickel 3apathogens 3aphosphates 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aseed germination 3asoil 3asoil inoculation 3asolubilization 3atoxicity 0aphytoextraction 0ametal tolerant bacteria 0aheavy metals 0aB. juncea 0asoil contamination1 aBabalola, Olubukola Oluranti0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2016 Feb. 1, v. 18, no. 2 p.200-209dTaylor & Francisx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2015.10736713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013700170300001500307520110000322592002801422650001901450650002001469650001001489650001201499650002601511650001501537650001601552650002501568651001701593653003001610653002701640653001701667653001601684653001501700700002101715700001701736773009001753856005101843852000901894655001201903IND50086625020221116174956.0140412e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008662502DNAL7 a10.1080/03031853.2011.5627112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpeelman, Stijn10aSimulation of efficiency impact of drainage water re-use: Case of small-scale vegetable growers in North West Province, South Africa  ap. 89-101.  aThis paper focuses on estimating the effect of drainage water reuse on the technical efficiency of small-scale vegetable growers in South Africa applying a data envelopment analysis (DEA). In the semi-arid North West Province of South Africa water scarcity and the soon to be implemented water charges have urged farmers in small-scale irrigation schemes to evaluate the efficiency of their water use. Data on 60 farmers were used to estimate the level of technical efficiency and the effect that drainage water re-use could have on efficiency levels. This effect of water reuse was simulated by a 5, 10, 15 and 20 per cent reduction in water use at farm level. A Malmquist productivity index was calculated to evaluate the effect of these reductions. The main finding was that under current farming conditions many farmers operated at suboptimal levels of technical efficiency. While a reduction in water use evidently increased factor productivity for most farms, the effect clearly varied strongly between farms. This confirms the need to take a systems approach for this type of evaluations.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage water 3afarming systems 3afarms 3agrowers 3airrigation management 3avegetables 3awater reuse 3awater use efficiency 3aSouth Africa 0adata envelopment analysis 0asmall-scale irrigation 0aSouth Africa 0awater reuse 0asimulation1 aD'Haese, Marijke1 aD'Haese, Luc0 tAgrekon.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 50, no. 1 p.89-101dTaylor & Francis Groupx2078-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2011.562711  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245018600164520139700350592002801747650002101775650003401796650003601830650002401866650003401890650004601924650001101970650001101981650001301992650001302005653004602018653002402064653001802088653003002106653001902136700001802155700002102173700006002194700001902254700001902273700001202292700002002304700001802324700005602342773011402398856008502512852000902597655001202606IND60731306520221122141353.0211213e20210426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073130652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4620802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Heng10aExtraction and purification of cis/trans asarone from Acorus tatarinowii Schott: Accelerated solvent extraction and silver ion coordination high-speed counter-current chromatography  aAcorus tatarinowii Schott is a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat memory and cognitive dysfunction. Because of their efficacy and lower toxic effects, research on α- and β-asarone, the phytoconstituents, has attracted attention owing to their remarkable pharmacological activities. Silver ion coordination complexation high-speed counter-current chromatography was used to separate these isomers from A. tatarinowii extract, coupled with accelerated solvent extraction. Accelerated solvent extraction parameters were investigated with single-factor and orthogonal testing. A two-phase solvent system composed of n-hexane-ethyl acetate-ethanol-water (2:1:2:1, v/v) with 0.50 mol/L silver ions was selected for separation. From 2.0 g crude extract, 1.4 g of β-asarone and 0.09 g of α-asarone were obtained with purities over 98% by sequential sample loading in 20 h. The isolated compounds were identified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, ¹H and ¹³C NMR. Silver ions significantly increased the separation factor and retention of the stationary phase. The chromatographic behavior indicated that cis-configuration was more strongly complexed with the silver ion. This was further demonstrated with the help of computational analysis. In conclusion, the established method could be employed to separate other cis-trans or E/Z isomers that form coordination complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcorus gramineus 3aOriental traditional medicine 3achemical constituents of plants 3acognitive disorders 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3amemory 3asilver 3asolvents 3atoxicity 0aHigh-speed counter-current chromatography 0aSilver coordination 0aα/β-asarone 0aAcorus tatarinowii Schott 0aDFT simulation1 aAli, Iftikhar1 aHussain, Hidayat1 aHussain, Manzoor1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1766-72421 aWang, Xing-Bao1 aSong, Xiangyun1 aLuo, Ge1 aZhang, Zhenfang1 aWang, Zhigang1 aWang, Daijie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2156-45480 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Apr. 26, v. 1643 p.462080-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4620803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245011800172520167900290592002801969650001801997650001502015650001202030650002402042650001402066650001002080650001802090650000702108650001902115650001702134650001102151650001102162650001802173651001002191653001802201653001902219653002202238653002802260653002802288700001902316700001302335700005402348700002802402773009102430856009002521852000902611655001202620IND60727498320221122055431.0220103e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072749832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1298702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Guiqin10aDiversity and structure of microbial biofilms on microplastics in riverine waters of the Pearl River Delta, China  aRiverine runoff is a significant transport pathway for microplastics (MPs) discharged from land-based sources to marine environments where MPs accumulate. Knowledge of riverine MP-associated biofilms will improve the understanding of the fate and potential effects of MPs in marine environments. This study aimed to characterize the microbial biofilms colonizing MPs in the riverine water of the Pearl River Delta, China, and identify the seasonal, geographical and environmental influences on MP-associated communities. We sampled MPs and the surrounding surface water from eight outlets in three seasons and analyzed their microbial communities by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene libraries. Across all sampling seasons and locations, abundant MP-colonizing taxa belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria, which suggested initial biofilm development on those MPs. The structure and composition of MP-attached microbial communities varied with respect to season and location, and the microbial diversity of the MP-associated biofilm communities decreased in June compared with that in the April and November sampling events. Opportunistic pathogens of the genus Acinetobacter were significantly enriched on the MP surfaces for all sampling events. Among the 15 environmental variables examined, the main drivers of MP-associated biofilm community composition included IC, alkalinity, TOC, TDS, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻, NO₂⁻ and pH. This study provides an insight into the environmental factors that shape microbial biofilm colonization on MPs in estuary environments and a further understanding of the structure, diversity and ecological roles of MP-associated communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aalkalinity 3abiofilm 3acommunity structure 3aestuaries 3agenes 3amicroplastics 3apH 3ariparian areas 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3arunoff 3asurface water 3aChina 0aMicroplastics 0aRiverine water 0aBiofilm community 0aEnvironmental variables 0aOpportunistic pathogens1 aGong, Mengting1 aMai, Lei1 aZhuang, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6938-11771 aZeng, E.

These models assume that a trace is always laid down when a stimulus is processed. In addition, some of these models explain how response times (RTs) and response accuracies arise from a process in which the different traces race against each other. In this article, we present a Bayesian hierarchical model of RT and accuracy in a difficult recognition memory experiment. The model includes a stochastic component that probabilistically determines whether a trace is laid down. The RTs and accuracies are modeled using a minimum gamma race model, with extra model components that allow for the effects of stimulus, sequential dependencies, and trend. Subject-specific effects, as well as ancillary effects due to processes such as perceptual encoding and guessing, are also captured in the hierarchy. Predictive checks show that our model fits the data well. Marginal likelihood evaluations show better predictive performance of our model compared to an approximate Weibull model.

Thinning increased aboveground productivity and reduced stem mortality in this Mediterranean forest during four years just after thinning, contributing to the maintenance of forest functioning under changing climatic conditions. Q. ilex was the only species positively affected by the thinning: stem growth increased for all stem sizes, and mortality was significantly lower in thinned plots. On the contrary, mortality rates of Phillyrea latifolia and Arbutus unedo were not significantly lower. Stem growth increased for P. latifolia only in the smallest stem-size class. Our results highlight the suitability of selective thinning for improving the forest productivity and ensuring the conservation of Mediterranean coppices. Other benefits of selective thinning, such as a decrease in the risk of fire dispersion and an increase in the water supply for human populations, are also discussed.  aThis work was supported by the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación [CGL2016-79835-P-]; European Research Council [ERC-2013-SyG-2013-610028 IMBALANCE-P]; Catalan Government [SGR-2017-1005]; “la Caixa” Foundation [ORGEST].  aPublisher supplied data  aCGL2016-79835-P-cMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovacióndhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004837  aERC-2013-SyG-2013-610028 IMBALANCE-PcEuropean Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000781  aSGR-2017-1005cCatalan Government  aORGESTc“la Caixa” Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010434 3aArbutus unedo 3aPhillyrea latifolia 3aQuercus ilex 3aclimate change 3adominant species 3aforests 3ahumans 3amortality 3aprimary productivity 3arisk 3astem elongation 3asustainable forestry 3atree mortality 3awater supply 0aCarbon sink 0aforest dieback 0aforest management 0aholm oak 0amediterranean forest 0aselective thinning 0atree growth1 aEscolà, Anna1 aLiu, Daijun1 aBarbeta, Adrià1 aPeñuelas, Josep0 tJournal of sustainable forestry.g2020 May 18, v. 39, no. 4 p.365-378dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl48967x1540-756X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2019.16731793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010400171300001200275520133600287592002801623650002501651650000901676650001001685650001501695650001101710650002201721650001701743650001101760650002601771650001401797650001501811650001401826700001701840700001801857700002001875773010501895856008202000852000902082655001202091IND60621490320221121044603.0181117s1997    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062149032DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826597018004072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChernichovsky, Dov10aOptimal Consumer Subsidies and Income Transfers for Minimum Nutritional Requirements: A Basic Model  ap. 1-9.  aThe supply of food is no longer a major determinant of malnutrition in the developing world. Rather, a lack of purchasing power, ignorance about nutrition, and subjective tastes or preferences prevent some households and individuals from securing adequate diets. Some households spend more on food and other consumer items than would be needed for a minimum balanced diet. Yet they remain malnourished or have nutritionally undesirable diets. Food subsidies and income transfers have been major policy options available to governments to augment household purchasing power and change consumer preferences in order to alleviate malnutrition. Those options have traditionally addressed the problem by considering one critical nutrient and one common staple. The model discussed here provides and demonstrates a solution to the question: What is the combined optimal income-transfer and subsidy programme that would meet particular nutritional requirements with the least budget expense to the government? It is argued and shown, with the aid of an initial model, that a combination of income transfers and food subsidies that consider a range of foods, rather than a single staple, and a range of nutrients, rather than a particular nutrient, may lead to cost-beneficial policies that meet wider nutritional objectives for less cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer preferences 3adiet 3afoods 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amalnutrition 3amodels 3anutrient requirements 3anutrients 3apurchasing 3asubsidies1 aSpiegel, Uri1 aZion, Uri Ben1 aGradstein, Mark0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 18, no. 4 p.1-9dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826597018004073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005100151245011600202520123100318592002801549650001401577650002101591650001401612650002301626650001201649650002401661650001601685650002101701650004401722650002001766650001501786650001101801653001501812653001901827653002601846653002201872653002701894700005201921700001201973700001601985700001502001773010802016856008602124852000902210655001202219IND60688229920221118065133.0200830e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068822992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1162382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7927-905310aStructural Properties of Homogeneous Polysaccharide Fraction Released from Wheat Germ by Hydrothermal Treatment  aThe work aimed to enhance the extraction of wheat germ polysaccharides (WGPs) by hydrothermal treatment and identify the structural properties of WGPs. Results showed that the extraction yield of crude WGPs reached 18.72% after steam explosion. A homogeneous polysaccharide fraction (steam explosion wheat germ polysaccharides, SEWGPs) was also released and purified by DEAE-cellulose-52 separation and Sephacryl S-500 HR gel filtration with a yield of 3.84%. The SEWGPs had an average molecular weight of 3.34 × 10⁶ Da and was composed of glucose (32.62%), arabinose (28.27%), xylose (27.71%), and galactose (11.40%). Methylation and nuclear magnetic resonance results indicated that the main linkages of the SEWGPs contained →4)-α-D-Glcp(1→3)-β-D-Xylp(1→3)-α-L-Arap(1→4)-α- D-Glcp(1→3)-α-L-Arap(1→ or →3)-β-D-Xylp(1→4)-α-D-Glcp(1→3)-α-L-Arap(1→ 4)-α-D-Glcp(1→3)-α-L-Arap(1→, and the side chains were α-D- Galp(1→ and β-D-Xylp(1→ linked at the C6-position of →4,6)-α-D-Glcp(1→, respectively. Therefore, the steam explosion facilitated the detection of a more structural nature of WGPs and provided the industrial potential of WGPs as functional ingredients for food-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarabinose 3afunctional foods 3agalactose 3agel chromatography 3aglucose 3ahot water treatment 3amethylation 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolysaccharides 3awheat germ 3axylose 0aWheat germ 0aPolysaccharide 0aStructural properties 0aThermal stability 0aHydrothermal treatment1 aLiu, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8534-20711 aWu, Tao1 aSui, Wenjie1 aZhang, Min0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 July 15, v. 240 p.116238-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1162383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03497naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245029400202300001800496520189800514592002802412650001402440650002502454650002402479650001702503650001002520650001402530650001902544650002102563650001402584650001602598650002602614650001702640650001702657700001502674700001702689700001802706700001602724700002602740700002302766700001302789700001802802773012402820856007402944852000903018655001203027IND60617733320221120070206.0181026e20180321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061773332DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo01298e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQinThese authors contributed equally to this work., Zifei10aChemical inhibition and stable knock-down of efflux transporters leads to reduced glucuronidation of wushanicaritin in UGT1A1-overexpressing HeLa cells: the role of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) in the excretion of glucuronides  ap. 1410-1423.  aActive efflux transport of glucuronides out of cells is a critical process in elimination of drugs and food-derived compounds. Wushanicaritin, a natural polyphenol from Epimedium species, has shown many biological activities. However, the transporters responsible for excretion of wushanicaritin glucuronides still remain undefined. Herein, chemical inhibitors (Ko143, MK571, dipyridamole and leukotriene C4) and single stable knocked-down efflux transporters (BCRP, MRP1, MRP3 and MRP4) were used to determine the contributions of efflux transporters to glucuronide efflux and cellular glucuronidation in UGT1A1-overexpressing HeLa cells (HeLa1A1). Knock-down of transporters was performed by stable transfection of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) using lentiviral vectors. The HeLa1A1 cell lysate catalyzed wushanicaritin glucuronidation, generating wushanicaritin-3-O-glucuronide and wushanicaritin-7-O-glucuronide. Ko143 (a dual inhibitor of BCRP, 5–20 μM) caused a marked decrease in excretion rate (maximal 53.4%) and increase of intracellular glucuronides (maximal 86.0%), while MK-571 (an inhibitor of MRPs, 5–20 μM) resulted in a significant reduction in excretion rate (maximal 64.6%) and rise of intracellular glucuronides (maximal 98.0%). By contrast, dipyridamole and leukotriene C4 showed no inhibitory effects on glucuronide excretion. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated silencing of a target transporter led to a marked reduction in the excretion rate of wushanicaritin glucuronides (maximal 33.8% for BCRP; 25.9% for MRP1; 26.7% for MRP3; 39.3% for MRP4). Transporter silencing also led to substantial decreases in efflux clearance (maximal 61.5% for BCRP; 48.7% for MRP1; 35.1% for MRP3; 63.1% for MRP4). In conclusion, chemical inhibition and gene silencing results suggested that BCRP, MRP1, MRP3 and MRP4 were significant contributors to excretion of wushanicaritin glucuronides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEpimedium 3abioactive properties 3achemical inhibitors 3adipyridamole 3adrugs 3aexcretion 3agene silencing 3ahuman cell lines 3aneoplasms 3apolyphenols 3asmall interfering RNA 3atransfection 3atransporters1 aLi, Shishi1 aYao, Zhihong1 aHong, Xiaodan1 aWu, Baojian1 aKrausz, Kristopher W.1 aGonzalez, Frank J.1 aGao, Hao1 aYao, Xinsheng0 tFood & function.g2018 Mar. 21, v. 9, no. 3 p.1410-1423dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo01298e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003600151245009700187300001600284500001900300520113500319592002801454650001501482650001201497650002501509650001901534650001501553650001501568650002201583650002401605650001201629650001501641650002501656651001001681653001401691653002101705653002001726653002101746773012701767856008501894852000901979655001201988IND60685701020221119095319.0200306e20200518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068570102DNAL7 a10.1080/10549811.2019.16737792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnríquez-de-Salamanca, Álvaro10aContribution To Climate Change Of Forest Fires In Spain: Emissions And Loss Of Sequestration  ap. 417-431.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aForest fires contribute to climate change mainly due to emission of greenhouse gases by biomass burning and loss of sequestration by sink destruction. The average contribution in Spain between 1998 and 2015 was 9,494,910 Mg CO₂ ₑq per year, 23.8% from biomass burning and 76.2% from loss of carbon sequestration, the latter three times higher than the former, although the emissions from combustion are usually the only accounted. Regarding to the vegetation burned, 43.6% of emissions come from forest (17.7% conifers, 4.8% hardwoods and 21.1% Eucalyptus), 53.7% from scrublands and 2.7% from grasslands. The loss of sequestration is 6.6% in the fire year and by 93.4% in previous years. Scrubland burning produces a greater amount of emissions than forests, but forest regeneration is slower, with greater influence on the loss of sequestration. It is essential a forest management focused on increase fire resilience and adaptation to climate change, increase the effectiveness of extinction works to reduce fire damages and implement actions to recover the burnt vegetation, because the loss of sinks is a critical aspect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3abiomass 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3acombustion 3aextinction 3aforest management 3aforest regeneration 3aforests 3ashrublands 3asustainable forestry 3aSpain 0aWildfires 0agreenhouse gases 0aGHG inventories 0asink destruction0 tJournal of sustainable forestry.g2020 May 18, v. 39, no. 4 p.417-431dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl48967x1540-756X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2019.16737793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007500169300001600244520108800260592002801348650002201376650001801398650000901416650003801425650001201463650002301475650001201498650001401510650001101524650001101535653001101546653001601557653001401573653001801587653001201605700002001617773010801637856008601745852000901831655001201840IND60525297020221122224503.0190318e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052529702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jong-Yea10aPreparation and characterization of corn starch-β-carotene composites  ap. 394-401.  aStarch-β-carotene composites were generated by drop-wise addition of ethanol comprising varying β-carotene contents (5, 10, or 20mg) into starch pastes (1, 3, or 5% w/v) to improve water-dispersibility and stability of β-carotene. The mean diameter of the composites was less than 900nm, allowing particles to be homogeneously dispersed in aqueous media for over two weeks without sedimentation. X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry analysis confirmed the composite mainly consisted of Vh-amylose, amorphous starch matrices, and starch-β-carotene ordered structures. Both amorphous matrices and Vh-amylose structures in the composite were readily digested within 20min in vitro digestion, while highly ordered structures, which melted between 132 and 159°C, exhibited inhibited and/or delayed enzymatic digestion. As more β-carotene was incorporated into the composite, the β-carotene content of the ordered structure was increased. Formation of starch-β-carotene composites also appeared to enhance the stability of β-carotene against chemical oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abeta-carotene 3acorn 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aethanol 3ain vitro digestion 3amelting 3aoxidation 3apastes 3astarch 0aStarch 0aβ-Carotene 0aComposite 0aEncapsulation 0aComplex1 aHuber, Kerry C.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 136 p.394-401dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01769naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245005200169300001300221520078400234592002801018650001901046650001501065650001901080650001201099650001101111650001201122650001601134650001701150650001001167653001901177653001201196653001901208653001901227773008901246856005101335852000901386655001201395IND50086625720221116174912.0140412e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008662572DNAL7 a10.1080/03031853.2011.6178562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStorchmann, K.10aWine Economics: Emergence, Developments, Topics  ap. 1-28.  aFine wine has a few characteristics that differentiate it from other agricultural commodities and beverages rendering it an interesting topic for economists. Fine wine can regularly fetch bottle prices that exceed several thousand dollars. It can be stored a long time and may increase in value with age. Fine wine quality and prices are extraordinarily sensitive to fluctuations in the weather of the year in which the grapes were grown. Wine is an experience good: that is, consumers often rely on “expert opinion” regarding quality and maturation prospects. This article describes the emergence and the unparalleled rise of wine economics since the 1980s to the present time and sheds light on its three main topics: finance, climate change and the role of expert opinion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aeconomists 3aexpert opinion 3afinance 3aprices 3aweather 3awine grapes 3awine quality 3awines 0awine economics 0afinance 0aclimate change 0aexpert opinion0 tAgrekon.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 50, no. 3 p.1-28dTaylor & Francis Groupx2078-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2011.617856  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245009800172520136400270592002801634650001201662650001901674650001501693650000901708650001301717650001101730650001901741650001001760650000901770650000701779650001801786650001401804650002201818653001801840653001401858653001401872653001901886653001201905653001301917653000801930653000801938653001001946653000801956653000801964653000901972653000801981653000801989653000801997653000902005653000902014653001202023653000902035653000902044653000902053653000802062653001202070653000802082653000802090700002102098700006402119700002002183773009002203856009002293852000902383655001202392IND60727498920221122064458.0220103e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072749892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1298762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoon, Ho Yin14aThe role of carbonate mineral dissolution in turbidity reduction in an oil sands end pit lake  aSurface water turbidity from dispersed clay particles can hinder the development of aquatic ecosystems. One of the primary objectives for proposed oil sands end pit lakes is that they support ecological functions and lake-specific wildlife habitat. However, high surface water turbidity has been observed in the Base Mine Lake cap water, the first full-scale demonstration oil sands end pit lake. Our previous study showed that adjusting the solution pH through carbon dioxide (CO₂) addition reduced surface water turbidity in oil sands tailings. Carbonate minerals such as calcite and dolomite were also previously identified in tailings, and thus the goal of this study was to determine the effect of calcite and dolomite dissolution through CO₂-mediated pH reduction on turbidity and the stability of suspended clay particles. Calcite dissolution resulted in ∼99% reduction of turbidity. The suspended clay particle stability was analyzed using DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) theory with water chemistry data from this column study. An inverse correlation was observed between the amount of dolomite and the energy barrier values on day 42 of the experiment. These results suggest CO₂-mediated calcite dissolution changes the water chemistry and is the most promising treatment condition for the settlement of suspended tailings particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcite 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3aclay 3adolomite 3aenergy 3ahydrochemistry 3alakes 3aoils 3apH 3asurface water 3aturbidity 3awildlife habitats 0aEnd pit lakes 0aOil sands 0aTurbidity 0aCarbon dioxide 0aCalcite 0aDolomite 0aBCR 0aBML 0aCaCl2 0aCO2 0aDDL 0aDLVO 0aEPL 0aFFT 0aHCl 0aICDD 0aICSD 0aICP-OES 0aNRAL 0aOSPW 0aSBML 0aSEM 0aSO42− 0aTSS 0aXRD1 aCossey, Heidi L.1 aBalaberda, Amy-lynne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3944-46161 aUlrich, Ania C.0 tChemosphere.g2021 May, v. 271 p.129876-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1298763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03601naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006900168506011700237506007600354520193100430592002802361506003702389650001502426650001902441650002002460650001202480650001602492650002402508650001602532651001102548651001302559651001302572651001202585651001102597651001502608651001202623651001702635651001102652651001302663653001602676653001502692653002402707653001802731653001002749700003002759700002002789700002102809700002402830773010102854856008302955852000903038655001203047IND60788725320221207141247.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078872532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.1011852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalu, Ikechukwu12aA new modelling framework to assess changes in groundwater level  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Southern African region consists of ten countries including, Angola, Zambia, Malawi, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Africa, Lesotho, and Swaziland. Frequent drought episodes in the arid and semi-arid parts of the region suggest the impact of climate change and the need for a sustainable framework for groundwater level assessments. In this study, we developed a machine learning modelling framework based on the deep belief network (DBN) to predict the changes in monthly groundwater levels (CGWLs) at 1–5 month time scales for 27 groundwater wells over the southern Africa region. With a predictor dataset constituted by hydrological parameters, groundwater level estimates, and global climate indices, we ascertain the possibility of forecasting changes in groundwater levels (CGWL) up to 5-month lead times at most locations in the study region. Using the quantile regression technique, the strength of the DBN network at 90% and 95 % confidence levels were tested, and this helped to determine the accuracy of our forecasts at five months lead times over the four representative wells. Deep learning offers new capabilities in evaluating non-linear hydrological systems, including groundwater analysis. The re-injection procedure of the DBN network, which allows the prior CGWL estimates to serve as inputs for the next estimate was key in maintaining the forecast accuracy in the 4th and 5th month lead times. This was evidenced in the accuracy of the four representative wells (r = 0.91, 0.87, 0.81, 0.75), which formed part of the test samples in CGWL analysis. We also observed that the DBN is highly susceptible to local climate variables and global climate indices, which are important drivers of climate change, and can have strong impact on groundwater level fluctuations. Therefore, the DBN proved to be a robust algorithm in our general assessments of groundwater level fluctuations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adrought 3agroundwater 3aregression analysis 3awater table 3aAngola 3aBotswana 3aEswatini 3aLesotho 3aMalawi 3aMozambique 3aNamibia 3aSouth Africa 3aZambia 3aZimbabwe 0aGroundwater 0aPrediction 0aDeep Belief Network 0aDeep learning 0aGRACE1 aNdehedehe, Christopher E.1 aOkwuashi, Onuwa1 aEyoh, Aniekan E.1 aFerreira, Vagner G.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 Oct., v. 43 p.101185-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.1011853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010900173300001600282520135300298536010101651592002801752596005401780650002301834650002101857650001201878650000901890650002301899650001901922650001901941650000701960650001901967650002001986650001602006650001402022650002102036653001202057653003102069653002402100653001302124653002302137653001702160653001902177700001902196700001702215700001802232700001802250700001802268773014802286856008602434852000902520655001202529IND60685701220221119095228.0210710e20200502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068570122DNAL7 a10.1080/10643389.2019.16428322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBandara, Tharanga10aChemical and biological immobilization mechanisms of potentially toxic elements in biochar-amended soils  ap. 903-978.  aThe application of biochars for the remediation of water and soils contaminated with potentially toxic elements (PTEs) has seen a recent growing interest. The mechanisms of chemical immobilization of PTEs with biochars in aqueous media have been well defined. However, immobilization mechanisms by which biochars interact with PTEs in soil matrix are more complex. The biological immobilization mechanisms and their interactions with PTEs in biochar-amended soils are not as well defined. This review presents an overview of factors governing interactions of biochars with PTEs as well as the synergistic effect of biochars and microorganisms in biological immobilization processes. The effectiveness of biochars in improvement of microbial immobilization of PTEs mainly depends on biochar properties, application rates, and soil environments such as organic matter content, clay type and content, pH and redox potential. Although some modified biochars appear to be better than the pristine biochars for immobilization of PTEs, their potential adverse impacts on soil microbial activity should be considered. This review highlights the most common analytical methods to discover molecular interaction mechanisms between biochar and PTEs and future research areas required for the understanding of biochar-PTE interactions in polluted soil systems.  aJMX was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41520104001).  aPublisher supplied data  a001cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aanalytical methods 3aapplication rate 3abiochar 3aclay 3amicrobial activity 3amicroorganisms 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apolluted soils 3aredox potential 3aremediation 3asynergism 3atoxic substances 0aBiochar 0apotentially toxic elements 0achemical mechanisms 0amicrobes 0aadvance techniques 0amodification 0apriming effect1 aFranks, Ashley1 aXu, Jianming1 aBolan, Nanthi1 aWang, Hailong1 aTang, Caixian0 tCritical reviews in environmental science and technology.g2020 May 2, v. 50, no. 9 p.903-978dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12197x1547-65377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2019.16428323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245012700167520115400294592002801448650003501476650001901511650001501530650003401545650001701579650001701596650001101613650001301624650001301637650002001650650000701670650001501677650001701692650001501709650001001724653002301734653002001757653002901777653002801806653000801834653000801842653000901850700002201859700002101881700002201902700002201924773010701946856008102053852000902134655001202143IND60685092320221119164101.0200412e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068509232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2020.1136402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurgat, Krystian10aDetermination of homocysteine thiolactone in human urine by capillary zone electrophoresis and single drop microextraction  aA simple, fast, sensitive and reproducible capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) method with single drop microextraction (SDME) for determination of homocysteine thiolactone (HTL) in human urine has been developed and validated. The method is characterized by good precision, high accuracy, short analysis time and low consumption of reagents. The procedure consists only of few steps: urine sample centrifugation, dilution with phosphate buffer and methanol, chloroform addition onto the top of donor phase, on-line SDME in CE system, sample separation by CZE and ultraviolet detection of HTL at 240 nm. The background electrolyte was 0.1 M pH 4.75 phosphate buffer. Effective separation was achieved within 6.04 min under the separation voltage of 24 kV (~110 μA). The LOQ and LOD for HTL were 50 and 25 nM urine, respectively. The calibration curve in urine showed linearity in the range of 50–200 nM, with R² 0.9995. The intra- and inter-day precision and recovery were 4.0–14.5% (average 8.7% and 9.3%) and 92.7–115.5% (average 103.6% and 104.8%), respectively. The procedure was successfully applied to analysis of urine samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillary zone electrophoresis 3acentrifugation 3achloroform 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrolytes 3ahomocysteine 3ahumans 3alactones 3amethanol 3amicroextraction 3apH 3aphosphates 3athiolactones 3aurinalysis 3aurine 0aAnalytical methods 0aElectrophoresis 0aHomocysteine thiolactone 0aOn-line microextraction 0aCZE 0aHTL 0aSDME1 aOlejarz, Patrycja1 aKośka, Izabella1 aGłowacki, Rafał1 aKubalczyk, Paweł0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2020 May 01, v. 596 p.113640-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2020.1136403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245007800204300001600282500001100298520120000309592002801509650000801537650002001545650001501565650000901580650001601589650002001605650001001625650002101635650001001656650001301666650001101679650001401690650002301704650001301727650001901740650002501759650001001784650001901794650003601813650001101849650001001860650001701870700002001887700002201907700001801929773014101947856008202088852000902170655001202179IND60685382120221120222121.0200303e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068538212DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-019-01203-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Jeena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0320-088710aPhytochemicals enriched in spices: a source of natural epigenetic therapy  ap. 171-186.  aReview  aMetabolic disorders are increasing at an alarming rate due to the stressful lifestyle and inappropriate diet schedule. The unorganized habits influence multiple epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications and miRNA expression. These epigenetic modifications are reversible in nature and regulate gene expression in response to external stimuli without altering the DNA sequence. Dietary herbs are enriched in various phytochemicals which additionally provide nutrition and health benefits; and are known to target these epigenetic gene regulatory mechanisms. They have been in use since human civilization for their health-promoting effects. Culinary spices and condiments which are generally used to enhance the taste of food are rich repositories of many phytochemicals which provides them their unique aroma. Considerable attention has been given to “Nutri-epigenetics” nowadays, with a focus on evaluating the potential of phytochemicals to regulate/neutralize various epigenetic modifications. This article aims at highlighting the epigenetic regulatory roles of phytochemicals present in condiments and spices with considerable health benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3acondiments 3adiet 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahealth promotion 3aherbs 3ahistones 3ahumans 3alifestyle 3ametabolic diseases 3amicroRNA 3aneutralization 3anucleotide sequences 3aodors 3aphytochemicals 3apost-translational modification 3aspices 3ataste 3atherapeutics1 aSharma, Sandeep1 aSharma, Neeta Raj1 aKabra, Dhiraj0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2020 Feb., v. 43, no. 2 p.171-186dPharmaceutical Society of KoreawJournal:J000001242x0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-019-01203-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03855naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012600168506011700294506007600411520210000487592002802587506003702615650001602652650001102668650001502679650000902694650002102703650002002724650001802744650001002762650001602772650002102788650002202809650001702831650001402848650002002862650001802882650002002900650001002920653012102930700002003051700001603071700002103087700001603108700001903124773010303143856008203246852000903328655001203337IND60788725520221207141248.0220926e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078872552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cpb.2022.1002552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnyemaobi, Olive10aTranscriptome profiling of the chilling response in wheat spikes: I, acclimation response to long-term chilling treatment  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChilling conditions coinciding with the early stage of flowering cause significant yield losses in temperate climate zone wheat crops. Progress in breeding for chilling tolerance has been hampered by a lack in understanding of the physiological basis of the problem. Phenotyping methods have therefore used grain yield related traits, rather than traits that focus directly on the cause of the problem. In this study we used transcriptome profiling to gain a better understanding about the differences in cold acclimation in young microspore (YM) stage wheat spikes of a chilling-tolerant (Young, Yng) and a chilling-sensitive (Wyalkatchem, Wk) wheat variety. Gene expression studies were carried out for a longer-term (4-days) controlled environment cyclic chilling treatment (21 °C day/−3 °C night). The accompanying paper addresses the short-term response to chilling using the same treatment cycle (4 h and 12 h), enabling us to compare the regulatory and cold acclimation responses. We used Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to objectively identify processes that differ in the chilling response of both wheat lines. The transcriptome analysis reveals significant quantitative and qualitative differences between the two wheat lines. Most notable are differences in the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and cuticular wax deposition. Several genes involved in auxin metabolism and signalling were enriched in chilling-tolerant Yng compared to Wk, including genes of the Small Auxin Up-Regulated (SAUR) gene family. The results indicate that the chilling tolerant and sensitive wheat varieties differ significantly in their adaption of lipid metabolism and cuticular wax deposition to chilling temperatures. This suggests that controlling membrane fluidity and permeability of the cell wall play a crucial role in controlling chilling tolerance. The results also indicate that auxin metabolism and signalling differentiate the chilling tolerant and sensitive wheat lines, suggesting that this hormone may play an important role in establishing chilling tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacclimation 3aauxins 3acell walls 3acold 3aepicuticular wax 3agene expression 3agene ontology 3agenes 3agrain yield 3alipid metabolism 3amembrane fluidity 3apermeability 3aphenotype 3atemperate zones 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3awheat 0aChilling tolerance/transcriptome/cold acclimation/lipid metabolism/cuticular wax/auxin/ SAUR/spike development/wheat1 aSangma, Harriet1 aGarg, Gagan1 aWallace, Xiaomei1 aKleven, Sue1 aDolferus, Rudy0 tCurrent plant biology.g2022 Sept., v. 31 p.100255-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23302x2214-66287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpb.2022.1002553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013000165300001600295500001500311520127800326592002801604650001801632650003301650650001301683650002201696650001401718650001801732650001901750650002501769650001801794650001301812650001601825650001201841653002801853700002001881700002201901700002501923700002001948700001901968773011301987856008102100852000902181655001202190IND60120233820221122180748.0150131e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012023382DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-014-0634-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaculik, Petr10aPotato virus X displaying the E7 peptide derived from human papillomavirus type 16: a novel position for epitope presentation  ap. 671-680.  a2019-12-04  aPotato virus X (PVX) is widely used as a peptide presentation system in plant biotechnology, mostly by fusion of desired peptides to the N-terminus of its capsid protein (CP). Considering that some epitopes can interfere with the stability and/or self-assembly of PVX CP when fused to its N-terminus, we evaluated four other possible sites for fusion using the E7 epitope derived from human papillomavirus type 16 with different tags. We prepared eight different PVX CP constructs modified with the E7 epitope fused with the 6xHis tag in both orientations (6xHis-E7, E7-6xHis), cloned them into the PVX-based vector pGR106 and expressed them transiently in Nicotiana benthamina plants. Only the fusion site located after amino acid 23 led to systemic infection of plants and the production of recombinant proteins, but no viral particles were detected. When we replaced the 6xHis with StrepII tag, the modified virus infected plants systemically, expressed proteins assembled into viral particles and the epitopes were located on the particle surface. The results of this study indicate that the new position within the PVX CP can be used for peptide presentation on the surface of PVX particles and is promising for PVX based production of therapeutic compounds in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoat proteins 3aHuman papillomavirus type 16 3aepitopes 3aprotein synthesis 3aNicotiana 3aorgan culture 3aPotato virus X 3arecombinant proteins 3abiotechnology 3apeptides 3aamino acids 3aviruses 0aHuman papillomavirus 161 aPlchova, Helena1 aMoravec, Tomáš,1 aHoffmeisterova, Hana1 aCerovska, Noemi1 aSmahel, Michal0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2015 Feb., v. 120, no. 2 p.671-680dSpringer-Verlagx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-014-0634-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245012900180300001400309520124100323592002801564650002401592650002501616650002201641650001901663650003301682650001101715650001701726650002101743650001901764653002501783653001901808653001901827653003901846653002101885700003701906773010601943856008602049852000902135655001202144IND60525297320221122224430.0190318e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052529732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins, Andréa Bercini10aEffect of carboxylic acids as compatibilizer agent on mechanical properties of thermoplastic starch and polypropylene blends  ap. 79-85.  aIn this work, polypropylene/thermoplastic starch (PP/TPS) blends were prepared as an alternative material to use in disposable packaging, reducing the negative polymeric environmental impact. Unfortunately, this material displays morphological characteristics typical of immiscible polymer blends and a compatibilizer agent is needed. Three different carboxyl acids: myristic (C14), palmitic (C16) and stearic acids (C18) were used as natural compatibilizer agent (NCA). The effects of NCA on the mechanical, physical, thermal and morphological properties of PP/TPS blends were investigated and compared against PP/TPS with and without PP-grafted maleic anhydride (PPgMA). When compared to PP/TPS, blends with C18, PPgMA and C14 presented an improvement of 25, 22 and 17% in tensile strength at break and of 180, 194 and 259% in elongation at break, respectively. The highest increase, 54%, in the impact strength was achieved with C14 incorporation. Improvements could be seen, through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, in the compatibility between the immiscible components by acids incorporation. These results showed that carboxylic acids, specifically C14, could be used as compatibilizer agent and could substitute PPgMA.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisposable products 3aenvironmental impact 3amaleic anhydrides 3apolypropylenes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astarch 3astearic acid 3atensile strength 3athermoplastics 0aThermoplastic starch 0aPolymer blends 0aCompatibilizer 0aMechanical and physical properties 0aCarboxylic acids1 aSantana, Ruth Marlene Campomanes0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 135 p.79-85dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008500167300001500252520137800267592002801645650002001673650001501693650001201708650001201720650002301732650001501755650001101770650000901781650002001790650001701810650001701827651001101844651001301855653001101868653002101879653001501900653001901915700001601934700002401950773009101974856005102065852000902116655001202125IND50086626120221116174947.0140412e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008662612DNAL7 a10.1080/03031853.2011.6178652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorako, T.K.10aInvestigating Volatility in Coffee Prices Along the Ethiopian Coffee Value Chain  ap. 90-108.  aThe coffee sub-sector is a major contributor to the Ethiopian economy. In addition to accounting for approximately 40 per cent on average of total export earnings, coffee production provides a livelihood for a large proportion of the Ethiopian population in the form of jobs for farmers, local traders, transporters and exporters. Volatility in the price of coffee thus influences a large proportion of the population all along the coffee commodity chain within Ethiopia. This study uses the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity/Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH)/(GARCH) approach to quantify the volatility in the price of coffee. A distinction is made between producer, wholesale and export prices in order to compare the price risk as faced by the respective participants in the coffee chain. The volatility in coffee prices within Ethiopia is also compared to the volatility levels in Brazilian coffee prices, since Brazil is a major coffee producing country in the world. Coffee prices within Ethiopia were found to be more volatile than in Brazil. Producer prices were found to be the most volatile, followed by wholesale prices and export prices respectively. The high level of volatility in producer prices emphasises the need for efficient price risk management tools that should be available to coffee producers in Ethiopia.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3aemployment 3aexports 3afarmers 3aheteroskedasticity 3alivelihood 3aprices 3arisk 3arisk management 3asupply chain 3atransporters 3aBrazil 3aEthiopia 0acoffee 0aprice volatility 0aARCH/GARCH 0aproducer price1 aJordaan, H.1 avan Schalkwyk, H.D.0 tAgrekon.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 50, no. 3 p.90-108dTaylor & Francis Groupx2078-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2011.617865  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014600170300001800316520148700334536029701821592002802118596003202146650002102178650001502199650001502214650002402229650001702253650002202270650001502292650001602307650003302323650002502356650002002381650002002401653003302421653001502454653002102469700002402490700001902514700002302533700002702556700001602583700002402599773015202623856008602775852000902861655001202870IND60685701520221119095143.0210710e20200518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068570152DNAL7 a10.1080/10643389.2019.16428352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnfar, Zakaria10aRecent trends on numerical investigations of response surface methodology for pollutants adsorption onto activated carbon materials: A review  ap. 1043-1084.  aNowadays, water pollution has been considered a global concern on environmental sustainability, calling for high-performance materials in effective pollution treatments. Adsorption approach has great potential to eliminate persistent inorganic and organic compounds. Activated carbon (AC) materials including their composite materials have been largely investigated under various experimental conditions as low-cost, promising adsorbents to remove contaminants from water resources. In this review, the authors report the most recent development in activated carbon materials for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants and its modeling counterpart using response surface methodology (RSM) statistical calculations. We also highlights up-to-date studies for the removal of organic pollutants and heavy metals from water using activated carbon materials as adsorbents with a focus on structure-to-properties and the effects of surface functions on adsorption processes. This review also summarizes for the first time the advantages and disadvantages of RSM method in the investigations related to adsorption of pollutants to assess the potential opportunities and challenges for the application of activated carbon materials in wastewater treatment. The critical analyses and conclusions highlighted in this present study should be of benefit to environmental scientists, chemists and engineers interested in the use of AC and optimization tools in environmental remediation.  aThis work was supported by the Franco-Moroccan cooperation, CEDocs 2018 research projects.

A probit analysis is used to identify the factors which determine the choice of a selling point. Variables capturing transaction costs are used in the analysis and these relate to searching for a trading partner, gathering information about the transaction, contracting, negotiating, monitoring and enforcing of contracts. The findings reveal that collective action, gender of household head, degree of dependence on the crop, geographical location and access to price information significantly affect the choice of selling point. This suggests that policies aimed at establishing market information systems, promotion of collective action among smallholder farmers, increased investment in rural infrastructure and achieving gender balance in trade are important.  aPublisher supplied data 3abananas 3acollective action 3agender 3agrowers 3ainformation systems 3aissues and policy 3amarketing channels 3amonitoring 3aprobit analysis 3arural infrastructure 3atrade balance 3aCentral Africa 3aGreat Lakes region 0atransaction costs 0achoice of selling point 0afarmgate 0amarket/s 0asmallholder farmers 0abananas 0aGreat Lakes region1 aMachethe, C.0 tAgrekon.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 50, no. 3 p.109-123dTaylor & Francis Groupx2078-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2011.617866  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245007900207300001400286520104100300592002801341650001301369650002701382650001701409650004701426650001501473650001701488650000901505650001201514650001301526700006001539700005901599700006001658700006001718773011501778856008301893852000901976655001201985IND60771499120221121221045.0220411e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077149912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10577-021-09678-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanabe, Reito1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3593-904510aMobility of kinetochore proteins measured by FRAP analysis in living cells  ap. 43-57.  aThe kinetochore is essential for faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis and is assembled through dynamic processes involving numerous kinetochore proteins. Various experimental strategies have been used to understand kinetochore assembly processes. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis is also a useful strategy for revealing the dynamics of kinetochore assembly. In this study, we introduced fluorescence protein-tagged kinetochore protein cDNAs into each endogenous locus and performed FRAP analyses in chicken DT40 cells. Centromeric protein (CENP)-C was highly mobile in interphase, but immobile during mitosis. CENP-C mutants lacking the CENP-A-binding domain became mobile during mitosis. In contrast to CENP-C, CENP-T and CENP-H were immobile during both interphase and mitosis. The mobility of Dsn1, which is a component of the Mis12 complex and directly binds to CENP-C, depended on CENP-C mobility during mitosis. Thus, our FRAP assays provide dynamic aspects of how the kinetochore is assembled.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickens 3achromosome segregation 3afluorescence 3afluorescence recovery after photobleaching 3ainterphase 3akinetochores 3aloci 3amitosis 3aresearch1 aHirano, Yasuhiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7339-40531 aHara, Masatoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8433-11111 aHiraoka, Yasushi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9407-82281 aFukagawa, Tatsuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8564-68520 tChromosome research.g2022 Mar., v. 30, no. 1 p.43-57dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl53154x0967-38497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10577-021-09678-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245015000181500002200331506011700353506007600470520146800546592002802014506003702042650001502079650001702094650002402111650002002135650001402155650002202169650001702191650002402208650001602232650001402248653001302262653002702275653002702302653002402329653001402353700002902367700006502396773018902461856008302650852000902733655001202742IND60788725820221207141251.0220914e20220727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078872582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japb.2022.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKathirvelpandian, Ayyathurai10aSpecies-specific molecular signatures for the commercially important scombrids using mitochondrial gene analysis; a tool for fisheries management  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe family Scombridae, comprising of commercially important marine fishes, which are widely distributed across tropical, subtropical, and temperate waters. Scombrids constitute an important fishery and are exploited across their range of distribution. Accurate identification of species is important for effective fisheries management and forensics purposes. In the present study, commercially important species of scombrids distributed in Indian waters were selected for molecular phylogeny and development of species-specific diagnostic keys using mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. In addition to morphological identification, the species were identified using molecular-based identification approach and character-based identification system. Molecular phylogeny for 16 species of scombrids was ascertained using mitochondrial COI analyses. The character-based molecular diagnostic keys for 16 species of scombrids were developed in-silico from data set comprising 603 mtCOI sequences generated in the present study as well as collected from published resources. The study uncovered 39 unambiguous molecular keys, capable of distinguishing all reference taxa under study. The development of species-specific sequences and key diagnostic nucleotides for scombrid fish species will be helpful in effective forensic applications, enforcement of fisheries regulations, and for sustainable utilization of this commercially important group of species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aScombridae 3abiodiversity 3acomputer simulation 3adata collection 3afisheries 3aforensic sciences 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genes 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 0aBLOG 2.0 0adiagnostic nucleotides 0amitochondrial COI gene 0amolecular phylogeny 0ascombrids1 aChowdhury, Labrechai Mog1 aSanjeev Kumar, Murali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1171-96060 tJournal of Asia-Pacific biodiversity(Online).g2022 July 27, dElsevier B.V.aNational Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA)wJournal:23211x2287-884X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japb.2022.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245009000210520127600300592002801576650002001604650003301624650000801657650002001665650001101685650001201696650000901708650001401717650001201731650002801743650001101771650001301782650001501795650001401810650001301824650002001837653001201857653001001869653002201879700002101901700001801922700002001940700002201960700002001982700005602002700006002058773011002118856008502228852000902313655001202322IND60746027020221119193236.0210926e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074602702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1178432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBank, Michael S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5194-717110aRapid temporal decline of mercury in Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides)  aMercury (Hg) pollution in the ocean is an issue of global concern, however bioaccumulation regimes of this ubiquitous pollutant in marine apex predators have important knowledge gaps. Our fish length and stable isotope (δ¹⁵N and δ¹³C) normalized data of Greenland halibut (GH) (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) showed that Hg bioaccumulation in fillet tissue decreased by ~35–50 %, over a ten-year period from 2006 to 2015 (n = 7 individual sampling years). Hg was predominantly in the methylmercury form (>77 %). Results from a Bayesian information theoretic model showed that GH Hg concentrations decreased with time and its associated declines in Hg air emissions, estimated trophic position, and a potentially lower degree of demersal prey use as indicated by temporal trend shifts in nitrogen (δ¹⁵N) and carbon (δ¹³C) stable isotope values. GH trophic shifts accounted for about one third of the observed temporal reduction in Hg. Our study demonstrates the importance of simultaneously considering Hg emissions, food web dynamics and trophic shifts as important drivers of Hg bioaccumulation in a marine, deep water fish species and highlights the effectiveness of Hg regulations on ocean apex predator Hg concentrations and overall seafood safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aReinhardtius hippoglossoides 3aair 3abioaccumulation 3acarbon 3afillets 3afish 3afood webs 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3amodels 3anitrogen 3apollutants 3apollution 3aseafoods 3astable isotopes 0aSeafood 0aOcean 0aGreenland halibut1 aFrantzen, Sylvia1 aDuinker, Arne1 aAmouroux, David1 aTessier, Emmanuel1 aNedreaas, Kjell1 aMaage, Amund1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2772-57521 aNilsen, Bente M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5432-68720 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 289 p.117843-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1178433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01680naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007800167300001400245520057100259592002800830650001900858650002300877650001200900650001700912650001400929650002100943650002400964650001200988650001501000650001201015650001801027650001001045651001901055700002201074773010701096856008201203852000901285655001201294IND60621491120221121204949.0181117s1998    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062149112DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826598019001052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnofiok, N.

Although all the three concentrations (100, 150 and 200mgL−1) of GA3 were effective in improving grain yield in both cultivars, the effect of 150mgL−1 GA3 was much pronounced particularly in the salt intolerant cultivar when under salt stress. Seed priming with GA3 altered the pattern of accumulation of different ions between shoots and roots in the adult plants of wheat under saline conditions. Treatment with GA3 (150mgL−1) decreased Na+ concentrations both in the shoots and roots and increased Ca2+ and K+ concentrations in the roots of both wheat cultivars. GA3-priming did not show consistent effect on gaseous exchange characteristics and the concentrations of auxins in the salt stressed plants of both wheat cultivars. However, all concentrations of GA3 reduced leaf free ABA levels in the salt intolerant, while reverse was true in the salt tolerant cultivar under saline conditions. Priming with GA3 (150mgL−1) was very effective in enhancing salicylic acid (SA) concentration in both wheat cultivars when under salt stress. Treatment with GA3 (100–150mgL−1) lowered leaf free putrescine (Put) and spermidine (Spd) concentrations in the plants of both wheat cultivars. The decrease in polyamines (Put and Spd) and ABA concentrations in the salt stressed plants of the salt intolerant cultivar treated with GA3 suggested that these plants might have faced less stress compared with control. Thus, physiologically, GA3-priming-induced increase in grain yield was attributed to the GA3-priming-induced modulation of ions uptake and partitioning (within shoots and roots) and hormones homeostasis under saline conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aabscisic acid 3acultivars 3agas exchange 3agibberellic acid 3agrain yield 3ahomeostasis 3aion transport 3aleaves 3amature plants 3aphotosynthesis 3aputrescine 3aroots 3asalicylic acid 3asalt concentration 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseed priming 3aseeds 3ashoots 3asodium chloride 3aspring wheat 0aGA3-conditioning 0aHormonal priming 0aPolyamines 0aAuxins 0aABA 0aSA 0aSalt tolerance 0aPhotosynthesis 0aIonic partitioning 0aWheat1 aAshraf, Muhammad0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2013 Feb., v. 86 p.76-85dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2010.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012200159300001600281520105500297592002801352650001301380650002401393650001801417650001101435650004101446650002301487650001901510650001601529650001101545650001001556650000901566650002001575650001801595650001401613650001301627650002301640650001101663650001701674650001501691700001801706700001401724700001701738700002001755773012201775856007401897852000901971655001201980IND60617734020221120042224.0181026e20180124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061773402DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo01371j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiao-Wei10aQuillaja saponin-based hollow salt particles as solid carriers for enhancing sensory aroma with reduced sodium intake  ap. 191-199.  aDietary salt is a vital ingredient associated with sensory performance in processed foods, while reduced salt intake linked to public health is highly desired by consumers and food manufacturers. In this paper, quillaja saponin (QS) based hollow salt particles (∼10 μm) were fabricated by simple spray drying, and utilized as solid carriers to enhance sensory aromas with reduced sodium intake. QS-coated nanodroplets were firstly prepared as a reservoir for flavor oils (lemon and garlic oil), and then served as frameworks to construct hollow salt particles via general spray drying. Headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (DHS-GC-MS) and panel sensory analysis conclude that the hollow salt particles loaded with flavor oils enhance typical aroma attributes and saltiness perception in comparison with their mixture control. The QS-based hollow salt particles could be developed into novel vehicles for improving flavor performance with reduced sodium intake, and furthermore used for delivery of hydrophobic bioactives in food systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuillaja 3abioactive compounds 3afood industry 3agarlic 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3ahydrophobicity 3aingredients 3alemons 3aodors 3aoils 3aprocessed foods 3apublic health 3asaltiness 3asaponins 3asensory evaluation 3asodium 3aspray drying 3atable salt1 aYang, Dan-Xia1 aGuo, Jian1 aRuan, Qi-Jun1 aYang, Xiao-Quan0 tFood & function.g2018 Jan. 24, v. 9, no. 1 p.191-199dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo01371j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013800170300001600308520131700324592002801641650003001669650002701699650001401726650002201740650002101762650001901783650002601802650002201828650002601850650001501876650001301891650002201904650002001926653003501946653003001981653003902011653002102050653002102071700005802092700002002150773010802170856008602278852000902364655001202373IND60525297620221122224535.0190318e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052529762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagashima, Aya12aA uniaxially oriented nanofibrous cellulose scaffold from pellicles produced by Gluconacetobacter xylinus in dissolved oxygen culture  ap. 215-224.  aAn aerobic, Gram-negative bacterium, Gluconacetobacter xylinus, was successfully employed to produce a stretchable cellulose nanofiber pellicle using dissolved oxygen in a conventional cultured medium. The obtained nanofibers were highly crystalline with the metastable cellulose Iα phase being apparently the dominant phase by more than 90%. The obtained pellicle could be stretched by up to 1.5 times to provide oriented crystalline nanofibrous films. Low heating of the nanofibrous film induced the transformation of the dominant cellulose Iα crystalline phase into the Iβ crystalline phase without a loss of crystallinity or the high Young's modulus. The film also exhibited unique and anisotropic viscoelastic and mechanical properties as well as superior thermal stability compared with conventional high-performance synthetic polymeric materials. In addition, when G. xylinus cells were transferred to the oriented surface after stretched, they started to synthesize cellulose ribbons that parallel the nanofiber orientation of the substrate. This function as a template was evidenced by direct video imaging of the motion of the bacteria. The application of a bacterial culture using dissolved oxygen in the medium offers the fabrication of novel anisotropic and nanofibrous scaffold of cellulose Iα.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGluconacetobacter xylinus 3aGram-negative bacteria 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3adissolved oxygen 3aimage analysis 3amechanical properties 3amicrobial culture 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananofibers 3apolymers 3athermal stability 3aviscoelasticity 0aCulture using dissolved oxygen 0aGluconacetobacter xylinus 0aStretchable nanocellulose pellicle 0aNano-orientation 0aNanofibrous film1 aTsuji, Tsubasa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2649-649X1 aKondō, Tetsuo,0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 135 p.215-224dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009800173300001600271520118400287592002801471650001201499650001901511650001401530650002301544650001801567650001301585650001401598650001801612650002201630650001701652650001101669651001001680653001601690653002001706653001701726653003101743653002101774700001701795700002101812700003101833773013701864856008502001852000902086655001202095IND60685701820221119095605.0200306e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068570182DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2019.15745762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVail, Courtney S.10aPotential Welfare Impacts of Chase and Capture of Small Cetaceans during Drive Hunts in Japan  ap. 193-208.  aDrive hunts are a method to herd, capture and kill small cetaceans (whales and dolphins) in coastal waters of some countries including Japan and the Faroe Islands. In Japan, these methods are often associated with the acquisition of live dolphins for international marine parks and aquaria. During the hunts, dolphins are herded by a flotilla of fishing vessels and loud underwater noise created by fishermen banging hammers on metal poles. The prolonged and strenuous chase and use of sound barriers to herd, capture, and restrain the dolphins can result in acute stress and injury. The authors review physiological and behavioral data pertaining to chase, encirclement, and live capture of dolphins and draw comparisons between chase and capture data for marine and terrestrial species. This analysis raises substantial welfare concerns associated with the hunts and acquisition of dolphins from such capture operations. The authors assert that this data detailing the negative impacts of chase, herding and handling (capture) of small cetaceans renders these hunts inherently inhumane and should inform policy relating to the collection and management of dolphins in the wild.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCetacea 3aanimal welfare 3aaquariums 3acapture of animals 3acoastal water 3adolphins 3afishermen 3afishing boats 3aissues and policy 3amarine parks 3awhales 3aJapan 0aDrive hunts 0adolphin welfare 0aconservation 0adolphin collection methods 0acapture myopathy1 aReiss, Diana1 aBrakes, Philippa1 aButterworth, A.q(Andrew),0 tJournal of applied animal welfare science.g2020 Apr. 2, v. 23, no. 2 p.193-208dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56472x1532-76047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2019.15745763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245012400173520156800297592002801865650002501893650001501918650001601933650001001949650001301959650001201972650001501984650000701999650001702006653002502023653002502048653001702073653001602090653001902106653002002125700001902145700002002164700001502184700001902199773009102218856009002309852000902399655001202408IND60727499620221122044600.0220103e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072749962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1298842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Jeong-Joo10aUtilization of extracellular fungal melanin as an eco-friendly biosorbent for treatment of metal-contaminated effluents  aFungal melanins have been considered as potential biosorbents due to their metal-binding properties, stability, and scalability. Previous studies established scalable fungal melanin production methods with promising strains, however, their applicability for metal-contaminated effluents treatment has not been sufficiently reported. Herein, melanin pigment derived from Amorphotheca resinae was produced and characterized using microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. Adsorptive properties towards Cu(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) were evaluated using batch tests. Melanin pigment was composed of aggregates of nanosized particles with indole-based constituents. Adsorption capacities increased with the pH of solution, especially at pH > 4.0. Maximum binding capacities of Cu(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) on melanin were 69.18, 103.23, 24.31, and 13.57 mg/g, respectively. The competitive adsorption experiments elucidated affinity as Cu(II)>Pb(II)≫Cd(II)>Zn(II). Adsorption time generally required <2.5 h to reach equilibrium; the pseudo-second-order kinetic model well described the kinetics. Chelating ability of free radicals in pigment was considered as a possible mechanism for adsorption. Initial adsorption capacities remained almost intact even after 5 consecutive adsorption–desorption cycles. Complete removal of Cu(II), Pb(II), and Cd(II) from metal-contaminated effluent was confirmed. Consequently, melanin pigment derived from A. resinae can be used as a biosorbent suitable for the treatment of metal-contaminated aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmorphotheca resinae 3aadsorption 3abiosorbents 3afungi 3akinetics 3amelanin 3amicroscopy 3apH 3aspectroscopy 0aMicrobial biosorbent 0aAmorphotheca resinae 0aHeavy metals 0aBiosorption 0aFungal melanin 0aMelanin pigment1 aKim, Jeeyoung,1 aKim, Yŏng-jun,1 aKim, Sŏk,1 aKim, Gyu-Hyeok0 tChemosphere.g2021 June, v. 272 p.129884-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1298843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03423naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002000163245006100183300001600244520141900260536011401679592002801793650001501821650002601836650001201862650001901874650001501893650001301908650001801921650001801939650002501957650001201982650001101994650001002005650001902015650001302034650001202047650001902059650001402078650001202092650001002104650007002114650001202184650006402196650001802260650001102278650003702289650001002326650005302336653001102389653001002400653001202410653001502422653003102437700002302468700002402491700002402515773013202539856008102671852000902752655001202761IND4464880720221120031934.0181016e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446488072DNAL7 a225291402pmid7 a10.1177/10406387124428792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewkirk, Kim M.10aLipid emboli in a Vietnamese potbellied pig (Sus scrofa)  ap. 625-629.  aA 2-year-old, spayed female Vietnamese potbellied pig (Sus scrofa) was evaluated due to polyuria, polydipsia, lethargy, and hyporexia. The pig was obese, and a large abdominal mass was palpated. Additional findings included hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, glucosuria, and an inflammatory leukogram. At surgery, the abdominal mass was biopsied and found to be bilaterally symmetric adipose tissue with mineralization and granulomatous steatitis. An additional surgery was performed to collect additional diagnostic samples, but the pig died while recovering from anesthesia. A cosmetic necropsy was performed, and lipid emboli were identified microscopically in various tissues. The presence of lipid emboli in the lung and kidney was supported by antifibrinogen immunohistochemistry. Obesity is a common finding in potbellied pigs; however, mineralization and saponification of fat are uncommon, particularly the bilateral symmetrical distribution found in the abdomen of the present case. This may present as a single intra-abdominal mass complicating diagnostic interpretation. Whether mineralization and saponification of fat facilitate the development of fat embolism is undetermined. Lipid emboli should be considered in obese pigs undergoing medical or surgical procedures. Factors that may predispose to the development of fat embolism, such as excessive handling or bruising of fat stores, should be avoided.  aThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSus scrofa 3aVietnamese Potbellied 3aabdomen 3aadipose tissue 3aanesthesia 3aembolism 3ahypercalcemia 3ahyperglycemia 3aimmunohistochemistry 3akidneys 3alipids 3alungs 3amineralization 3anecropsy 3aobesity 3asaponification 3asteatitis 3asurgery 3aswine 2aAbdominal Neoplasmsxpathologyxradiographyxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aEmbolism, Fatxpathologyxradiographyxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aFatal Outcome 2aFemale 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxpathologyxradiographyxsurgery. 0aEmboli 0alipid 0aporcine 0aSus scrofa 0aVietnamese potbellied pigs1 aFineschi, Vittorio1 aKiefer, Virginia R.1 aVanAmstel, Sarel R.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 24, no. 3 p.625-629dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387124428793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245013900210300001100349506007600360520085400436592002801290506003701318650002201355650002201377650001901399650002501418650001901443650001001462650001701472650005201489650001901541650001801560700002401578700002001602773009201622856008101714852000901795655001201804IND60515201520221207050947.0160623e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051520152DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-016-0404-z2doi7 aPMC47794532pmcid7 a283301562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoc, Nguyen Hoang10aEffect of salicylic acid on expression level of genes related with isoprenoid pathway in centella (Centella asiatica (L.)

Salicylic acid treatment (50–200 µM) decreased expression level of CaCYS and CaSQS genes in elicited cells compared with the control.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCentella asiatica 3aNorthern blotting 3aacid treatment 3abiochemical pathways 3acultured cells 3agenes 3aphytosterols 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalicylic acid 3atriterpenoids1 aGiang, Nguyen Thanh1 aHuy, Nguyen Duc0 t3 Biotech.g2016 June, v. 6, no. 1 p.86-86dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2190-572X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-016-0404-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010700165300001600272520163800288592002801926650001301954650001101967650001301978650002001991650001502011650002602026650002302052650001302075651001602088653002302104653003102127653003002158653000802188653000902196653001002205653000802215653001002223653001202233653000802245653000702253653000802260653000702268700001802275700001702293700001702310700001702327700001802344700001402362700001702376700001802393700001702411700001602428700001502444700002302459700002002482773011002502856008302612852000902695655001202704IND60561840520221120040729.0200228e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056184052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2015.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeelis, E.G.10aPresentation of a nationwide multicenter registry of intestinal failure and intestinal transplantation  ap. 225-229.  aExact data on Dutch patients with chronic intestinal failure (CIF) and after intestinal transplantation (ITx) have been lacking. To improve standard care of these patients, a nationwide collaboration has been established. Objectives of this study were obtaining an up-to-date prevalence of CIF and characterizing these patients using the specially developed multicenter web-based Dutch Registry of Intestinal Failure and Intestinal Transplantation (DRIFT).Cross-sectional study. CIF was defined as type 3 intestinal failure in which >75% of nutritional requirements were given as home parenteral nutrition (HPN) for ≥ 4 weeks in children and >50% for ≥3 months in adults. All patients with CIF receiving HPN care by the three Dutch specialized centers on January 1, 2013 and all ITx patients were registered in DRIFT (https://drift.darmfalen.nl).In total, 195 patients with CIF (158 adults, 37 children) were identified, of whom 184 were registered in DRIFT. The Dutch point prevalence of CIF was 11.62 per million (12.24 for adults, 9.56 for children) on January 1, 2013. Fifty-seven patients (31%) had one or more indications for ITx, while 12 patients actually underwent ITx since its Dutch introduction. Four patients required transplantectomy of their intestinal graft and 3 intestinal transplant patients died.The multicenter registry DRIFT revealed an up-to-date prevalence of CIF and provided nationwide insight into the patients with CIF during HPN and after ITx in the Netherlands. DRIFT will facilitate the multicenter monitoring of individual patients, thereby supporting multidisciplinary care and decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aadults 3achildren 3adecision making 3amonitoring 3anutrient requirements 3aparenteral feeding 3apatients 3aNetherlands 0aIntestinal failure 0aIntestinal transplantation 0aHome parenteral nutrition 0aCIF 0aCIPO 0aCRBSI 0aCVC 0aDRIFT 0aESPGHAN 0aHPN 0aIF 0aITx 0aPN1 aRoskott, A.M.1 aDijkstra, G.1 aWanten, G.J.1 aSerlie, M.J.1 aTabbers, M.M.1 aDamen, G.1 aOlthof, E.D.1 aJonkers, C.F.1 aKloeze, J.H.1 aPloeg, R.J.1 aImhann, F.1 aNieuwenhuijs, V.B.1 aRings, E.H.H.M.0 tClinical nutrition.g2016 Feb., v. 35, no. 1 p.225-229dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2015.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01753naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245012800173300001800301500001900319520051200338592002800850650000800878650001500886650001600901650002100917650001900938650002100957650001100978650001200989700003301001700002701034700001601061700002001077700005701097773012101154856008301275852000901358655001201367IND60718149320210618000000.0201120e20201106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071814932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c034622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakrapani, Aswathi10aPhotocaged 5-(Hydroxymethyl)pyrimidine Nucleoside Phosphoramidites for Specific Photoactivatable Epigenetic Labeling of DNA  ap. 9081-9085.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  a5-Hydroxymethylcytosine and uracil are epigenetic nucleobases, but their biological roles are still unclear.

Phrygana differed significantly from maquis, in regard to the community metrics, composition and the homogeneity of bird assemblages. Moreover, detrended correspondence analysis ordered the census plots along a continuum of increasing vegetation height. On the other hand, within-maquis differences were few, while no significant differences were found within phrygana stages. Based upon the observed patterns, we recognise three vegetation groups: (1) phrygana, with low α-diversity and abundance and homogenous bird assemblages; (2) low maquis with relatively high α-diversity and heterogenous bird assemblages; and (3) tall maquis with relatively high α-diversity and heterogenous assemblages in which “woodland” bird species contribution is prominent.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3abreeding 3acorrespondence analysis 3ashrublands 3aspecies diversity 3awoodlands 3aCrete 3aGreece1 aDretakis, Michalis1 aAkriotis, Triantaphyllos1 aMylonas, Moysis0 tJournal für Ornithologie.g2006 July, v. 147, no. 3 p.419-427dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949854x2193-71927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-005-0024-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245012800202520097000330592002801300650000901328650001101337650002001348650001901368653001601387653001601403653002001419653001401439653002801453700001301481773009401494856008101588852000901669655001201678IND60725110720221120050024.0210124e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072511072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1044472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Zhanni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5162-875X10aEye-tracking technology in identifying visualizers and verbalizers: data on eye-movement differences and detection accuracy  aData in this article revealed the eye movement differences of visualizers and verbalizers in viewing four pictures-in-text by analyzing gaze path and fixation data (fixation duration, fixation counts and the average time on each fixation).

These AGEs have shown to associated with the development of many diseases such as diabetes-mellitus. This study is focused on immunological characterization of glycated-Hb induced by d-ribose. Here, we analysed the immunogenicity of glycated-Hb by direct binding and competitive inhibition ELISA. Direct binding ELISA confirmed that glycated-Hb was highly immunogenic and induced high titre antibodies as compared to native-Hb. The antigen binding specificity and cross reactivity of these antibodies were also screened by competitive inhibition ELISA. The IgG from rabbit sera showed enhanced binding of glycated-Hb than native-Hb. Thus, it is possible that alterations in Hb induced by d-ribose could have generated highly immunogenic neoepitopes. Moreover, induced antibodies were also found to cross-react with other modified/native proteins. On the basis of the results of this study, we presume that this type of structural perturbations in Hb in vivo by d-ribose might take place in untreated diabetic condition that could induce such type of immunogenic auto-antibodies. Furthermore, increased level of these auto-antibodies could serve as a biomarker in diabetes and its progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aantigens 3aautoantibodies 3abiomarkers 3across reaction 3adiabetes mellitus 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aglycation 3ahemoglobin 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3arabbits 0aAGEs 0aHb 0aHMF 0aTBARS 0aELISA 0aIgG 0aLYS 0aNZW 0aSDS-PAGE 0aHemoglobin 0aAGEs 0aImmunogenicity1 aFaisal, M.q(Mohammad),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8176-15271 aAlatar, Abdulrahman A.1 aAhmad, Saheem1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1215-02790 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 123 p.427-435dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03630naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013600164300001600300520216100316592002802477596005902505596004702564650002602611650002402637650001402661650001502675650002502690650002502715650001602740650001202756650002702768700005602795700001502851700001502866700001802881700001802899700001502917700001102932700002102943773012802964856008303092852000903175655001203184IND60774593220221117025420.0220421e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077459322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-022-05313-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Huimin10aSoil fungi regulate the response of plant production-community composition relationship to grazing and mowing in a semi-arid steppe  ap. 573-589.  aPURPOSE: Soil fungi have been proven to influence the plant productivity and community composition of grasslands, but regulation of soil fungi on the responses of plant production-community composition relationship to grazing and mowing remains unclear. METHODS: Here, we assessed the functional characteristics of three fungal groups using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier and data available in FUNGuild, and we characterized the community of saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, and potential plant pathogenic fungi from surface (0–10 cm) and subsurface soils (10–20 cm) of temperate grasslands, which experienced three management practices, grazing, mowing, and grazing + mowing, respectively. RESULTS: We found that all three disturbances decreased plant aboveground production and changed plant community composition in grasslands. Compared with the control, grazing significantly reduced the richness of both saprophytic fungi and potential plant pathogens from surface soil, where the richness of saprophytic fungi under grazing + mowing was also significantly reduced. No changes in the richness of mycorrhizal fungi among three disturbances were observed compared to the control in the surface soil, where antagonistic interaction between potential plant pathogens and saprotrophic fungi drove the plant production-community composition relationship. On the contrary, three disturbances did not change the richness of all fungal functional guilds in the subsurface soil, where the plant production-community composition relationship was driven by antagonistic interaction between mycorrhizal fungi and potential plant pathogens. CONCLUSION: The findings reveal that antagonistic interaction between fungal guilds played important roles in regulating response of plant production-community composition to grazing and mowing in grasslands. Our finding highlights that potential plant pathogens also have a crucial effect on plant production-community composition relationship. This knowledge is important for predicting the shifts in ecosystem functions as consequence of changes in soil fungal groups during grassland management.  aPublisher supplied data  a31860681cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aCARS-34cChina Agriculture Research System 3abotanical composition 3acommunity structure 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3agrassland management 3aprimary productivity 3asaprophytes 3asteppes 3asubsurface soil layers1 aLiu, Zhiying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5483-61321 aHuang, Nan1 aLuo, Yaqin1 aHuang, Zixuan1 aZhang, Tianyu1 aLi, Wenhao1 aWu, Le1 aBaoyin, Taogetao0 tPlant and soil.g2022 Apr., v. 473, no. 1-2 p.573-589dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05313-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245017000164300002000334520096300354592002801317650000801345650001401353650001801367650001801385650001201403650000901415650001801424650001701442650001101459650001801470650001401488650001901502650001401521700003101535700002001566700002101586700002101607700007201628773017301700856008001873852000901953655001201962IND60600967420180822000000.0180705e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060096742DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b015712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerrien, Elie10aAerobic Oxidation of Glucose to Glucaric Acid under Alkaline-Free Conditions: Au-Based Bimetallic Catalysts and the Effect of Residues in a Hemicellulose Hydrolysate  ap. 13175-13189.  aAu–Pt and Au–Pd bimetallic catalysts were prepared over various supports using different preparation methods and were compared in the base-free selective aerobic catalytic oxidation of glucose to glucaric acid. The method of preparation of the bimetallic catalysts, the support material for the Au–Pt bimetallic nanoparticles, and the metal molar ratios have a strong influence on the activity and the maximum yield of glucaric acid. The Au–Pt/ZrO₂ catalyst with a molar ratio for Au/Pt = 1 provides a 50% yield of glucaric acid at complete conversion of glucose and gluconic acid at 100 °C, under 40 bar air, using a glucose/metal ratio of 80. The catalyst was stable upon sequential recycling in a batch reactor and in long-term use in a continuous reactor. The influence of possible residual impurities has been studied. Furan derivatives or lignin residues might be problematic for catalytic oxidation of glucose in hemicellulose hydrolysates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acatalysts 3aglucaric acid 3agluconic acid 3aglucose 3agold 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysates 3alignin 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aprocess design 3arecycling1 aMounguengui-Diallo, Modibo1 aPerret, Noémie1 aMarion, Philippe1 aPinel, Catherine1 aBesson-Guillaumot, Michèle,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0024-56760 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 56, no. 45 p.13175-13189dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b015713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03958naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245010800177300001800285500002000303500001500323520214000338592002802478650002202506650001702528650001402545650001902559650002602578650002302604650002002627650001402647650001902661650001502680650001702695650001902712650002202731650001802753650001502771650002202786650002002808650002102828650002202849650001002871650002202881650000902903650003102912650001602943650001702959650002102976650001302997651001803010651001803028653001803046653001903064700002203083773013203105852000903237856007403246655001203320IND4431557520221117232308.0180321e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443155752DNAL7 a198310682pmid7 a10.1890/08-0172.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharles, Heather10aEffects of warming and altered precipitation on plant and nutrient dynamics of a New England salt marsh  ap. 1758-1773.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aSalt marsh structure and function, and consequently ability to support a range of species and to provide ecosystem services, may be affected by climate change. To better understand how salt marshes will respond to warming and associated shifts in precipitation, we conducted a manipulative experiment in a tidal salt marsh in Massachusetts, USA. We exposed two plant communities (one dominated by Spartina patens–Distichlis spicata and one dominated by short form Spartina alterniflora) to five climate manipulations: warming via passive open‐topped chambers, doubled precipitation, warming and doubled precipitation, extreme drought via rainout shelter, and ambient conditions. Modest daytime warming increased total aboveground biomass of the S. alterniflora community (24%), but not the S. patens–D. spicata community. Warming also increased maximum stem heights of S. alterniflora (8%), S. patens (8%), and D. spicata (15%). Decomposition was marginally accelerated by warming in the S. alterniflora community. Drought markedly increased total biomass of the S. alterniflora community (53%) and live S. patens (69%), perhaps by alleviating waterlogging of sediments. Decomposition was accelerated by increased precipitation and slowed by drought, particularly in the S. patens–D. spicata community. Flowering phenology responded minimally to the treatments, and pore water salinity, sulfide, ammonium, and phosphate concentrations showed no treatment effects in either plant community. Our results suggest that these salt marsh communities may be resilient to modest amounts of warming and large changes in precipitation. If production increases under climate change, marshes will have a greater ability to keep pace with sea‐level rise, although an increase in decomposition could offset this. As long as marshes are not inundated by flooding due to sea‐level rise, increases in aboveground biomass and stem heights suggest that marshes may continue to export carbon and nutrients to coastal waters and may be able to increase their carbon storage capability by increasing plant growth under future climate conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3asalt marsh plants 3aplant growth 3aflowering 3aplant residues 3anutrient availability 3aDistichlis spicata 3aair temperature 3aphenology 3aglobal warming 3aphosphates 3asalt marshes 3abiodegradation 3acommunity ecology 3aplant ecology 3aphosphorus 3aammonium nitrogen 3aSpartina patens 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aLight 2aPlant Development 2aRain 2aSodium Chloridexchemistry 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWetlands 3aMassachusetts 0aMassachusetts 0aprecipitation 0aclimate change1 aDukes, Jeffrey S.0 tEcological applications.g2009 Oct., v. 19, no. 7 p.1758-1773dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0172.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01580naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245007700164300001800241500001900259520058100278592002800859650001300887650002000900650001600920650002700936650001300963700001800976700005900994773012101053856008301174852000901257655001201266IND60718149420221118082805.0201120e20201109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071814942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c034722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSi, Yi-Xin10aSynthesis of Isocyanides by Reacting Primary Amines with Difluorocarbene  ap. 9086-9090.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA general, convenient, and friendly route for preparing a versatile building block of isocyanides from primary amines is developed.

DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: Research institute and obstetrics and gynecology clinic. PATIENT(S): Participants with (n = 18) and without (n = 20) endometriosis. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, protease assays, and in silico tools were used to investigate the origin of the 20-kd HSP70 fragment. Immunocolocalization studies were carried out to determine whether subtilisin/kexin isozyme 1 (SKI-1) and HSP70 are colocalized. Expression and localization of surrogate markers of inflammation, such as nuclear factor NF-κB and interleukin IL-6 were examined by immunoblotting and in situ studies. RESULT(S): HSP70 is posttranslationally processed into a 20-kd fragment by SKI-1, a protease of the subtilisin family, in ectopic endometrium (ECE). Immunocolocalization studies revealed spatial proximity of SKI-1 and HSP70 in ECE. Furthermore, ECE demonstrated nuclear localization of the transcription factor, NF-κB and high expression of its target protein, IL-6. CONCLUSION(S): This study hints at the possible mechanisms underlying the trimming of HSP70 in ECE and also at the role of proteases in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The possible repercussions of HSP70 fragmentation include dysregulation of key regulatory proteins, resulting in the escalation of inflammatory events in endometriotic lesions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendometrium 3aheat-shock protein 70 3aimmunoblotting 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aisozymes 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aproteolysis 3aregulatory proteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asubtilisin 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aWarty, Neeta1 aSachdeva, Geetanjali1 aKhole, Vrinda0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Apr., v. 95, no. 5 p.1560-1567.e3dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.01.1223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245004400170300002500214520114400239592002801383650001301411650001701424650001001441650001701451650001901468650001301487650001401500650001001514650002401524650002001548650001701568700002301585700001501608700001701623700002101640773010501661856008801766990002301854852000901877655001201886IND60098513420221122101924.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009851342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiba, Koji10aFinasteride-associated male infertility  ap. 1786.e9-1786.e11.  aOBJECTIVE: To describe a male patient with finasteride-associated infertility. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Tertiary-care clinic for male infertility. PATIENT(S): A patient with azoospermia who had been taking finasteride (1-mg dose) for 1 year for androgenic alopecia. He had been diagnosed with oligospermia 5 years before. INTERVENTION(S): Discontinuation of finasteride. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Improvement of semen parameters. RESULT(S): After cessation of finasteride, the patient’s semen volume increased immediately, and sperm concentration was up to more than 10 × 10⁶/mL 16 weeks after stopping finasteride. He is now trying to achieve pregnancy by intrauterine insemination. CONCLUSION(S): Cessation of finasteride improved spermatogenesis and allowed the couple to attempt less-invasive fertility therapy. In this case, the patient had impaired spermatogenesis before he started the drug. In such patients, the drug may further decrease spermatogenesis. We suggest that drug cessation could be taken into consideration for infertile male patients with impaired semen parameters who are taking finasteride at a 1-mg dose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalopecia 3acase studies 3adrugs 3ainsemination 3amale fertility 3apatients 3apregnancy 3asemen 3asperm concentration 3aspermatogenesis 3atherapeutics1 aYamaguchi, Kōhei,1 aLi, Fuping1 aAndo, Makoto1 aFujisawa, Masato0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Apr., v. 95, no. 5 p.1786.e9-1786.e11dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.12.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100007400146245012900220300002000349520131300369592002801682650001801710650003601728650001701764650002101781650001401802650001901816650002601835650001801861650001601879700001601895700002401911700001901935773017301954856008002127852000902207655001202216IND60600967620221121231854.0180705e20171122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060096762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b015832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohd.

The Mb-binding capacity of these geminis decreased in the order of C₁₄–E2O–C₁₄ > C₁₆–E2O–C₁₆ > C₁₂–E2O–C₁₂, following the 1:2 stoichiometry, as confirmed by the quantitative evaluation of binding constants via intrinsic fluorescence and cyclic voltammetry. The binding-induced microenvironmental and conformational changes of Mb were explored by pyrene/synchronous/three-dimensional (3-D) fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, far- and near-ultraviolet (UV) circular dichroism spectral results depicted discernible changes in both secondary and tertiary structures of Mb upon complexation with Cₘ–E2O–Cₘ. Molecular docking specified the binding site, and aromatic residues involved in the complexation. These investigations provide deeper insight into the structure–property relationships of biomacromolecules, and they will be useful in designing/selecting appropriate surfactants which, in turn, can facilitate the application of protein–surfactant mixtures in pharmaceutical, biological, and industrial fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3amolecular models 3amyoglobin 3aprocess design 3aquantitative analysis 3astoichiometry 3asurfactants1 aAnwar, Sana1 aBhat, Imtiyaz Ahmad1 aKabir-ud-Din, 0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Nov. 22, v. 56, no. 46 p.13663-13676dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b015833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245009900160300001600259520114600275592002801421596007501449650002701524650001401551650001601565650002101581650002901602650003101631650002101662650001201683650001301695650002201708650001601730650001701746650000901763700001601772700001601788700001601804700005701820773012801877856008302005852000902088655001202097IND60774593420221117030026.0220421e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077459342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-022-05307-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qin10aNitrogen fixation by Paenibacillus polymyxa WLY78 is responsible for cucumber growth promotion  ap. 507-516.  aAIMS: To study nitrogen contribution to cucumber derived from nitrogen fixation of Paenibacillus polymyxa WLY78. METHODS: The nif gene cluster deletion mutant (ΔnifB-V) of Paenibacillus polymyxa WLY78 was constructed by a homologous recombination method. The effects of plant-growth promotion were investigated by greenhouse experiments. The nitrogen fixation contribution was estimated by ¹⁵N isotope dilution method (also being called the ¹⁵N natural abundance technique). RESULTS: Deletion of nif gene cluster of P. polymyxa WLY78 resulted in complete loss of nitrogenase activity. Greenhouse experiments showed that inoculation with P. polymyxa WLY78 could significantly enhance the lengths and dry weights of cucumber roots and shoots, but inoculation with ΔnifB-V mutant could not. ¹⁵N isotope dilution experiments showed that cucumber plants derive 25.93% nitrogen from nitrogen fixation performed by P. polymyxa WLY78, but the ΔnifB-V mutant nearly could not provide nitrogen for plant growth. CONCLUSIONS: This present study demonstrated that nitrogen fixation performed by P. polymyxa WLY78 contributes to plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019YFA0904700cnational key research and development program of china 3aPaenibacillus polymyxa 3acucumbers 3agreenhouses 3agrowth promotion 3ahomologous recombination 3aisotope dilution technique 3amultigene family 3amutants 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogenase 3aplant growth 3asoil1 aLiu, Shuang1 aLi, Yongbin1 aHao, Tianyi1 aChen, Sanfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2956-90250 tPlant and soil.g2022 Apr., v. 473, no. 1-2 p.507-516dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05307-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011900170520128200289592002801571650001001599650001501609650001201624650002101636650001801657650001401675650001901689650000901708650001501717653001201732653002401744653002601768653002401794653001901818700001801837700001901855700001801874700002101892700001901913700002001932700001801952773011401970856008602084852000902170655001202179IND60783415120221121054830.0220914e20221005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078341512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1295672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhifeng,10aSustainable, biocompatible, and mass-producible superwetting water caltrop shell biochars for emulsion separations  aThe separation of oily wastewater, specifically emulsions, is a crucial global issue. Possible strategies for the efficient separation of emulsified oil/water mixtures through sustainable and environmentally friendly materials have recently drawn considerable attention. In our study, we prepared superwetting water caltrop shell biochar (WCSB) via a top-lit-updraft carbonization procedure. The as-prepared WCSB was characterized by superhydrophilicity, underwater superoleophobicity, underoil superhydrophilicity, and underoil water adsorption ability. Because of its superwetting properties, WCSB was used for the separation of both surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions (SOIWEs) and surfactant-stabilized water-in-oil emulsions (SWIOEs) with very high fluxes (up to 74,700 and 241,000 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹ for SOIWE and SWIOE, respectively). The separation performances were excellent, with oil contents in all SOIWE filtrates lower than 10 ppm and oil purities in all SWIOE filtrates higher than 99.99 wt%. Moreover, WCSB was applied to separate dye-spiked emulsions. Due to their high emulsion separation ability, sustainability, good biocompatibility, and ease of mass production, the as-prepared WCSBs have notable potential for utilitarian applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrapa 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3abiocompatibility 3acarbonization 3aemulsions 3ahydrophilicity 3aoils 3awastewater 0aBiochar 0aWater caltrop shell 0aSuperwetting property 0aEmulsion separation 0aSustainability1 aHuang, Xin-Yu1 aLin, Hong-Ping1 aChen, Jem-Kun1 aTsai, Hsieh-Chih1 aHung, Wei-Song1 aHu, Chien-Chieh1 aLai, Juin-Yih0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Oct. 05, v. 439 p.129567-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1295673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245019200170300002400362500001500386520096900401592002801370650001101398650001701409650002101426650001001447650001701457650002501474650001501499650001401514650001501528650001301543650001701556650001901573653001701592700002001609700002001629700002301649700002501672700002701697700002901724773010401753856008801857990002301945852000901968655001201977IND60098513520221122132032.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009851352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.11.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonnez, J.,10aPregnancy and live birth after autotransplantation of frozen-thawed ovarian tissue in a patient with metastatic disease undergoing chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  ap. 1787.e1-1787.e4.  a2019-12-06  aOBJECTIVE: To report a live birth after orthotopic transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue.

The timing of breeding was estimated on the basis of the wing length of the largest young within the brood. The wing lengths were plotted against the date of the measurement to get a linear regression model characterizing the average developmental stage of broods in relation to date. This model was used when converting the measurements to correspond to the median date of all the measurements. Large-scale climatic phenomena were characterized by the winter and monthly indices of the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO). A significant positive relationship between the winter NAO index and timing of breeding in the Osprey, as indicated by the wing length of the largest young in the brood, was found. The relationship was even stronger when only the monthly value of January was considered. These relationships seemed to be linked with consequent earlier ice melting after mild winters. The results indicate prominent effects of large-scale climatic phenomena and that they can be monitored with relatively modest effort.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aPandion haliaetus 3abreeding 3acoasts 3aice 3amelting 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3awinter 3aFinland0 tJournal of ornithology.g2008 Apr., v. 149, no. 2 p.229-229dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-007-0264-83Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02232naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012800169500002200297520096300319592002801282650001801310650002501328650002501353650001001378650003501388650001201423650001601435650002101451653001801472653001701490653001201507653002401519653000901543700001801552700001701570700002801587700002301615773008201638856008101720852000901801655001201810IND60562658020221116213523.0170208s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056265802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2017.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchweizer, Ulrich10aStructural aspects of thyroid hormone binding to proteins and competitive interactions with natural and synthetic compounds  aPre-press version  aThyroid hormones and their metabolites constitute a vast class of related iodothyronine compounds that contribute to the regulation of metabolic activity and cell differentiation. They are in turn transported, transformed and recognized as signaling molecules through binding to a variety of proteins from a wide range of evolutionary unrelated protein families, which renders these proteins and their iodothyronine binding sites an example for extensive convergent evolution. In this review, we will briefly summarize what is known about iodothyronine binding sites in proteins, the modes of protein/iodothyronine interaction, and the ligand conformations. We will then discuss physiological and synthetic compounds, including popular drugs and food components, that can interfere with iodothyronine binding and recognition by these proteins. The discussion also includes compounds persisting in the environment and acting as endocrine disrupting chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3acell differentiation 3aconvergent evolution 3adrugs 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aligands 3ametabolites 3athyroid hormones 0aIodothyronine 0aBinding site 0aComplex 0aLigand conformation 0aDrug1 aTowell, Holly1 aVit, Allegra1 aRodriguez-Ruiz, Alfonso1 aSteegborn, Clemens0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2017.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001900169245007200188300001600260520105000276592002801326650001201354650001301366650001501379650001401394650001601408650001501424650001101439650001501450650001901465650001001484650001401494650002501508650001601533650001201549650003101561650003101592650003001623650007801653650005401731700001701785700001501802700002901817700002101846773008801867856008601955852000902041655001202050IND4466846920221119063349.0141110e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446684692DNAL7 a227055122pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGranados, M.R.10aEvaluation of flocculants for the recovery of freshwater microalgae  ap. 102-110.  aThe use flocculants on the recovery of freshwater microalgae is studied. Flocculants tested include metal salts, chitosan, and polyelectrolytes used in wastewater treatment processes. Influence of flocculant, but also the doses and biomass concentrations affecting biomass recovery as well as the concentration factor has been evaluated. Results showed that the use of metal salts or chitosan was not efficient, whereas polyelectrolytes allow the efficient recovery of biomass, at doses of 2–25mg per gram of microalgae biomass. The required doses depend on the particular polyelectrolyte and the freshwater strain present; but cationic polyelectrolytes are generally recommended. The use of polyelectrolytes does not adversely affect water reuse in the production process. The concentration factors obtained are higher than 35 in most cases. Such high concentration factors allow a reduction in the equipment size necessary for biomass dewatering, thus improving the viability of using these microorganisms in biofuel or wastewater processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3achitosan 3adewatering 3aequipment 3aflocculants 3afreshwater 3ametals 3amicroalgae 3amicroorganisms 3asalts 3aviability 3awastewater treatment 3awater reuse 2aBiomass 2aElectrolytesxpharmacology 2aFlocculationxdrug effects 2aFresh Waterxmicrobiology 2aMicroalgaexdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aThalidomidexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology.1 aAcién, F.G.1 aGomez, C.,1 aFernández-Sevilla, J.M.1 aMolina Grima, E.0 tBioresource technology.g2012 Aug., v. 118 p.102-110dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011800169520130700287592002801594650001401622650001201636650001301648650001701661650001501678650002101693650001601714650001001730650001401740650001601754650001401770650001401784650002501798653002801823653002701851653003501878653003201913653002201945700001901967700001901986700001902005700001802024773011402042856008602156852000902242655001202251IND60783415320221121065638.0220914e20221005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078341532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1295752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yingsheng10aHigh-performance pseudocapacitive removal of cadmium via synergistic valence conversion in perovskite-type FeMnO3  aCadmium pollution is a serious threat for the global drink water and natural environment. Herein, a poly-pyrrole coated dual-metal perovskite-type oxide FeMnO₃ (PFMO@PPy) was developed firstly as pseudocapacitive cathode for the reversible capture and release of cadmium ions by asymmetry pseudocapacitive deionization (APCDI) technology, extending the library of CDI electrodes. Our work highlighted several points: (i) PFMO@PPy achieved a maximum Cd-removal capacity of 144.6 mg g⁻¹, and maintained the retention rate of 93.4% after 15-cycle CDI process for up to 150 h, far beyond other previous work. (ii) PFMO@PPy showed the superior removal ratio (~90%) under different real water environments such as tap water, lake water and the groundwater. (iii) The superior Cd(II) electrosorption and desorption behavior is ascribed to the reversible synergistic valence conversion (Fe³⁺/Fe⁰ and Mn³⁺/Mn²⁺), which is confirmed by ex-situ XPS measurement and electrochemical tests. (iv) DFT calculations confirmed the synergistic effect from Mn and Fe elements in perovskite-type bimetallic oxide FeMnO₃. This study paves a new way for promising future applications of perovskite-type oxides containing dual Faradic redox-activity for wastewater treatment and environmental remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3acadmium 3acathodes 3adeionization 3adesorption 3aelectrochemistry 3agroundwater 3alakes 3apollution 3aremediation 3asynergism 3atap water 3awastewater treatment 0aCapacitive deionization 0aPerovskite-type oxides 0aSynergistic valence conversion 0aPseudocapacitance electrode 0aCadmium pollution1 aXiang, Shuhong1 aZhang, Xinyuan1 aZhou, Hongjian1 aZhang, Haimin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Oct. 05, v. 439 p.129575-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1295753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01814naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245010300198300001800301506007600319520042400395592002800819506003700847650001900884650002900903650002300932650002300955650001000978650001600988700001801004700002601022700002901048700002401077700002401101700002201125700002101147700002101168773010701189856007501296852000901371655001201380IND60578761720221207080012.0170814e20140919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057876172DNAL7 a10.1021/ol502227x2doi7 aPMC41687732pmcid7 a251888212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Zhenjian10aOxazinin A, a Pseudodimeric Natural Product of Mixed Biosynthetic Origin from a Filamentous Fungus  ap. 4774-4777.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA racemic, prenylated polyketide dimer, oxazinin A (1), was isolated from a novel filamentous fungus in the class Eurotiomycetes, and its structure was elucidated spectroscopically.

DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University hospital, department of obstetrics and gynecology. PATIENT(S): A 45-year-old woman with menorrhagia, pelvic mass, right-sided hydronephrosis, and unexplained weight loss. INTERVENTION(S): Cervical biopsies were suggestive of cervical endometriosis. Laparoscopy confirmed endometriosis. Associated pleural effusion, without cytologic signs of malignancy, was interpreted as caused by thoracic endometriosis. The patient had a transabdominal hysterectomy and unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Histopathologic examination confirmed endometriosis and revealed a residual tubo-ovarian abscess. After surgery, the patient developed spontaneous seropneumothorax. Pleural biopsies revealed a well-differentiated epithelial malignant pleural mesothelioma. The patient underwent hypofractionated radiation of drain sites. She is now observed in our outpatient clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Steps to the correct diagnosis. RESULT(S): The patient had an association of cervical and pelvic endometriosis, residual tubo-ovarian abscess, and malignant pleural mesothelioma. CONCLUSION(S): Usually, the simplest diagnosis explaining a complex of symptoms and clinical and diagnostic findings is the one most likely to be correct. This is an application of Occam’s razor to medicine. Our case illustrates that occasionally the simplest and therefore most probable diagnosis can be wrong, and on these occasions one should consider a “third man.”  aPublisher supplied data 3aabscess 3aanimal ovaries 3acase studies 3ahistopathology 3ahysterectomy 3alaparoscopy 3amedicine 3amesothelioma 3apatients 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3aweight loss 3awomen1 aHeuer, Stefan1 aSegerer, Sabine1 aRauthe, Stephan1 aDietl, Johannes1 aHönig, Arnd0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Apr., v. 95, no. 5 p.1787.e5-1787.e7dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.11.0643Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013200165300001600297520204400313592002802357650001502385650002302400650001002423650001602433650001602449650001602465650001502481650001202496650001502508650001902523650001902542650001002561650001402571650001402585650002902599700001202628700002002640700002102660700001502681773010902696856008102805852000902886655001202895IND60439185320221119192558.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043918532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-015-1166-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jianqiang10aRoles of phenotypic and genetic characteristics in the social mating pattern of Silver-throated Tits (Aegithalos glaucogularis)  ap. 687-697.  aChoice of mating partners may affect fitness. Both phenotypic and genetic traits have been shown to play roles in the mating processes of animals. We investigated the roles of phenotypic and genetic characteristics in the patterns of social mating in the Silver-throated Tit (Aegithalos glaucogularis), a sexually monochromatic species that exhibits sexual size dimorphism, rarely sings, does not occupy territories, and has a relative low level of extrapair paternity. To explore the role of phenotype traits, we tested for assortative mating based on the sizes of seven morphological traits. To explore the role of genetic traits, we tested for assortative mating with respect to genetic heterozygosity (the heterozygous mate hypothesis) and whether birds mated with genetically dissimilar individuals (the compatible mate hypothesis). We found significant correlations between paired individuals for bill length and body length, indicating possible assortative mating based on these two traits. In contrast, genetic heterozygosity was not correlated between paired individuals, and the mean relatedness of the mates was not significantly different from that of randomly mated individuals, which do not support the idea that Silver-throated Tits assortatively mate with heterozygous individuals or choose genetically dissimilar mates. Also, individual heterozygosity was not reflected in the measured morphological traits, as no correlation was detected. Neither the individual heterozygosity nor the relatedness between mates was correlated with reproductive performance measures, including clutch size, brood size, and number of fledglings. However, we found that clutch size increased with female body length, which could explain the benefit to males of mating with larger females. Taken together, while our current data failed to provide evidence for an effect of genetic characteristics on the social mating pattern of Silver-throated Tits, the results suggest that phenotypic traits are likely associated with their mating pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegithalos 3aassortative mating 3abirds 3abody length 3aclutch size 3acorrelation 3adimorphism 3afemales 3afledglings 3agenetic traits 3aheterozygosity 3amales 3apaternity 3aphenotype 3areproductive performance1 aLv, Lei1 aWang, Pengcheng1 aZhang, Zhengwang1 aWang, Yong0 tJournal of ornithology.g2015 July, v. 156, no. 3 p.687-697dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-015-1166-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245011000206300001600316520177600332592002802108650002502136650001002161650002502171650002102196650001802217650000902235650001102244650002002255650001302275650002002288650002102308650002802329650001202357650001702369650004102386650001602427650000902443700006402452700006602516700005702582700001602639700006002655700006202715773012802777856008302905852000902988655001202997IND60774593720221117030154.0220421e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077459372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-022-05304-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManh Tuong, Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0214-775710aStenotrophomonas sp. SRS1 promotes growth of Arabidopsis and tomato plants under salt stress conditions  ap. 547-571.  aAIMS: Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) support plant growth by alleviating plant stresses, among which those triggered by saline soils. We isolated Stenotrophomonas sp. SRS1 from salt-resistant Carex distans (distant sedge) roots to understand how this growth promotion was enabled and whether an active contribution of the bacteria and/or plant was required. METHODS: Various growth assays were used to analyze the effect of bacterial inoculation on Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum (cherry tomato MicroTom) growth. Furthermore, droplet microfluidics, bacterial genome mining, and bacterial and plant gene expression analysis combined with plant mutant analysis were used for in-depth analysis. RESULTS: SRS1 application enhanced plant growth in both saline and nonsaline environments. The fresh weight of SRS1-inoculated plants was higher than that of noninoculated plants, whereas the fresh weight ratio between SRS1-inoculated and noninoculated plants differed whether the plants were grown on agar plates, white sand or in soil. We demonstrated that the strain grew well in high salt-containing media and that, besides plant-growth-promotion-related genes, the bacterium contained various active stress genes. Interestingly, inoculation with the strain increased the induction of plant genes related to abscisic acid and auxin signaling pathways under saline conditions. CONCLUSIONS: SRS1 inoculation promoted the growth of Arabidopsis and MicroTom tomato under saline and nonsaline conditions, also when the plants were grown in white sand and potting soil. Overall, genetic traits related to stress alleviation, derived from both the bacteria and the plants, play a crucial role in the impact of this novel PGPR strain on plant performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCarex 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aStenotrophomonas 3aabscisic acid 3aagar 3aauxins 3acherry tomatoes 3adroplets 3agene expression 3agrowth promotion 3amicrofluidic technology 3amutants 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3asalt stress 3asand1 aGarcia Mendez, Sonia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1140-92371 aVandecasteele, Michiel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7486-77481 aWillems, Anne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8421-28811 aLuo, Dexian1 aBeirinckx, Stien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4830-32251 aGoormachtig, Sofie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6195-98890 tPlant and soil.g2022 Apr., v. 473, no. 1-2 p.547-571dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05304-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03963naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245019200161300001600353520177100369592002802140650002102168650002702189650002302216650002102239650001602260650002202276650001302298650002002311650001002331650001202341650001702353650002102370650003002391650001202421650002602433650002202459650001802481650002202499650002102521650002102542650001002563650002402573650002602597650001302623650002102636650004302657650001202700650001402712650002502726650001802751650001102769650002902780653005102809653003802860653001702898653002002915653002102935700001302956700001902969700001902988700001503007700001603022773011203038856008203150852000903232655001203241IND60629814220221121183517.0191227e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062981422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2019.01.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Susu10aMolecular cloning of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor-like (pIgRL) in flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) and its expression in response to immunization with inactivated Vibrio anguillarum  ap. 524-533.  aIn the present work, the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor-like (pIgRL) from flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) was firstly cloned and identified. The full length cDNA of flounder pIgRL was of 1393 bp including an open reading frame of 1053 bp, and the deduced pIgRL sequence encoded 350 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 39 kDa. There were two immunoglobulin-like domains in flounder pIgRL. In healthy flounder, the transcriptional level of pIgRL was detected in different tissues by real-time PCR, showing the highest level in the skin and gills, and higher levels in the spleen and hindgut. After flounders were vaccinated with inactivated Vibrio anguillarum via intraperitoneal injection and immersion, the pIgRL mRNA level increased firstly and then declined in all tested tissues during 48 h, and the maximum expression levels in the gills, skin, spleen and hindgut in immersion group, or in the spleen, head kidney, skin and gills in injection group, were higher than in other tested tissues. In addition, recombinant protein of the extracellular region of flounder pIgRL was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and rabbit anti-pIgRL polyclonal antibodies were prepared, which specifically reacted with the recombinant pIgRL, and a 39 kDa protein confirmed as natural pIgRL by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in skin mucus of flounder. Co-immunoprecipitation assay and western-blotting demonstrated that the pIgRL, together with IgM, could be immunoprecipitated by anti-pIgRL antibody in gut, skin and gill mucus of flounder, suggesting the existence of pIgRL-IgM complexes. These results indicated that the flounder pIgRL was probably involved in the mucosal IgM transportation and played important roles in mucosal immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aWestern blotting 3aamino acids 3acomplementary DNA 3aflounder 3agene expression 3agills 3ahindgut 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aintraperitoneal injection 3akidneys 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3amolecular weight 3amucosal immunity 3amucus 3aopen reading frames 3apolyclonal antibodies 3apolymers 3aprecipitin tests 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arabbits 3areceptors 3arecombinant proteins 3askin (animal) 3aspleen 3atranscription (genetics) 0aPolymeric immunoglobulin receptor-like (pIgRL) 0aFlounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) 0aGene cloning 0aImmune response 0aMucosal immunity1 aDu, Yang1 aSheng, Xiuzhen1 aTang, Xiaoqian1 aXing, Jing1 aZhan, Webin0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Apr., v. 87 p.524-533dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.01.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011200165300001600277520151800293592002801811650001101839650001301850650001201863650002001875650001601895650001401911650001201925650001301937650001301950650001101963650001101974650002201985650001702007650001102024650001402035650000902049650001402058650001402072650001102086650001002097650000902107650002002116650001002136650001202146650001402158650000902172651001002181700001102191700001302202700001502215700001402230700001202244700001502256700001602271700001802287773012502305856008102430852000902511655001202520IND60515202120221119030911.0160312e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051520212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00244-016-0266-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Mengqin10aGrain Size Distribution and Health Risk Assessment of Metals in Outdoor Dust in Chengdu, Southwestern China  ap. 534-543.  aA total of 27 outdoor dust samples from roads, parks, and high spots were collected and analyzed to investigate the contamination of 11 metals (Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sr, Cd, Sb, and Pb) in Chengdu, China. The results showed that the samples from the high spots exhibited the highest heavy metal level compared with those from the roads and the parks, except for Ni, Cu, and Pb. The dust was classified into five grain size fractions. The mean loads of each grain size fraction of 11 determined metals displayed similar distribution, and the contribution of median size (63–125, 125–250, 250–500 μm) fractions accounted for more than 70 % of overall heavy metal loads. The health risk posed by the determined metals to human via dust ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation was investigated. Oral and respiratory bioaccessible parts of the metals in dust were extracted using simulated stomach solution and composite lung serum. The mean bioaccessibilities of 11 investigated metals in the gastric solution were much higher than those in the composite lung serum, especially Zn, Cd, and Pb. Ingestion was the most important exposure pathway with percentage greater than 70 % for both children and adults. Risk evaluation results illustrated that children in Chengdu might suffer noncarcinogenic risk when exposed to outdoor dust. Given that the cancer risk values of Pb and Cr larger than 1 × 10⁻⁴, potential carcinogenic risk might occur for Chengdu residents through outdoor dust intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3abioavailability 3ablood serum 3abreathing 3acadmium 3achildren 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aexposure pathways 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3aingestion 3alead 3amanganese 3aneoplasms 3anickel 3aparks 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aroads 3astomach 3astrontium 3azinc 3aChina1 aPi, Lu1 aLuo, Yan1 aGeng, Meng1 aHu, Wenli1 aLi, Zhi1 aSu, Shijun1 aGan, Zhiwei1 aDing, Sanglan0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2016 Apr., v. 70, no. 3 p.534-543dSpringer USx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-016-0266-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002700154245005000181300002500231520158200256592002801838650003901866650001701905650001101922650001001933650001401943650001401957650001301971650001301984650001401997650001602011650001002027700002102037700002102058700002602079700002102105773010502126856008802231990002302319852000902342655001202351IND60098513920221122101918.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009851392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.10.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaschingbauer, Florian10aTreatment of heterotopic cervical pregnancies  ap. 1787.e9-1787.e13.  aOBJECTIVE: To describe a rare case of a heterotopic pregnancy with a gestational sac in the cervix and one in the uterine cavity, managed successfully with subsequent delivery of a healthy newborn. DESIGN: Case report and review of the literature. SETTING: Tertiary university hospital. PATIENT(S): A woman with heterotopic twin gestation after stimulation treatment at 9 weeks gestation. Transvaginal ultrasound scan revealed two gestational sacs containing two viable fetuses: one sac inside the uterine cavity and the other sac in the uterine cervix. INTERVENTION(S): Selective termination of the cervical pregnancy by curettage under sonographic guidance in combination with cervical cerclage. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Intrauterine pregnancy preservation; maternal morbidity and mortality. RESULT(S): The termination of the cervical pregnancy was performed successfully without intraprocedural or postprocedural complications with preservation of the patient’s fertility. The intrauterine pregnancy progressed uneventfully through 39½ weeks with delivery of a healthy newborn. CONCLUSION(S): Combined intrauterine and cervical pregnancy is a remote but possible event, particularly after assisted reproductive technology procedures with a high rate of maternal morbidity. Other factors such as concomitant intrauterine pregnancy and the patient’s infertility history generally would be secondary concerns. In this case, we were able to terminate the cervical pregnancy selectively, while preserving the intrauterine one, allowing this couple to have a healthy newborn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3acase studies 3acervix 3afetus 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aneonates 3apatients 3apregnancy 3aultrasonics 3awomen1 aMueller, Andreas1 aVoigt, Franziska1 aBeckmann, Matthias W.1 aGoecke, Tamme W.0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Apr., v. 95, no. 5 p.1787.e9-1787.e13dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.10.0433Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03820naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012300162300001400285520235300299592002802652650002002680650002602700650002802726650000902754650002302763650001302786650001302799650002902812650002102841650001502862650002202877650001402899650003902913650001802952650001302970650000902983650001602992650002103008650001503029650001803044651001503062700001803077700001603095700001503111700001603126773010303142856004803245852000903293655001203302IND50062078520221118130520.0130321e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006207852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-012-0585-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Yong10aMolecular weight-dependent electron transfer capacities of dissolved organic matter derived from sewage sludge compost  ap. 56-63.  aPURPOSE: Dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been shown to be an efficient electron transfer facilitator in biogeochemical reactions due to its ability to mediate redox reactions. It has been known that various fractions of DOM differed in their chemical and biogeochemical behaviors in environment. However, there has been relatively little work directed at predicting the dependence of redox properties of DOM on its fractions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DOM was extracted from sewage sludge compost. Freeze-dried DOM was grouped into three fractions of different molecular sizes (<3,500, 3,500–14,000, and >14,000 Da) using dialysis bags (Spectra/Por 3 and 4, Spectrum Industries, California, US). Cycle voltammetry was used to investigate the redox behavior of the fractions. Chronoamperometry was employed to study their electron accepting capacities and electron donating capacities by applying fixed positive or negative potential to the working electrode in a conventional three-electrode cell. Fourier-transform infrared and three-dimensional excitation/emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopies were used to determine the functional groups in the fractions. Shewanella putrefaciens 200 (SP200) and Klebsiella pneumoniae L17 (L17) were used for all microbial iron(III) reduction experiments. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Electrochemical methods show that the electron transfer capacity (ETC) of DOM depends on its molecular weight, and ETC is in the order of high-molecular weight DOM (H-DOM) > moderate-molecular weight DOM > low-molecular weight DOM. The same trend is discovered in the DOM-stimulated iron(III) oxide bioreduction where DOM fractions act as electron shuttles transferring electrons from the Fe(III)-reducing bacteria to the iron oxide. Both spectroscopic and cyclic voltammogram assays show the highest abundance of redox moieties associated to H-DOM, which is possibly responsible for its strongest electron-shuttling ability. CONCLUSIONS: DOM has a wide molecular weight (MW) distribution due to the complexity of its chemical composition and structure. In addition to structural variations, DOM fractions with different MW have different redox properties and electron-shuttling capacities in microbial Fe(III) reduction. The results are of great significance for further studies on DOM geochemical behavior in environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGallionellaceae 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aShewanella putrefaciens 3abags 3achemical structure 3acomposts 3adialysis 3adissolved organic matter 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afreeze drying 3aindustry 3airon 3airon oxides 3amolecular weight 3aprediction 3asewage sludge 3aCalifornia1 aZhou, Shungui1 aTian, Yuan,1 aZhuang, Li1 aLi, Fangbai0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2013 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.56-63dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-012-0585-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012600168300001400294520073600308592002801044650001701072650001801089650001401107650001001121650002201131650001301153650001401166650001301180650002401193653000801217653000901225653002201234653003301256653001701289653000901306700003701315700002101352700001801373773010401391856008101495852000901576655001201585IND60562658420221116213329.0170709e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056265842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2017.01.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornez, Isabelle10aJAK/STAT disruption induces immuno-deficiency: Rationale for the development of JAK inhibitors as immunosuppressive drugs  ap. 88-96.  aCytokines are mediating immune cells responses through the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Being critical for immune cells, a defective JAK/STAT signaling leads to various immune disorders, such as immunodeficiency. In contrast, hyperactivation of JAK/STAT signaling is linked to autoimmunity and cancer. Targeting the JAK/STAT proteins by small protein inhibitors impedes immune cell function by uncoupling cells from cytokine effects and by interfering with functional immune cell hallmarks, such as cell migration. This review will explore immune syndromes driven by JAK/STAT deregulation and discuss the emerging role of JAK inhibitors as immunosuppressive drugs used in autoimmunity and transplantation medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoimmunity 3acell movement 3acytokines 3adrugs 3aimmunosuppression 3amedicine 3aneoplasms 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 0aJAK 0aSTAT 0aImmunosuppression 0aMyeloproliferative neoplasia 0aAutoimmunity 0aGVHD1 aYajnanarayana, Sowmya Parampalli1 aWolf, Anna Maria1 aWolf, Dominik0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 451 p.88-96dElsevier B.V.x0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2017.01.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006200167300001600229520131300245592002801558650001501586650004101601650003501642650001801677650001501695650001801710650001601728650002001744650001601764650001601780650002801796650001601824650002301840650001201863653002001875653002401895653003501919653004101954653002601995653003002021653001802051653002002069653002202089653001602111653002002127653002602147700002602173773011202199856008202311852000902393655001202402IND60629814320221121110948.0191227e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062981432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2019.01.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahle, Maria K.10aAntiviral defense in salmonids – Mission made possible?  ap. 421-437.  aViral diseases represent one of the major threats for salmonid aquaculture. Survival from viral infections are highly dependent on host innate antiviral immune defense, where interferons are of crucial importance. Neutralizing antibodies and T cell effector mechanisms mediate long-term antiviral protection. Despite an immune cell repertoire comparable to higher vertebrates, farmed fish often fail to mount optimal antiviral protection. In the quest to multiply and spread, viruses utilize a variety of strategies to evade or escape the host immune system. Understanding the specific interplay between viruses and host immunity at depth is crucial for developing successful vaccination and treatment strategies in mammals. However, this knowledge base is still limited for pathogenic fish viruses. Here, we have focused on five RNA viruses with major impact on salmonid aquaculture: Salmonid alphavirus, Infectious salmon anemia virus, Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, Piscine orthoreovirus and Piscine myocarditis virus. This review explore the protective immune responses that salmonids mount to these viruses and the existing knowledge on how the viruses counteract and/or bypass the immune response, including their IFN antagonizing effects and their mechanisms to establish persisting infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlphavirus 3aInfectious pancreatic necrosis virus 3aInfectious salmon anemia virus 3aOrthoreovirus 3aSalmonidae 3aT-lymphocytes 3afarmed fish 3aimmune response 3ainterferons 3amyocarditis 3aneutralizing antibodies 3avaccination 3avertebrate viruses 3aviruses 0aAtlantic salmon 0aSalmonid alphavirus 0aInfectious salmon anemia virus 0aInfectious pancreatic necrosis virus 0aPiscine orthoreovirus 0aPiscine myocarditis virus 0afish immunity 0aInnate immunity 0aadaptive immunity 0aPersistence 0aVirus infection 0aInterferon antagonism1 aJørgensen, Jorunn B.0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Apr., v. 87 p.421-437dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.01.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01495naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245012000164300001800284520042900302592002800731650001400759650002300773650002300796650002300819650001200842650001300854650001100867650001400878650002100892700002000913700002100933773010700954856007501061852000901136655001201145IND60578761920221116212837.0170814e20140919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057876192DNAL7 a10.1021/ol502244g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNallagonda, Rajender10aSynthesis of Functionalized Indoles via Palladium-Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Cycloisomerization of o-Allylanilines  ap. 4786-4789.  aAn efficient strategy for the synthesis of 3-substituted 2-benzylindoles from stable and readily available o-allylanilines, prepared from anilines and allyl alcohols, has been developed.

Much research has been done on cereal-pigeon pea intercropping on research stations, comparing yields in intercrops with sole maize. However, the role of inorganic fertilizers in sustainably intensifying intercropping systems has not been optimalised in all cases. For example in a recent study “Sustainable Intensification with Cereal-Legume Intercropping in Eastern and Southern Africa” published in Sustainability 2019, 11, 2891; https://doi.org/10.3390/su11102891, also the effect of inorganic fertilizers were studied. But usually these studies did not pay attention on the relation with water supply.Data in this article presents rainfall variability in the season and between seasons, yield of maize (Zea mays cv. TMV1) and pigeon-pea (Cajanus cajan cv. Babati White) under sole crop and intercropping. Yield of maize and pigeon-pea is analyzed under inter-row rainwater harvesting practices and fertilizer application in the field. Sole cropping and intercropping biological and/or economic yield are used to determine land use efficiency through land equivalent ratio. Comparisons between sites and seasons are done using a T-test.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCajanus cajan 3aZea mays 3acorn 3afertilizer application 3aintercropping 3aland use 3apeas 3arain 3asoil water 3asole cropping 3at-test 3aSouthern Africa 3aTanzania1 aAsch, Folkard1 aKimaro, Anthony A.1 aGermer, Jorn1 aKahimba, F.

However, very little is known about the species that live in the topsoil of forests and their potential role in reducing the natural regeneration of tree species, particularly of forest trees that produce abundant fruit only once every few years. To enhance our understanding of the species that inhabit the topsoil, we studied the diversity and pathogenicity of Cylindrocarpon‐like fungi inhabiting the litter in old‐growth mixed‐beech forests in the Carpathians (Poland) and in the Alps (Austria), and in a managed beech stand in the Krakowsko‐Częstochowska Highland (Poland). The fungi inhabiting the beech litter were investigated using beechnuts and pine seedlings as bait. Isolates were identified based on morphology and DNA sequencing. The pathogenicity of the most common species was investigated by inoculating beech germinants. A wide range of Cylindrocarpon‐like fungi were associated with the beech litter: 718 cultures representing 12 species were isolated. Five taxa were identified down to species level: namely Ilyonectria crassa, I. pseudodestructans, I. rufa, Neonectria candida and N. obtusispora, and seven species were identified to genus level (Neonectria or Ilyonectria species). Ilyonectria destructans, which is considered to be the sexual morph of ‘Cylindrocarpon destructans’, was not found. There were qualitative and quantitative differences between the different forest sites in terms of Neonectria and Ilyonectria species composition in beech litter. The isolation frequency and species richness of Cylindrocarpon‐like fungi were greatest in beech litter taken from old‐growth mixed‐beech forests. Neonectria and Ilyonectria species were capable of killing beech germinants, suggesting that they may play a negative role in natural beech regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aNeonectria 3abaits 3aforest trees 3afungi 3ahosts 3anatural regeneration 3aold-growth forests 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogens 3aseedlings 3asequence analysis 3aspecies diversity 3atopsoil 3aAustria 3aCentral European region 3aPoland1 aStępniewska, H.1 aSzwagrzyk, J.1 aBilański, P.1 aGratzer, G.0 tForest pathology.g2016 Dec., v. 46, no. 6 p.582-594dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60333x1437-47817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/efp.122753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245013900201300001800340520113300358592002801491650001601519650002201535650003701557650001501594650002401609650001101633650001401644650002101658650002501679650002001704650001701724650001901741650001201760650001701772650000801789650001601797650003701813700002001850700001901870700005701889700002201946700002101968700006101989700002202050773017102072856008002243852000902323655001202332IND60600968020221120173902.0180705e20170628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060096802DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b015982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Lidan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8843-854610aHighly Active and Stable Pt–Sn/SBA-15 Catalyst Prepared by Direct Reduction for Ethylbenzene Dehydrogenation: Effects of Sn Addition  ap. 7160-7172.  aA series of Pt–Sn/SBA-15 catalysts (Sn/Pt nominal ratios: 0–3) prepared by direct reduction were applied to ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to styrene. The characterization by X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption fine structure, CO adsorption, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the formation of highly dispersed and stable Pt–Sn alloy particles [PtₓSny (x/y ≥ 3) and Pt–Sn alloys having Sn-rich surfaces] on SBA-15. Nonalloyed Sn existed as highly dispersed SnO₂. 1Pt–1Sn/SBA-15 (Sn/Pt nominal ratio = 1) exhibited the highest activity, on which Pt₃Sn alloy nanoparticles were mainly formed. In contrast, PtSn alloy was dominant on Pt–Sn/SBA-15 catalysts whose Sn/Pt nominal ratios were larger than 1, and the activity was decreased. Furthermore, 1Pt–1Sn/SBA-15 exhibited a higher stability than Pt/SBA-15 and 1Pt–1Sn/SiO₂. The addition of Sn not only inhibits C–C bond cleavage and improves selectivity toward styrene but also enhances the “drain-off” effect, allowing coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to SBA-15 with large surface area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aalloy nanoparticles 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3acleavage (chemistry) 3adehydrogenation 3aethylbenzene 3aprocess design 3astyrene 3asurface area 3atin 3atin dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aArakawa, Takuto1 aOhkubo, Tomoyo1 aMiura, Hiroki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2488-44321 aShishido, Tetsuya1 aHosokawa, Saburo1 aTeramura, Kentaro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2916-45971 aTanaka, Tsunehiro0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 June 28, v. 56, no. 25 p.7160-7172dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b015983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04276naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245014100203300001600344520177900360592002802139650002502167650002402192650002502216650001002241650001602251650001702267650000902284650001602293650002002309650001402329650002002343650003602363650001902399650001902418650002202437650001802459650001802477650001202495650001002507650001302517650003702530650002002567650001402587650002102601650001802622650001702640650003602657650003202693653001802725653002002743653001702763653001802780653002502798653001802823653000902841653001102850653000902861653001202870653001502882653001102897653001002908653001002918653000902928653000902937653000702946653000802953653001102961653000902972653000802981653000902989653000902998653001203007653000803019653001203027653000803039653000903047653001003056653000703066700004203073700002003115773011203135856008203247852000903329655001203338IND60629814420221121110904.0191227e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062981442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2019.01.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBilen, Soner1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9459-817810aTherapeutic effects of beard lichen, Usnea barbata extract against Lactococcus garvieae infection in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  ap. 401-409.  aIn this study, therapeutic effects of aqueous methanolic extracts of beard lichen (Usnea barbata) against Lactococcus garvieae (ATCC 43921) in rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss) were investigated. Six different experimental groups [0 mg/100 μL (Control), 4 mg/100 μL, 8 mg/100 μL, 12 mg/100 μL, 6 mg/100 μL florfenicol (positive control), 6 mg/100 μL erythromycin (positive control)] were set up to determine effects of lichen extract on immune responses and survival rate. In the study, superoxide radical production was increased in fish treated with 12 mg beard lichen extract, florfenicol and erythromycin compared to that of control (P < 0.05). Lysozyme activity was generally decreased (P < 0.05) or no differences were observed in all experimental groups compared to that of control (P > 0.05). Myeloperoxidase was significantly increased in all antibiotic treated groups. No differences were observed in liver histology of experimental groups compared to control. Cytokine gene expressions were elevated in all experimental groups compared to that of control (P < 0.05), except IL-1β expression at 10th day sampling time. Other immune related genes (IL-8, TGF- β, IL-12 Beta, TNFα1, IL-10, COX-2, IL-6, TLR5, C3, IGM, MHC-II, iNOS, IgT, IFN1, IFN2, IFN reg) were also elevated in all experimental groups compared to that of control group. The survival rates obtained in 4 mg beard lichen treated group, 8 mg beard lichen treated group and erythromycin treated group were 73.08, 65.38 and 80.77% respectively. Our results suggest that beard lichen methanolic extract could be an effective therapeutic agent to be used against L. garvieae infection in rainbow trout at the dose of 4 mg/17.41 ± 0.3 g body weight/day.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus garvieae 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aToll-like receptor 5 3aUsnea 3abody weight 3aerythromycin 3afish 3aflorfenicol 3agene expression 3ahistology 3aimmune response 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3alichens 3aliver 3alysozyme 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amyeloperoxidase 3ashellfish 3asuperoxide anion 3asurvival rate 3atherapeutics 3atransforming growth factor beta 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aRainbow trout 0aImmune response 0aBread lichen 0aSurvival rate 0aLactococcus garvieae 0aUsnea barbata 0aATCC 0aIL-1β 0aIL-8 0aTGF- β 0aIL-12 Beta 0aTNFα1 0aIL-10 0aCOX-2 0aIL-6 0aTLR5 0aC3 0aIGM 0aMHC-II 0aiNOS 0aIgT 0aIFN1 0aIFN2 0aIFN reg 0aROS 0aqRT-PCR 0aMPO 0aFlor 0aEryth 0aBL1 aSirtiyah, Abdulwahid Mohammed Almahdi1 aTerzi, Ertugrul0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Apr., v. 87 p.401-409dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.01.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01676naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001900187245011600206300001300322506007600335520048100411592002800892506003700920650002000957650001000977650002300987650001301010700002201023700002301045700002401068700002701092773010601119856008001225852000901305655001201314IND60119389220221207114529.0141214e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011938922DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-4-r442doi7 aPMC26889352pmcid7 a193930852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Reuben10aChoosing the right path: enhancement of biologically relevant sets of genes or proteins using pathway structure  ap. 2194.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA method is proposed that finds enriched pathways relevant to a studied condition using the measured molecular data and also the structural information of the pathway viewed as a network of nodes and edges.

We report behaviour, vocalizations, morphology, and genetic data for this bird. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences revealed that the hybrid had a great snipe mother and a common snipe father. The hybrid was intermediate in most measured morphometric traits and showed some intermediate plumage characteristics. The behaviour was similar to that of a great snipe—it displayed and vocalised at a great snipe lek for more than a week. The song was somewhat reminiscent of a great snipe's, but lacked the frequency-modulated whistles that are part of the great snipe song, consisting of more rapid click notes of a narrower frequency spectrum. This is the only putative hybrid that we have found among the more than 4,400 adult individuals we have examined between 1986 and 2014 at great snipe leks in Norway, Sweden, Poland, and Estonia. Common snipes invariably occur near these sites. Reports on putative hybrids among snipe species are very rare, and we question the validity of previous claims. This is the first where the parental origins—and, indeed, the hybrid status—have been unequivocally determined. We speculate on how a great snipe female, known for being extremely choosy about mating, came to mate with a common snipe male. We also note that, although perhaps behaviourally more likely, physical constraints on chick development (caused by the smaller egg size of the common snipe and larger body size of the great snipe) might prevent any successful male great snipe × female common snipe hybridisation—a possible example of an unidirectional post-zygotic barrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGallinago media 3ahybrids 3amorphometry 3aDNA 3amales 3amountains 3aeggs 3anuclear genome 3aadults 3abody size 3anucleotide sequences 3avocalization 3achicks 3aplumage 3afemales 3aNorway 3aSweden 3aEstonia 3aPoland 0abirds1 aSæther, Stein Are1 aFiske, Peder1 aWheatcroft, David1 aKålås, John Atle,0 tJournal of ornithology.g2015 July, v. 156, no. 3 p.819-827dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-015-1154-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245017800171300001600349520130700365592002801672650002501700650002001725650002601745650001201771650001201783650001901795650001201814650001301826650001301839650002701852650001601879650001701895650001801912650001801930650000901948650000901957650001401966650001101980650001901991650001402010650001402024650001202038650001102050650000902061650002502070650000902095651001202104651001302116700001902129700002502148700002602173700003102199773012502230856008102355852000902436655001202445IND60515202420221119030927.0160312e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051520242DNAL7 a10.1007/s00244-015-0198-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZemanová, Veronika10aResponses to Cd Stress in Two Noccaea Species (Noccaea praecox and Noccaea caerulescens) Originating from Two Contaminated Sites in Mežica, Slovenia and Redlschlag, Austria  ap. 464-474.  aThe two Noccaea species—Noccaea praecox originating from Mežica, Slovenia (Me) (Pb, Zn, Cd pollution) and Noccaea caerulescens from Redlschlag, Austria (Re) (high levels of Ni, Cr, Mg)—were studied to compare Cd accumulation and tolerance. After 120 days of plant cultivation in Cd-contaminated soil (90 mg Cd kg⁻¹ soil), gas-exchange parameters (e.g. net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, and intercellular CO₂ concentration), fatty acids, and selected macro- and microelements were determined in addition to N utilization by plants. The comparison between ecotypes showed that Cd stress resulted in similar changes in gas-exchange parameters. Contrasting responses of plants to Cd contamination were confirmed by the macro- and microelement contents and fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. Significantly higher accumulations of Cd and strong decreases in the levels of K, Ca, Na, and Fe were observed in the Me plants in contrast to the Re plants. The higher Re plant ability to take in some cations is a result of selective pressure due to contamination. Different ion uptake by plants affected the activities of metalloenzymes. Significant increases in the glutamic acid/proline ratio resulted from higher adaption of the Me in contrast to the Re plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNoccaea caerulescens 3aNoccaea praecox 3aamino acid metabolism 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acations 3achromium 3aecotypes 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3agas exchange 3aglutamic acid 3aion transport 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3anickel 3aphotosynthesis 3apollution 3apotassium 3aproline 3asodium 3asoil 3astomatal conductance 3azinc 3aAustria 3aSlovenia1 aPavlík, Milan1 aPavlíková, Daniela1 aHnilička, František1 aVondráčková, Stanislava0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2016 Apr., v. 70, no. 3 p.464-474dSpringer USx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-015-0198-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245015200171300002600323520127100349592002801620650001901648650001701667650002901684650001401713650001101727650002001738650001501758650001801773650001701791650001301808650001101821650001001832700002201842700002301864700002301887700001701910700001901927700002101946700002301967773010601990856008802096990002302184852000902207655001202216IND60098514220221121220647.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009851422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.11.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeki, Atsuko12aA subserosal uterus-like mass presenting after a sliding hernia of the ovary and endometriosis: a rare entity with a discussion of the histogenesis  ap. 1788.e15-1788.e19.  aOBJECTIVE: To report the first case of a subserosal uterus-like mass. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: A community-based hospital. PATIENT(S): A 44-year-old nulliparous woman who complained of a left inguinal mass had a medical history that was notable for two features. One was left oophorectomy for a sliding hernia at 10 months of age; the other was endometriosis at the oophorectomy site at 26 years of age. INTERVENTION(S): Tumorectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Not applicable. RESULT(S): Pathologic examination demonstrated that this subserosal mass mimicked a miniature uterus with a leiomyomatous lesion. CONCLUSION(S): As of September 2010, 23 cases of uterus-like mass had been reported. Three pathologic theories of uterus-like mass have been proposed: [1] congenital anomaly theory, [2] metaplasia theory, and [3] heterotopia. The pathogenesis of this rare entity is currently under debate. Most uterus-like masses have been connected to the genital organs (75.0%) and associated with endometriosis (50.0%). In the present case, the uterus-like mass developed at the surgical scar site of oophorectomy for a sliding hernia and a tumorectomy for endometriosis. We review the literature and discuss the theories regarding the histogenesis of uterus-like mass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3acase studies 3acongenital abnormalities 3agenitalia 3ahernia 3amedical history 3ametaplasia 3amorphogenesis 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3auterus 3awomen1 aMaeshima, Arafumi1 aNakagawa Hiroyuki,1 aShiraishi, Junichi1 aMurata, Yuya1 aArai, Hiroharu1 aKubochi, Kiyoshi1 aKuramochi, Shigeru0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Apr., v. 95, no. 5 p.1788.e15-1788.e19dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.11.0513Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013400160300001600294500002000310500001500330520201600345592002802361650001602389650002202405650001202427650001902439650001802458650001502476650001002491651001202501651001802513653002302531773010502554856007402659852000902733655001202742IND60522643720221119145453.0160603e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052264372DNAL7 a10.1111/syen.121732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker, Joseph,10aEmergence of a superradiation: pselaphine rove beetles in mid‐Cretaceous amber from Myanmar and their evolutionary implications  ap. 541-566.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aPselaphinae is an exceptionally species‐rich, globally distributed subfamily of minute rove beetles (Staphylinidae), many of which are inquilines of social insects. Deducing the factors that drove pselaphine diversification and their evolutionary predisposition to inquilinism requires a reliable timescale of pselaphine cladogenesis. Pselaphinae is split into a small and highly plesiomorphic supertribe, Faronitae, and its sister group, the ‘higher Pselaphinae’ – a vast multi‐tribe clade with a more derived morphological ground plan, and which includes all known instances of inquilinism. The higher Pselaphinae is dominated by tribes with a Gondwanan taxonomic bias. However, a minority of tribes are limited to the Nearctic and Palearctic ecozones, implying a potentially older, Pangaean origin of the higher Pselaphinae as a whole. Here, I describe fossils from mid‐Cretaceous (∼99 million years old) Burmese amber that confirm the existence of crown‐group higher pselaphines on the Eurasian supercontinent prior to contact with Gondwanan landmasses. Protrichonyx rafifrons gen. et sp.n. is placed incertae sedis within the higher Pselaphinae. Boreotethys gen.n., erected for B. grimaldii sp.n. and B. arctopteryx sp.n., represents an extinct sister taxon and putative stem group of Bythinini, a Recent tribe with a primarily Holarctic distribution. The Laurasian palaeolocality of the newly described taxa implies that higher pselaphines are indeed probably of Jurassic, Pangaean extraction and that the Laurasian‐Gondwanan tribal dichotomy of this clade may have developed vicariantly following Pangaean rifting. Higher pselaphines probably predate the earliest ants. Their physically protective morphological ground plan may have been a preadaptation for myrmecophily when ants became diverse and ecologically ubiquitous, much later in the Cenozoic.

This study focuses on Hermosillo, which is an urbanized area located in the Sonoran Desert in which soil resuspension and dust emission processes are common. The metal content of arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), and lead (Pb) were determined in three dust sources (playgrounds, roofs, and roads), each representing different exposure media (EM) for these elements. The metal levels in dust were found in the order of Mn > Cr > Pb > As with the highest metal content found in road dust. Despite the similar average metal distributions, principal component analysis shows a clear separation of the three EM with playground dust related to Cr and Mn and road dust to As and Pb. However, the geoaccumulation index results indicate that dust samples are uncontaminated to moderately polluted, except for Pb in road dust, which is considerably high. In addition, the enrichment factor suggests an anthropogenic origin for all of the studied metals except for Mn. In this context, the hazard index (HI) for noncarcinogenic risk is >1 in this population and thus represents a potential health risk. The spatial distribution for each metal on EM and the HI related to the marginality index could represent a more accurate decision-making tool in risk assessment studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3aarsenic 3achildren 3achromium 3adecision support systems 3alead 3amanganese 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aroads 3asoil 3aurbanization 3aMexico 3aSonoran Desert1 aMeza-Figueroa, Diana1 aJay Gandolfi, A.1 aDel Río-Salas, Rafael1 aRomero, Francisco M.1 aMeza-Montenegro, Maria Mercedes0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2016 Apr., v. 70, no. 3 p.522-533dSpringer USx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-015-0229-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01550naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002000187245010600207300001300313506007600326520040800402592002800810506003700838650001800875650002000893650001400913650002600927700001800953700001900971700001600990773010501006856008001111852000901191655001201200IND60119389620221207114539.0141214e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011938962DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-5-r462doi7 aPMC27185122pmcid7 a194090822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeilwagen, Jens10aMotifAdjuster: a tool for computational reassessment of transcription factor binding site annotations  ap. 2196.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aValuable binding-site annotation data are stored in databases.

Small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA-based phylogenies subdivide the known 150 species into four major and some minor groups, but lack resolution within groups, particularly group 4, and, as shown by genome-based phylogenies of 11 species, showed errors in the position of the root and nodes separating major clades. We are interested in the evolution of cell-type specialization, which particularly expanded in group 4. To construct a more robust phylogeny, we first included 7 recently sequenced genomes in the genome-based phylogeny of 47 functionally divergent proteins and next selected 6 proteins (Agl, AmdA, PurD, PurL, RpaA, SmdA) that independently or in sets of two fully reproduced the core-phylogeny. We amplified their coding regions from 34 Dictyostelium species and combined their concatenated sequences with those identified in the 18 genomes to generate a fully resolved phylogeny. The new AAPPRS based phylogeny (after the acronym of the 6 proteins) subdivides group 4 into 2 branches. These branches further resolve into 5 clades, rather than the progressively nested group 4 topology of the SSU rDNA tree, and also re-orders taxa in the other major groups. Ancestral state reconstruction of 25 phenotypic traits returned higher “goodness of fit” metrics for evolution of 19 of those traits over the AAPPRS tree, than over the SSU rDNA tree. The novel tree provides a solid framework for studying the evolution of cell-type specialization, signalling and other cellular processes in particularly group 4, which contains the model Dictyostelid D. discoideum.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDictyostelium discoideum 3agenes 3amodels 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3asocial behavior 3atopology 0aphylogenomics 0aancestral state reconstruction 0aphylogenetic marker genes 0aDictyostelia 0aPolysphondylium multicystogenum 0aDictyostelium caveateum1 aLawal, Hajara M.1 aKin, Koryu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2409-72761 aShibano-Hayakawa, Ikumi1 aInouye, Kei1 aSchaap, Pauline0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2019 Jan. 21, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2019.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009600170300001600266500001400282520171400296592002802010650002202038650002402060650002202084650001402106650001102120650001302131650001502144650003002159650001602189650001602205650001302221650001902234650001002253650002202263650001502285650000902300650001802309653001502327653002002342653002002362653002202382700002002404700002302424700002102447700002302468773008202491856008102573852000902654655001202663IND60718150620221118082138.0201120e20191021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071815062DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-000021022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuffinatto, Flavio12aA new atlas and macroscopic wood identification software package for Italian timber species  ap. 393-411.  aNAL-light  aWood identification has never been more important to serve the purpose of global forest protection, by controlling international illegal timber trade and enabling the enforcement of timber trade regulations. Macroscopic wood identification is the fastest method for the first identification of an unknown timber and, with proper training, it can be performed by operators in the timber industry, restorers and curators of cultural heritage, wood traders, designers, students and customs officers. Here we describe a wood atlas and accompanying software, SIR-Legno, developed for the identification of 48 Italian timber species based on a recently proposed list of macroscopic features for wood identification. For each species the atlas provides a complete macroscopic description plus information on natural durability, end-use class, physico-mechanical properties, conservation status, maximum diameter of the bole and most frequent uses. For each genus covered by the atlas, information about species number, CITES-listed species, main commercial timbers, similarly-named timbers from other genera, geographical distribution and notes on species or species group recognition at macroscopic and microscopic level are provided. SIR-Legno is an educational product, a handy identification key and a tool to search woods by their natural durability, end-use class and physico-mechanical properties. Both the atlas and the software can be freely downloaded from the web. Thanks to the adoption of a codified list of characters and a transferable design, SIR-Legno can be easily replicated or expanded to other databases in order to include new species. SIR-Legno is freeware and works on any version of Windows.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aconservation status 3acultural heritage 3adatabases 3adesign 3adiameter 3adurability 3ageographical distribution 3ainformation 3anew species 3astudents 3ataxonomic keys 3atrade 3atrade regulations 3atree trunk 3awood 3awood industry 0aWood atlas 0aIAWA characters 0awood properties 0acommercial timber1 aCastro, Gaetano1 aCremonini, Corrado1 aCrivellaro, Alan1 aZanuttini, Roberto0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 41, no. 4 p.393-411dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-000021023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245005500168300001400223520088100237592002801118650002201146650002001168650001701188650001501205650001301220650001701233650001201250650002601262650002501288650001301313650000901326650001601335653002901351653002301380653001801403653001201421653001801433653001701451700001901468700002001487700002701507773010801534856008301642852000901725655001201734IND60561842220221122032201.0200228e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056184222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2015.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThibault, Ronan10aTwelve key nutritional issues in bariatric surgery  ap. 12-17.  aIn morbidly obese patients, i.e. body mass index ≥35, bariatric surgery is considered the only effective durable weight-loss therapy.

Therefore, preoperative nutritional assessment and correction of vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies, as well as long-term postoperative nutritional follow-up, are advised. Dietetic counseling is mandatory during the first year, optional later. Planned and structured physical exercise should be systematically promoted to maintain muscle mass and bone health.

Here we study Terradessus caecus Watts, a terrestrial species of the subfamily Hydroporinae endemic to Australia. We infer its phylogenetic placement using Bayesian inference and maximum‐likelihood methods based on a multilocus molecular dataset. We also investigate the divergence time estimates of this lineage using a Bayesian relaxed clock approach. Finally, we infer ancestral ecological preferences using a likelihood approach. We recover T. caecus nested in the genus Paroster Sharp with strong support. Therefore, we establish a synonymy for both species of Terradessus with Paroster: Paroster caecus (Watts) n.comb. and Paroster anophthalmus (Brancucci & Monteith) n.comb. Paroster is an endemic Australian genus that has a remarkable number of subterranean species in underground aquifers with highly derived morphologies. Our results highlight one of the most remarkable radiations of aquatic beetles with independent ecological pathways likely linked to palaeoclimatic disruptions in the Neogene. Paroster caecus (Watts) n.comb. originated from a mid‐Miocene split following the onset of an aridification episode that has been ongoing to the present day. The deep changes in ecological communities in association with the drying‐out of palaeodrainage systems might have pushed this lineage to colonize a new niche in terrestrial habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aDytiscidae 3aaquifers 3adata collection 3ahabitats 3alifestyle 3aphylogeny 3aAustralia1 aHENDRICH, LARS1 aEscalona, Hermes E.,1 aPORCH, NICK1 aBalke, Michael,0 tSystematic entomology.g2016 July, v. 41, no. 3 p.650-657dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/syen.121823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010800171300001600279520166700295592002801962650001701990650001402007650001302021650002002034650001102054650002402065650001502089650001202104650001302116650003102129650001002160650001302170650001202183650002302195700001902218700002602237700002502263773010902288856008102397852000902478655001202487IND60439186320221120165533.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043918632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-015-1156-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarneiro, Ana P.

We deployed global positioning system (GPS) and immersion (activity) loggers on breeding Brown Skuas of known sex, body size and condition at Admiralty Bay, King George Island with the aim to examine the impacts of spatial and seasonal fluctuations in prey availability on movement and foraging behavior. We also investigated whether reversed sexual size dimorphism (females larger than males) in this species leads to differences between sexes in foraging behavior and whether this or other factors contribute to variation in breeding success. Analysis of the GPS data highlighted the high degree of plasticity in foraging behavior among individuals. Although most Brown Skuas were flexible in their feeding tactics, this was not enough to ensure a successful breeding season, as few pairs fledged chicks. During early chick rearing, Brown Skuas spent most of their time on land, feeding almost exclusively on penguin chicks. By late chick rearing, when the availability of penguins had diminished, Brown Skuas supplemented the food obtained on land by traveling to the ocean. All foraging trips to sea occurred during daylight, mostly during the early morning. Despite marked sexual size dimorphism, we failed to find any difference in foraging tactics between males and females. Furthermore, although laying date affected the number of chicks hatched (earlier pairs were more successful), no relationship was found between breeding success and male or female body size, condition or degree of dimorphism within pairs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStercorarius 3abody size 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3achicks 3adietary supplements 3adimorphism 3afemales 3aforaging 3aglobal positioning systems 3amales 3apenguins 3arearing 3aseasonal variation1 aManica, Andrea1 aTrivelpiece, Wayne Z.1 aPhillips, Richard A.0 tJournal of ornithology.g2015 July, v. 156, no. 3 p.625-633dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-015-1156-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245008800201300001800289520155900307592002801866650004401894650003701938650001501975650001501990650001302005650001402018650001802032650003102050650001202081650001802093650001302111650001302124650001502137650001502152650001902167650003402186650001302220650001502233650001902248650001402267700001302281700001602294700001602310700001502326700005602341773017102397856008002568852000902648655001202657IND60600965820221121005940.0180705e20170830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060096582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b015232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Xubiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3935-126810aEnhancement of Phosphate Adsorption on Zirconium Hydroxide by Ammonium Modification  ap. 9419-9428.  aSurface modification of adsorbents plays a crucial role in its adsorption performance. Furthermore, the most important step in modification is to design the modification groups based on target pollutants. In this study, the phosphate adsorption performance of zirconium hydroxide was enhanced by different ammonium modification as a result of increasing utilization efficiency of adsorption site. The maximum capacity is 155.04 mg/g from the zirconium hydroxide modified by dimethylamine. In comparison with undecorated zirconium hydroxide, the selectivity factors for Cl–, SO₄²–, and NO₃– are all raised by almost 2 times by dimethylamine modification. The mass transfer rate K₂ also increase 6 times using N-methylaniline and N-ethylmethylamine. Results from zeta-potential and FT-IR revealed that the enhanced adsorption capacity for phosphate were directly related to the inner-sphere complex and electrostatic interactions (quaternary ammonium groups and phosphate) and ligand exchange (the hydroxyl groups of zirconium hydroxide and phosphate). Moreover, the utilization ratios of hydroxyl groups on adsorbents were improved from 22.9% to 33.9% by dimethylamine modification, which is proved by XPS. At last, the modified zirconium hydroxide presents excellent performances of anti-interference in real wastewater. Overall, modified zirconium hydroxide is considered to have great potential for engineering application, and then the method of increased utilization of the adsorption site gives a new route for other adsorption systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aammonium 3achlorides 3adimethylamine 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aligands 3amass transfer 3amoieties 3anitrates 3aphosphates 3apollutants 3aprocess design 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asulfates 3awastewater 3azeta potential 3azirconium1 aWu, Xing1 aReng, Zhong1 aMin, Xiaoye1 aXiao, Xiao1 aLuo, Jinming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8698-76240 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Aug. 30, v. 56, no. 34 p.9419-9428dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b015233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012000170300001400290520163500304592002801939650001201967650001701979650001201996650001302008650001302021650003102034650002702065650002602092650001002118650002102128650001602149650001802165650001302183650002502196650001302221650001402234650001402248650001302262650001802275650002002293653002602313653003002339653003102369653003302400653002402433653003302457653002702490700001702517700001702534700001502551700001702566700001602583700001802599700001802617773013102635856008602766852000902852655001202861IND60629812320221121052735.0190410e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062981232DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60055-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDONG, Xingchen10aChronic Nitrogen Fertilization Modulates Competitive Interactions Among Microbial Ammonia Oxidizers in a Loess Soil  ap. 24-33.  aNitrogen (N) application may lead to niche segregation of soil ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), thereby reducing the competitive interactions between AOA and AOB due to higher ammonium substrate availability. However, the adaptive mechanisms of AOA and AOB under N enrichment remain poorly understood. Stable isotope probing (SIP) microcosm incubation was employed to reveal community changes of active AOA and AOB in a loess soil from a field experiment growing potatoes that received no N (control, CK), low N (LN, 75 kg N ha−1), and high N (HN, 375 kg N ha−1). The results showed that the soil potential nitrification rate (PNR) was measured by culturing of the soil samples from the field experiment. Soil PNR was significantly increased in HN by 87.5% and 67.5% compared with CK and LN, respectively. Compared with CK, the 13C-amoA genes of soil AOA and AOB in HN had 2.58 × 104 and 1.55 × 106 copies, representing 1.6- and 16.2-fold increase respectively. It was indicated that AOB dominated soil ammonia oxidation. A phylogenetic analysis of the 13C-amoA gene showed that N application significantly increased the proportion of 54d9-like AOA up to 90% in HN, while the Nitrososphaera gargensis-like and Nitrososphaera viennensis-like AOA were inhibited and completely disappeared. Nitrogen application also resulted in the community shift of active AOB-dominant group from Nitrosospira briensis-like to Nitrosospira sp. TCH711-like. Our study provides compelling evidence for the emergence and maintenance of active nitrifying communities under the intensified N input to an agricultural ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aNitrosospira 3aammonia 3aammonium 3abacteria 3aecological differentiation 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3agenes 3aisotope labeling 3aloess soils 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aphylogeny 3apotatoes 3asoil sampling 3astable isotopes 0aammonia monooxygenase 0aammonia-oxidizing archaea 0aammonia-oxidizing bacteria 0achronic nitrogen application 0amicrobial community 0apotential nitrification rate 0astable isotope probing1 aZhang, Jian,1 aQIU, Huizhen1 aZhang, He,1 aLUO, Chaoyue1 aDENG, Delei1 aShen, Qirong,1 aJIA, Zhongjun0 tPedosphere.g2019 Feb., v. 29, no. 1 p.24-33dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60055-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140242003600158245003100194300001600225520104100241592002801282650000901310650001301319650001501332650001301347650001801360650001401378650001501392650001401407650001001421651001201431700002001443700001901463773013201482856007501614852000901689655001201698IND60439183020221005000000.0221005e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043918302DNAL7 a10.1007/BF024656312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerger, Silke10aBakterien in Nestern von Staren10aBacteria in starling nests  ap. 317-322.  aWe investigated the bacterial frequency and identified 11 genera of bacteria in starling-nests of a nest box colony in southern Germany. We sampled bacteria with a new method: agar paddles, developed for the food industry, were pressed against the naked belly of nestlings at an age of 14 days for 5 seconds. The bacteria colonies on the paddle surface were counted after incubation and their numbers served as an estimate of bacterial infestation of a nest. Bacteria numbers increased with season and precipitation. No relationship between bacteria load of the nests and hatching and fledging success, nestling mortality and body mass close to fledging was detected. The reason for this may be that a high bacteria load is not necessarily harmful but may even act in a beneficial way on the digestive and immune system. Nevertheless we consider it possible that the higher load of bacteria of late nests may under certain conditions be one of the factors responsible for the frequently observed lower quality of second brood nestlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3abacteria 3afledglings 3ahatching 3aimmune system 3amortality 3anest boxes 3anestlings 3anests 3aGermany1 aDisko, Ruediger1 aGwinner, Helga0 tJournal für Ornithologie.g2003 July, v. 144, no. 3 p.317-322dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949854x2193-71927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF024656313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009800169500002200267520101000289592002801299653002401327653005901351653002701410700002401437700001701461700002501478773018601503856008101689852000901770655001201779IND60561839020221119232939.0170124s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056183902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbe.2016.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoźniak, Tomasz,10a3D vascular tree segmentation using a multiscale vesselness function and a level set approach  aPre-press version  aThe paper presents a method aimed at segmentation of a vascular network in 3D medical data. The method implements an extended version of a vesselness function that considers multiscale image filtering to emphasize vessels of different diameters. This function is combined with a level set approach based on a Chan–Vese model. The proposed method was evaluated on medical images of the brain and hand vasculature. These images were obtained by different modalities, including angio-CT and two MR acquisition protocols. The proposed technique was quantitatively validated for the tree phantom image by assessing segmentation accuracy and for the angio-CT images by estimating diameters of vessel fragments. Two radiologists provided also qualitative evaluation of this approach. It was demonstrated that this method ensures correct segmentation of a vessel tree in the analyzed images. Moreover, it enables detection of thinner vessel branches when compared to single scale vesselness function approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 0a3D vascular network 0aMagnetic resonance and computed tomography angiography 0aLevel set segmentation1 aStrzelecki, Michał1 aMajos, Agata1 aStefańczyk, Ludomir0 tBiocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering.g2017, dElsevier B.V.aNałęcz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciencesx0208-52167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbe.2016.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245007900154300001600233500002000249520127000269592002801539650001601567650001601583650001101599650002401610650002001634650001301654650001001667650001001677650002301687650001701710650001601727650001301743651001101756700002401767700001601791773011601807856007301923852000901996655001202005IND60587956520221119040759.0180103e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058795652DNAL7 a10.1111/efp.122622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoroń, P.14aThe distribution of Dothistroma septosporum and its mating types in Poland  ap. 489-496.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDothistroma needle blight (DNB), one of the most dangerous foliar diseases of pines, is the cause of much economic loss in pine plantations worldwide. The threat to pine‐dominated Polish forestry from this disease is therefore very large. However, the impact of DNB has not been high mainly due to the planting of P. sylvestris, a less susceptible native species. Until now, DNB was recorded in Poland only on highly susceptible exotic P. nigra. The current situation concerning the disease in Poland is described in this article. This disease, caused by Dothistroma septosporum, was first recorded in a single location (Domiarki) in southern Poland in 1990. This study reports the occurrence of D. septosporum in 37 new locations, demonstrating that the disease has now spread across the whole country. Pinus nigra remains the predominant host species in Poland. However, three new hosts for this fungus are reported, that is P. sylvestris, P. mugo and P. ponderosa. The ratio of D. septosporum mating types varies significantly between sites, ranging from an equal proportion of each mating type to single mating type populations. For the oldest known Polish population of D. septosporum, the mating type ratio has shifted towards equilibrium over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDothistroma 3aPinus nigra 3ablight 3afinancial economics 3afoliar diseases 3aforestry 3afungi 3ahosts 3aindigenous species 3amating types 3aplantations 3aplanting 3aPoland1 aLenart‐Boroń, A.1 aMullett, M.0 tForest pathology.g2016 Oct., v. 46, no. 5 p.489-496dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60333x1437-47817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/efp.122623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04408naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245015900176300001400335520232100349592002802670650002702698650002302725650002202748650001502770650001402785650001202799650003102811650001602842650001502858650001202873650002602885650001102911650002202922650002102944650001402965650002802979650001403007650002003021650001703041650001603058650001003074650001603084650001703100650002303117650001503140650002103155651003103176651001203207653002703219653004003246653002303286653002703309653002103336653002603357653002703383653002203410700002603432700001903458700001903477773013103496856008603627852000903713655001203722IND60629812420221121052752.0190410e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062981242DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60056-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBOLDT-BURISCH, Katja10aRoot Exudation of Organic Acids of Herbaceous Pioneer Plants and Their Growth in Sterile and Non-Sterile Nutrient-Poor, Sandy Soils from Post-Mining Sites  ap. 34-44.  aNutrient-poor, sandy soils form the prevailing substrate at post-mining sites of the Lusatian region (Brandenburg, Germany) and present a challenge for vegetation development. We studied the organic acid quantity and composition of three commonly occurring pioneer plant species, the legumes Lotus corniculatus L. and Trifolium arvense L. and the grass Calamagrostis epigeios (L.) Roth, to determine if plant growth and exudation differed with (non-sterilized soil) and without (sterilized soil) an indigenous soil microbial community. We investigated whether organic acids were found in the rhizosphere and surrounding soil and whether this influenced nutrient mobilization. This study consists of linked field investigations and a greenhouse experiment. Plants were grown in the greenhouse in either sterilized or non-sterilized sandy soil from a reclamation site in the Lusatian mining landscape (Welzow Süd, East Germany). After seven months, the plant biomass, root morphology, organic acids, and water-soluble nutrients and root colonization with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) were analyzed. Roots of all three plants in the field and greenhouse experiments were highly colonized with AMF. Calamagrostis epigeios and T. arvense had a significantly higher colonization frequency with DSE than L. corniculatus. The quantity and composition of organic acids strongly differed among plant species, with the highest number of organic acids found for L. corniculatus and lowest for C. epigeios. The quantity of organic acids was greatly reduced in all plants under sterilized soil conditions. However, the composition of organic acids and plant growth in sterilized soil were reduced for both legumes, but not for C. epigeios, which had a higher biomass under sterilized conditions. Changes in nutrient concentrations in the field rhizosphere soil relative to those in the control were measurable after seven months. While the spectrum of organic acids and the growth of legumes seemed to be dependent on a highly diverse soil microbial community and a symbiotic partner, the grass C. epigeios appeared capable of mobilizing enough nutrients without an indigenous microbial community, and might be more competitive on sites where soil microbial diversity and activity are low.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalamagrostis epigejos 3aLotus corniculatus 3aTrifolium arvense 3aendophytes 3aexudation 3agrasses 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3alandscapes 3alegumes 3amicrobial communities 3amining 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aorganic acids and salts 3aphytomass 3apioneer species 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asandy soils 3asoil quality 3asoil sterilization 3avegetation 3awater solubility 3aGerman Democratic Republic 3aGermany 0aCalamagrostis epigeios 0aindigenous soil microbial community 0aLotus corniculatus 0amicrobial colonization 0amining landscape 0anutrient mobilization 0aroot symbiotic partner 0aTrifolium arvense1 aSchneider, Bernd Uwe,1 aNAETH, M.

There are also remotely sensed soil moisture observations from missions like the European Space Agency (ESA), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP); however, these time series are still too short to conduct studies that demonstrate the utility of these data for operational applications, or to provide historical context for extreme wet or dry events. To promote the use of remotely sensed soil moisture in agricultural drought and food security monitoring, we evaluate the quality of a 30+ year time series of merged active–passive microwave soil moisture from the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI-SM) over East Africa. Compared to the Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) and modeled soil moisture products, we find substantial spatial and temporal gaps in the early part of the CCI-SM record, with adequate data coverage beginning in 1992. From this point forward, growing season CCI-SM anomalies are well correlated (R>0.5) with modeled soil moisture, and in some regions, NDVI. We use pixel-wise correlation analysis and qualitative comparisons of seasonal maps and time series to show that remotely sensed soil moisture can inform remote drought monitoring that has traditionally relied on rainfall and NDVI in moderately vegetated regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite 3aclimate change 3adrought 3afood security 3agrowing season 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3arain 3aremote sensing 3asoil water 3atime series analysis 3avegetation 3aEastern Africa 0aRemotely sensed soil moisture 0aAgricultural drought monitoring 0aFood security 0aEast Africa1 aShukla, Shraddhanand1 aArsenault, Kristi R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6830-62711 aWang, Shugong1 aPeters-Lidard, Christa D.1 aVerdin, James P.0 tITC journal.g2016 June, v. 48 p.96-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:22337x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2016.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009200158300001600250500002000266520086300286592002801149650003101177650001601208650001901224650002301243650003001266650001101296650001201307650001601319650002101335650002101356650001601377650001401393700001501407700001501422700001901437700001601456700001401472700001701486700001701503773011601520856007301636852000901709655001201718IND60587956620221119040850.0180103e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058795662DNAL7 a10.1111/efp.122372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlenezi, F.

The results suggest that A. migulanus Nagano has potential as a biological control agent for use against DNB in forest nurseries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAneurinibacillus migulanus 3aDothistroma 3aPinus contorta 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3ablight 3aconidia 3aconidiomata 3adisease severity 3aforest nurseries 3agermination 3aseedlings1 aFraser, S.1 aBełka, M.1 aDoğmuş, T.H.1 aHeckova, Z.1 aOskay, F.1 aBelbahri, L.1 aWoodward, S.0 tForest pathology.g2016 Oct., v. 46, no. 5 p.555-558dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60333x1437-47817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/efp.122373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011700170520147000287592002801757650001301785650001401798650001501812650001901827650002401846653000801870653003201878653002401910653002001934653002701954700002601981700002202007700002202029700002902051700002302080773009402103856008102197852000902278655001202287IND60725109120221119105028.0210124e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072510912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1044312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNifant'ev, Ilya E.10aData for quantum-chemical modeling of the mechanisms of ring-opening polymerization of methyl ethylene phosphate  aThe data presented in this paper are related to the research article entitled "Mechanistic study of transesterification in TBD-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of methyl ethylene phosphate" (Nifant'ev et al., 2019). In this data article, we present 3D molecular information of 76 structures for TBD-catalyzed transformations of methyl ethylene phosphate (MeOEP) and trimethyl phosphate (TMP). We also present 3D molecular information for 24 complexes that model the reaction profile of transesterification of poly(MeOEP) and TMP catalyzed by 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy magnezium species, complementing the article "Mechanistic insights of BHT-Mg-catalyzed ethylene phosphate's coordination ring-opening polymerization: DFT modeling and experimental data" (Nifant'ev et al., 2018). The data contains stationary points and transition states (TS) along the first propagation step of MeOEP ring-opening polymerization (ROP) for alternative amide and donor-acceptor mechanisms, initiated by EtOH in the presence of TBD; stationary points and TS for MeOH and HOCH₂CH₂OP(O)(OMe)₂ initiated ROP of MeOEP; and stationary points and TS for transesterification of poly(MeOEP) and TMP. In addition, the data contains stationary points and transition states for the ROP of MeOEP and transesterification of poly(MeOEP) and TMP catalyzed by 2,6-di-tert-butylphenoxy magnesium complex.

Polyploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) has had a massive increase in genome size largely due to recent WGDs. How these processes may impact the dynamics of gene evolution was studied by comparing the patterns of gene structure changes, alternative splicing (AS), and codon substitution rates among wheat and model grass genomes. In orthologous gene sets, significantly more acquired and lost exonic sequences were detected in wheat than in model grasses. In wheat, 35% of these gene structure rearrangements resulted in frame-shift mutations and premature termination codons. An increased codon mutation rate in the wheat lineage compared with Brachypodium distachyon was found for 17% of orthologs. The discovery of premature termination codons in 38% of expressed genes was consistent with ongoing pseudogenization of the wheat genome. The rates of AS within the individual wheat subgenomes (21%–25%) were similar to diploid plants. However, we uncovered a high level of AS pattern divergence between the duplicated homeologous copies of genes. Our results are consistent with the accelerated accumulation of AS isoforms, nonsynonymous mutations, and gene structure rearrangements in the wheat lineage, likely due to genetic redundancy created by WGDs. Whereas these processes mostly contribute to the degeneration of a duplicated genome and its diploidization, they have the potential to facilitate the origin of new functional variations, which, upon selection in the evolutionary lineage, may play an important role in the origin of novel traits.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3astop codon 3agrasses 3aalternative splicing 3aframeshift mutation 3aevolution 3awheat 3apolyploidy 3aBrachypodium 3aTriticum aestivum 0agenes1 aSehgal, Sunish1 aLiang, Hanquan1 aWang, Shichen1 aAkhunova, Alina R.1 aGaganpreet Kaur,1 aLi, Wanlong1 aForrest, Kerrie L.1 aSee, Deven1 aŠimková, Hana1 aMa, Yaqin1 aHayden, Matthew J.1 aLuo, Mingcheng1 aFaris, Justin D.1 aDoležel, Jaroslav,1 aGill, B.

The implementation of all our experiments, as well as the gathering of all raw data derived from them, was based on the software implementation and evaluation of all methods in HESML library (Lastra-Díaz et al., 2017), and their subsequent recording with Reprozip (Chirigati et al., 2016). Raw data is made up by a collection of data files gathering the raw word-similarity values returned by each method for each word pair evaluated in any benchmark. Raw data files were processed by running a R-language script with the aim of computing all evaluation metrics reported in (Lastra-Díaz et al., 2019), such as Pearson and Spearman correlation, harmonic score and statistical significance p-values, as well as to generate automatically all data tables shown in our companion paper. Our dataset provides all input data files, resources and complementary software tools to reproduce from scratch all our experimental data, statistical analysis and reported data. Finally, our reproducibility dataset provides a self-contained experimentation platform which allows to run new word similarity benchmarks by setting up new experiments including other unconsidered methods or word similarity benchmarks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3astatistical analysis 3asurveys 0aOntology-based semantic similarity measures 0aWord embedding models 0aInformation content models 0aWordNet 0aExperimental survey 0aHESML 0aReprozip1 aGoikoetxea, Josu1 aHadj Taieb, Mohamed Ali1 aGarcia-Serrano, Ana,1 aAouicha, Mohamed Ben1 aAgirre, Eneko0 tData in Brief.g2019 Oct., v. 26 p.104432-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2019.1044323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007500156300002000231520106400251592002801315650001501343650001501358650003001373650001701403650002001420650001501440650001301455650001401468650001201482650001601494700001801510700001601528700001501544700002001559700001701579700001301596700001501609773012401624856007401748852000901822655001201831IND60641167920221120145541.0190505e20160830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064116792DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra18785d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bowu10aSynergistic nanofibrous adsorbent for uranium extraction from seawater  ap. 81995-82005.  aHuge reserves of uranium (U) in seawater have been of interest to scientists and energy companies since the 1950s. However, extracting trace concentrations (3.3 ppb) of U from seawater is economically unfeasible without new, high-performance adsorbents. Here, a mat-like nanofibrous composite adsorbent containing binary coordination groups (amidoxime (AO) and carboxyl (AC⁻)) in a highly porous network of nanofibers is constructed via a parallel-blend electrospinning method. Its U uptake in artificial seawater is more than double those of adsorbents containing AO or AC⁻ groups alone. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that this synergistic effect is because the AC⁻ group promotes both the U 5f/6d orbital contribution to U–AO bonding and the dissociation of uranyl tricarbonate ions in seawater. In a continuous flow-through experiment with simulated seawater, the nanofibrous adsorbent achieves an adsorption capacity up to 2.86 mg U gₐdₛ⁻¹ in 30 d but without saturation, indicating a high efficiency for U extraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adensity functional theory 3adissociation 3aenergy industry 3ananofibers 3aseawater 3asynergism 3auranium 3auranyl ions1 aGuo, Xiaojing1 aXie, Siyuan1 aLiu, Xiyan1 aLing, Changjian1 aMa, Hongjuan1 aYu, Ming1 aLi, Jingye0 tRSC advances.g2016 Aug. 30, v. 6, no. 85 p.81995-82005dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra18785d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245009100208300001200299506007600311520118400387592002801571506003701599650001801636650002001654650002201674650001401696650001101710650002401721650002201745650001701767650001501784650002501799650001401824650001801838700001901856773010501875856008101980852000902061655001202070IND60119100220221207094821.0150411e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011910022DNAL7 a10.1186/s13059-014-0538-42doi7 aPMC42821512pmcid7 a254181192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrad, Yonatan H10aEpidemiologic data and pathogen genome sequences: a powerful synergy for public health  ap. 538.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEpidemiologists aim to inform the design of public health interventions with evidence on the evolution, emergence and spread of infectious diseases. Sequencing of pathogen genomes, together with date, location, clinical manifestation and other relevant data about sample origins, can contribute to describing nearly every aspect of transmission dynamics, including local transmission and global spread. The analyses of these data have implications for all levels of clinical and public health practice, from institutional infection control to policies for surveillance, prevention and treatment. This review highlights the range of epidemiological questions that can be addressed from the combination of genome sequence and traditional ‘line lists’ (tables of epidemiological data where each line includes demographic and clinical features of infected individuals). We identify opportunities for these data to inform interventions that reduce disease incidence and prevalence. By considering current limitations of, and challenges to, interpreting these data, we aim to outline a research agenda to accelerate the genomics-driven transformation in public health microbiology.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata analysis 3adisease control 3adisease incidence 3aevolution 3agenome 3ainfectious diseases 3aissues and policy 3amicrobiology 3amonitoring 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3apublic health1 aLipsitch, Marc0 tGenome biology.g2014 Nov., v. 15, no. 11 p.538-538dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-014-0538-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245016400178300001600342520103100358592002801389650004401417650002801461650001301489650002201502650001301524650001301537650002401550650004401574650001801618650002101636700002101657700001601678700002501694700006301719700001801782773013501800856008701935852000902022655001202031IND60622694220221122053930.0190131e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062269422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.1832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJavaid, Muhammad Asif10aMathematical modeling and experimental study of mechanical properties of chitosan based polyurethanes: Effect of diisocyanate nature by mixture design approach  ap. 321-330.  aThis research work has been done to investigate the influence of the geometry of aliphatic diisocyanate (hexamethylene diisocyanate, HDI), cycloaliphatic diisocyanate (isophorone diisocyanate, IPDI) and aromatic diisocyanate (2,4-toluene diisocyanate, TDI) on the tensile strength and hardness of chitosan based polyurethane biomaterials.

This biomaterial has been established as an innovative and promising strategy to improve the mechanical strength of chitosan-based polyurethanes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiocompatible materials 3achitosan 3acomputer software 3ageometry 3ahardness 3amathematical models 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyurethanes 3atensile strength1 aYounas, Muhammad1 aZafar, Irsa1 aKhera, Rasheed Ahmad1 aZia, Khalid Mahmood1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0129-11721 aJabeen, Sobia0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 124 p.321-330dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.1833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016000167300001600327520148800343592002801831650002801859650001401887650001401901650002801915650001001943650002001953650003101973650002002004650001802024650001702042650001402059650004302073650002802116650001402144650004202158700002002200700001602220700002202236773008402258856008102342852000902423655001202432IND60515200220221119030927.0160312e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051520022DNAL7 a10.1007/s12355-014-0364-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSathyabhama, M.10aIdentification of Differentially Expressed Genes in Sugarcane During Pathogenesis of Colletotrichum falcatum by Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH)  ap. 176-183.  aA suppression subtractive hybridization technique was used to identify differentially expressed genes in sugarcane in response to Colletotrichum falcatum, the fungal pathogen causing red rot in sugarcane. Messenger RNA (mRNA) samples collected from red rot resistant cv. Co 93009 at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after pathogen challenge were pooled together and used as tester population. mRNA samples collected from red rot susceptible cv. CoC 671 at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after pathogen challenge and control of samples of cv. Co 93009 and cv. CoC 671 were pooled together and used as the driver population. A forward subtraction enriched for differentially expressed ESTs in the resistant cultivar was carried out. At the end of subtraction, cloning and sequencing, 136 EST sequences were assembled into ten clusters/contigs. Based on TIGR homology search, the clusters were found to be involved in reactive oxygen species signaling, defense and the secretory pathway of plant innate immunity associated with hypersensitive response—mediated programmed cell death. Temporal gene expression pattern of the EST clusters by quantitative real time PCR revealed that, resistant cultivar had a higher level of gene expression than the susceptible cultivar in all the clusters till 48 h after pathogen inoculation. In conclusion, this study identified for the first time a set of differentially expressed EST clusters in red rot resistant sugarcane cultivar in response to C. falcatum infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomerella tucumanensis 3aapoptosis 3acultivars 3aexpressed sequence tags 3afungi 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ainnate immunity 3amessenger RNA 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areactive oxygen species 3asugarcane 3asuppression subtractive hybridization1 aViswanathan, R.1 aMalathi, P.1 aRamesh Sundar, A.0 tSugar tech.g2016 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.176-183dSpringer Indiax0972-15257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12355-014-0364-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013300161520150200294592002801796650001401824650002101838650002301859650001501882650002001897650003001917650002201947650002201969650001301991650002102004650002202025651001002047651001202057653003002069653004502099653002302144653004202167653001602209700005402225700001902279700001602298700001202314700001602326700001402342700001802356700001602374773009402390856008102484852000902565655001202574IND60725109420221119104940.0210124e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072510942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1044342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yun10aData on soil microbial carbon source utilization under different carbon input treatments in broadleaf and coniferous plantations  aThis article presents soil microbial carbon metabolism data under different detritus input and removal treatments (DIRT) in broadleaf and coniferous plantations in the Tashan Forests in Feixian County, Shandong Province, China (35°10′–36°00′N, 117°35′–118°20′E). The local annual air temperature is 13 °C, and the annual precipitation is 700 mm. The soil belongs to Phaeozems. The effects of DIRT on soil microbial carbon (C) metabolism in oak (Quercus variabilis Bl.) plantations and pine (Pinus thunbergii Parl.) plantations were assessed. There were five treatments for each plantation type, including: a control; doubling aboveground litter input; no aboveground litter input; no roots; and no detritus inputs. Soils were sampled after one year and nine months of DIRT. Soil microbial C metabolism was measured by EcoPlate™, which contained 31 different C substrates. The absorbance was measured with a micro-plate reader (Synergy H¹, Biotek, Vermont, USA) at 590 nm every 12 h for 240 h. The data are based on 50 samples (two forest types × five C input treatments × five replicates); three replicates of the samples were taken. Interpretation of the data can be found in “Carbon input manipulations affecting microbial carbon metabolism in temperate forest soils – a comparative study between broadleaf and coniferous plantations” (Wang et al., 2019). The data can be used for studying the roles of aboveground and belowground inputs to soil C stabilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeozems 3aPinus thunbergii 3aQuercus variabilis 3aabsorbance 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarbon metabolism 3acomparative study 3adetritus 3amicrobial carbon 3atemperate forests 3aChina 3aVermont 0aCarbon source utilization 0aMicrobial functional metabolic diversity 0aBiolog Ecoplate™ 0aDetritus input and removal treatments 0aPlantations1 aZhang, Chi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9456-00651 aZhang, Guangna1 aWang, Xinli1 aLiu, Bo1 aWang, Lizhi1 aGao, Yuan1 aZhao, Xingyun1 aMei, Heping0 tData in Brief.g2019 Oct., v. 26 p.104434-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2019.1044343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03458naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009500173506011100268506007600379520195800455592002802413506003702441650001402478650001602492650001102508650002002519650001302539650001302552650002202565650001502587651001302602653002002615653001202635653002402647653001802671653001402689653000802703700002202711700006602733773011802799856008602917852000903003655001203012IND60783413720221207114232.0221004e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078341372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaxwell, Bryan M.10aPaired denitrifying bioreactors with wide orientation for increased drainage flow capacity  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDenitrifying bioreactors are a conservation drainage practice for reducing nitrate loads in subsurface agricultural drainage. Bioreactor hydraulic capacity is limited by cross-sectional area perpendicular to flow through the woodchip bed, with excess bypass flow untreated. Paired bioreactors with wide orientations were built in 2017 in Illinois, USA, to treat drainage from a relatively large 29 ha field. The paired design consisted of: a larger, Main bioreactor (LWD: 6.1 × 18.3 × 0.9 m) for treating base flow, and 2) a smaller, Booster bioreactor (7.8 × 13.1 × 0.9 m) receiving bypass flow from the Main bioreactor during periods of high flow. Over three years of monitoring, the paired bioreactor captured 84–92% of the annual drainage discharge which demonstrated an expanded cross-sectional area could improve bioreactor flow capture, even for a large drainage area. However, the paired bioreactors removed 6–28% of the annual N load leaving the field (1.8–5.6 kg N ha⁻¹ removed; 52–161 kg N), which was not a notable improvement compared to bioreactors treating smaller drainage areas. The design operated as intended at low annual flow-weighted hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of usually ≤2 h, but these short HRTs ultimately limited bioreactor nitrate removal efficiency. Daily HRTs of <2 h often resulted in nitrate flushing. The Main bioreactor had higher hydraulic loading as intended and was responsible for the majority of flow captured in each year although not always the most nitrate mass removal. The Booster bioreactor provided better nitrate removal than the Main at HRTs of 3.0–11.9 h, possibly due to its drying cycles which may have liberated more available carbon. This new design approach tested at the field-scale illustrated tradeoffs between greater flow capacity (via increased bioreactor width) and longer HRT (via increased length), given a consistent bioreactor surface footprint.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abase flow 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3adenitrification 3adrainage 3anitrates 3apreferential flow 3awood chips 3aIllinois 0aDenitrification 0aNitrate 0aSubsurface drainage 0aTile drainage 0aWoodchips 0aHRT1 aCooke, Richard A.1 aChristianson, Laura E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2583-64320 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 319 p.115768-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010700156300001600263500002000279520149400299592002801793650001601821650001001837650001001847650001801857650001001875650001301885650001101898650000701909650001401916650001701930650001601947700002601963700001301989700002102002773011602023856007302139852000902212655001202221IND60587957020221119040721.0180103e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058795702DNAL7 a10.1111/efp.122432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowalski, T.10aInfluence of culture conditions on medium discoloration and mycelial growth of Dothistroma septosporum  ap. 507-514.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDothistroma septosporum is one of the most damaging fungi‐attacking pines wherever they are grown. Specific symptoms on pine include the formation of red bands on needles and the appearance of which is attributed to dothistromin, a toxin produced by this pathogen. Many reports have suggested that such red bands do not appear in all infections, although the cause of this phenomenon is unclear. When grown in vitro, some strains of D. septosporum cause an intense blue, rather than red, coloration of the medium. This study presents results of experiments designed to determine the effects of culture conditions on growth of D. septosporum in vitro and the accompanying coloration of the medium. Growth of D. septosporum is characterized by slow mycelial extension and high morphological diversity in all culture conditions. The most rapid growth occurred at 20°C and on a medium at pH 6. Colour of the secreted pigment was not a consistent feature of a given fungal isolate, but depended on temperature and pH of the medium, along with a significant interaction among these factors. Lower temperature and lower pH favoured the production of the blue pigment. Moreover, pigmentation around the D. septosporum colonies was affected by other fungi inhabiting the same ecological niche. These results are discussed in terms of the possible reasons for the failure to produce the characteristic red banding symptoms on needles infected by D. septosporum in some in vivo situations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDothistroma 3aPinus 3acolor 3adiscoloration 3afungi 3amycelium 3aniches 3apH 3apathogens 3apigmentation 3atemperature1 aNawrot‐Chorabik, K.1 aGrad, B.1 aLeszczyński, K.0 tForest pathology.g2016 Oct., v. 46, no. 5 p.507-514dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60333x1437-47817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/efp.122433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04599naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245013100163300001600294520263900310592002802949650001302977650002202990650002403012650001203036650002003048650001603068650001003084650001403094650001403108650001603122650001903138650001803157650002203175650001403197650001503211650002203226650002003248650001203268650001703280651002803297651001103325700003003336700002803366700001903394700002003413700002303433700001903456700002203475700002303497700001903520700002003539700001703559700002203576700001703598700002103615700002303636700002103659700002103680700002103701773010103722856008103823852000903904655001203913IND4460486920221118130633.0141110e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446048692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2011.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalosuo, Taru10aSimulation of winter wheat yield and its variability in different climates of Europe: A comparison of eight crop growth models  ap. 103-114.  aWe compared the performance of eight widely used, easily accessible and well-documented crop growth simulation models (APES, CROPSYST, DAISY, DSSAT, FASSET, HERMES, STICS and WOFOST) for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) during 49 growing seasons at eight sites in northwestern, Central and southeastern Europe. The aim was to examine how different process-based crop models perform at the field scale when provided with a limited set of information for model calibration and simulation, reflecting the typical use of models for large-scale applications, and to present the uncertainties related to this type of model application. Data used in the simulations consisted of daily weather statistics, information on soil properties, information on crop phenology for each cultivar, and basic crop and soil management information. Our results showed that none of the models perfectly reproduced recorded observations at all sites and in all years, and none could unequivocally be labelled robust and accurate in terms of yield prediction across different environments and crop cultivars with only minimum calibration. The best performance regarding yield estimation was for DAISY and DSSAT, for which the RMSE values were lowest (1428 and 1603kgha⁻¹) and the index of agreement (0.71 and 0.74) highest. CROPSYST systematically underestimated yields (MBE – 1186kgha⁻¹), whereas HERMES, STICS and WOFOST clearly overestimated them (MBE 1174, 1272 and 1213kgha⁻¹, respectively). APES, DAISY, HERMES, STICS and WOFOST furnished high total above-ground biomass estimates, whereas CROPSYST, DSSAT and FASSET provided low total above-ground estimates. Consequently, DSSAT and FASSET produced very high harvest index values, followed by HERMES and WOFOST. APES and DAISY, on the other hand, returned low harvest index values. In spite of phenological observations being provided, the calibration results for wheat phenology, i.e. estimated dates of anthesis and maturity, were surprisingly variable, with the largest RMSE for anthesis being generated by APES (20.2 days) and for maturity by HERMES (12.6). The wide range of grain yield estimates provided by the models for all sites and years reflects substantial uncertainties in model estimates achieved with only minimum calibration. Mean predictions from the eight models, on the other hand, were in good agreement with measured data. This applies to both results across all sites and seasons as well as to prediction of observed yield variability at single sites – a very important finding that supports the use of multi-model estimates rather than reliance on single models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPongidae 3aTriticum aestivum 3aaboveground biomass 3aclimate 3acrop management 3acrop models 3acrops 3acultivars 3aflowering 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3aharvest index 3amodel uncertainty 3aphenology 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3asoil properties 3aweather 3awinter wheat 3aCentral European region 3aEurope1 aKersebaum, Kurt Christian1 aAngulo Valdés, Carlos,1 aHlavinka, Petr1 aMoriondo, Marco1 aOlesen, Jørgen E.1 aPatil, Ravi H.1 aRuget, Françoise1 aRumbaur, Christian1 aTakáč, Jozef1 aTrnka, Miroslav1 aBindi, Marco1 aÇaldağ, Barış1 aEwert, Frank1 aFerrise, Roberto1 aMirschel, Wilfried1 aŞaylan, Levent,1 aŠiška, Bernard1 aRötter, Reimund0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2011 Oct., v. 35, no. 3 p.103-114dElsevier B.V.x1161-03017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2011.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245017400173520150800347592002801855650002301883650001301906650002501919650001701944650001001961650002001971650000901991650001502000650001402015650002302029650001502052650001202067650002302079650001602102650002502118650001802143650001802161653001602179653001202195653001602207653001102223653001902234653002502253700002202278700006902300700006002369773009402429856008102523852000902604655001202613IND60725109820221119104955.0210124e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072510982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1044382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyafaat, Muhammad Nur10aData on population density, growth, survival, water quality, larval stage index and ingestion rate of selected microalgae of portunids crabs at different feeding regimes  aPopulation density, growth, survival, water quality and larval stage index of purple mud crab, Scylla tranquebarica at different feeding regimes and the data on ingestion rate of chosen microalgae, survival and larval development of blue swimming crab, Portunus pelagicus are presented.

Direct eye observation, data collected through the larval rearing culture of S. tranquebarica and further statistical analysis were done daily until the crabs reached the megalopa stage. The result obtained from the optimum density of selected microalgae fed by individual larvae of P. pelagicus will be combined with the highest survival rate and larval stage index to develop feeding schedule for crab larvae P. pelagicus. This dataset has not previously been published and is of great potential for further comparison with other – and future investigation of various feeding regimes affected the crab culture. The collected information could be used as a standard feeding regime for nursery and hatchery seed production of others portunids crabs.

Since cornea epithelial biomechanics is already described for contacts on nanostructures, we herein analyzed cell response to mechanical substrate elasticity. Therefore, corneal keratinocytes were established on physiologically-relevant elastic substrates of 40kPa, 130kPa but also on non-physiological stiff substrates of 1.74MPa for 3 days. qPCR revealed that changes in gene expression were only marginal between 40kPa and 130kPa, while significant modulations were seen on 1.74MPa substrates for most tissue-innate biomarkers under study. Gene expression fairly coincided with the protein, with differentiation progression biomarkers involucrin and fillagrin being already significantly increased between elasticities of 40kPa and 130kPa. Regarding focal adhesions, reinforcement was seen for ß1 integrin and phospho- p¹²⁵Fᴬᴷ between 40kPa and 130kPa, while from 130kPa to 1.74MPa actin redistributed and phospho-p¹²⁵Fᴬᴷ was strikingly up-regulated. These findings suggest elasticity dependence for differentiation progression and focal adhesion dynamics of corneal keratinocytes, supporting the concept of biomechanics governed regulation of tissue homeostasis. Moreover, this concept in turn can be translated into prospective cornea-tailored biomaterials for therapeutic approaches in ophthalmology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aadhesion 3abiocompatible materials 3abiomarkers 3abiomechanics 3acornea 3aelasticities 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahomeostasis 3aintegrins 3akeratinocytes 3ananomaterials 3aophthalmology 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction1 aSteinberg, Thorsten1 aSchlunck, Günther1 aReinhard, T.q(Thomas),1 aTomakidi, Pascal1 aEberwein, Philipp0 tExperimental cell research.g2013 July 15, v. 319, no. 12 p.1889-1901dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.05.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100006600166245012900232300001800361520162200379592002802001650001702029650001902046650001302065650001902078650001402097650001202111650001502123650001402138650002202152650002402174650001702198650001602215651001102231653001902242653002202261653001702283653002202300653002102322700004602343700002602389700002202415700001902437700002202456773013002478856008102608852000902689655001202698IND60651496020221120231726.0190711e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065149602DNAL7 a286252322pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800170012392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMastroeni, Marco Fabio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9276-886610aBreast-feeding duration for the prevention of excess body weight of mother–child pairs concurrently: a 2-year cohort study  ap. 2537-2548.  aTo examine the association between breast-feeding duration and the risk of excess body weight (children >85th percentile, mothers BMI≥25·0 kg/m²) concurrently in mother–child pairs two years after delivery. Prospective cohort study in Joinville, Brazil. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the independent relationship between breast-feeding duration and risk of excess body weight. Brazilian public maternity hospital. Three hundred and five mother–child pairs. At 2-year follow-up, 23·6 % of mother–child pairs had excess body weight. Children breast-fed for <2 months were more likely to have excess body weight than children breast-fed for ≥6 months (OR=2·4; 95 % CI 1·1, 5·1). Breast-feeding for <2 months was also associated with a greater likelihood of maternal excess body weight compared with those who breast-fed for ≥6 months (OR=2·9; 95 % CI 1·1, 8·1). There was a progressive increase in the likelihood of mother–child pairs having excess body weight as breast-feeding duration decreased. In addition to breast-feeding duration, other independent determinants of excess body weight were pre-pregnancy weight, gestational weight gain and number of pregnancies in mothers, and birth weight in children. Breast-feeding for a longer duration has a parallel protective effect on the risk of excess body weight in mother–child pairs two years after birth. Since members of the same family could be influenced by the same risk factors, continued promotion and support of breast-feeding may help to attenuate the rising prevalence of overweight in mother–child pairs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirth weight 3abreast feeding 3achildren 3acohort studies 3ahospitals 3amothers 3aoverweight 3apregnancy 3aprotective effect 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aweight gain 3aBrazil 0aBreast-feeding 0aChildhood obesity 0aBirth cohort 0aPostpartum weight 0aMaternal obesity1 aMastroeni, Silmara Salete de Barros Silva1 aCzarnobay, Sandra Ana1 aEkwaru, John Paul1 aLoehr, Sarah A1 aVeugelers, Paul J0 tPublic health nutrition.g2017 Oct., v. 20, no. 14 p.2537-2548dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800170012393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245015400164300002000318520124200338592002801580650001901608650001101627650001801638650001301656650002401669650001601693650001301709650001701722650001901739650001901758650001901777650002301796650001701819700001601836700001401852700001201866700001901878773012801897856008202025852000902107655001202116IND60566266920221123032130.0170409e20160519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056626692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b017052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chengyin10aEasily and Synchronously Ameliorating Charge Separation and Band Energy Level in Porous g-C3N4 for Boosting Photooxidation and Photoreduction Ability  ap. 10381-10389.  aMetal-free graphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄) shows benign photocatalytic abilities concerning contaminant decomposition and hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. Developing facile modification tactics for promoted activity of g-C₃N₄ has always been desirable and worth pursuing. Herein, we report the integration of multiple (three-in-one) advantageous effects in g-C₃N₄ photocatalyst by a simple co-pyrolyzation of co-precursors melamine and NH₄HCO₃. This strategy utilizing NH₄HCO₃ as a bubble soft template not only endows g-C₃N₄ with porous structure with enhanced specific surface area, but also renders highly promoted separation and transfer of charge carriers and up-shifted conduction band. Given these benefits, the modified g-C₃N₄ unfolds remarkably improved photocatalytic performance toward RhB degradation, NO removal, and hydrogen evolution. Additionally, the exploration on active radicals has also corroborated the ameliorated band structure and illustrates the photocatalytic mechanism. Our present work may open up a new avenue for ameliorating the photocatalytic property of g-C₃N₄ and also further our understanding of design of high-performance photoelectric materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nitride 3aenergy 3afree radicals 3agraphene 3ahydrogen production 3airradiation 3amelamine 3anitric oxide 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotooxidation 3aphysical chemistry 3asurface area1 aZhang, Yihe1 aDong, Fan1 aDu, Xin1 aHuang, Hongwei0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 May 19, v. 120, no. 19 p.10381-10389dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b017053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245016800184300001600352520099400368592002801362650001801390650002101408650002101429650002501450650001801475650001201493650001501505650002701520650002001547650002001567650002401587650002901611650003201640650002301672650001201695650002901707650007101736650002001807700002101827700001801848700001901866700001601885700002101901700002101922773010701943856008102050990002302131852000902154655001202163IND60090605520221119105649.0141102e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009060552DNAL7 a212119842pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2010.11.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhtsuka, Isao14aThe effect of structural differences in the reducing terminus of sugars on the binding affinity of carbohydrates and proteins analyzed using photoaffinity labeling  ap. 894-899.  aBecause carbohydrates and proteins bind with such low affinity, the nature of their interactions is not clear. Photoaffinity labeling with diazirin groups is useful for elucidating the roles of carbohydrates in these binding processes. However, when carbohydrate probes are synthesized according to this conventional method, the reducing terminus of the sugar is opened to provide an acyclic structure. Because greater elucidation of carbohydrate–protein interactions requires a closed-ring carbohydrate in addition to the photoreactive group, we synthesized new molecular tools. The carbohydrate ligands were synthesized in three steps (glycosylation with allyl alcohol, deprotection, and ozonolysis). Specific binding proteins for carbohydrate ligands were obtained by photoaffinity labeling. Closed ring-type carbohydrate ligands, in which the reducing sugar is closed, bound to lectins more strongly than open ring-type sugars. Carbohydrate to protein binding was observed using AFM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallyl alcohol 3abinding capacity 3abinding proteins 3acarbohydrate binding 3aglycosylation 3alectins 3aozonolysis 3aphotoaffinity labeling 3aprotein binding 3areducing sugars 2aAzirinesxchemistry 2aCarbohydratesxchemistry 2aDihydropyridinesxchemistry 2aLectinsxchemistry 2aLigands 2aMicroscopy, Atomic Force 2aPhotoaffinity Labelsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aProtein Binding1 aSadakane, Yutaka1 aHiguchi, Mari1 aHada, Noriyasu1 aHada, Junko1 aKakiuchi, Nobuko1 aSakushima, Akiyo0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 19, no. 2 p.894-899dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2010.11.0673Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002000188245011300208300001100321506007600332520127800408592002801686506003701714650002001751650001801771650001101789650001201800650002101812650003301833650001801866650003001884650001501914650001201929651001201941700001901953700002101972700001701993700001802010700001902028700001902047700001802066700002202084700002302106773010602129856008202235852000902317655001202326IND60572468220221207122036.0220831e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057246822DNAL7 aPMC53886482pmcid7 a284014682pmid7 a10.1007/s13205-016-0587-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrabelsi, Rahma10aMorphological and molecular characterization of Fusarium spp. associated with olive trees dieback in Tunisia  ap. 28.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDieback and wilting symptoms caused by complex soilborne fungi are nowadays the most serious threatening disease affecting olive trees (Olea europaea) in Tunisia and presumably in many Mediterranean basin countries. Fusarium is one of the important phytopathogenic genera associated with dieback symptoms of olive trees. The objective of the present study was to confirm the pathogenicity of Fusarium spp. isolated from several olive-growing areas in Tunisia. According to the pathogenic test done on young olive trees (cv. Chemlali), 23 out of 104 isolates of Fusarium spp. were found to be pathogenic and the others were weakly or not pathogenic. The pathogenic Fusarium spp. isolates were characterized using molecular methods based on ITS PCR. Isolation results revealed the predominance of Fusarium solani (56.5%) and F. oxysporum species (21.7%) compared to F. chalmydosporum (8.7%), F. brachygibbosum (8.7%) and F. acuminatum (4.34%). Based on pathogenicity test, disease severity was highly variable among the 23 pathogenic isolates tested (P < 0.05) where F. solani was the most aggressive dieback agent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows that Fusarium spp. might be a major agent causing dieback disease of olive trees in Tunisia.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFusarium solani 3aOlea europaea 3abasins 3adieback 3adisease severity 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apathogenicity 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asoil fungi 3awilting 3aTunisia1 aSellami, Hanen1 aGharbi, Yâakoub1 aKrid, Samira1 aCheffi, Manel1 aKammoun, Sonia1 aDammak, Mariem1 aMseddi, Aymen1 aGdoura, Radhouane1 aTriki, Mohamed Ali0 t3 Biotech.g2017 May, v. 7, no. 1 p.28-28dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-016-0587-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245014900183300001800332520151700350592002801867650003401895650001101929650001701940650002201957650001201979650001701991650001602008650001502024650000902039650001002048650001402058650003002072650002302102650001902125650002602144650001002170650000902180651001102189653000702200653000702207653001302214653002302227653001902250653002702269700002202296700002002318700002502338700002302363700002002386773013002406856008102536852000902617655001202626IND60651496120221120231740.0190711e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065149612DNAL7 a286416002pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800170012402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnez, Marija14aThe influence of food consumption and socio-economic factors on the relationship between zinc and iron intake and status in a healthy population  ap. 2486-2498.  aTo examine Zn and Fe nutritional status of a healthy population by means of anthropometric, dietary and biochemical measurements and to investigate the relationship of usual Zn and Fe dietary intakes to Zn and Fe status.

The prevalence of study participants with inadequate micronutrient intakes was calculated using the Estimated Average Requirement cut-point method. Serbia, Europe. Apparently healthy adults (25–65 years of age). Mean daily Zn and Fe intakes were 9·1 mg and 11·6 mg for males and 7·3 mg and 9·4 mg for females, respectively. Five per cent of the study population had inadequate dietary Fe intake and 15–25 % had inadequate Zn intake. Lower Hb concentrations were measured in women with lower Zn intakes. No differences in Fe and Zn intakes and status among various socio-economic groups were observed, except for Fe intake between the low-income and affluent groups. Regular follow-ups are needed to ensure that potential deficiencies of Zn and Fe do get recognized and addressed in a timely manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEstimated Average Requirement 3aadults 3ablood plasma 3aerythrocyte count 3afemales 3afood choices 3afood intake 3ahematocrit 3airon 3amales 3anutrients 3anutrition risk assessment 3anutritional status 3aquestionnaires 3asocioeconomic factors 3awomen 3azinc 3aSerbia 0aZn 0aFe 0aMinerals 0aHealthy population 0aDietary intake 0aSocio-economic factors1 aNikolić, Marina,1 aZekovic, Milica1 aStangoulis, James CR1 aGurinovic, Mirjana1 aGlibetic, Maria0 tPublic health nutrition.g2017 Oct., v. 20, no. 14 p.2486-2498dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800170012403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245005600201300001600257500001100273520156200284592002801846650001601874650001901890650001601909650001401925650001701939650001901956650002601975650001102001650002502012650001502037650001302052650001302065650001702078700001802095700002402113700002502137700001502162773012902177856007802306852000902384655001202393IND60687175520221120213502.0200327e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068717552DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2019006752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBegum, Jubeda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3636-479210aRecent advances in the diagnosis of dermatophytosis  ap. 293-303.  aREVIEW  aDermatophytosis is a disease of global significance caused by pathogenic keratinolytic fungi called dermatophytes in both animals and humans. The recent taxonomy of dermatophytes classifies them into six pathogenic genera, namely Microsporum, Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, Nannizzia, Lophophyton and Arthroderma. It is because of the delayed diagnostic nature and low accuracy of dermatophyte detection by conventional methods that paved the path for the evolution of molecular diagnostic techniques, which provide the accurate and rapid diagnosis of dermatophytosis for an appropriate, timely antifungal therapy that prevents the nonspecific over‐the‐counter self‐medication. This review focuses on the importance of rapid and accurate diagnosis of dermatophytosis, limitations of conventional methods, selection of targets in diagnosis, and factors affecting sensitivity and specificity of various molecular diagnostic technologies in the diagnosis of dermatophytosis. Generally, all the molecular techniques have a significant edge over the conventional methods of culture and microscopy in the dermatophytosis diagnosis. However, in mycology laboratory, the suitability of any molecular diagnostic technique in the diagnosis of dermatophytosis is driven by the requirement of time, economy, complexity, the range of species spectrum detected and the scale of diagnostic output required. Thus, various choices involved in the pursuit of a diagnosis of dermatophytosis are determined by the available conditions and the facilities in the laboratory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthroderma 3aEpidermophyton 3aMicrosporum 3aNannizzia 3aTrichophyton 3adermatomycoses 3adiagnostic techniques 3ahumans 3akeratinophilic fungi 3amicroscopy 3amycology 3ataxonomy 3atherapeutics1 aMir, Nasir A.1 aLingaraju, Madhu C.1 aBuyamayum, Bidyarani1 aDev, Kapil0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2020 Apr., v. 60, no. 4 p.293-303dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39022x0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2019006753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012300157300002000280520154200300592002801842650001901870650002801889650001401917650001401931650001501945650002301960650001701983650001702000650001002017650001802027650001502045650002202060650001402082650001102096650001202107650001002119650000902129650001302138650001902151650001502170650001802185650002002203650001402223650001602237650001202253650001402265700001702279700001502296773012502311856007402436852000902510655001202519IND60666888820221120030831.0190919e20141124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066688882DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra09761k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Mengying10aPolymer micelle-based combination therapy of paclitaxel and resveratrol with enhanced and selective antitumor activity  ap. 64151-64161.  aOwing to the low therapeutic efficacy and high toxicity associated with conventional single drug chemotherapy, combination therapy has been adopted in clinics. We employed polymer micelles for sequential delivery of resveratrol (RES) and paclitaxel (PTX) to obtain a synergistic anticancer activity. Briefly, PTX and RES co-encapsulated micelles were prepared by a thin film method using mPEG-b-PLA block copolymers as carriers with a particle diameter of 20 nm and high encapsulation efficiencies of 95% for both PTX and RES. Furthermore, time-dependent sequential release of two drugs resulted in sensitizing the cancer cells to apoptosis. In vitro cytotoxicity tests the combination strategy exerted a synergistic effect (combination index, CI = 0.7–0.8) both in the PTX-resistant human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial (A549/T) cell line and mice sarcoma 180 (S180) cells while showing very limited toxicity towards the normal human hepatic (L02) cell strain and normal human kidney (HK-2) cell line, which could be illustrated from manipulating ROS levels by redox modulation and reducing protective autophagy. In vivo, the combination therapy achieved the best antitumor effect in all treatment groups in S180 bearing mice and evoked the most significant changes in the cytoarchitecture leading to tumor regression according to the histological studies. In conclusion, PTX and RES co-encapsulated micelles would provide a potential strategy to selectively treat cancers by inducing ROS-dependent apoptosis and inhibiting autophagy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acell lines 3acomposite polymers 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aepithelium 3afilms (materials) 3ahistology 3ahumans 3akidneys 3alungs 3amice 3amicelles 3aneoplasm cells 3apaclitaxel 3aparticle size 3aredox reactions 3aremission 3aresveratrol 3asarcoma 3asynergism1 aZhu, Jinfang1 aQiu, Liyan0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 24, v. 4, no. 109 p.64151-64161dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra09761k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094040001800116100002100134245016200155300001600317520101700333592002801350650000801378650001601386650001301402650001001415650001201425650002101437650001601458650001701474650001001491651001301501653001901514653001801533653000901551700002001560700002001580700001901600700002601619700002401645773013901669856006901808852000901877655001201886IND60786785220221119021815.0220805e20220804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078678522DNAL7 a10.1645/22-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurden, Lance A.10aSucking Lice (Phthiraptera: Anoplura) Parasitizing Mongolian Rodents with the Description of a New Species of Hoplopleura from Mountain Voles (Alticola spp.)  ap. 353-365.  aThe sucking louse fauna associated with Mongolian mammals is inadequately known.

Enteric disease in poultry can have devastating economic effects on producers, due to high mortality rates and poor feed efficiency. Clostridia are considered to be among the most important agents of enteric disease in poultry. Diagnosis of enteric diseases produced by clostridia is usually challenging, mainly because many clostridial species can be normal inhabitants of the gut, making it difficult to determine their role in virulence. The most common clostridial enteric disease in poultry is necrotic enteritis, caused by Clostridium perfringens, which typically occurs in broiler chickens but has also been diagnosed in various avian species including turkeys, waterfowl, and ostriches. Diagnosis is based on clinical and pathological findings. Negative culture and toxin detection results may be used to rule out this disease, but isolation of C. perfringens and/or detection of its alpha toxin are of little value to confirm the disease because both are often found in the intestine of healthy birds. Ulcerative enteritis, caused by Clostridium colinum, is the other major clostridial enteric disease of poultry. Diagnosis of ulcerative enteritis is by documentation of typical pathological findings, coupled with isolation of C. colinum from the intestine of affected birds. Other clostridial enteric diseases include infections produced by Clostridium difficile, Clostridium fallax, and Clostridium baratii.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium baratii 3aClostridium colinum 3aClostridium difficile 3aClostridium fallax 3aClostridium perfringens 3abroiler chickens 3abusiness enterprises 3afeed conversion 3aintestines 3amortality 3anecrotic enteritis 3aostriches 3apoultry diseases 3aturkeys 3avirulence 3awaterfowl 0aClostridium 0adiagnosis 0aenteric 0apoultry1 aSonger, J.

The oxidant-sensitive transcription factor, nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), regulates expression of inflammatory mediators such as interferon γ (IFN-γ), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). These inflammatory mediators increased in gastric mucosal tissues from patients infected with H pylori. Angelica keiskei (AK), a green leafy vegetable, is rich in carotenoids and flavonoids and shows antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, we hypothesized that AK may protect the gastric mucosa of H pylori–infected mice against inflammation. We determined lipid peroxide abundance, myeloperoxidase activity, expression levels of inflammatory mediators (IFN-γ, COX-2, and iNOS), NF-κB–DNA binding activity, and histologic changes in gastric mucosal tissues. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine served as the positive control treatment. Supplementation with AK suppressed increases in lipid peroxide abundance, myeloperoxidase activity, induction of inflammatory mediators (IFN-γ, COX-2, and iNOS), activation of NF-κB, and degradation of nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor α in gastric mucosal tissue from H pylori–infected mice. Inhibition of H pylori–induced alterations by AK was similar to that by N-acetylcysteine. Taken together, these results suggest that supplementation with AK may prevent H pylori–induced gastric inflammation by inhibiting NF-κB–mediated induction of inflammatory mediators in the gastric mucosa of patients infected with H pylori.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngelica keiskei 3aHelicobacter 3aacetylcysteine 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3acarcinogenesis 3acarotenoids 3aflavonoids 3agastric mucosa 3agenes 3agreen leafy vegetables 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3alipids 3amice 3amyeloperoxidase 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3apolypeptides 3aprostaglandin synthase 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aAngelica keiskei 0aHelicobacter pylori 0aInflammatory mediators 0aGastric mucosa 0aMice 0aAK 0acDNA 0aCOX-2 0aEMSA 0aIκBα 0aIFN-γ 0aiNOS 0aLPO 0aMPO 0amRNA 0aNAC 0aNF-κB 0aNO 0aPMN 0aqRT-PCR 0aROS1 aLim, Joo Weon1 aKim, Hoguen1 aKim, Hyeyoung0 tNutrition research.g2016 May, v. 36 p.488-497dElsevier Inc.x0271-53177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2015.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100006500135245015400200300001600354520155900370592002801929650001601957650002201973650002701995650001602022650001502038650000902053650002102062650001402083650001102097650001402108650001702122650001102139651001102150651002502161653002302186653002202209653001502231653002102246653002702267653003102294773014002325856007002465852000902535655001202544IND60786785320221119021742.0220805e20220727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078678532DNAL7 a10.1645/22-352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcogliese, David J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7734-896710aRecruitment and Seasonal Occurrence of Parasites in Juvenile Invasive Round Gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) in the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada  ap. 337-342.  aThe round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is an invasive species that has become one of the most abundant fish in the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada over the past 15 yr. Since its introduction, the round goby has acquired a number of native parasites, yet little is known about the dynamics of parasite recruitment. To examine this question, young-of-the-year and juvenile round gobies were collected monthly from 2 localities in the river (Îles de la Paix, Île Dorval) from June through November 2012. At Îles de la Paix, round gobies (n = 180) were infected with 3 species of parasites, all larval stages (Diplostomum spp., Tylodelphys scheuringi, Neoechinorhynchus tenellus). Prevalence of the digenean Diplostomum spp. varied from 3.3 to 13.3%, and mean abundance from 0.03 to 0.53 from June through September, with a maximum in August. The digenean T. scheuringi was seen only in August, at a prevalence of 10.0% and a mean abundance of 0.53. The acanthocephalan N. tenellus was observed in June, August, and September, prevalence ranging from 3.3 to 10.0% and mean abundance from 0.03 to 0.27. Maximum infection for all 3 species occurred in August. All infected fish were ≥44 mm in total length (TL). Fish infected with more than 1 parasite species were >60 mm TL. No round goby (n = 178) was infected at Île Dorval. This study demonstrated that the invasive round goby starts to acquire parasite infections in the St. Lawrence River in the first year of life and may contribute to the transmission of some parasites within this ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplostomum 3aNeoechinorhynchus 3aNeogobius melanostomus 3aTylodelphys 3aecosystems 3afish 3ainvasive species 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3arivers 3aQuebec 3aSaint Lawrence River 0aHelminth parasites 0aYoung-of-the-year 0aFreshwater 0aDiplostomum spp. 0aTylodelphys scheuringi 0aNeoechinorhynchus tenellus0 tJournal of parasitology.g2022 July 27, v. 108, no. 4 p.337-342dAmerican Society of ParasitologistswJournal:jnl45570x0022-33957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1645/22-353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04491naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100002300186245015800209300001200367506007600379520236000455592002802815506003702843650002202880650002602902650001102928650001502939650001102954650001502965650003802980650001103018650001203029650001703041650001203058650001803070650001303088650003003101650001803131650002003149650001203169650006503181650002103246650002103267650001103288650001103299650001103310650003803321650005203359650001203411651001003423651001003433700002303443700002403466700002603490700002203516700002203538700002303560700002103583773011203604856008003716852000903796655001203805IND50060924820221207094809.0190823e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006092482DNAL7 aPMC34956332pmcid7 a230135512pmid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-5-2122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTchouassi, David P10aCharacterization of malaria transmission by vector populations for improved interventions during the dry season in the Kpone-on-Sea area of coastal Ghana  ap. 212.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Malaria is a major public health problem in Ghana. We present a site-specific entomological study of malaria vectors and transmission indices as part of an effort to develop a site for the testing of improved control strategies including possible vaccine trials. METHODS: Pyrethrum spray catches (PSC), and indoor and outdoor human landing collections of adult female anopheline mosquitoes were carried out over a six-month period (November 2005 - April 2006) at Kpone-on-Sea, a fishing village in southern Ghana. These were morphologically identified to species level and sibling species of the Anopheles gambiae complex further characterized by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect Plasmodium falciparum mosquito infectivity and host blood meal sources. Parity rate was examined based on dilatation of ovarian tracheoles following dissection. RESULTS: Of the 1233 Anopheles mosquitoes collected, An. gambiae s.l. was predominant (99.5%), followed by An. funestus (0.4%) and An. pharoensis (0.1%). All An. gambiae s.l. examined (480) were identified as An. gambiae s.s. with a majority of M molecular form (98.2%) and only 1.8% S form with no record of M/S hybrid. A significantly higher proportion of anophelines were observed outdoors relative to indoors (χ² = 159.34, df = 1, p < 0.0000). Only An. gambiae M molecular form contributed to transmission with a high degree of anthropophily, parity rate and an estimated entomological inoculation rate (EIR) of 62.1 infective bites/person/year. The Majority of the infective bites occurred outdoors after 09.00 pm reaching peaks between 12.00-01.00 am and 03.00-04.00 am. CONCLUSION: Anopheles gambiae M molecular form is responsible for maintaining the status quo of malaria in the surveyed site during the study period. The findings provide a baseline for evidence-based planning and implementation of improved malaria interventions. The plasticity observed in biting patterns especially the combined outdoor and early biting behavior of the vector may undermine the success of insecticide-based strategies using insecticide treated nets (ITN) and indoor residual spray (IRS). As such, novel or improved vector interventions should be informed by the local malaria epidemiology data as it relates to vector behavior.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aadults 3ablood meal 3acoasts 3adry season 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumans 3ahybrids 3ainsecticides 3amalaria 3apathogenicity 3aplanning 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3asibling species 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxparasitology. 2aChild, Preschool 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMalaria, Falciparumxtransmission 2aPlasmodium falciparumxisolation & purification 2aSeasons 3aGhana 0aGhana1 aQuakyi, Isabella A1 aAddison, Ebenezer A1 aBosompem, Kwabena M.,1 aWilson, Michael D1 aAppawu, Maxwell A1 aBrown, Charles A.,1 aBoakye, Daniel A0 tParasites & vectors.g2012 Dec., v. 5, no. 1 p.212-212dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-5-2123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245004500168300001800213520181400231592002802045650000802073650001502081650001502096650001602111650002102127650002102148650002102169650001502190650001602205650001102221650002002232650000902252650001202261650001502273650002102288650001502309650002102324650002402345700001902369700001602388700001902404700001802423700002102441773011002462856008602572852000902658655001202667IND60563485120221123034013.0170223e20170221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056348512DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b047562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Lanshuang10aDNA Generated Electric Current Biosensor  ap. 2547-2552.  aIn addition to its primary function as a genetic material, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is also a potential biologic energy source for molecular electronics. For the first time, we demonstrate that DNA can generate a redox electric current. As an example of this new functionality, DNA generated redox current was used for electrochemical detection of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a clinically important breast cancer biomarker. To induce redox current, the phosphate of the single stranded DNA aptamer backbone was reacted with molybdate to form redox molybdophosphate precipitate and generate an electrochemical current of ∼16.8 μA/μM cm². This detection of HER2 was performed using a sandwich detection assay. A HER2 specific peptide was immobilized onto a gold electrode surface for capturing HER2 in buffer and serum. The HER2 specific aptamer was used as both ligand to bind the captured HER2 and to generate a redox current signal. When tested for HER2 detection, the electrochemical current generated by the aptasensor was proportional to HER2 concentration in the range of 0.01 to 5 ng/mL, with a current generated in the range of ∼6.37 to 31.8 μA/cm² in both buffer and serum. This detection level is within the clinically relevant range of HER2 concentrations. This method of electrochemical signal amplification greatly simplifies the signal transduction of aptasensors, broadening their use for HER2 analysis. This novel approach of using the same aptamer as biosensor ligand and as transducer can be universally extended to other aptasensors for a wide array of biodetection applications. Moreover, electric currents generated by DNA or other nucleic acids can be used in molecular electronics or implanted devices for both power generation and measurement of output.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3abreast neoplasms 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3aerbB-2 receptor 3agold 3aligands 3amolybdates 3aoligonucleotides 3aphosphates 3apower generation 3asignal transduction1 aHu, Shengqiang1 aGuo, Linyan1 aShen, Congcong1 aYang, Minghui1 aRasooly, Avraham0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2017 Feb. 21, v. 89, no. 4 p.2547-2552dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b047563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012300164300001800287520200700305592002802312596003602340596007602376596007702452650001702529650001502546650001702561650001902578650001802597650001302615650001502628650001402643650002002657650002102677650001102698650001602709650001802725650002002743700001402763700002602777700001702803700001602820700002602836700001502862700005602877773014602933856008303079852000903162655001203171IND60699819820221120051548.0210720e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069981982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-020-10672-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yinghui10aTime-course transcriptome analysis reveals the mechanisms of Burkholderia sp. adaptation to high phenol concentrations  ap. 5873-5887.  aMicrobial tolerance to phenolic pollutants is the key to their efficient biodegradation. However, the metabolic mechanisms that allow some microorganisms to adapt to high phenol concentrations remain unclear. In this study, to reveal the underlying mechanisms of how Burkholderia sp. adapt to high phenol concentrations, the strain’s tolerance ability and time-course transcriptome in combination with cell phenotype were evaluated. Surprisingly, Burkholderia sp. still grew normally after a long adaptation to a relatively high phenol concentration (1500 mg/L) and exhibited some time-dependent changes compared to unstressed cells prior to the phenol addition. Time-course transcriptome analysis results revealed that the mechanism of adaptations to phenol was an evolutionary process that transitioned from tolerance to positive degradation through precise gene regulation at appropriate times. Specifically, basal stress gene expression was upregulated and contributed to phenol tolerance, which involved stress, DNA repair, membrane, efflux pump and antioxidant protein-coding genes, while a phenol degradation gene cluster was specifically induced. Interestingly, both the catechol and protocatechuate branches of the β-ketoadipate pathway contributed to the early stage of phenol degradation, but only the catechol branch was used in the late stage. In addition, pathways involving flagella, chemotaxis, ATP-binding cassette transporters and two-component systems were positively associated with strain survival under phenolic stress. This study provides the first insights into the specific response of Burkholderia sp. to high phenol stress and shows potential for application in remediation of polluted environments. KEY POINTS: • Shock, DNA repair and antioxidant-related genes contributed to phenol tolerance. • β-Ketoadipate pathway branches differed at different stages of phenol degradation. • Adaptation mechanisms transitioned from negative tolerance to positive degradation.  aPublisher supplied data  a81703777cYoung Scientists Fund  a2019ZDLNY01-02-01cShaanxi Provincial Science and Technology Department  a2015k14cApplication Basial Research Fund of Shaanxi Academy of Sciences 3aBurkholderia 3aDNA repair 3aantioxidants 3abiodegradation 3abiotechnology 3acatechol 3achemotaxis 3aflagellum 3agene expression 3amultigene family 3aphenol 3aremediation 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aLi, Lijun1 aAwasthi, Mukesh Kumar1 aTian, Haixia1 aLu, Meihuan1 aMegharaj, Mallavarapu1 aPan, Yalei1 aHe, Wenxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0242-57340 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 July, v. 104, no. 13 p.5873-5887dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10672-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245016400156300001800320520235400338592002802692650001402720650001802734650001102752650001102763650001402774650002302788650001702811700001802828700002002846700001902866700001802885700001902903700001802922773009202940856007303032852000903105655001203114IND60132950120221119191438.0150513e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013295012DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.102772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasvi, Elina10aTwo‐dimensional and three‐dimensional computational models in hydrodynamic and morphodynamic reconstructions of a river bend: sensitivity and functionality  ap. 1604-1629.  aThis study assesses hydrodynamic and morphodynamic model sensitivity and functionality in a curved channel. The sensitivity of a depth‐averaged model to user‐defined parameters (grain size, roughness, transverse bed slope effect, transport relations and secondary flow) is tested. According to the sensitivity analysis, grain size, transverse bed slope effect and sediment transport relations are critical to simulated meander bend morphodynamics. The parametrization of grain size has the most remarkable effect: field‐based grain size parametrization is necessary in a successful morphodynamic reconstruction of a meander bend. The roughness parametrization method affects the distribution of flow velocities and therefore also morphodynamics. The combined effect of various parameters needs further research. Two‐dimensional (2D) and three‐dimensional (3D) reconstructions of a natural meander bend during a flood event are assessed against field measurements of acoustic Doppler current profiler and multi‐temporal mobile laser scanning data. The depth‐averaged velocities are simulated satisfactorily (differences from acoustic Doppler current profiler velocities 5–14%) in both 2D and 3D simulations, but the advantage of the 3D hydrodynamic model is unquestionable because of its ability to model vertical and near‐bed flows. The measured and modelled near‐bed flow, however, differed notably from each other's, the reason of which was left open for future research. It was challenging to model flow direction beyond the apex. The 3D flow features, which also affected the distribution of the bed shear stress, seem not to have much effect on the predicted morphodynamics: the 2D and 3D morphodynamic reconstructions over the point bar resembled each other closely. Although common features between the modelled and measured morphological changes were also found, some specific changes that occurred were not evident in the simulation results. Our results show that short‐term, sub‐bend scale morphodynamic processes of a natural meander bend are challenging to model, which implies that they are affected by factors that have been neglected in the simulations. The modelling of short‐term morphodynamics in natural curved channel is a challenge that requires further study.

Complete understanding of such a sensing system will provide significant guidance for the design of superior sensing materials, which is still lacking. In this Letter, we demonstrate the development of FeP nanowires as a nanoquencher for high-performance fluorescent nucleic acid detection with much superior performance to α-Fe₂O₃ counterparts. The whole detection process is complete within 1 min, and this fluorosensor presents a detection limit as low as 4 pM with strong discrimination of single-point mutation. Electrochemical tests and density functional theory calculations reveal that FeP NWs are superior in both conductivity for facilitated electron diffusion and hydrogen-evolving catalytic activity for favorable electron depletion, providing further experimental and theoretical insights into the enhanced sensing performance of the FeP nanosensor. Both faster electron transfer kinetics and stronger electron-consuming ability via catalyzed proton reduction enable FeP nanowires to be a superb nucleic acid nanosensor for applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aferric oxide 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3amutation 3ananowires 3anucleic acids1 aLiu, Danni1 aHao, Shuai1 aQu, Fengli1 aGe, Ruixiang1 aMa, Yongjun1 aDu, Gu1 aAsiri, Abdullah M.1 aMa, Yukun,1 aSun, Xuping0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2017 Feb. 21, v. 89, no. 4 p.2191-2195dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b047603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012200156300002000278520062300298592002800921650001200949650001400961650001700975650001500992650001401007650001901021650001601040650001601056700001601072700001701088700001601105700001701121773012501138856007401263852000901337655001201346IND60666889120221120171325.0190919e20141119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066688912DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra09766a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Shouli10aSnO₂@Co₃O₄ p–n heterostructures fabricated by electrospinning and mechanism analysis enhanced acetone sensing  ap. 62862-62868.  aSnO₂@Co₃O₄ p–n heterostructure nanotubes have been obtained for the first time via precursor nanofibres and subsequent annealing.

The improvement of sensing characteristics is attributed to the formation of a p–n heterojunction between the two types of semiconductor oxides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aannealing 3acobalt oxide 3ananofibers 3ananotubes 3asemiconductors 3atemperature 3atin dioxide1 aLiu, Haiyan1 aLuo, Ruixian1 aChen, Aifan1 aLi, Dianqing0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 19, v. 4, no. 108 p.62862-62868dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra09766a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01468naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008100169300001100250520045600261592002800717650002500745650001200770650001800782650001000800650001100810650002500821650005200846651000900898700002000907773012400927856008201051852000901133655001201142IND60572468820221120190237.0200911e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057246882DNAL7 a10.1007/s13314-017-0236-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarzadfar, Shirin10aMolecular detection of Turnip yellows virus (TuYV) infecting alfalfa in Iran  ap. 12.  aSymptomatic alfalfa leaf samples were collected from Western Iran.

Nevertheless, they are perishable and susceptible to microbial contamination, leading to an increased health risk for consumers as well as to the economic loss in meat industry. The utilization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a natural preservative has received a considerable attention. Inoculation of bacteriocin-producing LAB cell as starter or protective cultures is suitable for fermented meats, whilst the direct addition of bacteriocin as food additive is more preferable when live cells of LAB could not produce bacteriocin in the real meat system. The incorporation of bacteriocins in packaging is another way to improve meat safety to avoid direct addition of bacteriocin to meat. Utilization of bacteriocins can effectively contribute to food safety, especially when integrated into hurdle concepts. In this review, LAB bacteriocins and their applications in meat and meat products are revisited. The molecular structure and characteristics of bacteriocins recently discovered, as well as exemplary properties are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteriocins 3achemical structure 3afermented meat 3afinancial economics 3afood additives 3afood safety 3ahuman nutrition 3alactic acid bacteria 3alivestock and meat industry 3ameat 3amicrobial contamination 3anutrients 3apackaging 3arisk 0aLactic acid bacteria 0aBacteriocins 0aNatural antimicrobials 0aMeats 0aMeat products1 aMalila, Yuwares1 aSorapukdee, Supaluk1 aSwetwiwathana, Adisorn1 aBenjakul, Soottawat1 aVisessanguan, Wonnop0 tMeat science.g2016 Oct., v. 120 p.118-132dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2016.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010500168300001600273520095100289592002801240650002101268650001901289650002101308650002401329650002401353650001001377650001401387650002701401650001901428700001801447773012001465856008301585852000901668655001201677IND60087448120221121131139.0141102e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008744812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2010.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapoor, Mukesh10aEnzymatic bioremediation of organophosphorus insecticides by recombinant organophosphorous hydrolase  ap. 896-901.  aThe gene for organophosphorous hydrolase (OPH) (GenBank accession no.

The protein was localised in the membrane fraction and no amount of the expressed protein was soluble, thus hindering its purification and further downstream utility. The expressed enzyme was solubilised by mild treatment with ionic detergent [sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS 1.0% (w/v))]. An innovative step of incubation at 4°C was used to precipitate SDS, resulting in catalytically active OPH in the supernatant and detergent at the bottom. This solubilised, SDS-free, recombinant OPH was able to detoxify parathion and methylparathion ranging between 10–80% and 3.6–45% in enzyme reaction cycles after immobilization on Ca-alginate and agar–agar, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abioremediation 3acalcium alginate 3aenzymatic reactions 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aparathion 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asolubilization1 aRajagopal, R.0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2011 Sept., v. 65, no. 6 p.896-901dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2010.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012300168500001900291520112100310592002801431650002501459650001501484650001901499650001701518650001701535650002001552650002201572650001301594650001501607653000901622653001501631653001801646653002101664653003401685700001501719700001301734700002001747700002201767773011901789856008201908852000901990655001201999IND60728917520221121133616.0210513e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072891752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2021.1668872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgrawal, Priyesh10aRiPPMiner-Genome: A Web Resource for Automated Prediction of Crosslinked Chemical Structures of RiPPs by Genome Mining  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRiPPMiner-Genome is a unique bioinformatics resource for identifying Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGC) for RiPPs (Ribosomally Synthesized and Post-translationally Modified Peptides) and automated prediction of crosslinked chemical structures of RiPPs starting from genomic sequences. It is a major update of the RiPPMiner webserver, which used only peptide sequence of RiPP precursors as input for predicting RiPP class and crosslinked chemical structures. Other major improvements are, machine learning (ML) based identification of correct RiPP precursor peptide from among multiple small ORFs (Open Reading Frames) in a BGC, prediction of the cleavage site and cross-links in thiopeptides and identification of non-crosslinked modified residues in lanthipeptides. It has been benchmarked on a dataset of 204 experimentally characterized RiPP BGCs. RiPPMiner-Genome also facilitates visualization of the RiPP BGCs and depiction of the chemical structure of crosslinked RiPP. It also has an interface for searching characterized RiPPs, similar to the predicted core peptide sequence or crosslinked chemical structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aautomation 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3acrosslinking 3adata collection 3amolecular biology 3apeptides 3aprediction 0aRiPP 0across-link 0agenome mining 0amachine learning 0achemical structure prediction1 aAmir, Sana1 aDīpaka,1 aBarua, Drishtee1 aMohanty, Debasisa0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2021 May 28, v. 433, no. 11 p.166887-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2021.1668873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245011900158300001600277520171500293592002802008650002302036650001202059650001202071650002102083650002002104650001402124650001102138650001202149650002302161650001802184650001102202650003102213700001402244700001402258700001302272700001802285700001802303700001702321773015502338856007902493852000902572655001202581IND60114866120221117052652.0141124e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011486612DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.112.0527462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Kai10aEffect of green tea on glucose control and insulin sensitivity: a meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials  ap. 340-348.  aBackground: The results of studies investigating the effect of green tea on glucose control and insulin sensitivity in humans are inconsistent.Objective: We aimed to quantitatively evaluate the effect of green tea on glucose control and insulin sensitivity.Design: We performed a strategic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (updated to January 2013) for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of green tea and green tea extract on glucose control and insulin sensitivity. Study quality was assessed by using the Jadad scale. Weighted mean differences were calculated for net changes in glycemic measures by using fixed-effects or random-effects models. We conducted prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses to explore potential heterogeneity. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to investigate dose effects of green tea on fasting glucose and insulin concentrations.Results: Seventeen trials comprising a total of 1133 subjects were included in the current meta-analysis. Green tea consumption significantly reduced the fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c (Hb A1c) concentrations by −0.09 mmol/L (95% CI: −0.15, −0.03 mmol/L; P < 0.01) and −0.30% (95% CI: −0.37, −0.22%; P < 0.01), respectively. Further stratified analyses from high Jadad score studies showed that green tea significantly reduced fasting insulin concentrations (−1.16 μIU/mL; 95% CI: −1.91, −0.40 μIU/mL; P = 0.03).Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggested that green tea had favorable effects, ie, decreased fasting glucose and Hb A1c concentrations. Subgroup analyses showed a significant reduction in fasting insulin concentrations in trials with high Jadad scores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical nutrition 3afasting 3aglucose 3aglycemic control 3aglycohemoglobin 3agreen tea 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3arandomized clinical trials1 aZhou, Rui1 aWang, Bin1 aChen, Ka1 aShi, Lin-Ying1 aZhu, Jun-Dong1 aMi, Man-Tian0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2013 Aug., v. 98, no. 2 p.340-348dAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:jnl45206x0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.112.0527463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024003700128040001800165100002400183245012900207300001800336520092800354596008301282596004501365650001501410650001301425650001101438650001301449650002401462650002901486650000901515650001501524650001701539650001201556650002701568650002001595650000901615650001401624650001501638650001001653650001901663700002701682700002701709700001601736773017501752856008101927852000902008655001202017IND60520948320221117040550.0160527e20160309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052094832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b053102doi7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b053102chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCersosimo, Laura M.10aBreed and Lactation Stage Alter the Rumen Protozoal Fatty Acid Profiles and Community Structures in Primiparous Dairy Cattle  ap. 2021-2029.  aThe protozoal fatty acid (FA) composition and community structure are important to dairy cattle nutrition and their products. The purpose of the study was to observe if the rumen protozoal FA profiles and protozoal community structure differed by breed and lactation stage. At 93, 183, and 273 days in milk (DIM), whole rumen digesta samples were collected from seven co-housed Holstein (H), eight Jersey (J), and seven Holstein–Jersey crossbreed (C) cows. Rumen protozoal linoleic acid was higher at 183 DIM (8.1%) and 273 DIM (8.3%) than at 93 DIM (5.7%). Oleic acid was the most abundant protozoal unsaturated FA (10.1%). Protozoal rumenic acid and protozoa of the genus Metadinium were higher in J (9.9%) than in H (0.52%) and C (0.96%). Protozoa belonging to the genus Entodinium were more abundant in H (45.2%) than in J (23.4%) and C (30.2%).

WT00C exposed to high concentration of selenate  ap. 304-321.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSelenium (Se) is a nonmetallic element of the chalcogens. It is primarily available in natural environments as selenate and selenite oxoanions. Although selenate/selenite reduction in many microbes is widely studied at low concentrations (<50 mM), the effects of high selenate stress on bacterial growth, morphology, and cell components have not yet been studied. In this study, the response of Herbaspirillum sp. WT00C to selenate stress at high concentration is investigated by microbiological and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques as well as proteomic analysis. Bacterial growth was seriously inhibited under high selenate concentrations and its growth‐inhibitory phase was prolonged with the increase of selenate concentrations. More interestingly, this bacterium was able to recover its growth even if the selenate concentration was up to 400 mM. Its growth inhibition period shortened to 6 h when the bacterium growing in 200 mM selenate for 28 h was reinoculated to the Luria‐Bertani medium containing 200 mM selenate. The high concentration of selenate also induces marked changes in the cell dimension and surface roughness, as revealed by SEM, along with compositional changes in the cell wall shown by proteomic analysis. The bacterial growth inhibition results from the marked downregulation of the α‐subunit of DNA polymerase III and RNA helicase, whereas its growth recovery is related to its high antioxidative activities. More NADPH synthesis and the upregulation of thioredoxin reductase and GPx are beneficial for Herbaspirillum sp. WT00C to establish and maintain a balance between oxidant and antioxidant intracellular systems for defending selenate toxicity. This study is an important contribution to understanding why Herbaspirillum sp. WT00C survives in a high concentration of selenate and how the bacterial cells respond physiologically to selenate stress at high concentration.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0200905cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aHerbaspirillum 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aRNA helicases 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abacteria 3abacterial growth 3acell walls 3agene expression regulation 3aoxidants 3aproteomics 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aselenates 3aselenites 3aselenium 3asurface roughness 3athioredoxins 3atoxicity1 aTian, Jinbao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3225-02961 aZhou, Jiahui1 aNi, Xuechen1 aLei, Jia1 aWang, Xingguo0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2020 Apr., v. 60, no. 4 p.304-321dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39022x0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2019005863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245011900210300001600329520188400345592002802229650001202257650001502269650002002284650001302304650001302317650001702330650001302347650002102360650001702381650001802398650001102416650001402427650001202441650001802453700005502471700006002526773011702586856008702703852000902790655001202799IND60681712520200410000000.0200117e20191209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068171252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b034402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Quan-De1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3941-019210aComparative Chemical Kinetic Analysis and Skeletal Mechanism Generation for Syngas Combustion with NOₓ Chemistry  ap. 949-964.  aEmission of nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) are one of the major environmental concerns arising from the combustion of syngas. Strategies to reduce emission and improve the efficiency of syngas combustion can be developed using computational fluid dynamic simulations to design cleaner and more efficient combustors. Toward this end, an accurate and efficient chemical kinetic mechanism that can describe the combustion chemistry of syngas with NOₓ under engine-relevant conditions is critical. In this work, a comprehensive survey of detailed mechanisms available in the literature for the syngas/NOₓ combustion reaction system is first conducted. A systematic and comparative chemical kinetic analysis of five detailed mechanisms is performed based on the reaction pathway and sensitivity analyses to identify the key reactions of the nitrogen species for a wide range of mixtures including the formation of NOₓ during syngas combustion and ignition of NH₃, H₂/N₂O, and H₂/NO₂ mixtures. Comparisons of the reaction pathways from different detailed mechanisms indicate that the detailed chemistry is controlled by a small set of reactions and species. Recent high-level theoretical studies on HONO and HNO₂ chemistry including previously neglected important reactions are updated. The rate constants for HNO + O₂ = NO + HȮ₂ are calculated using ab initio calculations in this work. An efficient high-fidelity skeletal mechanism consisting of 27 species and 130 reactions is developed based on a combination of the directed relation graph with the error propagation method and the simplified iterative screening and structure analysis method. Compared to the detailed mechanisms, the skeletal mechanism retains the major species and reactions for the syngas/NOₓ system and is validated against the typical experimental data, resulting in a very good performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acombustion 3afluid mechanics 3ahydrogen 3akinetics 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3anitrogen dioxide 3anitrous acid 3anitrous oxide 3aoxygen 3ascreening 3asurveys 3asynthesis gas1 aSun, Yanjin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7786-50241 aCurran, Henry J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5124-85620 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Dec. 09, v. 34, no. 1 p.949-964dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b034403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245009500206300001600301506007600317520176000393592002802153506003702181650001302218650001502231650001002246650002302256650002002279650001302299650001602312650001602328650001002344650001302354650001402367650001002381650001702391650001502408650002302423650001202446650001202458650001602470700002002486700002002506700002002526700002202546700002102568700003002589773013702619856007902756852000902835655001202844IND60114866220221207075034.0141124e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011486622DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.112.0573312doi7 aPMC37125472pmcid7 a237832982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKavanagh, Kylie10aDietary fructose induces endotoxemia and hepatic injury in calorically controlled primates  ap. 349-357.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Controversy exists regarding the causative role of dietary fructose in obesity and fatty liver diseases. Clinical trials have indicated that negative health consequences may occur only when fructose is consumed within excess calories. Animal studies have suggested that fructose impairs intestinal integrity and leads to hepatic steatosis (HS).Objectives: We assessed nonhuman primates after chronic ad libitum and short-term calorically controlled consumption of a high-fructose (HFr), low-fat diet (24% of calories). Microbial translocation (MT), microbiome, and metabolic health indexes were evaluated.Design: Seventeen monkeys fed 0.3–7 y of an HFr ad libitum diet were compared with 10 monkeys fed a low-fructose, low-fat diet (control). Ten middle-aged, weight-stable, fructose-naive monkeys were stratified into HFr and control groups fed for 6 wk at caloric amounts required to maintain weight stability. Metabolic endpoints, feces, liver, small and large intestinal biopsies, and portal blood samples were collected.Results: Monkeys allowed ad libitum HFr developed HS in contrast to the control diet, and the extent of ectopic fat was related to the duration of feeding. Diabetes incidence also increased. Monkeys that consumed calorically controlled HFr showed significant increases in biomarkers of liver damage, endotoxemia, and MT indexes and a trend for greater hepatitis that was related to MT; however, HS did not develop.Conclusions: Even in the absence of weight gain, fructose rapidly causes liver damage that we suggest is secondary to endotoxemia and MT. HS relates to the duration of fructose consumption and total calories consumed. These data support fructose inducing both MT and ectopic fat deposition in primates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPrimates 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3aclinical nutrition 3aclinical trials 3adiabetes 3aendotoxemia 3afatty liver 3afeces 3afructose 3ahepatitis 3aliver 3alow fat diet 3amicrobiome 3amiddle-aged adults 3amonkeys 3aobesity 3aweight gain1 aWylie, Ashley T1 aTucker, Kelly L1 aHamp, Timothy J1 aGharaibeh, Raad Z1 aFodor, Anthony A1 aCullen, J.

Imaging the penetration and distribution of ozone at depth is beneficial for studying the influence of ozone on skin or eyes. Here, we introduced a facile method for three-dimensional (3D) imaging of the penetration of O₃ into the anterior chamber of an isolated crucian carp eye by using optical coherence tomography (OCT) combined with gold triangular nanoprisms (GTNPs) as the contrast agent and molecular probe. We illustrated the specific response of GTNPs to ozone and demonstrated that GTNPs can function as an efficient nanoprobe for sensing O₃. The stabilities of GTNPs in different biologic solutions, as well as the signal intensity of GTNPs on an OCT imaging system, were investigated. Visualization of 3D penetration and distribution of O₃ in the biologic tissue was proved for the first time. The quantitative analysis of O₃ diffusion in the anterior chamber of the fish eye revealed a penetration depth of 311 μm within 172 min. Due to the strong scattering, near-infrared extinction band, and easy functionalization of GTNPs, they could further serve as nanoprobes for 3D OCT or multimodal imaging of other molecules or ions in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius 3acornea 3aepithelium 3afish 3agold 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aions 3aozone 3aquantitative analysis 3atomography1 aTang, Peijun1 aGao, Panpan1 aZhang, Yu Shrike1 aYi, Changqing1 aZhou, Jianhua0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2017 Feb. 21, v. 89, no. 4 p.2561-2568dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b047853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245010200154520202800256592002802284650002902312650001702341650000902358650002502367650001802392650002702410650001402437650002802451650002302479651001002502700001502512700001702527773012602544856007302670852000902743655001202752IND60651926720221122051449.0190712e20170413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065192672DNAL7 a10.3390/su90405972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Yunhe10aSpatial and Temporal Variations in the Ecological Footprints in Northwest China from 2005 to 2014  aGlobal change is becoming increasingly evident, and human activities are also causing severe damage to natural resources and the environment. Therefore, it is increasingly important to study regional sustainability in order to guide human decisions and actions. The ecological footprint is a useful indicator with which to quantify the pressures imposed by humans on natural resources and regional capacities for sustainable development. This paper analyzed the variations in the ecological footprints and capacity for regional development of five provinces in Northwest China in 2005–2014, based on the Wackernagel ecological footprint method, using the standard measurement of the national hectare. The ecological footprints of the five provinces were quite different, mainly because of the differences in arable land and fossil energy resources. The average ecological footprint in Shanxi was relatively high over the study period, at 22,549.86 thousand NHA, which had the greatest demand for natural resources, whereas that of Qinghai was relatively low, at 4163.20 thousand NHA. The ecological footprint in Northwest China increased from 57,770.19 thousand NHA in 2005 to 96,501.66 thousand NHA in 2014, predominantly attributed to the growth of the fossil energy ecological footprint (coal accounted for 72.88%, crude oil accounted for 14.97%, and coke accounted for 6.67%). The changes in the ecological footprint per 10,000 CNY gross domestic product, the ecological footprint diversity index, and the development capacity index in the study period revealed an increase in the comprehensive development capacity in this region, which should improve the regional capacity for sustainable development, but the stability of the eco-economic systems in Shanxi, Ningxia, and Xinjiang require improvement. This analysis provides the reference information for the construction of an ecologically viable civilization in Northwest China and the scientific foundation for the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarable soils 3acoal 3aecological footprint 3aglobal change 3agross domestic product 3apetroleum 3asustainable development 3atemporal variation 3aChina1 aHan, Xiang1 aWu, Shaohong0 tSustainability.g2017 Apr. 13, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90405973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013300169300001600302520152200318592002801840650002401868650004401892650001601936650001601952650001301968650001901981650000902000650002902009650001202038650001002050650002602060650001902086650001502105650001702120650002202137650003302159650000902192650001602201700002102217700003202238700002102270773012002291856008302411852000902494655001202503IND60087448420221121065505.0141102e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008744842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2011.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowak, Bożena,10aMicroorganisms participating in the biodegradation of modified polyethylene films in different soils under laboratory conditions  ap. 757-767.  aThe degree of biodegradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) films modified with Bionolle® polyester in different soils under laboratory conditions was evaluated. Films were incubated in soils from waste coal, a forest and an extinct volcano crater. Prior to degradation studies, soils underwent chemical and microbiological analysis. Film weight loss and mechanical properties, as well as the surface of the polymeric samples determined via scanning electron microscopy, were evaluated after 75, 150 and 225 days of biodegradation. Important chemical changes in the polymeric chains were detected by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Fungal and bacterial species that were able to grow on the film surfaces were monitored in order to see whether the films were easily colonised by autochthonous microorganisms (i.e., typical to each soil). Identification of microorganisms was based on their cellular fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles. Biodegradation of modified polyethylene films in soils led to significant changes (i.e., elongation at brake of 98%) in their mechanical properties that were caused by biochemical modifications of both polyester and polyethylene. Compared to waste coal soil, films underwent rapid biodegradation in soils that were rich in organic matter. Bacteria belonging to the genus, Bacillus, and the fungi, Gliocladium viride, Aspergillus awamori and Mortierella subtilissima, were easily able to colonise both polyethylene and polyethylene modified with Bionolle®.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus awamori 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGliocladium 3aMortierella 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3acoal 3afatty acid methyl esters 3aforests 3afungi 3amechanical properties 3aorganic matter 3apolyesters 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene film 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoil 3aweight loss1 aPająk, Jolanta,1 aDrozd-Bratkowicz, Magdalena1 aRymarz, Grażyna0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2011 Sept., v. 65, no. 6 p.757-767dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2011.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245014800162300001600310520183800326592002802164650002002192650002302212650002302235650002702258650002302285650001802308650000902326650002102335650000802356650001402364650002502378650002202403700002402425700001902449700002402468700003902492773015502531856007902686852000902765655001202774IND60114866420221117052119.0141124e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011486642DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.112.0549242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHursel, Rick10aDisadvantageous shift in energy balance is primarily expressed in high-quality sleepers after a decline in quality sleep because of disturbance  ap. 367-373.  aBackground: Epidemiologic studies have shown an inverse or U-shaped relation between sleep duration and body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2). Moreover, associations between energy balance (EB) and characteristics of quality sleep (QS) have recently been reported.Objective: We assessed the relation between total energy expenditure (TEE) as well as substrate oxidation and QS after disturbed compared with nondisturbed sleep in EB.Design: Fifteen healthy men (mean ± SD BMI: 24.1 ± 1.9; age: 23.7 ± 3.5 y) were included in a randomized crossover study. TEE and substrate oxidation were measured twice for 48 h in a respiration chamber, whereas slow-wave sleep (SWS), rapid eye movement (REM)–sleep, total sleeping time (TST), sleep stage 2 (S2), and QS [(SWS + REM) ÷ TST × 100%] were determined by using electroencephalography. During 2 nights, sleep (2330–0730) was either disturbed or nondisturbed (control).Results: Positive correlations were shown for TEE, activity-induced energy expenditure corrected for body mass (AEE/BM), respiratory quotient (RQ), and carbohydrate oxidation with QS and SWS during nondisturbed sleep. Fat oxidation was inversely correlated with QS and SWS. RQ and carbohydrate oxidation were inversely related to REM sleep. During the disturbed condition SWS, REM, TST, and S2 were reduced, and positive correlations were shown between TEE and AEE/BM with QS. The reduction in QS was stronger in high-quality sleepers; QS reduction was positively associated with increases in energy intake, TEE, and EB.Conclusion: A disadvantageous shift in energy balance is primarily expressed in high-quality sleepers after a decline in QS because of disturbance, implying that good sleepers are most liable to a positive energy balance because of sleep disturbance. This trial was registered at ISRCTN as NTR1919.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3aclinical nutrition 3across-over studies 3aelectroencephalography 3aenergy expenditure 3aenergy intake 3aeyes 3alipid metabolism 3amen 3aoxidation 3arespiratory quotient 3asleep deprivation1 aGonnissen, Hanne KJ1 aRutters, Femke1 aMartens, Eveline AP1 aWesterterp-Plantenga, Margriet S.,0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2013 Aug., v. 98, no. 2 p.367-373dAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:jnl45206x0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.112.0549243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013400164300001800298520148000316592002801796596006401824596005801888596010701946650001802053650001802071650001602089650001002105650002102115650001802136650001902154650001802173650001202191650001702203650001702220650001302237650002102250650002802271700001302299700001402312700001802326700001302344700001602357700001802373700001902391700001702410700001502427700001702442700001602459700001702475773014602492856008302638852000902721655001202730IND60699820220221121061844.0210720e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069982022DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-020-10638-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Yilan10aInterleukin-22 ameliorated acetaminophen-induced kidney injury by inhibiting mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory responses  ap. 5889-5898.  aAcetaminophen (APAP) overdose can lead to acute, severe kidney injury, which has recently attracted considerable attention among researchers and clinicians. Unfortunately, there are no well-established treatments for APAP-induced renal injury, and the molecular mechanism of APAP-induced kidney injury is still unclear. Herein, we explored the protective effects of interleukin (IL)-22 on APAP-induced renal injury and the underlying molecular basis. We found that IL-22 could significantly alleviate the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction, reducing APAP-induced renal tubular epithelial cell (TEC) death in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, IL-22 could downregulate the APAP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and mature IL-1β release in kidney injury. Additionally, the APAP-mediated upregulation of the serum levels of IL-18, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β was obviously decreased, suggesting IL-22 has inhibitory effects on inflammatory responses. Conclusively, our study demonstrated that IL-22 exerted ameliorative effects on APAP-induced kidney injury by alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suggesting that IL-22 represents a potential therapeutic approach to treat APAP-induced kidney injury. KEY POINTS: • IL-22 could ameliorate APAP that triggered oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. • IL-22 could reduce APAP that caused inflammatory responses.

We sought to examine the role of total and processed red meat consumption on all-cause mortality among patients with cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) and lung, in order to test our hypothesis that red or processed meat was associated with overall mortality in these patients. Using data from a population-based case-control study conducted in Los Angeles County, we conducted a case-only analysis to examine the association of red or processed meat consumption on mortality after 12 years of follow-up, using a diet history questionnaire. Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for potential confounders. Of 601 UADT cancer cases and 611 lung cancer cases, there were 248 and 406 deaths, respectively, yielding crude mortality rates of 0.07 and 0.12 deaths per year. Comparing the highest with lowest quartile of red meat consumption, the adjusted HR was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.04-2.57) among UADT cancer cases; for red or processed meat, the adjusted HR was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.10-2.82). A dose-response trend was observed. A weaker association was observed with red meat consumption and overall mortality among lung cancer cases. In conclusion, this case-only analysis demonstrated that increased consumption of red or processed meats was associated with mortality among UADT cancer cases and WAS weakly associated with mortality among lung cancer cases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase-control studies 3aconfidence interval 3adose response 3afood frequency questionnaires 3alung neoplasms 3ameat consumption 3amortality 3apatients 3aprocessed meat 3ared meat 3aregression analysis 0aRed meat 0aCox regression 0aMortality 0aLung cancer 0aUADT cancer 0aCohort 0aEpidemiology 0aaHR 0aPFM 0aPRM 0aRM 0aRPFM 0aUADT1 aChang, Shen-Chih1 aMorgenstern, Hal1 aTashkin, Donald1 aRao, Jian-Yu1 aCozen, Wendy1 aMack, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3775-38851 aLu, Qing-Yi1 aZhang, Zuo-Feng0 tNutrition research.g2016 June, v. 36 p.620-626dElsevier Inc.x0271-53177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2016.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012800156300002000284520112500304592002801429650002301457650002201480650001301502650001901515650001501534650001101549650001601560650001701576650002001593650002101613700002701634700002001661700001901681700001601700700001601716773012401732856007401856852000901930655001201939IND60666889620221120192402.0190919e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066688962DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra09775k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Su Pei10aPromotional effect of silver nanoparticles on the performance of N-doped TiO₂ photoanode-based dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 48236-48244.  aWe report the first successful application of an N-TiO₂–Ag nanocomposite as an efficient photoanode for highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). The N-TiO₂–Ag nanocomposites with different Ag contents were prepared using a simple chemical reduction method and characterized using various suitable techniques. The DSSC assembled with the N-TiO₂–Ag-modified photoanode demonstrated an enhanced solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency of 8.15% compared to the photoanode of a DSSC composed of unmodified TiO₂ (2.19%) under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm⁻², AM 1.5 G). This superior DSSC performance was due to the reduced band gap energy and retarded charge recombination that resulted from the introduction of plasmonic Ag nanoparticles on the surface of N-TiO₂. The influence of the Ag content on the overall efficiency was also investigated, and the optimum Ag content for N-TiO₂ was found to be 10 wt%. The enhanced solar energy conversion efficiency demonstrated by the N-TiO₂–Ag nanocomposite makes it a promising alternative to conventional photoanode-based DSSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reduction 3aenergy conversion 3alighting 3ananocomposites 3ananosilver 3asilver 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3atitanium dioxide1 aPandikumar, Alagarsamy1 aHuang, Nay Ming1 aLim, Hong Ngee1 aGu, Guochen1 aMa, Ting Li0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 02, v. 4, no. 89 p.48236-48244dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra09775k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245005800167300001600225500001500241520109400256536012001350592002801470650000901498650001301507650001001520650001901530650000901549650002901558650001001587650001401597650001401611650001801625650002701643650001601670650003401686650001201720650003001732650001301762650002301775650001501798650005201813650003401865650004001899650003301939650003001972650001202002650001002014650001102024650001002035651001302045653003202058653002402090653002502114653001802139700001902157700002202176700002402198700002002222700002002242700001902262773013202281856008002413852000902493655001202502IND60616334520221121155201.0181016e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061633452DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387134853692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Campen, Hana10aEpizootic hemorrhagic disease in yaks (Bos grunniens)  ap. 443-446.  a2019-12-06  aAn epizootic of hemorrhagic disease associated with Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus serotype 2 (EHDV-2) infections in yaks from 5 herds occurred in Colorado between August 21 and October 3, 2012. Affected yaks presented with fever, lethargy, anorexia, dyspnea, and swollen conjunctivae. Ulcerated dental pads, mucoid sanguineous nasal discharge, petechial hemorrhages in multiple organs, pulmonary edema, and serosanguinous fluid in the thorax, abdomen, and pericardial sac were observed at necropsy. Blood and tissue samples from 8 yaks with similar clinical signs and necropsy findings were positive for EHDV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and 5 yaks were seropositive for EHDV. Tests for malignant catarrhal fever (Ovine herpesvirus 2), Bovine viral diarrhea virus, Bovine herpesvirus 1, Foot-and-mouth disease virus, and Vesicular stomatitis virus were negative. The findings indicate that yaks are susceptible to infection with EHDV-2 and exhibit the clinical signs, and gross and histologic lesions of hemorrhagic disease observed in other ruminant species.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3anose 3anecropsy 3ablood 3aseroprevalence 3ayaks 3aOvine gammaherpesvirus 2 3aherds 3ahistology 3aserotypes 3aVesiculovirus 3adisease susceptibility 3apericardium 3aepizootic hemorrhagic disease 3aabdomen 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3aanorexia 3aepizootic diseases 3ahemorrhage 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3aEpizootic hemorrhagic disease virus 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3amalignant catarrhal fever 3adyspnea 3aedema 3athorax 3afever 3aColorado 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0aOvine herpesvirus 2 0aBovine herpesvirus 1 0aBos grunniens1 aDavis, Charlie1 aFlinchum, John D.1 aBishop, Jeanette V.1 aSchiebel, Anita1 aDuncan, Colleen1 aSpraker, Terry0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 25, no. 3 p.443-446dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387134853693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245013400166300002000300520133700320592002801657650001401685650001201699650001401711650002101725650002501746650002001771650001101791650001401802650001301816650001101829650001201840650001901852700002201871700002101893773012801914856008202042852000902124655001202133IND60566267820221120162918.0170409e20160519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056626782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b022152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHang, Tran Dieu10aMethanol Activation Catalyzed by Small Earth-Alkali Mixed Silicon Clusters Sim–nMn with M = Be, Mg, Ca and m = 3–4, n = 0–1  ap. 10442-10451.  aThe methanol activation pathways occurring on small pure and mixed silicon clusters Siₘ–ₙMₙ with M = Be, Mg, Ca and m = 3–4, n = 0–1 were investigated using quantum chemical computations (density functional theory B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ and coupled-cluster theory CCSD(T)/CBS extrapolated from energies with the aug-cc-pVnZ basis sets, n = D, T, Q) to examine their thermodynamic and kinetic feasibilities. In all cases considered, the cleavage of the O–H bond is favored over that of the C–H bond. The O–H bond cleavage in the presence of the singlet Si₃ cluster is thermodynamically less preferred than on mixed Si₂M clusters, even though it becomes more kinetically favored. Most importantly, the energy barriers for the O–H bond breaking on the singlet Si₃, Si₂Ca, and Si₃Ca clusters are found to be lower than the previously reported results for metal clusters, catalytic metal surfaces, metal oxides, etc. The small mixed Si clusters thus appear to be good catalysts for methanol activation and most probably in other dehydrogenation processes from the X–H bonds of organic compounds. These findings suggest further extensive searches for doped silicon clusters as realistic catalysts that can experimentally be prepared, for methanol activation particularly and dehydrogenation processes generally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aberyllium 3acalcium 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3acleavage (chemistry) 3adehydrogenation 3aenergy 3amagnesium 3amethanol 3aoxides 3asilicon 3athermodynamics1 aNguyen, Huyen

The hybrid or heterostructure of two different atomically thin materials exhibits completely different chemical and electronics behavior as compared to its parent components. Here, MoS₂ quantum dots (QDs) are decorated onto ultrathin NiO nanosheets (NSs) by using a one-pot hydrothermal process. Uniformly dispersed MoS₂ QDs and ultrathin NiO NSs hybrid/heterostructure can provide more active reaction sites and accelerate the charge transfer rate. Benefiting from the heterointerfaces synergistic effect between MoS₂ QDs and NiO NSs, the MoS₂ QDs/NiO NSs electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity towards both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, the MoS₂ QDs/NiO NSs electrode has achieved highly efficient overall water splitting activity, which needs a low voltage of 1.61 V to deliver a 10 mA cm⁻² with superior stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectronics 3ahydrogen production 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananosheets 3anickel oxide 3aoxygen production 3aphysicochemical properties 3aquantum dots 0aMoS2 quantum dots 0aNiO nanosheets 0aOne-pot hydrothermal process 0aOverall water splitting1 aZhang, Jianfang1 aWang, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1479-17151 aYu, Cuiping1 aWu, Jingjie1 aCui, Jiewu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4613-47951 aShu, Xia1 aQin, Yongqiang1 aZheng, Hongmei1 aSun, Jian1 aYan, Jian1 aZhang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7625-22341 aTiwary, Chandra Sekhar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9760-97681 aWu, Yucheng0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 566 p.411-418dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.01.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010800167520176200275592002802037650002302065650002302088650002202111650002302133650001702156650002402173650001402197650001102211650001802222650001602240650001202256650001902268650001902287650002602306650002502332650001502357651001002372653002302382653002202405653001802427653002102445653001302466653002902479700001402508700002002522700001302542700001402555700001802569700005902587773009302646856008602739852000902825655001202834IND60726101220221119051916.0210812e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072610122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e060822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jiafeng10aEffects of light quality on leaf growth and photosynthetic fluorescence of Brasenia schreberi seedlings  aBrasenia schreberi J. F. Gmel, a perennial floating-leaved macrophyte with high economic value as an aquatic vegetable, has been listed as first-class endangered species in China, mainly due to its habitat loss. Protected cultivation is a potential strategy to meet the demand of both plant conservation and vegetable market, whereas pre-experiments are still needed before series of parameters can be properly set for the large-scale growth of the plants indoor. Light quality is one of the major factors controlling the development of plants and consequently becomes an important factor when planting B. schreberi indoor. This experiment used three artificial light sources to investigate the response of B. schreberi seedlings to different light qualities, including the red-blue LED light (red: blue = 5:1, RB-LED), the white LED light (W-LED) and the white fluorescent (W-Fluo). Our results indicated that the responses of B. schreberi towards varied light qualities differed from those of most terrestrial plants. The total leaf number of the RB-LED treatment was the highest; the number of the submerged leaf and the rolled leaf of the RB-LED treatment was higher than that of the other two treatments, but the number of floating leaves was the lowest. Both the specific leaf weight and the pigment contents per unit leaf area were the lowest in the RB-LED treatment. Quantum yield of PSⅡ (ΦPSⅡ), electron transport rate (ETR) and photochemical quenching (qP) measured through light induction curves followed the sequence from high to low as W-Fluo > W-LED > RB-LED, whereas the trend of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) reversed. The maximum potential ETR (Pₛ) and maximum ETR (ETRₘ) derived from ETR curves further verified the trends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrasenia schreberi 3aeconomic valuation 3aelectron transfer 3aendangered species 3afluorescence 3ahabitat destruction 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alight quality 3amacrophytes 3amarkets 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotected cultivation 3aspecific leaf weight 3avegetables 3aChina 0aBrasenia schreberi 0aAquatic vegetable 0aLight quality 0aLeaf development 0aPigments 0aChlorophyll fluorescence1 aYi, Cuiyu1 aZhang, Chenrong1 aPan, Fan1 aXie, Chun1 aZhou, Wenzong1 aZhou, Changfang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8003-05620 tHeliyon.g2021 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.e06082-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e060823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001100149245010200160520110200262592002801364650001901392650001801411650001501429650001701444650002501461650001901486650001801505650001201523650002401535650002701559650001701586650001901603650002801622650001101650650003001661650001601691650000701707650002001714650002801734653002601762653001301788653002401801653002701825653001501852653001001867653000901877653000801886653000701894653001001901653000901911653000701920653000801927653001101935653000901946653000801955700001501963700001801978700001901996700001702015700001802032700001602050773010002066856008402166852000902250655001202259IND60750561520221121193041.0211218e20211030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075056152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fochx.2021.1001292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qi10aIn vitro fecal fermentation characteristics of bamboo shoot (Phyllostachys edulis) polysaccharide  aThe effects of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) shoot polysaccharide (BSP) on the human gut microbiota composition and volatile metabolite components were investigated by in vitro fermentation.

Moreover, the total short-chain fatty acid concentration significantly (P < 0.05) increased from 13.46 mM (0 h) to 43.20 mM (48 h). 16S rRNA analysis revealed several differences in the gut microbiota community structure of the BSP-treated and water-treated (control) cultures. In the BSP group, the abundance of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria was significantly increased, while that of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria significantly decreased. Moreover, the concentrations of benzene, its substituted derivatives, and carbonyl compounds in the volatile metabolites of the BSP-treated group decreased, while that of organic acids significantly increased after 48 h of fermentation.

The objective was to examine aquatic community responses to climate warming. Our record reveals that faunal changes have occurred. Initially chironomid assemblages were dominated by a cold-indicating oligotrophic community but this was replaced by a community typical of more nutrient-enriched conditions and warmer water temperature at around AD 1,700–1,800. After AD 1,800, ostracods and Daphnia increase suggesting that a nutrient enrichment threshold was crossed, probably related to increased planktonic algal productivity. In the early twentieth century, organic content markedly increases and magnetic susceptibility values suddenly drop, indicating a further increase in nutrient input and lake productivity. Since the most likely source of nutrients in the lake is goose guano, this suggests that the size of the bird colony may also have increased over this period. These changes coincide with climate warming suggesting a positive feedback in which climate change is the primary driver of the increasing geese abundance and lake productivity. Our results further suggest that the predicted future warming in the Arctic will continue to have cascading effects on freshwater ecosystems in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomidae 3aDaphnia 3aanimal manures 3afossils 3afreshwater ecosystems 3ageese 3aglobal warming 3ainvertebrates 3alakes 3anutrients 3asediments 3awater temperature 3aArctic region1 aBrooks, Stephen J.1 aSalonen, Veli-Pekka0 tJournal of paleolimnology.g2014 Jan., v. 51, no. 1 p.87-97dSpringer-Verlagx0921-27287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-013-9757-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009600169520134200265592002801607650001101635650002101646650001301667650000901680650001901689650001801708650001001726650002501736650002101761650002001782653001901802653002001821653002401841653002101865700001701886700001701903700001701920700001501937700001401952700001801966773011701984856008602101852000902187655001202196IND60783465520221117085506.0220929e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078346552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1153842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDang, Baokang10aEffect of nano-zirconium oxide modification on flame retardancy of lignocellulose composite  aAs a common renewable raw material, lignocellulose had the advantages of high carbon content and rich active groups, however its poor flame retardancy limited the application. In this paper, lignocellulose and zirconium oxide (ZrO₂) were employed as raw materials, nano-ZrO₂-lignocellulose flame retardant composites (LCZ) were prepared by mechanical grinding and hot pressing. The friction between lignocellulose and nano-ZrO2 was increased by pretreatment using mechanical grinding. After hot-pressing, the ZrO₂ particles were attached on the lignocellulose. The results showed that LCZ composites had a better flame retardancy and mechanical strength. The mechanical strength of LCZ composite reached 34.9 MPa and improved by 31.2 % while the lignocellulose was 26.6 MPa. Owing to the existence of ZrO₂, the heat release rate and total heat release rate of LCZ composite were reduced 61 % and 27 % than that of pure lignocellulose material (LC), respectively. The smoke production rate of LCZ composite decreased by 58 % compared with that of LC composite. Thermogravimetric studies showed that ZrO₂ could promoted the charring of lignocellulose, further formed a carbon protective layer on the lignocellulose surface. Therefore, it provided a better modified method for preparing flame retardant lignocellulose composite.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aflame retardants 3afriction 3aheat 3alignocellulose 3araw materials 3asmoke 3astrength (mechanics) 3athermogravimetry 3azirconium oxide 0aLignocellulose 0aZirconium oxide 0aMechanical strength 0aFlame retardance1 aJin, Tengfei1 aChen, Yipeng1 aZhang, Jiayi1 aFeng, Qiao1 aLiu, Ming1 aSun, Qingfeng0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 187 p.115384-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1153843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011600171520129600287592002801583650001201611650001701623650001101640650002501651650002001676650001301696650001201709653002101721653001301742653002101755653003101776700001701807700002301824773009301847856008601940852000902026655001202035IND60726101320221119051758.0210812e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072610132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e060852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManikan, Vidyah10aTwo-level factorial analysis of the effect of fructose on DHA biosynthetic capacity of Aurantiochytrium sp. SW1  aThraustochytrids are getting increasingly popular due to their high potential role as alternative producers of the high-valued ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). While most thraustochytrids prefer glucose as the major carbon source, few strains have been reported to prefer fructose. One such strain is Aurantiochytrium sp. SW1. In this study, the effect of fructose on DHA accumulation by SW1 was investigated using a two-level full factorial design. Besides, biomass, lipid and DHA accumulation profiles of SW1 cultivated in fructose and glucose media were compared. Results revealed that fructose has a very significant positive effect on the volumetric DHA content. Meanwhile, its involvement in affecting DHA biosynthetic capacity, though significant, is not very profound. It was also found that when cultivated in fructose medium, SW1 had a less steep log phase compared to that of glucose medium. However, after 48h of cultivation, biomass and lipid accumulation in fructose medium outweighed the other. Volumetric DHA content in fructose medium at 96h was 11% higher than that of glucose medium. Overall, fructose was found to be a more suitable substrate for biomass, lipid and DHA accumulation in SW1 compared to the conventional source, glucose.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3afactor analysis 3afructose 3aglucose 0aThraustochytrids 0aFructose 0aFactorial design 0aDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA)1 aNazir, Yusuf1 aHamid, Aidil Abdul0 tHeliyon.g2021 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.e06085-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e060853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03777naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245013100207500002200338520226400360592002802624650002302652650002202675650002402697650001002721650001102731650002502742650001502767650001002782650000902792650003102801650002102832650001802853650001502871650002702886650001402913653002102927653001602948653000902964653002402973653001202997700001903009700002203028700002503050700002703075773007503102856008503177852000903262655001203271IND60570236820221119074259.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057023682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuris, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1769-389X12aL-type amino acid transporter 1 utilizing prodrugs: How to achieve effective brain delivery and low systemic exposure of drugs  aPre-press version  aL-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is selectively expressed in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain parenchyma. This transporter can facilitate brain delivery of neuroprotective agents and additionally give opportunity to minimize systemic exposure. Here, we investigated structure-pharmacokinetics relationship of five newly synthesized LAT1-utilizing prodrugs of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ketoprofen, in order to identify beneficial structural features of prodrugs to achieve both targeted brain delivery and low peripheral distribution of the parent drug. Besides, we studied whether pharmacokinetics and bioconversion of LAT1-utilizing prodrugs in vivo can be predicted in early stage experiments. To achieve these goals, we compared the in vitro brain uptake mechanism of prodrugs, rate of BBB permeation of compounds using in situ perfusion technique, their systemic pharmacokinetics and release of parent drug in brain, plasma and liver of mice. The results revealed that both excellent LAT1-binding ability and transporter utilization in vitro can be achieved by conjugating the parent drug to aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine in comparison to prodrugs with an aliphatic promoiety. The presence of an aromatic promoiety directly conjugated in meta- or para-position to ketoprofen led to LAT1-utilizing prodrugs capable of delivering the parent drug into the brain with higher unbound brain to plasma ratio and reduced liver exposure than with ketoprofen itself. In contrast, the prodrugs with aliphatic promoieties and with an additional carbon attached between the parent drug and phenylalanine aromatic ring did not enhance brain delivery of ketoprofen. Furthermore, we have devised a screening strategy to pinpoint successful candidates at an early stage of development of LAT1-utilizing prodrugs. The screening approach demonstrated that early stage experiments could not replace pharmacokinetic studies in vivo due to the lack of prediction of the intra-brain/systemic distribution of the prodrugs as well as the release of the parent drug. Overall, this study provides essential knowledge required for improvement of targeted brain delivery and reduction of systemic exposure of drugs via the LAT1-mediated prodrug approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3abiotransformation 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3acarbon 3adevelopmental stages 3aketoprofen 3aliver 3amice 3aparenchyma (animal tissue) 3apharmacokinetics 3aphenylalanine 3aprediction 3aprostaglandin synthase 3ascreening 0aPharmacokinetics 0aTransporter 0aLAT1 0aBlood-brain barrier 0aProdrug1 aGynther, Mikko1 aHuttunen, Johanna1 aPetsalo, Aleksanteri1 aHuttunen, Kristiina M.0 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002100162245011600183300001400299500000900313520198900322592002802311650001502339650002302354650002002377650002302397650001302420650001202433650001002445650001202455650001502467650001102482650001502493650000802508650002802516650002102544650001302565650001102578650002002589650001202609651001302621651001402634773012002648856009702768852000902865655001202874IND60663452020221118004307.0191122e198801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066345202DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1988.00021962008000010010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollins, Michael10aQuality of Whole Crop and Pressed Forage from Mechanically Dewatered Alfalfa, Red Clover, and Birdsfoot Trefoil  ap. 45-48.  aepub  aForage harvesting techniques that reduce losses in yield and quality that normally occur during field wilting of silage and curing of hay are needed. A 2-yr field study was conducted to evaluate mechanical dewatering of first-cutting forage of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) harvested at four stages of maturity. Each species, grown on Plano silt loam soil (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Argiudolls), was harvested at weekly intervals beginning on 27 May 1980 and 26 May 1981, and the forage was macerated and pressed at 6.9 × 10⁵ Pa for 2 min. Samples of the whole crop collected immediately after cutting and of the pressed forage were dried at 55°C to constant weight. Birdsfoot trefoil was the highest in N concentration of the three whole crops, and red clover was higher in N than alfalfa in 1 of the 2 yr. Pressed forage of alfalfa averaged 6.0 g kg⁻¹ less N than the whole crop. Pressed forage averaged 106, 151, and 49 g kg⁻¹ more neutral detergent fiber (NDF) than whole crop for alfalfa, red clover, and birdsfoot trefoil, respectively. Birdsfoot trefoil in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD) was affected least by Pressing, and red clover IVDMD was affected most. Results of this 2-yr experiment indicate that mechanical dewatering reduced IVDMD and generally N, and increased NDF concentration. Differences in legume species response to pressing were substantial and would preclude generalization of mechanical dewatering responses across species. However, whole crop dry matter, N, and IVDMD predicted 0.81 or more of the variation in pressed forage IVDMD of the three species, indicating that pressed forage IVDMD predicted from whole crop composition.

Plants from two different locations in Martinique (North and South) were studied. For the north location, two preparation methods were studied: hydrodistillation in 3L or 20 L reactors and steam distillation. Sixty components representing between 87.7% and 93.2% of the essential oil GC/FID chromatogram total area were identified. The most abundant compounds were caryophyllene oxide (from 5.0 to 31.5%), β-caryophyllene (from 4.7 to 32.6%), palmitic acid (from 2.0 to 9.5%), spathulenol (from 1.5 to 8.5%), α-copaene (from 4.5 to 6.9%), 2-tridecanone (from 0.0 to 6.1%) and phytol (from 2.3 to 4.8%). By comparison with the literature describing a first chemotype rich in Germacrene D and a second chemotype rich in limonene and estragole, in our study Germacrene D was only present at 1.1 and 2.1% in the northern oil. Limonene was present in the oil from 0.1 to 0.3%. Furthermore, no estragole was found in this essential oil. Antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from aerial parts of the plant was also investigated. Antibacterial and antifungal activities were observed against A. niger , C. albicans , S. aureus, E. coli, and B. cereus at 0.5%.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-tridecanone 3aBacillus cereus 3aEscherichia coli 3aHyptis 3aaerial parts 3aantifungal properties 3abeta-caryophyllene 3achemotypes 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agermacrene 3ahydrodistillation 3alimonene 3amethyl chavicol 3aoils 3apalmitic acid 3aspathulenol 3asteam distillation 3aMartinique 0aHyptis atrorubens Poit. 0aMartinique 0aantibacterial 0aantifungal1 aNjoh Ellong, E.1 aGonnot, V.1 aBoyer, L.1 aMichel, T.1 aAdenet, S.1 aRochefort, K.1 aFernandez, X.0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2016 Sept. 2, v. 28, no. 5 p.436-444dTaylor & Francisx2163-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2016.11502173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245010500170300001600275520080100291592002801092650001801120650001501138650002601153650002601179650001701205650001801222650001501240650001701255650001201272653003501284653002101319653001101340653002801351653002301379653004001402653001901442653001201461653002601473653002401499700002101523700002201544700002501566773012101591856007801712852000901790655001201799IND60519969320221121225304.0160512e20140122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051996932DNAL7 a10.2478/eces-2013-00472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrzyżaniak, Michał,10aEVALUATION OF THE EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES ON HEALTH CONDITION OF Quercus robur L.

Many companies claim to address sustainability and are engaged in a plethora of sustainability initiatives related to their supply chain operations. However, it is often difficult to make sense of this whirlwind of corporate activities, as research has failed to verify these claims’ veracity. We analysed one hundred and fifty annual reports of fifteen oil and gas companies across Europe, Asia and America to determine whether these companies support their green rhetoric by pushing their supply chain in the direction of sustainability. Content analysis was used to codify and explain what sustainability the companies emphasise in their supply chains. Findings indicate that in addition to the disparity that exists in the supply chain sustainability emphasis in the global oil and gas industry, oil and gas companies in Asia and America were lagging behind and still have a lot to do if they are to make a comprehensive emphasis on the three dimensions of sustainability in their supply chains. We argued that the observed emphasis of these oil companies would not result in a more sustainable oil and gas industry in the future; therefore, we expect them to act more sustainably given the nature of their operations and constraints of the industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoil and gas industry 3aoils 3asupply chain 3awhirlwinds 3aAsia 3aEurope 0aSustainability 0aSupply chain management 0aAnnual reports 0aOil and gas 0aAmerica0 tEnvironmental and sustainability indicators.g2021 Dec., v. 12 p.100145-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27272x2665-97277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indic.2021.1001453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03755naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245025800159300002000417520225100437592002802688650004302716650001902759650001902778650002002797650001702817650001502834650002602849650004102875650001302916650001802929650002902947700001802976700001802994700001203012700001303024700001603037700001603053700001703069700001603086773012403102856007403226852000903300655001203309IND60641966120221122083135.0190506e20170621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064196612DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra03788k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Qingqing10aNew instrumentation for large-scale quantitative analysis of components spanning a wide polarity range by column-switching hydrophilic interaction chromatography-turbulent flow chromatography-reversed phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 31838-31849.  aThe achievement of satisfactory chromatographic performance for every component regardless of the polarity plays a pivotal role in large-scale targeted metabolomics of complicated matrices; however, it is almost impossible to achieve comprehensive retention of all hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances by solely employing either hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) or reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Given the great complementarity between HILIC and RPLC, we attempted herein to find a superior instrumentation scheme for their online hyphenation. New instrumentation, namely column-switching HILIC-turbulent flow chromatography-RPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-TFC-RPLC-MS/MS) was firstly constructed by employing five solvent pumps, two electronic 6-port/2-channel valves, three columns including an Amide-type HILIC column, an HSS T3-type RP column along with a TFC column, a hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Qtrap-MS), as well as some other essential units. Each analytical run was automatically fragmented into loading (0–4 min) and parallel elution (4–32 min) phases via switching both valves. The TFC column was in charge of trapping apolar compounds from the diluted effluent of the Amide column within the loading phase and subsequently transmitting them into the HSS T3 column according to back-flushing in the parallel elution phase. Chromatographic separations of hydrophobic substances were accomplished on the HSS T3 column, whereas the Amide column took the load of separating the other substances. Qtrap-MS always received both eluents from the HILIC and RP columns. Three existing hyphenated HILIC-RPLC schemes, such as serially coupled RPLC-HILIC, guard column-(HILIC/RPLC), and HILIC-trapping column-RPLC, were involved for comparisons. With the assignment of an optimized elution program for each scheme, HILIC-TFC-RPLC-MS/MS was slightly better than the other ones for large-scale monitoring of polar and apolar components in a mimic compound pool containing 100 components. Above all, the integrated HILIC-TFC-RPLC-MS/MS platform can serve as a feasible choice to gain a holistic view regarding both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components in complicated matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ainstrumentation 3ametabolomics 3amonitoring 3aquantitative analysis 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asolvents 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aZhao, Yunfang1 aChen, Xiaojia1 aLi, Jun1 aLi, Peng1 aJiang, Yong1 aWang, Yitao1 aSong, Yuelin1 aTu, Pengfei0 tRSC advances.g2017 June 21, v. 7, no. 51 p.31838-31849dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra03788k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245009800171300001600269500002000285520123000305592002801535650002501563650002401588650001801612650002301630650001601653650001701669650001101686650002501697650001801722650000701740650001401747650002101761650001401782650002701796700002201823700002001845700001701865700002001882700001901902773012901921856007802050852000902128655001202137IND60592457920221117092144.0180404e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059245792DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2017005472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrea Deza, María A.10aArtisanal tanneries: Potential application of inoculants formulated with lactic acid bacteria  ap. 296-301.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn artisanal tanneries, the skins are immersed in cereals fermented by natural microbial flora in order to reduce the pH of the skin, an essential condition for carrying out the final step. The environmental thermal variation alters the fermentation process and affects the quality of the final product. The aim of this work was to isolate lactic acid bacteria from cereals mixture fermented in an artisanal tannery and to evaluate in vitro the acidifying activity of the strains as a first step for the formulation of a starter culture. In most samples, a prevalence of cocci (95%) was observed with respect to bacilli. The best acidifying strains were identified by phenotypic and genotypic techniques as Enterococcus faecium CRL 1943 (rapid acidification at 37 °C) and Leuconostoc citreum CRL 1945 (high acidifying activity at 18 °C). In addition, the biomass production of the selected strains was analyzed at free and controlled pH (bioreactors 1.5 L). The production of biomass was optimal at controlled pH, with a higher growth (0.5–1.1 log units). Both strains were compatible, allowing their inclusion in a mixed culture. These lactic strains could contribute to the systematization of the tanning process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aLeuconostoc citreum 3aacidification 3abiomass production 3abioreactors 3afermentation 3agrains 3alactic acid bacteria 3amixed culture 3apH 3aphenotype 3astarter cultures 3atanneries 3atraditional technology1 aMartos, Gladys I.1 aNúñez, Marta,1 aFiori, Mario1 aGerez, Carla L.1 aFont, Graciela0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2018 Apr., v. 58, no. 4 p.296-301dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39022x0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2017005473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245013100174300001800305520128300323592002801606650002601634650002501660650002501685650002901710650003001739650001101769650002201780650001801802650001201820650004401832650000701876650003201883650004101915650003101956650004501987650003602032650003702068653003302105653003702138653003502175653002202210653000802232700002002240700002302260700001802283700001802301700001802319700002002337773013302357852000902490856007502499655001202574IND4463798420221121221202.0160905e20120328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446379842DNAL7 a223724422pmid7 a10.1021/jf20415592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Hui Gyu10aProduction of a Conjugated Fatty Acid by Bifidobacterium breve LMC520 from α-Linolenic Acid: Conjugated Linolenic Acid (CLnA)  ap. 3204-3210.  aThis study was performed to characterize natural CLnA isomer production by Bifidobacterium breve LMC520 of human origin in comparison to conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) production. B. breve LMC520 was found to be highly active in terms of CLnA production, of which the major portion was identified as cis-9,trans-11,cis-15 CLnA isomer by GC-MS and NMR analysis. B. breve LMC520 was incubated for 48 h using MRS medium (containing 0.05% l-cysteine·HCl) under different environmental conditions such as atmosphere, pH, and substrate concentration. The high conversion rate of α-linolenic acid (α-LNA) to CLnA (99%) was retained up to 2 mM α-LNA, and the production was proportionally increased nearly 7-fold with 8 mM by the 6 h of incubation under anaerobic conditions at a wide range of pH values (between 5 and 9). When α-LNA was compared with linoleic acid (LA) as a substrate for isomerization by B. breve LMC520, the conversion of α-LNA was higher than that of LA. These results demonstrated that specific CLnA isomer could be produced through active bacterial conversion at an optimized condition. Because many conjugated octadecatrienoic acids in nature are shown to play many positive roles, the noble isomer found in this study has potential as a functional source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium breve 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3aanaerobic conditions 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3aconjugated linolenic acid 3ahumans 3ahydrochloric acid 3aisomerization 3aisomers 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 2aBifidobacteriumxmetabolism 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxbiosynthesis 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aalpha-Linolenic Acidxmetabolism 0aBifidobacterium breve LMC520 0aconjugated linolenic acid (CLnA) 0aconjugated linoleic acid (CLA) 0aα-linolenic acid 0aNMR1 aCho, Hyung

In order to improve the indicator gases detection technology and coal spontaneous combustion monitoring, a novel forecast method for toxic gases emission from coal oxidation at low temperature is presented in this paper. The experiment system is setup combined with frequency-domain terahertz technology and coal temperature programming device. The concentration curves of carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide gases from coal spontaneous combustion are estimated according to molecule terahertz spectra. The influences of coal rank and oxygen supply on coal spontaneous combustion characteristics are discussed. Both carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide gases absorption spectra show the characteristic equi-spaced absorption peaks. Results demonstrate that under the condition of lean oxygen, there exists a critical oxygen concentration in the process of coal oxidation at low temperature. Comparing with Fourier infrared spectrum testing, the presented method is highly accurate and more sensitive, especially suitable for early-stage monitoring of the indicator gases produced by coal spontaneous combustion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon monoxide 3acoal 3acombustion 3agases 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3aspectral analysis 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 0acoal spontaneous combustion 0agas monitoring 0acarbon monoxide 0asulphur dioxide 0aterahertz spectroscopy technique 0asamozapłon węgla 0amonitorowania gazów 0atlenek węgla 0aditlenek siarki 0atechnika spektroskopii terahercowej1 aWang, Wen-Zheng1 aShao, Zhen-Lu1 aWang, De-Ming1 aShi, Guo-Qing0 tEcological Chemistry and Engineering.g2014 Jan. 22, v. 20, no. 4 p.709-718dVersitawJournal:23149x2084-45497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/eces-2013-00493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008800170520151000258592002801768650001201796650001701808650001101825650001301836650001101849650001201860650001401872650001301886650000901899653001101908653001901919653002301938653002701961653002401988700001802012700001902030700001502049700001602064700001802080773011702098856008602215852000902301655001202310IND60783465920221117085835.0220929e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078346592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1153882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Caoxing10aUnlocking the role of lignin for preparing the lignin-based wood adhesive: A review  aAdhesives––the resins widely used in particleboards, oriented strength boards, and plywood––are traditionally produced from fossil-based polymers. Owing to the toxicity, environmental pollution, and non-renewable raw materials associated with these polymers, attempts to synthesize environmentally friendly and renewable adhesives from bio-based materials has attracted increasing attention. Lignin is an abundant natural and renewable phenolic polymer with multiple types of functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and aldehyde groups. This has drawn considerable attention to the exploitation of this resource based on these functional groups. Because of the advantages of lignin, continued research efforts have been focused on using lignin to partially or completely replace conventional raw materials for adhesives, such as phenol and melamine. In addition, lignin is also used with other biomass materials to produce formaldehyde-free biomass-based adhesives, such as lignin–furfural, lignin–soy protein, and lignin–tannin adhesives. Despite inspiring progress, the preparation of lignin-based adhesives with performances higher than that of fossil-based adhesives remains a serious challenge. This review summarizes the progress made in recent decades in research and commercial application of lignin-based adhesives for wood products, including lignin-based formaldehyde resins and lignin-based formaldehyde-free adhesives, and proposes perspectives on lignin-based adhesives.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aformaldehyde 3alignin 3amelamine 3aphenol 3aplywood 3apollution 3atoxicity 3awood 0aLignin 0aWood adhesives 0aLignin utilization 0aLignin-based adhesives 0aBio-based adhesives1 aPeng, Zhenwen1 aLi, Jiongjiong1 aLi, Xiaona1 aJiang, Xiao1 aDong, Youming0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 187 p.115388-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1153883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03661naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245007600181500002200257520160500279592002801884650001401912650002001926650001501946650001701961650001001978650001001988650001801998650001902016650000902035650001302044653002502057653001402082653003302096653001702129653002802146653003102174653003002205653004302235653003602278653003702314653005202351653003702403653003802440653007402478653007202552700001602624700002302640700001802663700001602681700001502697700002102712700002102733700002402754700005902778700001702837773007502854856008502929852000903014655001203023IND60570237120221119074925.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057023712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNordling-David, Mirjam M.10aLiposomal temozolomide drug delivery using convection enhanced delivery  aPre-press version  aEven though some progress in diagnosis and treatment has been made over the years, there is still no definitive treatment available for Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Convection-enhanced delivery (CED), a continuous infusion-mediated pressure gradient via intracranial catheters, studied in clinical trials, enables in situ drug concentrations several orders of magnitude greater than those achieved by systemic administration. We hypothesized that the currently limited efficacy of CED could be enhanced by a liposomal formulation, thus achieving enhanced drug localization to the tumor site with minimal toxicity. We hereby describe a novel approach for treating GBM by CED of liposomes containing the known chemotherapeutic agent, temozolomide (TMZ). A new technique for encapsulating TMZ in hydrophilic (PEGylated) liposomes, characterized by nano-size (121nm), low polydispersity index (<0.13) and with near-neutral charge (−0.2mV), has been developed. Co-infusion of PEGylated Gd-DTPA liposomes and TMZ-liposomes by CED in GBM bearing rats, resulted in enhanced tumor detection with longer residence time than free Gd-DTPA. Treatment of GBM-bearing rats with either TMZ solution or TMZ-liposomes resulted in greater tumor inhibition and significantly higher survival. However, the longer survival and smaller tumor volumes exhibited by TMZ liposomal treatment in comparison to TMZ in solution were insignificant (p<0.053); and only significantly lower edema volumes were observed. Thus, there are no clear-cut advantages to use a liposomal delivery system of TMZ via CED over a drug solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatheters 3aclinical trials 3aconvection 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aedema 3aencapsulation 3ahydrophilicity 3arats 3atoxicity 0aDrug delivery system 0aLiposomes 0aConvection enhanced delivery 0aTemozolomide 0aGlioblastoma multiforme 0aMagnetic resonance imaging 0aDSPC (PubChem CID: 94190) 0aDSPE-mPEG-2000 (PubChem CID: 86278269) 0aCholesterol (PubChem CID: 5997) 0atert-Butanol (PubChem CID: 6386) 0aOctyl β-D-glucopyranoside (PubChem CID: 62852) 0aTemozolomide (PubChem CID: 5394) 0aSalicylic acid (PubChem CID: 338) 0a5-(3-methyl-1-triazeno)imidazole-4-carboxamide (PubChem CID: 5381912) 0aGadolinium diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (PubChem CID: 55466)1 aYaffe, Roni1 aGuez, D.q(David),1 aMeirow, Hadar1 aLast, David1 aGrad, Etty1 aSalomon, Sharona1 aSharabi, Shirley1 aLevi-Kalisman, Yael1 aGolomb, Gershon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7369-98311 aMardor, Yael0 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007400170300001200244520233700256592002802593596001802621650001202639650001302651650000902664650002202673650001502695650003402710650001502744650001702759650001302776651001102789700003002800700002702830700002402857700003402881700001902915700002402934773011302958856008303071852000903154655001203163IND60715837820221122061804.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071583782DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04422-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSymeonidou, Isaia10aRapid on-site diagnosis of canine giardiosis: time versus performance  ap. 544.  aBACKGROUND: Infections by protozoans of the genus Giardia are a common cause of diarrhea in dogs. Canine giardiosis constitutes a disease with a zoonotic potential; however, it is often underestimated due to its challenging diagnosis. The objective of the study was to assess the diagnostic performance of an immunochromatographic strip test (Speedᵀᴹ Giardia, Virbac, France) comparing it with microscopy (zinc sulfate flotation) by utilizing the combination of an enzyme immunoassay (ProSpecTᵀᴹ Giardia EZ Microplate Assay, Oxoid Ltd., UK) and the PCR as the gold standard. A positive result in both ELISA and PCR was set as the gold standard. METHODS: Initially, fecal samples from dogs with clinical signs compatible with giardiosis were tested with the Speedᵀᴹ Giardia test and separated into two groups of 50 samples each: group A (positive) and group B (negative). Thereafter, all samples were examined by zinc sulfate centrifugal flotation technique and assayed by the ProSpecTᵀᴹ Giardia Microplate Assay and PCR. The performance of the Speedᵀᴹ Giardia and zinc sulfate centrifugal flotation tests were calculated estimating sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio; the chi-square and McNemar tests were used for the comparison of the two methods. RESULTS: Giardia cysts were not detected by microscopy in 16 out of the 50 samples (32%) of group A and in none of group B samples. Eight out of 50 samples in group B (16%) were tested positive both with the ProSpecTᵀᴹ Giardia Microplate Assay and PCR. Fecal examination with the Speedᵀᴹ Giardia test was more sensitive (86.2%) than the parasitological method (58.6%, P < 0.001) while the specificity of both methods was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The Speedᵀᴹ Giardia test is an easy-to-perform diagnostic method for the detection of Giardia spp., which can increase laboratory efficiency by reducing time and cost and decrease underdiagnosis of Giardia spp. infections. This immunochromatographic strip test may be routinely exploited when a rapid and reliable diagnosis is required, other diagnostic techniques are unavailable and microscopy expertise is inefficient. In negative dogs with compatible clinical signs of giardiosis, it is recommended either to repeat the exam or proceed with further ELISA and PCR testing.  aPublisher supplied data  a92945cVirbac 3aGiardia 3adiarrhea 3adogs 3afecal examination 3agiardiasis 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3amicroscopy 3azinc sulfate 3azoonoses 3aFrance1 aGelasakis, Athanasios Ι.1 aMiliotou, Androulla N.1 aAngelou, Athanasios1 aArsenopoulos, Konstantinos V.1 aLoukeri, Sofia1 aPapadopoulos, Elias0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.544-544dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04422-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245011800201300001600319520132700335592002801662650002301690650001501713650001201728650002301740650001801763650002101781650002701802650001301829650001301842650001701855650001301872653002101885653001301906653001701919653002601936653002701962653003401989653003102023653002702054653002602081700002302107700006402130773012402194856008302318852000902401655001202410IND60683430420221119061125.0201202e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068343042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.01.1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8349-866510aPartitioning of polymers between bulk and porous media: Monte Carlo study of the effect of pore size distribution  ap. 103-112.  aIn this paper we investigated the partitioning of polymer chains between bulk solvent and porous stationary phase under conditions appropriate for the chromatography under critical conditions (LCCC) close to the critical adsorption point (CAP). We addressed the concentration effect and the thermodynamic effect of pore-size dispersity (PSD) and their impacts on chromatography, i.e., the topics which surprisingly escaped from the interest of scientists in spite that the hydrodynamic effect of PSD has been a subject of numerous studies. The phase equilibria in narrow pores (as compared with the size of polymer coil) with attractive pores are complex and the enthalpy-to-entropy interplay is very intricate. The chains are attracted into pores and the partition coefficients are larger than 1, which corresponds to the interaction chromatography (IC), but they are strongly confined and deformed. The entropy plays important role and the elution volumes of chains differing in molar mass correspond to the size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The study thus reveals a new chromatography regime which could be easily overlooked without the awareness of its existence. The unexpected findings are important not only for chromatography, but for understanding the phase equilibria of polymers in porous systems in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aadsorption 3aentropy 3agel chromatography 3ahydrodynamics 3amolecular weight 3apartition coefficients 3apolymers 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asolvents 0aPhase equilibria 0aPolymers 0aPorous media 0aPartition coefficient 0aPore size distribution 0aSize-exclusion chromatography 0aInteraction chromatography 0aMonte Carlo simulation 0aMass balance equation1 aProcházka, Karel,1 aLimpouchová, Zuzana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2290-13580 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 May 01, v. 567 p.103-112dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.01.1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03885naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011500173520201900288592002802307650002102335650001602356650002202372650001902394650001502413650001502428650001202443650002502455650002402480650001902504650001702523650002002540650001202560650001102572650000902583650000702592650001402599650001302613650001102626650001602637650001302653650001402666650002302680650001702703650001702720650001602737653002102753653001402774653001702788700002502805700002002830700002802850700002902878700002102907700002502928700003402953700002902987773012603016856008403142852000903226655001203235IND60750562120221121152150.0211218s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075056212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crgsc.2021.1001692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsadu, Christian O.10aTreatment of crude oil polluted water using stearic acid grafted mango seed shell (Mangifera indica) composite  aThis work focuses on the treatment of crude oil polluted water using indigenous adsorbent prepared using mango seed shell. Esterification of mango seed shell (MSS) as a novel composite with high surface area and well-ordered framework of porosity was prepared and kinetic and isotherm modelling of crude oil removal considered. Batch adsorption studies were carried out with the function of oil water ratio, pH and temperature. Material characterization was carried out to ascertain the nature of the composite prepared and its affinity to oil sorption. Surface morphology was investigated with scan electron microscope (SEM). Chemical composition of compounds was investigated using X-ray fluorescent machine while the X-ray diffraction machine (XRD) examined the crystallographic nature of the pretreated mango seed shell (MSS). Salt addition techniques was employed for point zero charge analysis at ionic strengths 0.05 and 0.1 ​mol/dm³. The influence of pH, temperature and oil/water ratio was found to be highly significant and strongly influences oil removal by the composite. SEM analysis showed several changes on the surface of the composite after acid treatment. XRF and XRD revealed that the raw MSS were highly composed of quartz. The point zero charge revealed that the surface of esterified MSS was predominately positive charge at pH ranging between 4.06±0.1 and 4.04±0.1. However, the composite exhibited high adsorption efficiency at a very low pH of 5 with 90.69% of crude oil removal. Isotherm modelling revealed that the composite material was highly matched to Temkin isotherm model with maximum adsorption capacity of 50.80 ​mg/g. The kinetic data fitted well with Bahattacharya-Venkobachor model. The regenerated biomass exhibited high performance and functionality and used successively in different adsorption activities. Therefore, esterified MSS composite is an efficient, economic viable and sustainable adsorbent materials suitable in remediation of crude oil polluted water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMangifera indica 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacid treatment 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3achemical composition 3acomposite materials 3aesterification 3afluorescence 3agreen chemistry 3amangoes 3amodels 3aoils 3apH 3apetroleum 3aporosity 3aquartz 3aremediation 3aresearch 3aseed coat 3asorption isotherms 3astearic acid 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aMango seed shell 0aCrude oil 0aRegeneration1 aElijah, Onu Chijioke1 aOgbodo, Nick O.1 aAnthony, Ezema Chinonso1 aOnyejiuwa, Chime Thomson1 aOnoh, Maxwell I.1 aIke, Innocent Sunday1 aOnoghwarite, Ohimor Evuensiri1 aChukwuebuka, Aninwede S.0 tCurrent research in green and sustainable chemistry.g2021, v. 4 p.100169-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27616x2666-08657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crgsc.2021.1001693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245019300174300001600367500001900383520125300402592002801655650001501683650001501698650001001713650002201723650001201745650001601757650002301773650001201796650001901808650002001827650002101847650002301868650001201891650001501903650002501918653001601943653002301959653003001982700002202012700002002034700001902054700001902073700002302092700002402115700002402139773013802163856008502301852000902386655001202395IND60728756020221118142613.0210224e20210321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072875602DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2020.18136862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEssekri, Abdelilah10aNovel citric acid-functionalized brown algae with a high removal efficiency of crystal violet dye from colored wastewaters: insights into equilibrium, adsorption mechanism, and reusability  ap. 336-346.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSynthetic dye waste is one of the world's key ecological concerns. The algal biomass has emerged as a promising alternative adsorbent for wastewater treatment. The present study deals with the functionalization of brown algae (BA) by citric acid in order to improve its adsorption ability for textile dye removal in aqueous solutions. The morphological texture (SEM and BET) and surface chemistry (FTIR, EDS-mapping, and PZC) of the novel functionalized brown algae (designated as BA-CA) were analyzed. The performance of BA-CA for crystal violet (CV) dye removal from wastewater was investigated. The isotherm and kinetic adsorption modeling indicate the good fit of Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order models. Optimum monolayer uptake capacity was 279.14 mg/g for BA-CA, which was about two times higher than that of unmodified BA. The thermodynamic parameters clearly indicated that CV removal process was physiosorption, exothermic, and spontaneous in nature. The regeneration study showed excellent reusability of the BA-CA up to five cycles. Overall, the experimental findings lead us to conclude that the BA-CA can be used as an eco-friendly, cost-effective and easily regenerated adsorbent for the purification of textile effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aalgae 3aartificial colors 3abiomass 3acitric acid 3acost effectiveness 3afabrics 3agentian violet 3aheat production 3aphytoremediation 3asorption isotherms 3atexture 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aBrown algae 0amaterial recycling 0asurface functionalization1 aHsini, Abdelghani1 aNaciri, Yassine1 aLaabd, Mohamed1 aAjmal, Zeeshan1 aEl Ouardi, Mahmoud1 aAit Addi, Abdelaziz1 aAlbourine, Abdallah0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2021 Mar. 21, v. 23, no. 4 p.336-346dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2020.18136863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007000148245010500218520097300323592002801296650001601324650001801340650001801358650001101376650001601387650001201403651001001415653001301425653002101438653002701459653003001486653002001516700006401536700002101600700002501621700002501646773012001671856008301791852000901874655001201883IND60750562220221121152213.0211218e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075056222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jafr.2021.1002082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWongnaa, Camillus Abawiera1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1310-551X14aThe impact of adoption of artificial pollination technology in cocoa production: Evidence from Ghana  aThis study analyzed the impact of adoption of artificial pollination on productivity, income, poverty and food security among cocoa farmers in Ghana. Primary data was collected from 206 cocoa farmers drawn through a multi-stage sampling technique and analyzed using Propensity Score Matching. The study revealed that households who adopted artificial pollination had improvements in their productivity, income, poverty situation, and food security. It was also revealed that adopters increased their productivity by close to 15.34% on average, earned between GH₵ 2756.84 to GH₵ 11074.38 more on average in terms of income, reduced their poverty by an average of between 0.83% and 3.53%, and finally, improved their food security by approximately 3% compared to non-adopters. Leveraging on the positive impact of adoption of artificial pollination, policymakers should take steps in implementing artificial pollination to help increase the yield of Ghana’s cocoa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3afood research 3afood security 3aincome 3apollination 3apoverty 3aGhana 0aAdoption 0aCocoa production 0aArtificial pollination 0aPropensity score matching 0aWelfare effects1 aApike, Isaac Akurugu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9175-03141 aSurēṣ, Bābu,1 aAwunyo-Vitor, Dadson1 aKyei, Afrane Baffour0 tJournal of agriculture and food research.g2021 Dec., v. 6 p.100208-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27273x2666-15437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafr.2021.1002083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245013300182500002200315520190700337592002802244650002002272650001002292650002102302650001902323650002702342650002002369650001802389650001302407650001002420650001602430653002402446653001702470653002302487653002902510653002702539700002202566700003202588773007502620856008502695852000902780655001202789IND60570237420221119073315.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057023742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanthosh, Kallivalappil T.10aDesign and optimization of PLGA microparticles for controlled and local delivery of Neuregulin-1 in traumatic spinal cord injury  aPre-press version  aSpinal cord injury (SCI) results in significant tissue damage that underlies functional impairments. Pharmacological interventions to confer neuroprotection and promote cell replacement are essential for SCI repair. We previously reported that Neuregulin-1 (Nrg-1) is acutely and permanently downregulated after SCI. Nrg-1 is a critical growth factor for differentiation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) into myelinating oligodendrocytes. We showed that intrathecal delivery of Nrg-1 enhances oligodendrocyte replacement following SCI. While an effective delivery system, intrathecal and systemic administration of growth factors with diverse biological targets may pose adverse off-target effects. Here, we have developed and optimized an injectable biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles system for sustained and prolonged intraspinal delivery of Nrg-1 in SCI. Recombinant human Nrg-1β1 peptide was encapsulated into PLGA microparticles. Optimal Nrg-1 release rate and duration were achieved by manipulating the porosity and size of PLGA particles. Our in vitro analysis showed a direct correlation between particle size and porosity with Nrg-1 release rate, while Nrg-1 loading efficiency in PLGA microparticles was inversely correlated with particle porosity. In SCI, local intraspinal injection of PLGA-Nrg-1 microparticles maintained significantly higher tissue levels of Nrg-1 for a long-term duration compared to Nrg-1 delivered intrathecally by osmotic pumps. Bioactivity of Nrg-1 in PLGA microparticles was verified by promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation of NPCs in vitro, and preservation of oligodendrocytes and axons in SCI. PLGA-Nrg-1 also attenuated neuroinflammation and glial scarring following SCI.

Commonly the change in chemical composition over time is determined using chromatographic methods that separate the mixture components, but when structural characterization of the degradation products is required, other methods are needed. Arguably the most powerful method for determining chemical structure information is NMR spectroscopy. Here we show that NMR alone, using a combination of simple ¹⁹F, ¹H, and DOSY experiments, can characterise both structure and kinetics of an intact reaction mixture, without the need for any physical separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3achemical structure 3achromatography 3adrugs 3afluorine 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes1 aMorris, G.

Biomass and essential oil concentration were significantly decreased in each species similarly, if they were grown at 40% level of soil water capacity (SWC) compared to the ones growing at 70% SWC. The largest changes were detected in lemon balm (4.47-fold difference in biomass, 2.78-fold difference in EO content) while the response of marjoram was the modest one (1.95-fold in biomass, 1.21-fold in EO content). We found species specific quantitative modifications in the EO composition. The ratio of terpinene-type components increased in the EO of both thyme and marjoram to the expense of their characteristic compounds thymol, carvacrol and sabinyl compounds, respectively. The composition of lemon balm and peppermint, however, did not show considerable changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelissa officinalis 3aOriganum majorana 3athymol 3aessential oils 3athyme 3acarvacrol 3amarjoram 3awater stress 3asoil water 3aMentha piperita nothosubsp. piperita 3abiomass 3aThymus vulgaris 0adrought stress 0aMentha piperita 0aessential oil composition 0alemon balm 0aMajorana hortensis1 aSzabó, Krisztina,1 aPluhár, Zsuzsanna1 aRadácsi, Péter1 aInotai, Katalin0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2016 Sept. 2, v. 28, no. 5 p.391-399dTaylor & Francisx2163-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2016.11766063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245009200201300002000293520143400313592002801747650002001775650001001795650001601805650001801821650000901839650001701848650003201865653002401897653003201921653001801953653001001971653001101981700001301992700002102005700002002026700001702046700005902063773014202122856007802264852000902342655001202351IND60708453720221119143438.0200826e20200728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070845372DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c076092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jiahui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4949-621710aConditional Deoxyribozyme–Nanoparticle Conjugates for miRNA-Triggered Gene Regulation  ap. 37851-37861.  aDNA–nanoparticle (NP) conjugates have been used to knockdown gene expression transiently and effectively, making them desirable tools for gene regulation therapy. Because DNA–NPs are constitutively active and are rapidly taken up by most cell types, they offer limited control in terms of tissue or cell type specificity. To take a step toward solving this issue, we incorporate toehold-mediated strand exchange, a versatile molecular programming modality, to switch the DNA–NPs from an inactive state to an active state in the presence of a specific RNA input. Because many transcripts are unique to cell subtype or disease state, this approach could one day lead to responsive nucleic acid therapeutics with enhanced specificity. As a proof of concept, we designed conditional deoxyribozyme–nanoparticles (conditional DzNPs) that knockdown tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA upon miR-33 triggering. We demonstrate toehold-mediated strand exchange and restoration of TNFα DNAzyme activity in the presence of miR-33 trigger, with optimization of the preparation, configuration, and toehold length of conditional DzNPs. Our results indicate specific and strong ON/OFF response of conditional DzNPs to the miR-33 trigger in buffer. Furthermore, we demonstrate endogenous miR-33-triggered knockdown of TNFα mRNA in mouse macrophages, implying the potential of conditional gene regulation applications using these DzNPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3agene expression 3agenes 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aDNA−NP conjugates 0aconditional gene regulation 0adeoxyribozyme 0aTNFα 0amiR-331 aMa, Rong1 aBlanchard, Aaron1 aPetree, Jessica1 aJo, Hanjoong1 aSalaita, Khalid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4138-34770 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 28, v. 12, no. 34 p.37851-37861dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c076093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245006300177300001600240520099800256592002801254650001801282650001101300650000901311650001501320650000901335650001701344650001601361650002001377653003001397653001301427653002701440653001401467653002301481653002201504700002401526700002001550700002201570773011701592856008801709852000901797655001201806IND60540208620221119135105.0190318e20150715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054020862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.04.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalyander, P. Soupy10aNearshore dynamics of artificial sand and oil agglomerates  ap. 344-355.  aWeathered oil can mix with sediment to form heavier-than-water sand and oil agglomerates (SOAs) that can cause beach re-oiling for years after a spill. Few studies have focused on the physical dynamics of SOAs. In this study, artificial SOAs (aSOAs) were created and deployed in the nearshore, and shear stress-based mobility formulations were assessed to predict SOA response. Prediction sensitivity to uncertainty in hydrodynamic conditions and shear stress parameterizations were explored. Critical stress estimates accounting for large particle exposure in a mixed bed gave the best predictions of mobility under shoaling and breaking waves. In the surf zone, the 10-cm aSOA was immobile and began to bury in the seafloor while smaller size classes dispersed alongshore. aSOAs up to 5cm in diameter were frequently mobilized in the swash zone. The uncertainty in predicting aSOA dynamics reflects a broader uncertainty in applying mobility and transport formulations to cm-sized particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrodynamics 3amixing 3aoils 3aprediction 3asand 3ashear stress 3auncertainty 3awater pollution 0aSand and oil agglomerates 0aTarballs 0aSurface residual balls 0aOil spill 0aSediment transport 0aDeepwater Horizon1 aPlant, Nathaniel G.1 aLong, Joseph W.1 aMcLaughlin, Molly0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2015 July 15, v. 96, no. 1-2 p.344-355dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.04.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013200172300001600304520093200320592002801252650001501280650001701295650003001312650001601342650002501358650001901383650004101402650001301443650001501456650002201471650001301493650003701506650004401543650000901587651001201596653002901608653001801637653002501655653001001680653003601690700002401726700001901750700002501769700001901794700002101813700001701834773011201851856008501963852000902048655001202057IND60537034120221122121358.0160807e20160902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053703412DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2016.11796872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGherib, Mohammed10aChemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from aerial parts of Micromeria debilis Pomel from Algeria  ap. 383-390.  aFor the first time, the chemical composition of the essential oil of aerial parts of Micromeria debilis was determined. The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC(FID), GC/MS and ¹³C-NMR. In total, forty-two constituents were identified representing 92.4% of the total oil, β-Pinene (19.3%) being the major monoterpene beside geranial (8.7%) and linalool (6.5%). Germacrene D (11.4%) and (E) -β-caryophyllene (8.0%) were the main sesquiterpene hydrocarbons while oxygenated sesquiterpenes were mainly represented by caryophyllene oxide (8.0%). Eight samples of essential oil of M. debilis collected in two locations exhibited similar chemical composition evidencing a chemical homogeneity. The essential oil showed moderate antimicrobial activity, with MIC values between 2 μL/mL and 6 μL/mL. The lowest MIC values (2.0 μL/mL) were measured for K. pneumoniae, S. typhimurium and C. albicans .  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicromeria 3aaerial parts 3aanti-infective properties 3abeta-pinene 3achemical composition 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ageranial 3agermacrene 3ahydrodistillation 3alinalool 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3aAlgeria 0aMicromeria debilis Pomel 0aessential oil 0achemical composition 0aGC/MS 0a13C-NMR, antimicrobial activity1 aBekhechi, Chahrazed1 aPaoli, Mathieu1 aAtik Bekkara, Fewzia1 aBighelli, Ange1 aCasanova, Joseph1 aTomi, Félix0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2016 Sept. 2, v. 28, no. 5 p.383-390dTaylor & Francisx2163-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2016.11796873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010200168300001400270520145100284592002801735650001101763650001501774650001101789650001801800650001401818650001301832650003001845650002101875650001101896650001901907650001301926650001201939650001101951653002701962653002201989653001902011653001302030653002302043700001602066700001502082700001502097700001202112700001702124700001602141700005202157700002002209773012202229856008302351852000902434655001202443IND60683430920221119061212.0201202e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068343092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.01.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Jiangmin10aDefect-rich and N-doped hard carbon as a sustainable anode for high-energy lithium-ion capacitors  ap. 75-83.  aLithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are regarded as the most potential devices in the energy storage systems. Unfortunately, the mismatched in the intrinsic kinetics and specific capacities between anode and cathode lead to a depressed electrochemical performance. Thus, designing an advanced electrode material that combines high performance with low-cost is one of the main challenges for LICs, especially in a sustainable anode material until now. Here, a high-energy LIC has been successfully developed using the defect-rich and N-doped hard carbon (DNC) as anode, which is prepared through the carbonization process of the low-cost biowaste sepia without additional template or catalyst. The DNC shows nanospherical structure with a diameter of about 100 nm. Owing to the two-pronged strategy of N-doping and defect engineering, it delivers a high specific capacity (580.3 mAh g⁻¹ at 0.05 A g⁻¹), excellent rate capability, and long cycle stability (1000 cycles). The electrochemical kinetic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have confirmed its prominent pseudocapacitive behaviors and excellent Li⁺ storage capability. As expected, the as-fabricated LIC delivers a remarkable energy density (101.7 Wh kg⁻¹), an outstanding rate capability (56.3 Wh kg⁻¹ at 12.5 kW kg⁻¹), and a superior cycle lifespan (3000 cycles), demonstrating the tremendous potential for the next-generation energy storage systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acapacitors 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3akinetics 3alithium 3awastes 0aLithium-ion capacitors 0aHard carbon anode 0aLow-cost sepia 0aN doping 0aDefect engineering1 aZhang, Yadi1 aLi, Zhiwei1 aAn, Yufeng1 aZhu, Qi1 aXu, Yinghong1 aZang, Shuai1 aDou, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8917-27861 aZhang, Xiaogang0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 May 01, v. 567 p.75-83dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.01.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245006500170300001600235500000900251520117000260592002801430650002201458650002101480650001601501650001501517650001501532650001201547650001301559650002101572650001001593650001501603650002501618650001601643650001101659650001001670700002501680700002601705773012301731856008301854852000901937655001201946IND60663453020221118004449.0191226e199909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066345302DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1999.915783x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWuest, Stewart B.10aVapor Transport vs. Seed–Soil Contact in Wheat Germination  ap. 783-787.  aepub  aThe assumption that seed–soil contact is important for germination of seeds has influenced imbibition research and equipment design but has not been tested. This study compared germination with and without seed–soil contact. Over a temperature range from 3 to 28°C, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seed was either provided with good seed–soil contact or separated from soil by fiberglass cloth. The germination system was sealed to prevent evaporation. At soil water potentials of −4.5 and −2.3 MPa, no seeds germinated in either treatment. When the soil water potential was −1.1 to −0.15 MPa, the average increase in germination time due to the absence of seed–soil contact was 0.3 d (5.6%). Days to germination ranged from 1.1 d at −0.15 MPa and 28°C, to 18.3 d at −1.1 MPa and 3°C. These results show that vapor transport may be the most important mechanism for imbibition and that liquid transport through seed–soil contact may make little contribution. Recognition of vapor transport as a sufficient, and perhaps dominant, mechanism for water transport between seed and soil should improve modeling efforts and planting equipment designs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aequipment design 3aevaporation 3afiberglass 3aimbibition 3aliquids 3aplanters 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3asoil water 3asoil water potential 3atemperature 3avapors 3awheat1 aAlbrecht, Stephen L.1 aSkirvin, Katherine W.0 tAgronomy journal.g1999 Sept., v. 91, no. 5 p.783-787dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1999.915783x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245009100170300001600261520100400277592002801281650002201309650002401331650002001355650001501375650001001390650001401400650002201414650001801436650001401454650002001468653003101488653002501519653001501544653001101559653001801570700002001588700001901608773011701627856008801744852000901832655001201841IND60540208920221119135014.0190318e20150715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054020892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.04.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrooks, Lucy10aBiological effects of long term fine limestone tailings discharge in a fjord ecosystem  ap. 321-336.  aBenthic infaunal data collected from 1993 to 2010 were analysed to examine the effect of long term discharge of fine limestone tailings on macrofaunal species assemblages in a fjord. Relative distance from the outfall and proportion of fine tailings in the sediment were correlated with benthic community structure. Diversity decreased with increasing proportion of fine tailings. Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) was used to explore the temporal and spatial effects of the tailings gradient on macrofaunal functional attributes. BTA revealed that all stations along a pressure gradient of fine limestone tailings were dominated by free-living species. As the proportion of fine tailings in the sediment increased, there was an increase in fauna that were smaller, highly mobile, living on or nearer the surface sediment, with shorter lifespans. There was a decrease in permanent tube dwellers, those fauna with low or no mobility, that live deeper in the sediment and have longer lifespans (>5yrs).  aPublisher supplied data 3abenthic organisms 3acommunity structure 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3afauna 3alimestone 3along term effects 3amine tailings 3asediments 3awater pollution 0aBiological Traits Analysis 0aMarine benthic fauna 0aFrænfjord 0aNorway 0aMine tailings1 aMelsom, Fredrik1 aGlette, Tormod0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2015 July 15, v. 96, no. 1-2 p.321-336dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.04.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245013300163300001800296520103500314592002801349650001601377650001401393650001101407650001701418650001301435650001801448650001501466650001401481700002201495700002001517773013201537856007801669852000901747655001201756IND60541862920221119083348.0160823e20160420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054186292DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b010832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLionetti, Davide12aA trans-Hyponitrite Intermediate in the Reductive Coupling and Deoxygenation of Nitric Oxide by a Tricopper–Lewis Acid Complex  ap. 5008-5011.  aThe reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide (N₂O) is a process relevant to biological chemistry as well as to the abatement of certain environmental pollutants. One of the proposed key intermediates in NO reduction is hyponitrite (N₂O₂²–), the product of reductive coupling of two NO molecules. We report the reductive coupling of NO by an yttrium–tricopper complex generating a trans-hyponitrite moiety supported by two μ-O-bimetallic (Y,Cu) cores, a previously unreported coordination mode. Reaction of the hyponitrite species with Brønsted acids leads to the generation of N₂O, demonstrating the viability of the hyponitrite complex as an intermediate in NO reduction to N₂O. The additional reducing equivalents stored in each tricopper unit are employed in a subsequent step for N₂O reduction to N₂, for an overall (partial) conversion of NO to N₂. The combination of Lewis acid and multiple redox active metals facilitates this four electron conversion via an isolable hyponitrite intermediate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3achemistry 3ametals 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3apollutants 3aviability1 ade Ruiter, Graham1 aAgapie, Theodor0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Apr. 20, v. 138, no. 15 p.5008-5011dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b010833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245017100168520124200339592002801581650002101609650002901630650002501659650001801684650002601702650002201728650001201750650001501762650002001777650001701797650001601814650001601830653002001846653001801866653002901884653001601913653001201929700003201941700002701973700001602000700002002016700002002036700002802056700001802084700002802102700002202130700006202152700005902214700002102273700002302294773011202317856008502429852000902514655001202523IND60697898820221118021211.0201025e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069789882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1183522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPejman, Mehdi10aImproved antifouling and antibacterial properties of forward osmosis membranes through surface modification with zwitterions and silver-based metal organic frameworks  aThis study investigates the effect of surface functionalization of a thin-film composite forward osmosis membrane with zwitterions and silver-based metal organic frameworks (Ag-MOFs) to improve the antifouling, anti-biofouling, and antimicrobial activity of the membrane. Two types of zwitterions, namely, 3-bromopropionic acid and 1,3-propane sultone, are chemically bonded, with and without incorporation of Ag-MOFs, over the surface of a polyamide membrane. Spectroscopy measurements indicate successful grafting of the modifying agents on the membrane surface. Contact angle measurements demonstrate a notable improvement in surface wettability upon functionalization. The performance of the membranes is evaluated in terms of water and salt fluxes in forward osmosis filtrations. The transport data show demonstrably increased water flux of around 300% compared to pristine membranes, with similar or slightly reduced salt reverse flux. The antifouling and anti-biofouling properties of the modified membranes are evaluated using sodium alginate and E. coli, respectively. These experiments reveal that functionalized membranes exhibit significant antifouling and anti-biofouling behavior, with high resilience against flux decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3aartificial membranes 3acontact angle 3acoordination polymers 3afilms (materials) 3aosmosis 3apolyamides 3asodium alginate 3aspectroscopy 3awettability 3azwitterions 0aForward osmosis 0aTFC membranes 0aMetal organic frameworks 0aZwitterions 0aFouling1 aFirouzjaei, Mostafa Dadashi1 aAktij, Sadegh Aghapour1 aDas, Parnab1 aZolghadr, Ehsan1 aJafarian, Hesam1 aShamsabadi, Ahmad Arabi1 aElliott, Mark1 aEsfahani, Milad Rabbani1 aSangermano, Marco1 aSadrzadeh, Mohtada1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0403-83511 aWujcik, Evan K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4966-863X1 aRahimpour, Ahmad1 aTiraferri, Alberto0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 611 p.118352-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1183523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001800183245016500201300001800366506007600384520145600460592002801916506003701944650001701981650002801998650001302026650002102039650002202060650003602082650001302118650001202131650001102143650002202154700001902176700002302195700001902218700002502237700002302262773013202285856008002417852000902497655001202506IND60541863020221207045421.0160823e20160420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054186302DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b011512doi7 aPMC49272642pmcid7 a270219692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrnec, Martin10aElectronic Structure of the Ferryl Intermediate in the α-Ketoglutarate Dependent Non-Heme Iron Halogenase SyrB2: Contributions to H Atom Abstraction Reactivity  ap. 5110-5122.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLow temperature magnetic circular dichroism (LT MCD) spectroscopy in combination with quantum-chemical calculations are used to define the electronic structure associated with the geometric structure of the FeᴵⱽO intermediate in SyrB2 that was previously determined by nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy. These studies elucidate key frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and their contribution to H atom abstraction reactivity. The VT MCD spectra of the enzymatic S = 2 FeᴵⱽO intermediate with Br– ligation contain information-rich features that largely parallel the corresponding spectra of the S = 2 model complex (TMG₃tren)FeᴵⱽO (Srnec, M.; Wong, S. D.; England, J.; Que, L. Jr.; Solomon, E. I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2012, 109, 14326–14331). However, quantitative differences are observed that correlate with π-anisotropy and oxo donor strength that perturb FMOs and affect reactivity. Due to π-anisotropy, the FeᴵⱽO active site exhibits enhanced reactivity in the direction of the substrate cavity that proceeds through a π-channel that is controlled by perpendicular orientation of the substrate C–H bond relative to the halide–FeᴵⱽO plane. Also, the increased intrinsic reactivity of the SyrB2 intermediate relative to the ferryl model complex is correlated to a higher oxyl character of the FeᴵⱽO at the transition states resulting from the weaker ligand field of the halogenase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive sites 3aalpha-ketoglutaric acid 3abromides 3achemical bonding 3achemical elements 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3ageometry 3aligands 3amodels 3aquantum mechanics1 aWong, Shaun D.1 aMatthews, Megan L.1 aKrebs, Carsten1 aBollinger, J.

However, unlike with planar electrodes, the mesoporous nature of the films inherently limits both the thickness of the multilayer and subsequent diffusion through the pores. Here, we systematically investigated the role of TiO₂ nanoparticle film porosity and metal ion-linked multilayer thickness in surface loading, through-pore diffusion, and overall device performance. The TiO₂ porosity was controlled by varying TiO₂ sintering times. Molecular multilayer thickness was controlled through assembling Znᴵᴵ-linked bridging molecules (B = p-terphenyl diphosphonic acid) between the metal oxide and the Ru(bpy)₂((4,4′-PO₃H₂)₂bpy)]Cl₂ dye (RuP), thus producing TiO₂-(Bₙ)-RuP films. Using attenuated total reflectance infrared absorption and UV–vis spectroscopy, we observed that at least two molecular layers (i.e., TiO₂-B₂ or TiO₂-B₁-RuP) could be formed on all films but subsequent loading was dependent on the porosity of the TiO₂. Rough estimates indicate that in a film with 34 nm average pore diameter, the maximum multilayer film thickness is on the order of 4.6–6 nm, which decreases with decreasing pore size. These films were then incorporated as the photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells with cobalt(II/III)tris(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine) as a redox mediator. In agreement with the surface-loading studies, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements indicate that mediator diffusion is significantly hindered in films with thicker multilayers and less porous TiO₂. Collectively, these results show that care must be taken to balance multilayer thickness, substrate porosity, and size of the mediator in designing and maximizing the performance of new multilayer energy and electron management architectures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acobalt 3adielectric spectroscopy 3adyes 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy conversion 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3ananoparticles 3aporosity 3aporous media 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0ametal ion linked 0amultilayer 0adye-sensitized 0asolar cell 0adiffusion1 aMiles, Dalton1 aSalpage, Sahan R.1 aWatson, Noelle1 aHe, Qingquan1 aWu, Qiang1 aHanson, Kenneth1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7219-78080 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 30, v. 12, no. 34 p.38003-38011dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c079683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024005700113040001800170100002300188245009800211300001800309520126400327592002801591650002701619650000901646650001201655650002001667650002501687650002301712650002301735650003501758650003101793650002401824651001801848651002301866653001701889653001401906653002501920653002701945653001801972653002201990700002502012700001802037700002002055773012002075856011202195856010302307961001202410852000902422655001202431IND4371093620221116171408.0151127e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437109362DNAL7 a10113/386982hdl7 a10.2193/0091-7648(2004)032[1124:FOLMTC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, Tyler A.10aFeasibility of localized management to control white-tailed deer in forest regeneration areas  ap. 1124-1131.  aThe deleterious effects of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on forest regeneration are well documented in many forested systems, but potential solutions to these problems on remote landholdings are limited in number and scope. Localized management proposes that a persistent area (<2 km²) of low density can be created by removing all individuals within matriarchal social groups of white-tailed deer. Our objective was to assess the feasibility of using localized management as a tool within forest regeneration areas. We present a comparison of seasonal home-range and core-area size and site fidelity of 148 radiomonitored female white-tailed deer in a forested landscape of the central Appalachians of West Virginia. We also characterized seasonal movements and dispersal. Adult female winter home-range size exceeded those of summer and autumn. Female deer displayed high fidelity, with home-range and core-area overlap being less in autumn than in summer or winter. Dispersal occurred in 1 of 28 (3.6%) female fawns and no deer >1 year old dispersed. Female white-tailed deer on our study site meet the a priori assumptions of localized management. We assert that experimental manipulations based on localized management concepts are prudent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3adeer 3afemales 3aforest habitats 3aspatial distribution 3adispersal behavior 3aseasonal variation 3aradio frequency identification 3awildlife damage management 3aforest regeneration 3aWest Virginia 3aAppalachian region 0aAppalachians 0adispersal 0alocalized management 0aOdocoileus virginianus 0asite fidelity 0awhite-tailed deer1 aLaseter, Benjamin R.1 aFord, W.

However, elucidation of the biochemical mechanisms involved in phytoremediation is a topic to be explored with knowledge gaps. This study aims to identify and classify proteins expressed in the aerial parts of laboratory-cultivated alfalfa in the presence and absence of pyrene, anthracene, and phenanthrene. Soil samples were amended with 100 mg.kg⁻¹ of each PAH (total concentration of 300 ppm) and cultivated with alfalfa plants for 20 days. After this, aerial parts of cultivated plants from each condition were collected for qualitative proteomic analysis (ESI-Q/TOF). The results showed a significant increase (Student’s t-test p < 0.05) of 41.7% in the concentration of proteins from plants grown in PAH-amended substrates, changes in the protein profile, with intense protein bands observed at 40–55, 34, 28, and 15 kDa when compared to the control. A total of 504 proteins were identified and classified into 12 functional categories, highlighting the identification of 11 phytoremediation-related proteins candidates in plants grown in the presence of PAH, with biological functions related to diverse metabolisms involved in the xenobiotics biodegradation (included PAH), glutathione and response to stress.  aThe work was financially supported by CNPq, CENPES, PETROBRAS, and the Brazilian Agency of Petroleum (Agência Nacional de Petróleo, Gás e Biocombustíveis, ANP – Programa de Recursos Humanos) [PQ1-111.881/2013].  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aanthracenes 3abiodegradation 3aglutathione 3aphenanthrenes 3aphytoremediation 3aprotein composition 3aproteomics 3asoil 3astress response 3at-test 3axenobiotics 0aAnthracene 0aMedicago sativa L. 0aphenanthrene 0aproteome 0apyrene1 aSantos, Noemi S.1 aBaroca, Felipe F.1 aAlves, Bruna P.

The efficiency of the process of heavy metal sorption in algae used for in situ tests depends on abiotic factors, such as the chemical composition of water. Freshwater algae Spirogyra sp. were used in tests. Algae were exposed in the laboratory in manganese chloride solutions with various contents of other cations, including heavy metals and macronutrients. It has been shown that some heavy metals may desorb manganese bound to the surface of algae as a result of ion exchange in the following sequence: Cd²⁺ < Mn²⁺ ≈ Zn²⁺ < Cu²⁺. It has been also found that the competitiveness of sorption of cations naturally present in the alga environment versus Mn²⁺ cations changes in the sequence Na⁺ < Ca²⁺ < H⁺, defined for the concentrations referring to the cation unit charge. The results of tests were compared to the results of dried sea algae Palmaria palmata analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPalmaria 3aSpirogyra 3aalgae 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acations 3achemical composition 3acopper 3aecosystem engineering 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afreshwater 3aheavy metals 3aion exchange 3amanganese 3amanganese chloride 3aprotons 3aremediation 3asodium 3asorption 3athallus 3azinc 0aSpirogyra sp. 0aPalmaria palmata 0aion exchange 0aheavy metals 0acompetitiveness of sorption 0aSpirogyra sp. 0aPalmaria palmata 0awymiana jonowa 0ametale ciężkie 0akonkurencyjność sorpcji1 aJóźwiak, Małgorzata Anna1 aKłos, Andrzej0 tEcological Chemistry and Engineering.g2014 Apr. 9, v. 21, no. 1 p.35-43dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23149x2084-45497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/eces-2014-00033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009000172520132800262592002801590650001001618650001801628650001401646650001901660650002501679650001301704650000901717653001401726653002901740653001901769653001501788700001601803700001601819700001601835700001901851700001501870700001701885773010601902856008702008852000902095655001202104IND60783467020221117085521.0220824e20221020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078346702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1297012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhangheng10aColor fastness enhancement of dyed wood by Si-sol@PDMS based superhydrophobic coating  aSuperhydrophobic surfaces have been widely used in surface protection. Dyed wood (D-wood) easily fades when exposed to water, but to improve its the color fastness, a superhydrophobic coating can be applied to reduce the D-wood’s interaction with water. In this work, dyed-superhydrophobic wood (DS-wood) was successfully prepared by in-situ growth and transformation of Si-sol and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to enhance the color fastness of D-wood. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicated that the Si-sol deposited on the D-wood surface generated a rough coating and combined with the construction of PDMS acted to improve the superhydrophobicity. The water contact angle (WCA) of the DS-wood was around 151.6° and the sliding angle (SA) was about 7°. Because the superhydrophobic coating can form a protective layer on the D-wood surface, DS-wood does not suffer from severe fading under long-term water washing conditions. In addition, even after other rigorous tests (abrasion, chemical and solvent corrosion), DS-wood has excellent superhydrophobic stability and does not suffer color degradation. Last, DS-wood has been shown to exhibit excellent self-cleaning properties. This method provides a new strategy and paradigm for the application of superhydrophobic coating and the surface protection of D-wood.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3acontact angle 3acorrosion 3ahydrophobicity 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3asolvents 3awood 0aDyed wood 0aSuperhydrophobic coating 0aColor fastness 0aDurability1 aSun, Zhenyu1 aChen, Xinyi1 aZou, Weihua1 aJiang, Xiawang1 aSun, Delin1 aYu, Minggong0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Oct. 20, v. 651 p.129701-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1297013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01618naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245006900135300001600204520072200220592002800942650001600970650001100986650001000997650001401007650001601021650001601037650001401053650001201067650002201079651001101101651001301112700001301125773013301138852000901271655001201280IND60445488820221120122327.0151029e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044548882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCannon, Charles H.10aLithocarpus pulongtauensis (Fagaceae), a New Species from Borneo  ap. 495-498.  aWe describe a new species of Lithocarpus from the central Kelabit Highlands of Sarawak, Malaysia with a distribution extending north to Mt.

The fruit is semi-hemispheric in shape and the bracts on the cupule are entirely fused, relatively sparse, stiff, brittle, and prominent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithocarpus 3abracts 3acolor 3ahighlands 3amorphometry 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3atexture 3atopographic slope 3aBorneo 3aMalaysia1 aChen, Xi0 tAnnales botanici Fennici.g2011 Dec., v. 48, no. 6 p.495-498dFinnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Boardx0003-38477nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014600169300001800315520174500333592002802078650002602106650002502132650002702157650002302184650001202207650001602219650001702235650001102252650001102263650002302274650002002297650002102317650001602338650001202354650001002366650002002376650001402396650001102410650000902421650001902430653001802449653001202467653002102479653001602500653002002516653001202536700001502548700001802563700001602581700001802597700001502615700001802630700002202648773012202670856008502792852000902877655001202886IND60537034720221122121352.0160807e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053703472DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2016.11835812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yixiang10aCadmium accumulation and tolerance of Lagerstroemia indica and Lagerstroemia fauriei (Lythraceae) seedlings for phytoremediation applications  ap. 1104-1112.  aContamination by heavy metals is one of the most serious environmental problems generated from human activities. Because phytoremediation utilizes plants to uptake contaminants, it could potentially be used to remediate metal-contaminated areas. A pot culture experiment with four levels of cadmium (Cd) (0, 20, 40, and 80 mg of Cd/kg dry soil) was conducted to investigate Cd accumulation and tolerance of roots, shoots, and leaves of Lagerstroemia indica and Lagerstroemia fauriei as well as their potential for phytoremediation. Experimental results indicated that Cd inhibited seedling growth only at the higher Cd exposure concentration (40 and 80 mg/kg). The tolerance index revealed that on average L. indica is more tolerant of Cd than L. fauriei . Moreover, plants in the experiment accumulated Cd differentially. In comparisons between L. indica and L. fauriei , the leaves of the former had higher concentrations of Cd, while the roots of latter had higher concentrations of Cd. Furthermore, the roots, shoots, and leaves had very high bioaccumulation factors that markedly exceeded 1.0 (exceptional only in shoots of 80 mg/kg for L. fauriei), indicating that the seedlings extracted Cd from the soil. The leaves' translocation factor of L. indica was greater than 1.0, being significantly higher than that of L. fauriei . Chlorophyll a, Chlorophyll b and total declined in both species significantly as Cd concentrations exceeded 40 mg/kg in the soil. In contrast, lipid peroxidation and proline content was found to increase with increasing Cd concentration. From the assessments of biomass production, Cd tolerance and uptake L. indica and L. fauriei could stand as excellent species for remediating Cd-contaminated soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLagerstroemia fauriei 3aLagerstroemia indica 3abioaccumulation factor 3abiomass production 3acadmium 3achlorophyll 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3ametal tolerance 3aphytoremediation 3apot culture 3aproline 3aroots 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asoil 3asoil pollution 0aLagerstroemia 0acadmium 0aphytoremediation 0achlorophyll 0amalondialdehyde 0aproline1 aGu, Cuihua1 aBai, Shangbin1 aSun, Zhibin1 aZhu, Tingting1 aZhu, Xudan1 aGrit, Dale H.1 aTembrock, Luke R.0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2016 Nov. 1, v. 18, no. 11 p.1104-1112dTaylor & Francisx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2016.11835813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009300156300001800249500002000267520179400287592002802081650001502109650001702124650001002141650002002151650001302171650001202184650002202196650002002218700002102238773010702259856007302366852000902439655001202448IND60520946020221117040237.0160526e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052094602DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.127092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarin, Julie10aTime best explains global variation in species richness of amphibians, birds and mammals  ap. 1069-1079.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: The general pattern of higher species richness in tropical areas has been long recognized but the underlying cause is still debated. Two major hypotheses have emerged in recent years. The Rate Hypothesis attributes this pattern to a high rate of diversification, whereas the Time Hypothesis attributes it to greater lineage age. Here, we revisited these two hypotheses with global data sets of amphibians, birds and mammals. LOCATION: Global. METHODS: To test these hypotheses we evaluated the relationship between crown age and species richness, and between diversification rate and species richness within biogeographical regions. We also compared diversification rates of tropical and temperate clades, and assessed the usefulness of two phylometrics, evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) and evolutionary rate (ER), as proxies of age and diversification rate. Finally, we used those phylometrics in a grid cell approach to explore the spatial distribution of clade age and diversification rate. RESULTS: We found species richness of these tetrapods is best described by time (age of lineages) and that diversification rates are not significantly different between tropical and temperate areas. In addition to time, we found that historical biogeography, in some cases, has an influence on species richness patterns. In turn, this suggests that the latitudinal diversity gradient is a result of the gradient in climatic stability, with younger assemblages (hence, fewer species) occupying higher latitudes. MAIN CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that time, and not rate of diversification, best describes species richness patterns of amphibians, birds and mammals, and that this pattern is a ‘climate effect’ ultimately deriving from the latitudinal gradient in climatic stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphibians 3abiogeography 3abirds 3adata collection 3alatitude 3amammals 3aspecies diversity 3atemperate zones1 aHedges, S.

It can be effectively dealt with through the rational and healthy use of rural land, by promoting sustainable development and urban and rural coordination. Building on the foundation of ecosystem metabolism and sustainable development theories, this paper utilizes the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Malmquist productivity index to divide the land use efficiency total factor productivity (LUTFP) into Malmquist–Luenberger technical change (MLTECH) and Malmquist–Luenberger efficiency change (MLEFFCH) from the perspective of scale change, and uses Kernel Function to measure and study the distribution characteristics of the dynamic evolution and land use efficiency (LUE) in different functional and productive areas and living space subsystem. The results show that, in the process of land use, desirable output growth in the Chongqing city rural living space is lower than the undesirable output reduction rate. Rural human settlement and construction management appears to damage the environment. The LUE in the obtained results showcases an obvious agglomeration effect in Chongqing. Also, there is a very significant “match-up” effect between the LUE and economic development level. In addition, the paper also finds that the technical change index and efficiency change index work together in rural living space LUTFP. The results presented in this paper can provide a basis for the optimization of regional development strategies and rural land utilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3adevelopment theory 3aecosystems 3ahuman settlements 3aland use 3ametabolism 3asustainable development 3aChina1 aXie, Deti1 aLiao, Heping1 aTu, Bo1 aYang, Jun0 tSustainability.g2017 Mar. 23, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90404443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245014500175300001800320520102200338592002801360650003401388650001701422650002501439650001701464650001401481650002001495650002401515650001401539650001801553650001401571650004301585650002201628650001401650650002401664650001501688650001601703700002401719700002501743773014201768856008301910852000901993655001202002IND60699817720221120193356.0200917e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069981772DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-020-03516-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSentkowska, Aleksandra10aSimultaneous determination of vitamin B6 and catechins in dietary supplements by ZIC-HILIC chromatography and their antioxidant interactions  ap. 1609-1615.  aHydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was employed for simultaneous determination of vitamin B6 and catechins in dietary supplements. The obtained results clearly shows the potential of the application of alcohol eluent (instead mainly used acetonitrile) as a component of an with zwitterionic stationary phase. The limits of detection on ZIC-HILIC column were 0.01 mg/L for catechins and vitamins B (only for pyridoxal phosphate was 0.10 mg/L). The investigations between green tea extract (GTE) and vitamin B were also evaluated using isobolographic analysis as well as the interaction indexes. Antioxidant activities of single components and their mixtures were determined by DPPH assay. It was found that the mixtures of GTE and vitamin B acted synergistically. In comparison to GTE alone, faster DPPH radical bleaching of the mixtures was observed in the presence of different forms of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine, pyridoxal, or pyridoxal phosphate), particularly for pyridoxal.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aacetonitrile 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ableaching 3adetection limit 3adietary supplements 3aflavanols 3afood research 3agreen tea 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apyridoxal 3apyridoxal phosphate 3apyridoxine 3azwitterions1 aPiwowarczyk, Sylwia1 aPyrzyńska, Krystyna0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2020 Aug., v. 246, no. 8 p.1609-1615dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-020-03516-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245011200181300001600293520054300309592002800852650001700880650001300897650002100910650003700931650002100968650003700989650002801026650005901054650001101113650003601124700002701160700002301187700002101210700002001231700002201251773010601273856008101379990002301460852000901483655001201492IND60090604220221119105530.0141102e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009060422DNAL7 a211469942pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2010.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewin, Guy10aSynthesis of antiproliferative flavones from calycopterin, major flavonoid of Calycopteris floribunda Lamk.  ap. 186-196.  aEighteen new analogues of 5,3′-dihydroxy-3,6,7,8,4′-pentamethoxy-flavone, a potent natural cytotoxic and antimitotic flavone, were synthesized from calycopterin, the major flavonoid of Calycopteris floribunda Lamk., a traditional Asian medicinal plant.

Nitrogen (N) strongly affects the growth and quality of the rapeseed seedling. This study investigated the agronomic traits, physiological indexes, the surviving number of blanket seedlings, and the survival rate after transplanting two canola (Brassica napus L.) cultivars (Ningza 1838 and Yangyou 9) treated with five N rates (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 g N per tray). Plant height, leaf age, leaf area, collar length, fresh and dry weights, moisture content, and N concentration in root and shoot all increased as the N rate increased. The survival number, collar diameter, root to shoot ratio at the 30th day after sowing and the survival rate at the 10th day after transplanting increased at first then decreased as N rate consecutively increased. The survival number and survival rate under the 1.0 and 1.5 g N per tray treatments were most improved amongst N treatments, although there was no significant difference between these two N treatments. This suggests that to achieve high-quality blanket seedling needed for mechanized transplanting, the application of N at rates of 1.0 to 1.5 g N per tray at the one-leaf and one-heart stages is recommended.  aThis research was financially funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFD1000900), and the Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu Province, China (BE2020385).  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD1000900  aBE2020385 3aBrassica napus 3acanola 3acultivars 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amechanization 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aplant height 3aplant nutrition 3aroot shoot ratio 3aseedlings 3asurvival rate 3awater content 3aChina 0amechanized transplanting 0aplant N concentration 0arapeseed blanket seedling 0asurvival number1 aZheng, Jingdong1 aYou, Jingjing1 aWang, Long1 aYang, Guang1 aLeng, Suohu0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2022 Oct. 2, v. 45, no. 16 p.2515-2522dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2022.20637413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012400157300001600281520177500297592002802072650001502100650001302115650001602128650002002144650001502164650002502179650001602204700001902220773009002239856007302329852000902402655001202411IND60132948120221123001644.0150513e20150228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013294812DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.101662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJha, Madan K.10aEfficacy of neural network and genetic algorithm techniques in simulating spatio‐temporal fluctuations of groundwater  ap. 671-691.  aGroundwater modelling has emerged as a powerful tool to develop a sustainable management plan for efficient groundwater utilization and protection of this vital resource. This study deals with the development of five hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) models and their critical assessment for simulating spatio‐temporal fluctuations of groundwater in an alluvial aquifer system. Unlike past studies, in this study, all the relevant input variables having significant influence on groundwater have been considered, and the hybrid ANN technique [ANN‐cum‐Genetic Algorithm (GA)] has been used to simulate groundwater levels at 17 sites over the study area. The parameters of the ANN models were optimized using a GA optimization technique. The predictive ability of the five hybrid ANN models developed for each of the 17 sites was evaluated using six goodness‐of‐fit criteria and graphical indicators, together with adequate uncertainty analyses. The analysis of the results of this study revealed that the multilayer perceptron Levenberg–Marquardt model is the most efficient in predicting monthly groundwater levels at almost all of the 17 sites, while the radial basis function model is the least efficient. The GA technique was found to be superior to the commonly used trial‐and‐error method for determining optimal ANN architecture and internal parameters. Of the goodness‐of‐fit statistics used in this study, only root‐mean‐squared error, r²and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency were found to be more powerful and useful in assessing the performance of the ANN models. It can be concluded that the hybrid ANN modelling approach can be effectively used for predicting spatio‐temporal fluctuations of groundwater at basin or subbasin scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3auncertainty analysis 3awater table1 aSahoo, Sasmita0 tHydrological processes.g2015 Feb. 28, v. 29, no. 5 p.671-691dWileyx0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.101663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009600161520192400257592002802181650002302209650001902232650001202251650001902263650001902282650002502301650001602326650001302342650002002355650002202375650001202397650001102409650001502420650001002435650002002445650002402465700002102489773012602510856007302636852000902709655001202718IND60651924720221121044504.0190712e20170411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065192472DNAL7 a10.3390/su90405782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrews, Timothy E.10aWhat Agriculture Can Learn from Native Ecosystems in Building Soil Organic Matter: A Review  aOver the last century, researchers and practitioners with diverse backgrounds have articulated the importance of improving soil organic matter (SOM) contents in agricultural soils. More recently, climate change scientists interested in CO<inf>2</inf> sinks, and agroecologists interested in ecological intensification have converged on the goal of building SOM stocks in croplands. The challenge is that agriculture itself is responsible for dramatic losses of SOM. When grassland or forest ecosystems are first converted to agriculture, multiple mechanisms result in SOM declines of between 20% and 70%. Two of the most important mechanisms are the reduction in organic matter inputs from roots following the replacement of perennial vegetation with annual crop species, and increases in microbial respiration when tillage breaks open soil aggregates exposing previously protected organic matter. Many agricultural practices such as conservation tillage and integration of cover crops have been shown to achieve some degree of SOM improvement, but in general adoption of these practices falls short of accumulating the SOM stocks maintained by grasslands, forests or other native ecosystems that agriculture replaced. Two of the overarching reasons why native terrestrial ecosystems have achieved greater soil organic matter levels than human agroecosystems are because they direct a greater percentage of productivity belowground in perennial roots, and they do not require frequent soil disturbance. A growing body of research including that presented in this review suggests that developing perennial grain agroecosystems may hold the greatest promise for agriculture to approach the SOM levels that accumulate in native ecosystems. We present calculations that estimate potential soil organic carbon accumulation rates in fields converted from annual to perennial grains of between 0.13 and 1.70 t ha−1 year−1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aagroecosystems 3aannuals 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aconservation tillage 3acover crops 3acropland 3adisturbed soils 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3agrains 3agrasslands 3aroots 3asoil aggregates 3asoil organic carbon1 aRumsey, Brian E.0 tSustainability.g2017 Apr. 11, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90405783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011400164300001600278520119400294592002801488650001101516650001101527650002201538650001401560650002201574650000901596650001201605650002201617650001401639650001301653650001701666700001601683700001901699700001701718700005601735700001601791700001501807700001101822700001901833700001901852700002401871773008701895856008501982852000902067655001202076IND60590449920221121051437.0200419e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059044992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.01.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAo, Xiang10aIn situ nitrogen-doped helical mesoporous carbonaceous nanotubes for superior-high lithium anodic performance  ap. 599-606.  aCarbon with a theoretical lithium storage capacity of 372 mAh g⁻¹ has been widely used in commercial lithium-ion batteries. Increasing the capacity beyond this limit is highly desirable and needed, but challenging. Tailoring the structure and/or introducing heteroatom to carbon lattice may dramatically improve the lithium storage capability. Herein, in situ nitrogen-doped helical mesoporous carbonaceous nanotubes with ultra-high specific surface areas of 1170 m² g⁻¹ are designed. Applied as an anode material for LIBs, the as-prepared sample delivers a superior capacity of 1812 mA h g⁻¹ after 150 cycles at a current density of 123 mA g⁻¹, and 1336 mA hg⁻¹ after 300 cycles at 372 mA g⁻¹, suggesting that the unique nanoarchitecture provides plentiful lithium ion storage sites and facilitates the electrolyte and electron transport. The lone pairs of electrons of nitrogen atoms would alter the electronic properties of carbon, facilitating electron donation to Li ions. The strategy of rational design and synthesis of carbon nanostructures offer prospects in developing high-performance energy conversion and storage devices/systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3aenergy conversion 3aions 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ananotubes 3anitrogen 3aporous media1 aSun, Huayan1 aWang, Chundong1 aLi, Jiangang1 aRuan, Yunjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0696-89311 aLi, Baozong1 aWu, Qi-Hui1 aLi, Yi1 aJiang, Jianjun1 aYang, Yonggang1 aMai, L.q(Liqiang),0 tCarbon.g2018 Apr., v. 130 p.599-606dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.01.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006500151245011100216520170600327592002802033650001102061650001102072650001302083650002902096650001902125650001502144650001502159653002402174653002302198653002102221653003302242653002202275653002202297700002402319773010402343856008602447852000902533655001202542IND60728915620221121175909.0211029e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072891562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1261232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrzyborowski, Łukasz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0900-138710aIdentification of coherent structures downstream of patches of aquatic vegetation in a natural environment  aVelocity measurements from experiments performed downstream of patches of submerged aquatic vegetation were analysed. Two patches of different species, i.e., P. crispus and M. spicatum, were characterised by the same size. Measurement points covered the water depth in the centre and at the sides of the patches from 0.1 m to 0.85 m downstream. Conditional quadrant analysis was modified and applied to the data to study turbulence structures propagating from the mixing layer formed at the interface between the vegetation canopy and flow above. These structures were responsible for the majority of momentum transport and tended to vary with patch distance, height and plant physical characteristics. The stiffer plant, i.e., M. spicatum, produced a higher difference between the contributions of even events, i.e., sweeps and ejections, and odd events, i.e., outward and inward interactions. The changes in the detected strong bursting events across measurement profiles indicated that two main kinds of organised motions occurred immediately behind the plant patches. Strong sweep motions carried water flow into the low-velocity region below the vegetation height. Strong ejections, which had the longest time of the occurrence and had the highest contributions to the u′w′¯ Reynolds stress, pushed flow towards the water surface. Both kinds of extreme events produced the same Reynolds stress in an instant, but ejections had a higher frequency of occurrence. The presented results show how the observed changes in ejection and sweeps distribution reflect the model where vegetation canopy-induced vortices transform into the dual-head hairpin vortices downstream of the inflection point.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3amodels 3amomentum 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3aturbulent flow 3avegetation 3awater flow 0aCoherent structures 0aAquatic vegetation 0aRiver turbulence 0aAcoustic Doppler velocimetry 0aField experiments 0aQuadrant analysis1 aŁoboda, Anna Maria0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 May, v. 596 p.126123-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1261233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245013000175300001600305500001900321520152700340592002801867596005901895596005701954650001702011650001302028650001102041650001402052650002702066650002302093650000902116650001402125650002802139650001902167650000702186650001302193650002102206650001002227650001602237700002902253700002702282700002902309700002302338700006802361773010902429856008202538852000902620655001202629IND60728258220221121000758.0210219e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072825822DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-020-10174-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCelaya-Herrera, Samuel12aA Cellulolytic Streptomyces Sp. Isolated from a Highly Oligotrophic Niche Shows Potential for Hydrolyzing Agricultural Wastes  ap. 333-343.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCellulases from Streptomyces species can be used as auxiliary agents in the pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials, but little work has been done on this topic. Besides, Streptomyces strains have been identified from Cuatro Cienegas basin, but their potential in the treatment of agricultural wastes has not been demonstrated. In this work a Streptomyces sp., strain CC48 isolated from the oligotrophic environment, shows high levels of cellulolytic activity (0.76 U/ mL at pH 7.0, 60 °C) in minimum medium supplemented with carboxymethyl cellulose compared with other Streptomyces strains and isolates in a bacterial collection. At least three putative cellulases (~30, 40, and 45 kDa) were identified in Streptomyces sp. CC48 extracts. The addition of Mg²⁺ increased cellulase activity by 23%, whereas other cations resulted in decreased catalysis. Residual cellulolytic activities after 4 and 8 h of incubation at 60 °C were ~ 73 and 65%, respectively, and ~ 98% at 50 °C after 8 h. Corn cob and wheat straw pretreated with an alkaline method showed saccharification values of 320 and 330 mg/g of reducing sugars per gram of dry substrate, respectively. The significance of this work lies in the fact that data provided here show that Streptomyces sp. strain CC48 is capable of hydrolyzing both maize and wheat substrates, suggesting the potential of this bacterium to hydrolyze agricultural wastes. Also, Cuatro Cienegas Basin may represent a source for efficient cellulolytic microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data  a258220cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (Mx)  a2069cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (Mx) 3aStreptomyces 3abacteria 3abasins 3abioenergy 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acatalytic activity 3acorn 3acorn cobs 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3alignocellulose 3apH 3aresearch 3asaccharification 3awheat 3awheat straw1 aCasados-Vázquez, Luz E.1 aValdez-Vazquez, Idania1 aBarona-Gómez, Francisco1 aBideshi, Dennis K.1 aBarboza-Corona, José E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0704-30760 tBioEnergy research.g2021 Mar., v. 14, no. 1 p.333-343dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4138147x1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-020-10174-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100001900174245014100193300001600334520166600350592002802016650002302044650002602067650002302093650002502116650002702141650001702168650002902185650001202214650001902226650001702245650001802262650001302280650001202293650000802305650001202313650004002325650002702365650003902392650002702431650001702458650004102475650002302516650003202539650003302571650002702604653002502631653002702656653001902683700002502702700002902727700001802756700002602774700003002800773013802830856009002968852000903058655001203067IND50069524120221120045638.0190318e20130916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006952412DNAL7 a240419982pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurekci, Cemil10aAntimicrobial activity of essential oils and five terpenoid compounds against Campylobacter jejuni in pure and mixed culture experiments  ap. 450-457.  aThe aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial potential of three essential oils (EOs: tea tree oil, lemon myrtle oil and Leptospermum oil), five terpenoid compounds (α-bisabolol, α-terpinene, cineole, nerolidol and terpinen-4-ol) and polyphenol against two strains of Campylobacter jejuni (ACM 3393 and the poultry isolate C338), Campylobacter coli and other Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria. Different formulations of neem oil (Azadirachta indica) with these compounds were also tested for synergistic interaction against all organisms. Antimicrobial activity was determined by the use of disc diffusion and broth dilution assays. All EOs tested were found to have strong antimicrobial activity against Campylobacter spp. with inhibitory concentrations in the range 0.001–1% (v/v). Among the single compounds, terpinen-4-ol showed the highest activity against Campylobacter spp. and other reference strains. Based on the antimicrobial activity and potential commerciality of these agents, lemon myrtle oil, α-tops (α-terpineol+cineole+terpinen-4-ol) and terpinen-4-ol were also evaluated using an in vitro fermentation technique to test antimicrobial activity towards C. jejuni in the microbiota from the chicken-caecum. EO compounds (terpinen-4-ol and α-tops) were antimicrobial towards C. jejuni at high doses (0.05%) without altering the fermentation profile. EOs and terpenoid compounds can have strong anti-Campylobacter activity without adversely affecting the fermentation potential of the chicken-caeca microbiota. EOs and their active compounds may have the potential to control C. jejuni colonisation and abundance in poultry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzadirachta indica 3aBackhousia citriodora 3aCampylobacter coli 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aLeptospermum 3aantimicrobial properties 3acineole 3aessential oils 3afermentation 3amixed culture 3aneem oil 3apoultry 3atea 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacteriaxdrug effects 2aCampylobacter jejunixdrug effects 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aFermentation 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxdrug effects 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aOils, Volatilexpharmacology 2aTerpenesxpharmacology 0aCampylobacter jejuni 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aEssential oils1 aPadmanabha, Jagadish1 aBishop-Hurley, Sharon L.1 aHassan, Errol1 aAl Jassim, Rafat A.M.1 aMcSweeney, Christopher S.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2013 Sept. 16, v. 166, no. 3 p.450-457dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03561naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245010400176300001600280520197000296592002802266650002402294650001202318650001602330650002202346650002102368650001202389650002402401650003102425650001402456650003202470650001802502650001902520650001102539650001502550650002502565653002702590653002502617653002802642653001202670653001702682700002102699700001602720700002202736700001802758700002302776700001702799773011902816856008702935852000903022655001203031IND60606651420221119141312.0180727e20160215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060665142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.11.1742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrling, Maria P.10aShort and long term biosorption of silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticles in heterotrophic biofilms  ap. 722-729.  aThe increased application of engineered nanoparticles (ENP) in industrial processes and consumer products has raised concerns about their impact on health and environmental safety. When ENP enter the global water cycle by e.g. wastewater streams, wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) represent potential sinks for ENP. During biological WWT, the attachment of ENP to biofilms is responsible for the desired removal of ENP from the water phase avoiding their release into the aquatic environment. However, the fundamental mechanisms guiding the interactions between ENP and biofilms are not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study investigates the behavior and biosorption of inorganic ENP, here magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles coated with silica (scFe3O4-NP), with heterotrophic biofilms at different time scales. Their magnetic properties enable to follow scFe3O4-NP in the biofilm system by a magnetic susceptibility balance and magnetic resonance imaging. Biofilms were exposed to scFe3O4-NP at short contact times (5min) in flow cells and complementary, scFe3O4-NP were introduced into a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) to be observed for 27 d. Mass balances revealed that scFe3O4-NP sorbed to the biofilm within a few minutes, but that the total biosorption was rather low (3.2μgFe/mg TSS). scFe3O4-NP mainly sorbed to the biofilm surface inducing the detachment of outer biofilm parts starting after an exposure time of 3h in the MBBR. The biosorption depended on the exposure concentration of scFe3O4-NP, but less on the contact time. Most scFe3O4-NP exited the flow cell (up to 65%) and the MBBR (57%) via the effluent. This effect was favored by the stabilization of scFe3O4-NP in the bulk liquid by organic matter leading to a low retention capacity of the MBBR system. The results contribute to improve our understanding about the fate of ENP in environmental and in technical biofilm systems and give indications for future investigations needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3abiofilm 3abiosorption 3aexposure duration 3ahydrologic cycle 3aliquids 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amagnetism 3amoving bed biofilm reactors 3ananoparticles 3aorganic matter 3asilica 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aWastewater treatment 0aMagnetic susceptibility 0aBiomass 0aMass balance1 aLackner, Susanne1 aTatti, Oleg1 aGuthausen, Gisela1 aDelay, Markus1 aFranzreb, Matthias1 aHorn, Harald0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 544 p.722-729dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.11.1743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011300167300001600280520131400296592002801610650001101638650002101649650001401670650002101684650001301705650001101718650001301729650001401742650001301756650001101769650002301780650001301803650001401816650003301830650003701863700001801900700001701918700001701935700001901952773008701971856008502058852000902143655001202152IND60590450220221119094623.0200419e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059045022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.01.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jianbo10aHigh-yield production of large aspect ratio carbon nanotubes via catalytic pyrolysis of cheap coal tar pitch  ap. 701-713.  aHigh aspect ratio (up to 5000) multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were prepared on a large scale via Co-catalyzed pyrolysis of cheap coal tar pitch at 973–1273 K in an Ar-based atmosphere. Scanning Electron Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy investigations revealed that as-prepared carbon nanotubes were ca. 200 μm, 40 nm and 10 nm respectively, in length, outer diameter, and wall thickness. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the in-situ reduced Co catalyst from the original cobalt nitrate precursor facilitated the cleavage of C=C and C-H bonds in adsorbed C₂H₄ molecules by increasing the bond length and decreasing the bond strength via donating electrons to the C atoms. The straight MWCNTs grew from/on the Co clusters through a decomposition-diffusion-penetration mechanism. The catalytic formation of high aspect ratio MWCNTs from coal tar pitch stated above can be used to improve mechanical properties of carbon-containing refractory composites. As revealed by our work, cold crushing strength and modulus of rupture of a model Al₂O₃-carbon refractory containing 0.75 wt% Co catalyst were respectively 26% and 34% higher than in the case of its catalyst-free counterpart, indicating the strong reinforcement effects of in-situ formed MWCNTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3acoal tar 3acobalt 3acrushing 3aelectrons 3aethylene 3amodels 3amodulus of rupture 3anitrates 3apyrolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhang, Haijun1 aWang, Junkai1 aHuang, Liang1 aZhang, Shaowei0 tCarbon.g2018 Apr., v. 130 p.701-713dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.01.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245012900183300001600312520143500328592002801763650001001791650001401801650001901815650001201834650002001846650001101866650002301877650002501900650002101925650001801946650001301964650000901977650001701986650002402003650001202027650002902039650002102068650002302089650002602112650001102138650003102149650003402180650008702214650002002301650000902321650007302330700002102403700002202424700001402446700002302460700001902483700002302502700002402525700002002549700001702569773010702586856008102693990002302774852000902797655001202806IND60090604620221119105436.0141102e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009060462DNAL7 a211949562pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2010.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFridkin, Gil10aIntramolecular azo-bridge as a cystine disulfide bond surrogate: Somatostatin-14 and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) analogs  ap. 798-806.  aCystine disulfide bond is a common feature in numerous biologically active peptides and proteins and accordingly its replacement by various surrogates presents a potential route to obtain analogs with improved pharmacokinetic characteristics. The purpose of the present study was to assess whether an azo-bridge can serve as such a surrogate. In view of the marked clinical significance of somatostatin and the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) we choose these peptides as a model. Three cyclic-azo somatostatin analogs and three cyclic-azo BNP analogs were effectively prepared in solution through azo bond formation between p-amino phenylalanine and His or Tyr residues that were positioned in the peptide sequences in place of the native Cys residues. The peptides binding affinities to the sst₂ and ANP-receptor (NPR-A) expressed on rat acinar pancreating carcinoma AR4-2J cell membranes and HeLa cells, respectively, were examined. The somatostatin analogs displayed good to moderate affinities to the rat sst₂ in the nM range with best results obtained with peptide 2, that is, IC₅₀=8.1nM. Molecular dynamics simulations on these peptides suggests on a correlation between the observed binding potencies and the degree of conformational space overlapping with that of somatostatin. The BNP analogs exhibited binding affinities to the NPR-A in the nM range with best results obtained with BNP-1, that is, IC₅₀=60nM.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acarcinoma 3acell membranes 3acystine 3adisulfide bonds 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3anatriuretic peptides 3apharmacokinetics 3aphenylalanine 3aproteins 3arats 3asomatostatin 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAzo Compoundsxchemistry 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCystinexchemistry 2aDisulfidesxchemistry 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMolecular Dynamics Simulation 2aNatriuretic Peptide, Brainxanalogs & derivativesxchemical synthesisxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aRats 2aSomatostatinxanalogs & derivativesxchemical synthesisxmetabolism.1 aMaina, Theodosia1 aNock, Berthold A.1 aBlat, Dan1 aLev-Goldman, Vered1 aScolnik, Yosef1 aKapitkovski, Aviva1 aVachutinsky, Yelena1 aShechter, Yoram1 aLevy, Yaakov0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 19, no. 2 p.798-806dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2010.12.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002900166245010400195300001400299520169700313592002802010650001302038650001702051650001302068650001502081650001802096650001902114650001002133650001802143650002302161650001602184650001402200650002302214650001402237650001202251650001802263650001802281650001702299650001302316651001402329651001602343653002602359653002402385653002102409653001402430653001002444700006002454700002802514773012502542856008102667852000902748655001202757IND60651495120221120231834.0190711e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065149512DNAL7 a287144332pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800170011482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulker, Claire Elizabeth10aUltra-processed family foods in Australia: nutrition claims, health claims and marketing techniques  ap. 38-48.  aTo objectively evaluate voluntary nutrition and health claims and marketing techniques present on packaging of high-market-share ultra-processed foods (UPF) in Australia for their potential impact on public health. Cross-sectional. Packaging information from five high-market-share food manufacturers and one retailer were obtained from supermarket and manufacturers’ websites. Ingredients lists for 215 UPF were examined for presence of added sugar. Packaging information was categorised using a taxonomy of nutrition and health information which included nutrition and health claims and five common food marketing techniques. Compliance of statements and claims with the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code and with Health Star Ratings (HSR) were assessed for all products. Almost all UPF (95 %) contained added sugars described in thirty-four different ways; 55 % of UPF displayed a HSR; 56 % had nutrition claims (18 % were compliant with regulations); 25 % had health claims (79 % were compliant); and 97 % employed common food marketing techniques. Packaging of 47 % of UPF was designed to appeal to children. UPF carried a mean of 1·5 health and nutrition claims (range 0–10) and 2·6 marketing techniques (range 0–5), and 45 % had HSR≤3·0/5·0. Most UPF packaging featured nutrition and health statements or claims despite the high prevalence of added sugars and moderate HSR. The degree of inappropriate or inaccurate statements and claims present is concerning, particularly on packaging designed to appeal to children. Public policies to assist parents to select healthy family foods should address the quality and accuracy of information provided on UPF packaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aadded sugars 3achildren 3acompliance 3afood industry 3afood marketing 3afoods 3ahealth claims 3ahealth information 3aingredients 3anutrition 3anutrition labeling 3apackaging 3aparents 3apublic health 3apublic policy 3asupermarkets 3ataxonomy 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand 0aUltra-processed foods 0aNutrition labelling 0aNutrition claims 0aMarketing 0aSugar1 aScott, Jane Anne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0765-90541 aPollard, Christina Mary0 tPublic health nutrition.g2018 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.38-48dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800170011483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245007600163300002000239520126800259592002801527650002301555650002201578650002401600650001301624650002001637650002101657650001301678650002701691700001601718700001601734700002301750700002701773700002401800700001401824700001901838700003001857700002201887773012801909856008202037852000902119655001202128IND60566265820180615000000.0170409e20160519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056626582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b012762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbáñez, J.10aStructural, Vibrational, and Electronic Study of Sb2S3 at High Pressure  ap. 10547-10558.  aAntimony trisulfide (Sb₂S₃), found in nature as the mineral stibnite, has been studied under compression at room temperature from a joint experimental and theoretical perspective. X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering measurements are complemented with ab initio total-energy, lattice-dynamics, and electronic structure calculations. The continuous changes observed in the volume, lattice parameters, axial ratios, bond lengths, and Raman mode frequencies as a function of pressure can be attributed to the different compressibility along the three orthorhombic axes in different pressure ranges, which in turn are related to the different compressibility of several interatomic bond distances in different pressure ranges. The structural and vibrational properties of Sb₂S₃ under compression are compared and discussed in relation to isostructural Bi₂S₃ and Sb₂Se₃. No first-order phase transition has been observed in Sb₂S₃ up to 25 GPa, in agreement with the stability of the Pnma structure in Bi₂S₃ and Sb₂Se₃ previously reported up to 50 GPa. Our measurements and calculations do not show evidence either for a pressure-induced second-order isostructural phase transition or for an electronic topological transition in Sb₂S₃.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3aantimony 3acompressibility 3aphase transition 3atopology 3avibrational properties1 aSans, J.

Priority is the effort to prepare high-quality feed and high-quality feedstock for the biogas plant. However, deciding which harvesting technique to choose seems a difficult task. In this study, the influence of harvest technique on silage quality and thus on the methane yield during anaerobic digestion was investigated. Maize was harvested for silage and shredlage production. Two-year results showed that the chemical composition of water leachate from silage and the total solids content did not indicate any significant differences between maize silage and shredlage. Methane yield in the first year ranged from 0.2735 ± 0.0095 m³/kgVS (maize silage) to 0.3024 ± 0.0090 m³/kgVS (shredlage) and in the second year from 0.3047 ± 0.0110 m³/kgVS (maize silage) to 0.3147 ± 0.0086 m³/kgVS (shredlage). Methane concentration in biogas did not show any significant differences for the two types of harvesting techniques in both years. The results showed that harvest technique had no additional effect on the methane content in biogas and thus on the methane yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acorn 3acorn silage 3afeed quality 3afeedstocks 3aleachates 3alivestock production 3amethane 3amethane production 3aresearch1 aElbl, Jakub1 aTravnicek, Petr1 aKobzova, Eliska1 aHammerschmiedt, Tereza1 aKoutny, Tomas1 aKintl, Antonin1 aVitezova, Monika0 tBioEnergy research.g2021 Mar., v. 14, no. 1 p.303-312dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4138147x1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-020-10173-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245010800206300001800314500001100332520078500343592002801128596008601156596010401242596007701346650002301423650001801446650002001464650001101484650001701495650002201512650002501534650002801559650001701587700001401604773014601618856008301764852000901847655001201856IND60699818220221120070110.0210720e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069981822DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-020-10640-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tian-Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0793-100610aExpression vector cassette engineering for recombinant therapeutic production in mammalian cell systems  ap. 5673-5688.  aReview  aHuman tissue plasminogen activator was the first recombinant therapy protein that successfully produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells in 1986 and approved for clinical use. Since then, more and more therapeutic proteins are being manufactured in mammalian cells, and the technologies for recombinant protein production in this expression system have developed rapidly, with the optimization of both upstream and downstream processes. One of the most promising strategies is expression vector cassette optimization based on the expression vector cassette. In this review paper, these approaches and developments are summarized, and the future strategy on the utilizing of expression cassettes for the production of recombinant therapeutic proteins in mammalian cells is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 19A350008cKey Scientific Research Projects in Universities of Henan Province  aNo. 20zx013cBasic Research Foundation of Key Scientific Research of Universities in Henan Province  aNo.191110311500cMajor Science and Technology projects of Henan Province 3aCricetulus griseus 3abiotechnology 3agenetic vectors 3ahumans 3amicrobiology 3aprotein synthesis 3arecombinant proteins 3at-plasminogen activator 3atherapeutics1 aGuo, Xiao0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 July, v. 104, no. 13 p.5673-5688dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10640-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03589naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138040001800179100005900197245013700256300001600393520206200409592002802471596007002499650002502569650001402594650001102608650001602619650001302635650002902648650002002677650001102697650001202708650001802720650001302738650002102751650001102772650001602783650001602799650002402815650001102839650001202850650001802862773011702880856008802997961001303085852000903098655001203107IND60681710920221119013158.0200117e20191205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068171092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b033112chorus7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b033112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunn, Robert O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5886-714710aCorrelating the Cold Filter Plugging Point to Concentration and Melting Properties of Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (Biodiesel) Admixtures  ap. 501-515.  aBiodiesel is a renewable alternative diesel fuel made from plant oils, waste cooking greases, and animal fats. Its most common form is fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from transesterification of lipids and methanol. Biodiesel has physical properties that compare well with conventional diesel fuel (petrodiesel). However, biodiesel has poor cold flow properties that must be monitored in cold weather. In this work, three correlation models are introduced that accurately calculate the cold filter plugging point (CFPP) of biodiesel. The models were developed using measured CFPP data from neat (unblended) biodiesel fuels and 24 binary biodiesel admixtures. The biodiesel fuels studied were from canola, palm, and soybean oils and yellow grease (CaME, PME, SME, and YGME). The solid–liquid equilibrium (SLE) model required accurate concentration, melting point (MP), and enthalpy of fusion (ΔHfᵤₛ) data for each FAME species in the mixture. These data were used to infer the SLE phase transition temperature (TSLE) of the biodiesel mixtures. The TSLE demonstrated a linear correlation (R² = 0.977) with CFPP. The MODified Empirical Correlation (MODEC) model (R² = 0.980) was obtained by analysis of (CFPP)⁻¹ versus ln(yC₁₆) data where yC₁₆ is the mass fraction of methyl palmitate (MeC16). Finally, a second-order polynomial (R² = 0.982) was derived to calculate the CFPP from the modified long-chain saturation factor (LCSFₘₒd), which was defined as a weighted average mass fraction of C16+ saturated-FAME (SFAME) in the mixtures. Weight factors were the MP of the corresponding SFAME species. Prevalidation tests on these models yielded good results for the calculated CFPP data. These performances exceeded those obtained by using 26 models from the scientific literature. The MODEC model performed better by a small margin than the other two new models. The main benefit of the MODEC model is that it requires just the yC₁₆ value instead of the complete compositional analyses needed to apply the SLE or LCSFₘₒd models.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917 3aanimal fats and oils 3abiodiesel 3acanola 3adiesel fuel 3aenthalpy 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afluid mechanics 3alipids 3amelting 3amelting point 3amethanol 3amethyl palmitate 3amodels 3asoybean oil 3atemperature 3atransesterification 3awastes 3aweather 3ayellow grease0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Dec. 05, v. 34, no. 1 p.501-515dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b033113Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011600165300001600281520126200297592002801559650001101587650000901598650002001607650003101627650001901658650001901677650002301696650002201719650001901741650001201760650002001772650001901792650001201811650001501823653001901838653002801857653002001885653001401905653001601919700002101935700001601956700001501972700001601987700001502003700001702018700001702035700001702052700001502069700001302084700001402097773008702111856008502198852000902283655001202292IND60590450420221119094714.0200419e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059045042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.01.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Long10aHigh performance graphene oxide nanofiltration membrane prepared by electrospraying for wastewater purification  ap. 487-494.  aA high performance graphene oxide nanofiltration membrane (GO NFM) was prepared using the electrospraying technique instead of the traditional vacuum filtration method, which is a facial and scalable method to prepare GO NFMs with diameter of 100 mm. The permeate performance of this novel nanofiltration membrane was evaluated using a dead end filtration device, which gave us a high flux value for pure water (11.13–20.23 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹) even under an extremely low external pressure (1.0 bar). The GO(120) NFM demonstrated high organic dyes rejection rate (98.88%, 98.97%, 100%, and 99.99%, for BF, MB, MO, and EB, respectively). The rejection mechanism for charged dyes was discussed and the results revealed that physical size sieving and electrostatic interaction dominated the rejection mechanism. The rejections rate of GO NFMs for the Na₂SO₄, NaCl, MgSO₄, and MgCl₂ were 63.13%, 27.86%, 41.82%, and 15.00%, respectively, based on the mechanism of Donnan exclusion theory and steric hindrance effect. Furthermore, the GO NFM shows high flux recovery ratio (FRR) values (89.58% and 95.54% for SA and HA), suggesting that the GO NFM is easier to be recovered by DI water washing due to the smooth and hydrophilic surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adyes 3aelectrospraying 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3amagnesium chloride 3amagnesium sulfate 3ananofiltration 3asieving 3asodium chloride 3asodium sulfate 3awashing 3awastewater 0aGraphene oxide 0aNanofiltration membrane 0aElectrospraying 0aRejection 0aAntifouling1 aMoon, Jung-Hyeon1 aMa, Xiaoxin1 aZhang, Lin1 aChen, Qiong1 aChen, Lina1 aPeng, Ruiqin1 aSi, Pengchao1 aFeng, Jinkui1 aLi, Yanhui1 aLou, Jun1 aCi, Lijie0 tCarbon.g2018 Apr., v. 130 p.487-494dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.01.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245015300176300001400329520145000343592002801793650004401821650002101865650001501886650002501901650001701926650001301943650002601956650002101982650001802003650001802021650005202039650001502091653003302106653003202139653003302171653003102204700002202235700002602257700002702283700002502310700001902335700001902354700006702373773009002440856008502530852000902615655001202624IND60599441020221119184522.0180702e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059944102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChonanant, Chirapond10aDiscrimination of micromass-induced chondrocytes from human mesenchymal stem cells by focal plane array-Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy  ap. 39-48.  aRapid and sensitive methods for identifying stem cell differentiation state are required for facilitating future stem cell therapies. We aimed to evaluate the capability of focal plane array-Fourier transform infrared (FPA-FTIR) microspectroscopy for characterising the differentiation of chondrocytes from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Successful induction was validated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis for collagen and aggrecan expression as chondrocyte markers in parallel with the spectroscopy. Spectra derived from chondrocyte-induced cells revealed strong IR absorbance bands attributed to collagen near 1338 and 1234cm⁻¹ and proteoglycan at 1245 and 1175–960cm⁻¹ compared to the non-induced cells. In addition, spectra from control and induced cells are segregated into separate clusters in partial least squares discriminant analysis score plots at the very early stages of induction and discrimination of an independent set of validation spectra with 100% accuracy. The predominant bands responsible for this discrimination were associated with collagen and aggrecan protein concordant with those obtained from RT-PCR and Western blot techniques. Our findings support the capability of FPA-FTIR microspectroscopy as a label-free tool for stem cell characterization allowing rapid and sensitive detection of macromolecular changes during chondrogenic differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aWestern blotting 3aabsorbance 3acell differentiation 3achondrocytes 3acollagen 3adiscriminant analysis 3ahuman cell lines 3aleast squares 3aproteoglycans 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astem cells 0aHuman mesenchymal stem cells 0aMicromass culture technique 0aChondrogenic differentiation 0aFPA-FTIR microspectroscopy1 aBambery, Keith R.1 aJearanaikoon, Nichada1 aChio-Srichan, Sirinart1 aLimpaiboon, Temduang1 aTobin, Mark J.1 aHeraud, Philip1 aJearanaikoon, Patcharee1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0165-56930 tTalanta.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 130 p.39-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008300170300001600253500001900269520112000288592002801408650003501436650000901471650001701480650000901497650000901506650001401515650000901529650001001538650002701548650001801575651001101593700002901604700002301633700002501656700002401681700002401705700002701729700006101756773011401817856008201931852000902013655001202022IND60681785120221119222415.0200117e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068178512DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-019-01614-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChagas, Manoel P.10aDetermination and Evaluation of Lead Migration for Foods Prepared in Clay Pots  ap. 268-274.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis work presents a study to evaluate the migration of lead to cooked foods prepared in clay pots produced in a small community in Brazil. Clay pots produced in Maragogipinho, Bahia, Brazil, go through an artisanal vitrification process by the addition of lead oxide to improve the visual appearance of the pot. To evaluate the migration of the lead to the food, samples of a fish-based delicacy (fish stew), with and without palm oil and coconut milk, were taken at different moments of contact with the clay container after cooking. Determination of lead concentrations was performed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and the concentrations found were higher than 2.0 mg kg⁻¹, which is the value regulated by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency. In addition, the highest concentrations of lead were detected in samples with a longer contact time with the pan. The longer the contact time was, the higher the lead content that migrated to the food. These results suggest that cooking and storing foods in the glazed clay pots pose a potential risk of lead contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aclay 3acoconut milk 3afish 3alead 3apalm oils 3arisk 3astews 3atraditional technology 3avitrification 3aBrazil1 aTeixeira, Leonardo S.

Here, we document the distribution and seasonality of 4 taxonomic groups that use P. pugio as a host in coastal Alabama. We conducted a regional survey of 4 symbionts of P. pugio over 3 seasons and compared assemblages across space and time. The most common parasite was the metacercarial stage of the microphallid trematode Microphallus turgidus, which remained consistently prevalent over the 3 seasons surveyed. We also monitored the prevalence of M. turgidus at 2 sites monthly. Prevalence fluctuated significantly among seasons at these sites, but spatial heterogeneity appears to have a stronger influence on regional parasite prevalence. Distributions of 3 of 4 symbionts overlapped in a single geographic area (Mon Louis Island, Alabama, U.S.A.); however, multispecies infections of individual hosts were normally distributed within host populations. Sites surrounding Mon Louis Island had substantially higher parasite prevalence, particularly in the summer months. This area had a high quantity of Spartina marsh habitat, which we found influenced parasite prevalence, suggesting a role for wetland habitat in structuring parasite communities for this host.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPalaemonetes 0aparasite assemblage 0adistribution 0awetland 0aciliate 0abopyrid 0ahaplosporidian 0amicrophallid trematode 0aAlabama gulf coast1 aLafferty, Kevin D.1 aO'Brien, Jack1 aCebrian, Just0 tComparative parasitology.g2011 July, v. 78, no. 2 p.245-256dThe Helminthological Society of Washingtonx1525-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1654%2F4427.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010700167300001400274520111500288592002801403650003001431650001801461650002201479650001901501650001601520650001901536650001601555650001301571650001301584650002501597650001301622650001601635650002001651650001401671650000701685650001401692650001101706650001601717650001101733653001001744653003401754700001301788700001501801700001501816773008701831856008301918990002302001852000902024655001202033IND60697475620221119195034.0200605e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069747562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jiajun10aWhite spot syndrome virus enters crayfish hematopoietic tissue cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis  ap. 35-43.  aWhite spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a major pathogen of aquacultured shrimp. However, the mechanism of its entry remains poorly understood. In this study, by analyzing the internalization of WSSV using crayfish hematopoietic tissue (HPT) cells, we showed that WSSV virions were engulfed by cell membrane invaginations sharing the features of clathrin-coated pits and then internalized into coated cytoplasmic vesicles. Further investigation indicated that WSSV internalization was significantly inhibited by chlorpromazine (CPZ) but not genistein. The internalized virions were colocalized with endogenous clathrin as well as transferrin which undergoes clathrin-dependent uptake. Preventing endosome acidification by ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) or chloroquine (CQ) dramatically reduced WSSV entry as well. Moreover, disturbance of dynamin activity or depletion of membrane cholesterol also blocked WSSV uptake. These data indicate that WSSV enters crayfish HPT cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis in a pH-dependent manner, and membrane cholesterol as well as dynamin is critical for efficient viral entry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3aacidification 3aammonium chloride 3acell membranes 3achloroquine 3achlorpromazine 3acholesterol 3aclathrin 3acrayfish 3acytoplasmic vesicles 3adynamins 3aendocytosis 3aenzyme activity 3agenistein 3apH 3apathogens 3ashrimp 3atransferrin 3avirion 0aEntry 0aClathrin-mediated endocytosis1 aLi, Fang1 aWu, Junjun1 aYang, Feng0 tVirology.g2015 Dec., v. 486 p.35-43dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.08.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010000170300001800270520173600288592002802024650000802052650001402060650001402074650000902088650001102097653002602108653004202134653002402176653003102200653002702231653002902258700002102287700001202308700001602320700001602336700001702352700001702369700001702386773010002403856008702503852000902590655001202599IND60581723620221119090632.0190822e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058172362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Xiaochen10aFree piston expander-linear generator used for organic Rankine cycle waste heat recovery system  ap. 1297-1307.  aThis study presents an experimental investigation of a free piston expander-linear generator (FPE-LG) used for organic Rankine cycle (ORC) waste heat recovery system. A FPE-LG test rig using compressed air as working fluid is established. The motion characteristics, dynamic characteristics and the indicated efficiency of FPE-LG are analyzed. The motion characteristics and power output performance for different valve timings are studied. The degree of symmetry is defined to evaluate the asymmetry motion characteristics of the free piston assembly. The coefficient of cycle-to-cycle variation (COV) is presented to evaluate the cycle-to-cycle variation characteristics of the FPE-LG. Experimental results show that the free piston assembly displacement profile is similar to a sinusoidal wave and the free piston assembly can operate at high and relatively constant speed at the middle portion of the stroke. The maximum power output of 19W can be achieved when the intake pressure is 2.0bar and the operation frequency is 2.5Hz. The valve timing and intake pressure demonstrate a significant influence on the asymmetric motion and the power output performance of the FPE-LG. The indicated efficiency of the FPE (left cylinder) decreases with the increase in the intake pressure. The maximum indicated efficiency reaches 92.8% when the intake pressure is 1.4bar and the operation frequency is 2.0Hz. The indicated efficiency firstly increases and then decreases with the increase in the operation frequency. The COV of the FPE-LG decreases with increasing the intake pressure. The motion stability of FPE-LG improves with the increase in the intake pressure. Valve timing and valve train should be optimized in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aasymmetry 3acylinders 3aheat 3awastes 0aOrganic Rankine cycle 0aFree piston expander-linear generator 0aWaste heat recovery 0aExperimental investigation 0aMotion characteristics 0aPower output performance1 aZhang, Hongguang1 aYu, Fei1 aLiu, Hongda1 aYang, Fubin1 aXu, Yonghong1 aTian, Yaming1 aLi, Gaosheng0 tApplied energy.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 208 p.1297-1307dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012600175300001600301520126300317592002801580650002301608650002701631650002601658650001201684650001401696650001801710650001601728650001401744650003001758651001601788653001401804653001401818653002501832653002101857653001401878653002501892700002501917700002201942773014001964856008602104852000902190655001202199IND60705330320221120062542.0210627e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070533032DNAL7 a10.1080/00288233.2019.16202962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhanizadeh, Hossein14aThe target site mutation Ile-2041-Asn is associated with resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides in Lolium multiflorum  ap. 416-429.  aAcetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors such as haloxyfop, pinoxaden and clethodim selectively control grass weed species in many types of crop. Here, we characterised two populations of Lolium multiflorum (Italian ryegrass), R and RV, from South Canterbury and Central Otago respectively, that were suspected to be resistant to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides. Based on 50% reduction in biomass (GR₅₀), in two dose–response experiments, both populations were highly resistant to haloxyfop with resistance factors (RF) >400 times, but resistance to pinoxaden was low (RF of 2). Furthermore, population R was found to be moderately resistant to clethodim (RF >4, based on 50% reduction in survival (LD₅₀)), but population RV had RFs barely greater than 1, based on GR₅₀. Gene sequencing showed that the same target site mutation (Ile-2041-Asn) was associated with resistance to the three herbicides in both populations. The zygosity of the resistance alleles in the plants tested could cause the differences in resistance to clethodim observed between the populations, even though they carried the same mutation. This is the first report of the mechanism of resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides in Italian ryegrass from New Zealand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium multiflorum 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aagricultural research 3abiomass 3aclethodim 3adose response 3agrass weeds 3ahaloxyfop 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aNew Zealand 0aClethodim 0ahaloxyfop 0aherbicide resistance 0aItalian ryegrass 0apinoxaden 0atarget site mutation1 aHarrington, Kerry C.1 aMesarich, Carl H.0 tNew Zealand journal of agricultural research.g2020 July 2, v. 63, no. 3 p.416-429dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl16066x1175-87757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288233.2019.16202963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245014100204500001400345520153000359592002801889650001801917650002301935650001001958650001701968650002501985650001302010650001002023650001202033650000902045650004302054650001302097650002202110650001702132653001302149653000702162653000802169653001002177653000802187653001002195653001202205653000902217653000902226653001702235653001502252653001002267700001902277700001902296700001102315773008802326856008302414852000902497655001202506IND60704808020221119211230.0200907e20201130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070480802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2020.1449712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wenjin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2854-338410aCirc_0123996 promotes cell proliferation and fibrosis in mouse mesangial cells through sponging miR-149-5p and inducing Bach1 expression  aNAL-light  aDiabetic nephropathy (DN) is a serious microvascular complication of diabetes across the world. Recently, many circular RNAs (circRNAs) can exert a crucial role in DN progression. Our investigation was designed to study whether circ_0123996 was associated with DN and aimed to find out the underlying mechanisms. We observed that circ_0123996 expression was significantly increased in Type 2 diabetes (T2D) with DN in comparison to those patients without DN. Consistently, circ_0123996 was also obviously elevated in DN mice models and high glucose (HG)-incubated MMCs. Then, it was proved transfection of circ_0123996 siRNA in mice mesangial cells (MMCs) restrained MMCs proliferation greatly. In addition, it was demonstrated that decrease of circ_0123996 alleviated fibrosis-related protein expression including FN and Col-4 in MMCs. Next, it was confirmed by our study that circ_0123996 can serve as a sponge for miR-149-5p. miR-149-5p has been identified in several diseases including diabetes. At present, we observed that miR-149-5p was decreased in DN. Overexpression of miR-149-5p greatly repressed the effect of circ_0123996 on MMCs. BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1) is reported in various disease including some vascular diseases.Here, Bach1 was confirmed as a target of miR-149-5p. Circ_0123996 upregulated Bach1 expression and restrained MMCs proliferation and fibrosis through sponging miR-149-5p. Thus, it was revealed that circ_0123996 was involved in DN via sponging miR-149-5p and modulating Bach1 expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acell proliferation 3acells 3acircular RNA 3adiabetic nephropathy 3afibrosis 3agenes 3aglucose 3amice 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aprotein synthesis 3atransfection 0acircRNAs 0aDN 0aT2D 0aBach1 0aEdU 0aCCK-8 0aQRT-PCR 0acDNA 0aMMCs 0aCirc_0123996 0amiR-149-5p 0aBach11 aFeng, Jingfang1 aZhou, Hongying1 aLi, Qi0 tGene.g2020 Nov. 30, v. 761 p.144971-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.1449713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04063naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014100164300001600305520200600321592002802327596006602355596005902421596005902480596009202539596011902631596006302750650001902813650002402832650001402856650001002870650002202880650001302902650002202915650002902937650001602966650001202982650001602994650001503010650000903025650001203034650001203046651001003058700001803068700001303086700005103099700001403150700001803164700001803182700001603200700001303216700001903229700001503248773010603263856008303369852000903452655001203461IND60725503320221119181119.0210716e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072550332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-020-01591-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chuanfa10aDiazotrophic Community Variation Underlies Differences in Nitrogen Fixation Potential in Paddy Soils Across a Climatic Gradient in China  ap. 425-436.  aBiological nitrogen (N₂) fixation as a source of new N input into the soil by free-living diazotrophs is important for achieving sustainable rice agriculture. However, the dominant environmental drivers or factors influencing N₂ fixation and the functional significance of the diazotroph community structure in paddy soil across a climatic gradient are not yet well understood. Thus, we characterized the diazotroph community and identified the ecological predictors of N₂ fixation potential in four different climate zones (mid-temperate, warm-temperate, subtropical, and tropical paddy soils) in eastern China. Comprehensive nifH gene sequencing, functional activity detection, and correlation analysis with environmental factors were estimated. The potential nitrogenase activity (PNA) was highest in warm-temperate regions, where it was 6.2-, 2.9-, and 2.2-fold greater than in the tropical, subtropical, and mid-temperate regions, respectively; nifH gene abundance was significantly higher in warm-temperate and subtropical zones than in the tropical or mid-temperate zones. Diazotroph diversity was significantly higher in the tropical climate zone and significantly lower in the mid-temperate zone. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and canonical correlation analysis indicated that paddy soil diazotroph populations differed significantly among the four climate zones, mainly owing to differences in climate and soil pH. Structural equation models and automatic linear models revealed that climate and nutrients indirectly affected PNA by affecting soil pH and diazotroph community, respectively, while diazotroph community, C/P, and nifH gene abundance directly affected PNA. And C/P ratio, pH, and the diazotroph community structure were the main predictors of PNA in paddy soils. Collectively, the differences in diazotroph community structure have ecological significance, with important implications for the prediction of soil N₂-fixing functions under climate change scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0800104cNational Key Research and Development program  a41977100cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41771300cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018WK4012cHunan Province Base for Scientific and Technological Innovation Cooperation  a2017QNCXTD_GTDcYouth Innovation Team Project of Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences  a2019JJ10003cNatural Science Foundation of Hunan Province 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3aequations 3agenes 3amicrobial ecology 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3anitrogenase 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3aprediction 3arice 3asoil pH 3atropics 3aChina1 aWei, Xiaomeng1 aHu, Ziye1 aLiu, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5688-13241 aHu, Yajun1 aQin, Hongling1 aChen, Xiangbi1 aWu, Jinshui1 aGe, Tida1 aZhran, Mostafa1 aSu, Yirong0 tMicrobial ecology.g2021 Feb., v. 81, no. 2 p.425-436dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01591-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245017800169300001600347520121600363592002801579650002101607650001301628650001401641650001501655650001001670650002101680650001501701650002201716650001701738650000901755650001001764650002201774651001001796651001001806651001301816653002901829653001501858653007701873700002201950700002201972700002701994700001802021700002202039700005902061700001502120773017202135856008502307852000902392655001202401IND60557538120221121043355.0180904e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055753812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2016.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkumura, Marie10aCultivable Methylobacterium species diversity in rice seeds identified with whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis  ap. 190-196.  aMethylobacterium species are methylotrophic bacteria that widely inhabit plant surfaces. In addition to studies on methylotrophs as model organisms, research has also been conducted on their mechanism of plant growth promotion as well as the species–species specificity of plant–microbe interaction. We employed whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (WC-MS) analysis, which enables the rapid and accurate identification of bacteria at the species level, to identify Methylobacterium isolates collected from the rice seeds of different cultivars harvested in Japan, Thailand, and Kenya. Rice seeds obtained from diverse geographical locations showed different communities of Methylobacterium species. We found that M. fujisawaense, M. aquaticum, M. platani, and M. radiotolerans are the most frequently isolated species, but none were isolated as common species from 18 seed samples due to the highly biased communities in some samples. These findings will contribute to the development of formulations containing selected species that promote rice growth, though it may be necessary to customize the formulations depending on the cultivars and farm conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethylobacterium 3abacteria 3acultivars 3adesorption 3afarms 3agrowth promotion 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3aplant growth 3arice 3aseeds 3aspecies diversity 3aJapan 3aKenya 3aThailand 0aMethylobacterium species 0aRice seeds 0aWhole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry1 aFujitani, Yoshiko1 aMaekawa, Masahiko1 aCharoenpanich, Jittima1 aMurage, Hunja1 aKimbara, Kazuhide1 aSahin, Nurettin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1049-61801 aTani, Akio0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2017 Feb., v. 123, no. 2 p.190-196dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2016.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245009600183300001600279520136000295536020701655592002801862596001301890650002601903650001001929650001101939650002501950650001301975650001001988650001301998650001902011650002002030650000902050650001102059650001702070651001602087653002002103653001402123653003102137653001702168653003002185700002402215700001802239700002602257700002002283700002102303773014002324856008602464852000902550655001202559IND60705330520221120054054.0210627e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070533052DNAL7 a10.1080/00288233.2019.16368292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuddenhagen, Christopher E.10aCosts and risks associated with surveying the extent of herbicide resistance in New Zealand  ap. 430-448.  aHerbicide resistance has repeatedly developed under intensive herbicidal weed management regimes globally with 255 species having resistant biotypes. In New Zealand, since 1979, resistance was found in 13 taxa, with >25 herbicides in 8 chemical classes showing reduced effectiveness (i.e. HRAC groups A, B, C, D, F, G, H, N and O). Cases included weeds in turf, pastures, orchards, vineyards, forage and arable crops. Surprisingly little is known about the spatial extent or frequency of this problem in New Zealand. We estimate that 14,000 farms have land-use histories like those favouring herbicide resistance historically. Sampling simulations of ≥10% farms provided good estimates of resistance prevalence for most regions and crop types. Acceptable sampling rates varied with target population size, actual resistance prevalence, and detection certainty. Our simulations provide a sobering caution regarding our ability to delimit the problem cheaply or accurately. Detection rates lower than 75% always give imprecise prevalence estimates. Sampling and screening involved 7.4 h labour and 27 km of travel costing $759 NZD per farm. Sampling 10% of farms would cost >$1 million NZD if lower risk farms were excluded, or >$3 million in exhaustive surveys. Regional farm and industry breakdowns could guide cost-sharing arrangements for surveys.  aThis work was supported by Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [grant number C10X1806] to AgResearch: Improved weed control and vegetation management to minimise future herbicide resistance.  aPublisher supplied data  aC10X1806 3aagricultural research 3afarms 3aforage 3aherbicide resistance 3aindustry 3alabor 3aland use 3alawns and turf 3apopulation size 3arisk 3atravel 3aweed control 3aNew Zealand 0aRisk assessment 0ascreening 0auncertainty quantification 0acost-sharing 0aevidence-based management1 aGunnarsson, Matilda1 aRolston, Phil1 aChynoweth, Richard J.1 aBourdot, Graeme1 aJames, Trevor K.0 tNew Zealand journal of agricultural research.g2020 July 2, v. 63, no. 3 p.430-448dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl16066x1175-87757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288233.2019.16368293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002600136245015100162300001600313520087600329592002801205653001901233653002001252653003001272653003401302653002601336653002801362700001501390773012601405856007201531852000901603655001201612IND60126091720221120040713.0151105e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012609172DNAL7 a10.1654/4476.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichardson, Dennis J.10aPostcyclic Transmission of Leptorhynchoides thecatus and Neoechinorhynchus cylindratus (Acanthocephala) to Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides)  ap. 233-235.  aThis study investigated the postcyclic transmission of Neoechinorhynchus cylindratus and Leptorhynchoides thecatus, including gravid female worms, between largemouth bass. Twenty largemouth bass were each given 10 individuals of N. cylindratus taken from the enteric system of largemouth bass, and 10 largemouth bass were each given 10 individuals of L. thecatus taken from the enteric system of largemouth bass. After 2 wk, bass were necropsied and examined for the presence of worms. Six and a half percent of N. cylindratus and 11%% of L. thecatus were successfully transferred postcyclically, thus demonstrating that postcyclic transmission of N. cylindratus and L. thecatus, including gravid females, does occur. This provides a potential explanation for the high prevalence of these acanthocephalans often observed in large, exclusively piscivorous largemouth bass.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAcanthocephala 0alargemouth bass 0aLeptorhynchoides thecatus 0aNeoechinorhynchus cylindratus 0aMicropterus salmoides 0apostcyclic transmission1 aAbdo, Adel0 tComparative parasitology.g2011 July, v. 78, no. 2 p.233-235dThe Helminthological Society of Washingtonx1525-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1654%2F4476.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008200162300001800244520127300262592002801535650000801563650002501571650001901596650001501615700001401630700001301644700001401657700001601671700001501687700001601702773010001718856008101818990002301899852000901922655001201931IND60093760920221120221736.0141104e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009376092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2011.04.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, T.H.10aAtmospheric pressure microplasma source based on parallel stripline resonator  ap. S126-S130.  aMicroplasma sources with potential use in different applications can be found in the recent literature. The lifetime of most microplasma sources operating at atmospheric pressure is limited by electrode erosion due to energetic ion bombardment. These drawbacks were solved recently by several microplasma sources based on microstrip structure, which are more efficient and less prone to perturbations than other microplasma sources. This paper proposes a microplasma system source based on microwave parallel stripline resonator (MPSR), developed for the generation of microplasmas even in atmospheric air and analyzes the MPSR system with microwave field simulation via comparative study with two previous microwave sources (Microwave Spit Ring Resonator (MSRR), Microstrip Structure Source (MSS)). The result shows that the MPSR can concentrate a strong electric field of which direction is rather parallel to the stripline surface around the discharge gap, compared with other plasma sources. From the result, it is expected that the MPSR can be operated readily in low power level with high electron density because of its high strength of electric field and low plasma loss rate stemming from the parallel direction of the electric field to the stripline surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatmospheric pressure 3aelectric field 3aelectrodes1 aYou, S.J.1 aPark, M.1 aKim, J.H.1 aSeong, D.J.1 aShin, Y.H.1 aJeong, J.R.0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 Sept., v. 11, no. 5S p.S126-S130dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2011.04.0493Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245006100197300001600258500002000274520156700294592002801861596007401889596005901963650001702022650001102039650001902050650000902069650002202078650002502100650001802125650003002143650001302173700001802186700001502204700001602219700001702235700002102252700005902273773012502332856007402457852000902531655001202540IND60754088120221119170637.0211023e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075408812DNAL7 a10.1111/vop.129242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTajima, Kazuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2663-471X10aPrimary cell culture of canine corneal endothelial cells  ap. 447-454.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To establish a primary cell culture and clarify the characteristics of canine corneal endothelial cells in vitro. PROCEDURES: The eyes were enucleated from dogs that were euthanized for reasons unrelated to this study. Enucleated canine eyes were dissected, and the intact corneas were isolated from the globes. Using enzymes, the corneal endothelial cells were dispersed from the cornea. The obtained canine corneal endothelial cells were cultured in a cell culture dish. Cultured corneal endothelial cells were morphologically evaluated using phase‐contrast microscopy. Immunohistochemical analysis of the cultured cells, particularly of the corneal endothelial cell marker, zonula occludens‐1 (ZO‐1), Na⁺/K⁺‐ATPase, and vimentin, was performed to clarify whether the cultured cells were actually corneal endothelial cells. Furthermore, the post‐passage morphology of cultured cells was evaluated. RESULTS: Canine primary cultured corneal endothelial cells showed morphologically small, cobblestone‐like structures. The isolated cells had proliferative ability in vitro and demonstrated positive expression of the corneal endothelial cell markers, ZO‐1, Na⁺/K⁺‐ATPase, and vimentin. However, repeated passages resulted in larger cell sizes as assessed by phase‐contrast microscopy. Repeated passages also resulted in lower cell density. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the successful culture of canine corneal endothelial cells. This might enhance the understanding of corneal endothelial cell characteristics in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data  a2228‐3244cKitasato University Research Grant for Young Researchers  aJP20K15666cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3acell culture 3acornea 3aculture dishes 3adogs 3aendothelial cells 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aophthalmology 3aphase-contrast microscopy 3avimentin1 aOkada, Misaki1 aKudo, Rina1 aOtaka, Yuya1 aKita, Mizuki1 aYamashita, Yohei1 aKanai, Kazutaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3690-23320 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2021 Sept., v. 24, no. 5 p.447-454dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58131x1463-52167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.129243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245015100163520165400314592002801968650001501996650001602011650001102027650001202038650001902050650001502069650001202084650001402096650001202110650001402122650002602136650001102162650001402173650001802187650000902205650001702214650002102231650001102252650001602263650001102279650001402290651002202304773012302326856007302449852000902522655001202531IND60660460120221119232530.0190823e20190726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066046012DNAL7 a10.3390/d110801232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrundrett, Mark C.,12aA Comprehensive Study of Orchid Seed Production Relative to Pollination Traits, Plant Density and Climate in an Urban Reserve in Western Australia  aThe pollination of 20 common terrestrial orchids was studied in a 60-ha urban banksia and eucalypt dominated woodland in Western Australia. Five years of data (24,000 flowers, 6800 plants) measured fruit set relative to floral areas, capsule volumes, climate, phenology, pollination mechanisms, disturbance tolerance and demography. Pollination varied from 0&ndash;95% of flowers, floral displays from 90&ndash;3300 mm2 and capsules from 15&ndash;1300 mm3 per spike. Pollination traits strongly influenced outcomes, with self-pollination highest (59&mdash;95%), followed by sexually deceptive autumn or winter-flowering (18&ndash;39%), visual deception (0&ndash;48%) and sexually deceptive spring-flowering (13&ndash;16%). Pollination was limited by drought in autumn or spring and cool winter temperatures. Some orchids were resilient to drought and one formed seed after the leaves withered. Plant density had the greatest impact on fruit set for orchids forming large groups, especially for sexually deceptive pollination. Consequently, small group average (SGA) pollination was up to 4&times; greater than overall averages and peak seed production occurred in the best locations for genetic exchange and dispersal. SGA rates and seedpod volumes were strongly linked to clonality, but not to demographic trends. Resource competition limited flowering at higher plant densities and competition within spikes resulted in smaller, later-forming seedpods. Pollination data from co-occurring common orchids identified five evolutionary trade-offs linked to pollination, provided baseline data for rare species and revealed impacts of changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aOrchidaceae 3aautumn 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ademography 3adrought 3aflowering 3aflowers 3afruit set 3agenetic recombination 3aleaves 3aphenology 3aplant density 3apods 3arare species 3aself-pollination 3aspring 3atemperature 3awinter 3awoodlands 3aWestern Australia0 tDiversity.g2019 July 26, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d110801233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03473naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009900174300001600273500001500289520173400304592002802038650001902066650001402085650001002099650002102109650001302130650002502143650002802168650002302196650001002219650002802229650002702257650002502284650002602309650001402335653002602349653001502375653001402390653002702404653002102431653001702452700003302469700006602502700002602568700006702594700002102661700001902682700002002701773010302721856008602824852000902910655001202919IND60535898420221120050546.0190318e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053589842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollmann, Gabriela10aAntioxidant activity stimulated by ultraviolet radiation in the nervous system of a crustacean  ap. 151-162.  a2019-12-06  aUltraviolet (UV) radiation can produce biological damage, principally oxidative stress, by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study evaluated biochemical impairments related to the oxidative stress induced by UVA, UVB and UVA+UVB (solar simulator-SIM) in environmental doses, during five consecutive days of exposure, in the brain and eyestalk of the crab Ucides cordatus. We evaluated these regions by sampling on the 1st, 3rd and 5th days of UV exposure for lipid peroxidation (LPO), antioxidant capacity against the peroxyl radical (ACAP), and the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Immunohistochemical and immunoblotting assays were performed for anti-activated-caspase 3 in the brains. After the first day of exposure, LPO increased in the eyestalks and brains of the UV-exposed animals; ACAP, and CAT, GPX and GST activities also increased in the brains. On the third day, the LPO values in the eyestalk remained high in the UV-exposed groups, while ACAP decreased in the brain and eyestalk and CAT activity remained high in all irradiated groups in both regions. On the fifth day, LPO decreased in the eyestalk and brain of the UV-exposed groups. These results may have been a consequence of the antioxidant defense system (ADS) activity, since CAT activity was high in both regions, ACAP was high in the eyestalks of the SIM group, and GPX activity remained high in the eyestalks of the UVA and UVB groups. Immunohistochemical assays and immunoblotting showed that there was apoptosis in the brains of the UV-exposed crabs. In conclusion, environmental doses of UV can cause oxidative damage to the CNS cells, including apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunoblotting 3aCrustacea 3acrabs 3aoxidative stress 3acatalase 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aglutathione transferase 3alipid peroxidation 3abrain 3areactive oxygen species 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aantioxidant activity 3aultraviolet radiation 3aapoptosis 0aUltraviolet radiation 0aCrustacean 0aApoptosis 0aCentral Nervous System 0aOxidative stress 0aantioxidants1 aFerreira, Gabrielle de Jesus1 aGeihs, Márcio Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3158-630X1 aVargas, Marcelo Alves1 aNery, Luiz Eduardo Maia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0205-469X1 aLeitão, Alvaro,1 aLinden, Rafael1 aAllodi, Silvana0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 Mar., v. 160 p.151-162dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006600168300001400234500001500248520085400263592002801117650002001145650003501165650002701200650001101227650002801238650002001266650001601286650001101302650002101313650001101334650001701345653002801362700001801390700002201408773011001430856008401540852000901624655001201633IND60553614220221120041535.0161021e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055361422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2013.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuni, Camilla10aHuman-on-chip for therapy development and fundamental science  ap. 45-50.  a2019-12-06  aOrgan-on-chip systems integrate microfluidic technology and living cells to study human physiology and pathophysiology.

The focal image characteristics of the solar dish are determined to propose the suitable design of absorber/receiver. First, theoretical thermal performance analysis of the fuzzy focal solar parabolic dish concentrator with modified cavity receiver is carried out for different operating conditions. Based on the theoretical performance analysis, the total heat loss (conduction, convection and radiation heat losses) from the modified cavity receiver is estimated. It is observed that the maximum theoretical efficiencies of solar dish collector are found to be as 79.2% for no wind conditions and 78.2% and 77.8% for side-on and head-on winds speed of 5 m/s respectively. Latter, real time analysis of parabolic dish collector with modified cavity receiver is carried out in terms of stagnation test, time constant test and daily performance test. From stagnation test, the overall heat loss coefficient is found to be 356 W/m² K. The time constant test is carried out to determine the influence of sudden change in solar radiation at steady state conditions. The daily performance tests are conducted for different flow rates. It is found that the efficiency of the collector increases with the increase of volume flow rates. The average thermal efficiencies of the parabolic dish collector for the volume flow rate of 100 L/h and 250 L/h are found to be 69% and 74% for the average beam radiation (Ibn) of 532 W/m² and 641 W/m² respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvection 3aprototypes 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar collectors 3asolar radiation 3awind 0aSolar dish concentrator 0aModified cavity receiver 0aFocal flux distribution 0aPerformance test 0aStagnation test 0aTime constant1 aNatarajan, Sendhil Kumar1 aVeershetty, G.0 tRenewable energy.g2015 Feb., v. 74 p.148-157dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.07.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245013800161300001300299520119100312592002801503650001501531650001501546650001201561650002101573650001401594650001901608650001601627650001201643650002001655650002401675650001601699650001801715650001601733650001701749650002001766653002601786653001301812653000901825653001201834653001501846700001801861700001201879700001901891700001401910700001601924700001701940700001801957773012201975856008202097852000902179655001202188IND60599318520221120141051.0180702e20141115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059931852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.07.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bo10aOne-pot, solid-phase synthesis of magnetic multiwalled carbon nanotube/iron oxide composites and their application in arsenic removal  ap. 9-17.  aCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) functionalized with magnetic nanoparticles are attractive for environmental remediation applications due to their high specific surface area conducive for adsorption of water contaminants and the possibility of recovering these nanohybrids after remediation using an external magnetic field. Most of existing methods for synthesizing magnetic iron oxide/CNTs (MIO–CNTs) composites are carried out in the liquid medium and are tedious, uneconomical, and environmentally unfriendly. Herein, we report a one-pot solid-phase route to synthesize MIO–CNTs composites based on pristine CNTs. MIO–CNTs possess a high specific surface area, good dispersibility, and desirable magnetic properties, making them promising as adsorbents for arsenic removal. The maximum arsenic adsorption capacities are 47.41 and 24.05mgg⁻¹ for As(V) and As(III), respectively. These values are among the highest for carbon-based materials. Oxygen-containing groups on the surface of MIO–CNTs play a crucial role in arsenic adsorption. This work is very important for the practical applications of pristine CNTs containing catalyst nanoparticles without the need of purifications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3adispersibility 3airon oxides 3aliquids 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic properties 3ananohybrids 3ananoparticles 3aremediation 3asurface area 3awater pollution 0aSolid-phase synthesis 0aMagnetic 0aCNTs 0aArsenic 0aAdsorption1 aZhu, Zhiliang1 aMa, Jie1 aYang, Mingxuan1 aHong, Jun1 aHu, Xiaohui1 aQiu, Yanling1 aChen, Junhong0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 Nov. 15, v. 434 p.9-17dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.07.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008700167300001600254520104000270592002801310650004401338650001601382650002201398650001901420650003301439650001601472650002201488650001601510700002301526773009601549856008101645990002301726852000901749655001201758IND60093761220221120212109.0141104e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009376122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2011.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElashmawi, I.S.10aSpectroscopic studies of hydroxyapatite in PVP/PVA polymeric matrix as biomaterial  ap. 141-146.  aThis system is focusing on characterization and spectroscopic studies of PVA and PVP blend and the blend filled with various mass fractions (2.5, 5 and 10%) of HAp because it has great potential for applications in the medical purposes.

The transesterification of baobab oil was carried out using sodium methoxide as a homogeneous catalyst. One factor at a time experimental design was used to study the effect of temperature (30–70°C), time (0.5–2.5h), catalyst to oil ratio (0.7–3.5wt.%) and methanol to oil ratio (10–50wt.%) on the transesterification of baobab oil. Optimum biodiesel production conditions were as follows: reaction temperature (60°C), reaction time (1h), catalyst to oil ratio (1.4wt.%) and methanol to oil ratio (30wt.%). An optimum biodiesel yield of 96wt.% was obtained. Important fuel properties such kinematic viscosity, density, flash point, pour point, cloud point, oxidation stability and cetane number were measured and compared to the biodiesel properties in the European and American biodiesel standards (EN and ASTM standard). Results show that important fuel properties of biodiesel from baobab oil met both EN and ASTM standard.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdansonia digitata 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3aexperimental design 3afuel oils 3afuel production 3amethanol 3aoxidative stability 3apour point 3aseed oils 3asodium 3atemperature 3atransesterification 3aviscosity 0aBiodiesel 0aTransesterification 0aBaobab oil 0aSodium methoxide 0aFuel properties1 aOsifo, Peter1 aRutto, Hilary0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2014 Aug., v. 59 p.50-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.04.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05272naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245022400179300001600403520306100419592002803480650002903508650002703537650002103564650001403585650002303599650002103622650001703643650001703660650001703677650001803694650001703712650001803729650001603747650001003763650002803773650002103801650001503822650001603837650002103853650001103874650001903885650002003904650001203924650001903936650001903955650001703974650001103991650003104002653002604033653001504059653003004074653000804104653002004112653001704132653001704149653001704166653000904183653001404192700002604206700001804232700002704250700001904277700002604296773012504322856008204447852000904529655001204538IND60599318620221120145817.0180702e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059931862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMetaxa, Aikaterini-Foteini10aHollow microspheres based on – Folic acid modified – Hydroxypropyl Cellulose and synthetic multi-responsive bio-copolymer for targeted cancer therapy: Controlled release of daunorubicin, in vitro and in vivo studies  ap. 171-181.  aConventional chemotherapy drugs such as anthracyclines show no specific activity. They destroy cancer cells but also and the healthy ones, and for that reason exhibit high toxicity. In order to alleviate the toxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, the administration dose is being minimized, while their reactivity against tumor cells is lessened. This problem can be overcome or at least reduced by using nanoscale drug delivery systems to target the pathogenic area. The present work deals with the synthesis, characterization and biological evaluation of multi-responsive hollow microspheres coated with Hydroxypropyl Cellulose (HPC)-a biocompatible and thermosensitive polysaccharide-conjugated with folic acid as well promising drug vehicles for targeted cancer therapy.The synthetic route consists of two steps. In the first step, a single layer of sensitive copolymers is ((Methacrylic acid (MAA), N-(2-Hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) and N,N′-(disulfanediylbis(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(2-methylacrylamide) (DSBMA)) fabricated on a sacrificial template of SiO2 and in the second step, an additional layer of the folic acid modified HPC coat the microspheres’ surface. The layers fabrication is performed through a combination of distillation precipitation co-polymerization and chemical deposition method. The loading capacity (% LC) and encapsulation efficiency (% EE) percentages of the chemotherapeutic agent daunorubicin (DNR) in the fabricated microspheres were calculated through the standard curve methodology. In addition, the releasing properties of the resulting spheres are investigated, using the above mentioned methodology. It is worth mentioning that, spheres release the entrapped drug under combined conditions such acidic and reductive environment along with conventional hyperthermia. Cytotoxic activity of the synthesized spheres was investigated by using the well-established method of MTT assay in MCF-7 (breast cancer), HeLa (cervical cancer) and HEK 293 (Human Embryonic Kidney healthy cells) cell lines. Confocal and fluorescence microscopy were used to confirm the in vitro targeted ability of folic acid modified drug loaded microspheres in HeLa, to that overexpress folate receptors, MCF-7 and 3T3 cells, as negative folate cell substrate. Finally, radiolabelling of the spheres is performed, with a gamma emitting radionuclide (⁹⁹ᵐTc), to assess their in vivo profile by means of scintigraphic imaging and biodistribution studies.Hollow spheres release the encapsulated drug under acidic environment, conventional hyperthermia or in the presence of glutathione (reductive environment). The ability of modified drug carriers to target the HeLa cells, was confirmed by confocal and fluorescence microscopy. The resulting spheres are observed to be promising drug-carriers for cancer treatment due to their releasing properties under tumor’s environment and high concentration in HeLa cells via endocytosis. In addition, the empty vehicles have no toxicity in healthy cells and present antimicrobial activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3aatmospheric deposition 3abreast neoplasms 3acellulose 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3acytotoxicity 3adaunorubicin 3adistillation 3adrug carriers 3adrug therapy 3aencapsulation 3aendocytosis 3afever 3afluorescence microscopy 3afolate receptors 3afolic acid 3aglutathione 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3ain vivo studies 3akidneys 3amicroparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3ascintigraphy 3asilica 3auterine cervical neoplasms 0aDrug delivery systems 0aFolic acid 0aMulti responsive carriers 0aHPC 0aPolysaccharides 0aDaunorubicin 0aMicrospheres 0aCytotoxicity 0aIC50 0aMTT assay1 aEfthimiadou, Eleni K.1 aBoukos, Nikos1 aFragogeorgi, Eirini A.1 aLoudos, George1 aKordas, G.q(George),0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 435 p.171-181dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009400167300001400261520114300275592002801418650001001446650001201456650001001468650001301478650001201491650001201503650001201515650001201527650001401539650001201553650002101565650001401586650002001600650002301620650001101643650001101654650001401665651000901679653001401688653000901702653002101711653001801732653002401750653001801774653002101792700001901813773012201832856008201954852000902036655001202045IND60603714220221118054621.0190405e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060371422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2018.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrison, R.J.10aConcentrations of agronomically important nutrient elements in raw sugar produced in Fiji  ap. 72-76.  aSugar is an important global commodity with about 150 million tonnes produced annually from sugarcane and beet, and a market worth US$30–70 billion per year. The price of sugar varies considerably depending on demand and on quality. Quality of raw sugar is assessed using parameters such as percentage glucose, reducing sugars, dextran, colour, starch, and ash, with all of the inorganic components summarised in this last parameter. Analytical data on individual inorganic components is limited and data on non-toxic elements are rarely reported. This study determined the concentrations of agronomically important elements in raw sugar for Fiji (where no previous data were available) throughout the 2013 crushing season (July–November) for all 4 sugar mills in the country. The results showed average concentrations of N 415, P 23, K 1140, Ca 288, Mg 124, Na 22 and S 214 (mg kg−1) with distinct variations between the mills, but very limited seasonal variability. The contribution of sugar exports to the national nutrient budgets was also examined with sugar exports for most elements representing <10% of fertiliser imports.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeets 3acalcium 3acolor 3acrushing 3adextran 3aexports 3aglucose 3aimports 3amagnesium 3amarkets 3anitrogen content 3araw sugar 3areducing sugars 3aseasonal variation 3asodium 3astarch 3asugarcane 3aFiji 0aRaw sugar 0aFiji 0aFood composition 0aFood analysis 0aInorganic nutrients 0aConcentration 0aNutrient budgets1 aGawander, J.S.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2018 Aug., v. 71 p.72-76dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2018.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014000162300001800302500001500320520195300335592002802288650000902316650001802325650002602343650002402369650002402393650001702417650001802434650002702452650002202479650001902501650001802520650001602538650001902554650001202573650002402585650002002609651001002629653001102639700001602650700001402666700001902680773010802699856004802807852000902855655001202864IND50068508120221120033624.0130814e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006850812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-013-0741-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yanni10aStability and saturation of soil organic carbon in rice fields: evidence from a long-term fertilization experiment in subtropical China  ap. 1327-1334.  a2019-12-06  aPurpose: Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in croplands plays a critical role in climate change mitigation and food security, whereas the stability and saturation of the sequestered SOC have not been well understood yet, particularly in rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields. The objective of this study was to determine the long-term effect of inorganic fertilization alone or combined with organic amendments on SOC stability in a double rice cropping system, and to characterize the saturation behavior of the total SOC and its fractions in the paddy soil. Materials and methods: Soils were collected from a long-term field experiment in subtropical China where different fertilization regimes have been carried out for 31 years. The total SOC pool was separated into four fractions, characteristic of different turnover rates through chemical fractionation. Annual organic carbon (C) inputs were also estimated by determining the C content in crop residues and organic amendments. Results and discussion: Relative to the initial level, long-term double rice cropping without any fertilizer application significantly increased SOC concentration, suggesting that double rice cropping facilitates the storage and accumulation of SOC. The partial substitution of inorganic fertilizers with organic amendments significantly increased total SOC concentration compared to the unfertilized control. Total SOC increased significantly with greater C inputs and did not show any saturation behavior. Increased SOC was primarily stored in the labile fraction with input from organic amendments. However, other less labile SOC fractions showed no further increase with greater C inputs exhibiting C saturation. Conclusions: While the paddy soil holds a high potential for SOC sequestration, stable C fractions saturate with increasing C inputs, and thus, additional C inputs mainly accumulate in labile soil C pools. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.  aPublisher supplied data 3arice 3afractionation 3along term experiments 3amineral fertilizers 3asoil organic carbon 3aOryza sativa 3acrop residues 3afertilizer application 3along term effects 3aclimate change 3afood security 3apaddy soils 3arisk reduction 3apaddies 3aorganic fertilizers 3adouble cropping 3aChina 0acarbon1 aHuang, Shan1 aYu, Xichu1 aZhang, Weijian0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2013 Sept., v. 13, no. 8 p.1327-1334dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-013-0741-z  aDNAL 7aarticle01825naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009500174300001300269520085900282592002801141650001301169650002001182650001901202650001201221650001701233700002301250700002501273700002601298773009401324856008401418852000901502655001201511IND60553614420221120041506.0161021e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055361442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2013.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolvenbach, Boris A10aEmerging chemicals and the evolution of biodegradation capacities and pathways in bacteria  ap. 8-14.  aThe number of new chemicals produced is increasing daily by the thousands, and it is inevitable that many of these chemicals will reach the environment. Current research provides an understanding of how the evolution of promiscuous enzymes and the recruitment of enzymes available from the metagenome allows for the assembly of these pathways. Nevertheless, physicochemical constraints including bioavailability, bioaccessibility, and the structural variations of similar chemicals limit the evolution of biodegradation pathways. Similarly, physiological constraints related to kinetics and substrate utilization at low concentrations likewise limit chemical-enzyme interactions and consequently evolution. Considering these new data, the biodegradation decalogue still proves valid while at the same time the underlying mechanisms are better understood.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abioavailability 3abiodegradation 3aenzymes 3ametagenomics1 aHelbling, Damian E1 aKohler, Hans-Peter E1 aCorvini, Philippe F-X0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2014 June, v. 27 p.8-14dElsevier Ltdx0958-16697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2013.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015400172300001600326520129300342592002801635650002901663650001201692650001201704650001201716650001301728650002601741650001201767650001501779650001301794650001101807650001301818651001401831653001901845653002001864653002901884653002301913653002301936653002301959700002701982700002202009700001802031700002202049773011302071856008602184852000902270655001202279IND60542845720221120211706.0190408e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054284572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.04.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmiralian, Nasim10aOptimisation of resin extraction from an Australian arid grass ‘Triodia pungens’ and its preliminary evaluation as an anti-termite timber coating  ap. 241-247.  aSpinifex grasses are the dominant vegetative component in Australian grassland habitats, covering approximately 26% of the Australian landmass. Our ongoing work explores the utility of both the cellulosic and resinous components of this abundant biomass for modern applications and a potential economy for our Aboriginal collaborators. This study is focused on the optimisation of a resin extraction process using solvent, and the subsequent evaluation, via a field trial, of the potential use and efficacy of the resin as an anti-termite coating material. Termiticidal performance was evaluated by re-dissolving the extracted resin in acetone and coating on pine timber blocks. The resin-coated and control blocks were then exposed to a colony of Mastotermes darwiniensis’ (Froggatt) termites, which are the most primitive alive and destructive species in subterranean area, at a trial site in northeast Australia, for six months. The results clearly showed that spinifex resin effectively protected the timber from termite attack, while the uncoated control samples were extensively damaged. By demonstrating an enhanced termite resistance, we here report that plant resins that are produced by arid/semi-arid grasses could be potentially used as treatments to prevent termite attack.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMastotermes darwiniensis 3aTriodia 3aacetone 3abiomass 3acoatings 3afield experimentation 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aresins 3asolvents 3aAustralia 0aSpinifex resin 0aTriodia pungens 0aMastotermes darwiniensis 0aProtective coating 0aTermite resistance 0aAboriginal economy1 aAnnamalai, Pratheep K.1 aFitzgerald, Chris1 aMemmott, Paul1 aMartin, Darren J.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2014 Aug., v. 59 p.241-247dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.04.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007300170300001400243520118100257592002801438650002501466650002401491650001201515650001301527650001201540650001201552650001601564650001301580650001101593650001101604650001601615650000901631650000901640650001401649650001201663650001101675650001801686650001301704650001701717650001301734650000901747653001301756653002001769653001901789653002101808653001801829653001601847653001901863653001801882653002001900700001801920700002001938700001801958700002001976700003201996700003202028700001602060700002102076700002602097773010402123856008202227852000902309655001202318IND60603714320221118054550.0190405e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060371432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2018.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBilandžić, Nina10aElement contents in commercial fish species from the Croatian market  ap. 77-86.  aConcentrations of toxic (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb) and essential elements (Cu, Fe, Zn) were measured in 11 fish species purchased from supermarkets located in different Croatian cities. Mean element concentrations in fishes ranged: mg kg−1: Al 0.13–3.5, As 0.52–3.4, Cu 0.24–0.88, Fe 2.0–19, Mn 0.095–1.6, Zn 3.4–18; μg kg−1: Cd 0.61–123, Cr 5.0–41, Hg 17–130, Pb 2.0–59, Ni 5.5–51. The highest mean concentrations of elements were found in fishes: Al in cod; Cd in bluefin tuna; Cr in rainbow trout; Hg in European sea bass; Pb in canned sardine; As, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn in sardine. Significant differences in the concentrations of all elements measured were found between fish species. Mean Cd levels of 123 μg kg−1 for bluefin tuna exceeded the European Commision limit of 100 μg kg−1. An estimation of the dietary intake of elements associated with the consumption of the studied fish species, and its comparison with the toxicological reference values is provided. The obtained results suggest a strong reason for public concern with regard to exposure to As and Hg for consumers who often consume certain types of fishes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aThunnus 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acanned fish 3achromium 3acities 3acopper 3afood intake 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amercury 3anickel 3anormal values 3asardines 3asupermarkets 3atoxicity 3azinc 0aSea fish 0aFreshwater fish 0aCanned sardine 0aFood composition 0aFood analysis 0aFood safety 0aToxic elements 0aMicroelements 0aCroatian market1 aSedak, Marija1 aČalopek, Bruno1 aĐokić, Maja1 aVarenina, Ivana1 aKolanović, Božica Solomun1 aLuburić, Đurđica Božić1 aVarga, Ines1 aBenić, Miroslav1 aRoncarati, Alessandra0 tSubtropical plant science.g2018 Aug., v. 71 p.77-86dElsevier Inc.wJournal:20855x0485-20447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2018.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01597naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008900165300001600254520058900270592002800859650002200887650002000909650000900929650001800938650001200956650001200968650003700980700001601017700001701033773009601050856008101146990002301227852000901250655001201259IND60093761520221122065203.0141104e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009376152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2011.05.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Jae Hoon10aSynthesis of niobium oxide nanopowders by field-crystallization-assisted anodization  ap. 155-159.  aHerein, for the first time, we demonstrate that a large quantity of niobium oxide nanopowders consisting of amorphous round shape nanoparticles and highly crystalline needle shape nanoparticles can be prepared by anodization of a niobium foil in ethylene glycol containing NH₄F at a high voltage.

Formations of three-dimensional (3D) structured networks within gelled or flocculated suspension may prevent clay particles and aggregates from settling under gravity force and by encapsulate water within such a network, lead to poor sludge dewatering. To better understand this phenomenon, a microstructural investigation of a smectite clay (SWy2) suspension was conducted.SWy-2 was diluted in water and a moderately salty aqueous solution and was studied with the aid of a synchrotron-powered transmission X-ray microscope (TXM) and cryogenic transmission electron microscope (Cryo-TEM). Observations of mutual particle arrangement in 3D spaces were conducted within a natural water environment after vitrification without drying.A new type of micro-architecture in particle space arrangement was observed. Smectite flakes were mostly in edge-to-edge (EE) contact and formed a 3D network, confirming a “net of flakes” structural model. Clay particles form a complex and multi-hierarchic flocculated structure with characteristic cellular chained networking. Chained aggregates build cellular elements, encapsulating water inside closed voids. Increasing ionic strength results in the development of multi-hierarchic voids categories, with most water retained within nano-pores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abentonite 3aclay 3adewatering 3aencapsulation 3agravity 3aionic strength 3amodels 3asludge 3asmectite 3asoil 3atransmission electron microscopes 3avitrification 3aWyoming 0aTransmission X-ray microscope 0aClay flocculation 0aSmectite flocks 0aWyoming montmorillonite 0aColloids 0aClay gelation 0aClay microstructure1 aWilliams, David J.1 aSong, Yen-Fang1 aWang, Junjie,0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 435 p.119-127dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012500165300001400290520185400304592002802158650003402186650002302220650002402243650002602267650002502293650002902318650002502347650002102372650001902393650001802412650002802430650001402458650004102472650002202513650000902535650002802544650003302572650001502605650001502620651001002635651001002645651002102655653002302676653001802699653002502717653002702742653002602769700001802795700001502813700001802828700001602846700001502862700001402877773011102891856008603002852000903088655001203097IND60542846020221121020055.0190408e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054284602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.04.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Jun10aRegional variation in components and antioxidant and antifungal activities of Perilla frutescens essential oils in China  ap. 69-79.  aPerilla frutescens is an important annual herb of the mint family that is native to East Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Japan, is widely used as a fresh vegetable and in traditional Chinese medicines, popular garnishes, and food colorants. Hydrodistilled essential oils obtained from P. frutescens from 11 areas of China were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). One hundred and nineteen compounds accounting for 98.07–99.74% of the oils were identified. The predominant compounds were 2-acetylfuran (max. 82.17%), perillaldehyde (max. 53.41%), caryophyllene (max. 38.34%), laurolene (max. 40.6%), 2-hexanoylfuran (max. 33.03%), 2-butylamine (max. 22.22%), α-asarone (max. 11.85%), β-farnesene (max. 9.25%), α-caryophyllene (max. 9.16%), and (Z,E)-α-farnesene (max. 7.14%). Chemical variation in the oils was estimated using cluster analysis and principal component analysis. The results revealed chemical polymorphism in the oils. However, the oils from Ganzhou, Kaili, Suining, Macheng, Nanyang, and Yixing were more similar, and the oils from Quzhou, Loudi, and Nanning also revealed similarities. Antioxidant activity (by free radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing power) and antifungal activity (by poisoned food method and micro-well dilution method) were also assessed. The antioxidant activity of the oils showed similar order to that obtained by three different testing methods: Pingliang, Baoding, Loudi, and Quzhou>Kaili, Ganzhou, Macheng, and Nanning>Suining, Nanyang, and Yixing. All oils except that from Baoding were active against all of the tested strains. These results suggested that the region of origin greatly influenced the chemical composition and bioactivities of P. frutescens, which might help in developing this promising bioresource in the food and pharmaceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPerilla frutescens 3aalpha-caryophyllene 3aantifungal properties 3aantioxidant activity 3abiochemical polymorphism 3achemical composition 3acluster analysis 3aessential oils 3afood coloring 3afree radical scavengers 3agarnishes 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrodistillation 3aoils 3apharmaceutical industry 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprovenance 3avegetables 3aChina 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 0aPerilla frutescens 0aEssential oil 0aChemical composition 0aAntioxidant activities 0aAntifungal properties1 aZeng, Xiaobin1 aZhang, Shu1 aWang, Yanzhen1 aZhang, Peng1 aLü, Aijun1 aPeng, Xue0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2014 Aug., v. 59 p.69-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.04.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245006600184300001600250520113700266592002801403650001401431650001101445650001301456650001101469650002101480650002901501650000901530653002201539653002101561653003501582700002301617773009601640856008401736852000901820655001201829IND60603793220221120071542.0180716e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060379322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurnia Adi, Vincentius Surya,10aDevelopment of flexible designs for PVFC hybrid power systems  ap. 176-186.  aExtensive studies have already been performed in the past to integrate more than one ‘green’ energy source, e.g., solar, wind and hydrogen, for power generation. For actual operation in a realistic environment, such a hybrid process must be fully functional despite random fluctuations in energy supplies and power demands. A common option for accommodating the uncertain disturbances and their cumulative effects is to introduce battery into a properly structured system. However, by using an ad hoc approach, these schemes may be either overdesigned or inoperable. A generic mathematical programming model is thus adopted in the present study to compute a so-called temporal flexibility index for use as a performance measure. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of this assessment criterion, a large collection of photovoltaic–fuel cell (PVFC) systems can be configured for a specific application and then compared accordingly so as to identify the best combination of energy supply ratio and battery capacity. A MATLAB/Simulink simulation program has also been developed in this work to validate these design decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3apower generation 3arenewable energy sources 3awind 0aFlexibility index 0aResilient design 0aHybrid power generation system1 aChang, Chuei–Tin0 tRenewable energy.g2015 Feb., v. 74 p.176-186dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02073naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245010400165300001800269520115100287592002801438650001201466650002101478650001301499650001201512650001601524700001701540700002501557773010501582856007501687852000901762655001201771IND60578026620221117065223.0170811e20141125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057802662DNAL7 a10.1021/ma501320d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabzevari, S.

Tridisperse mixtures of fixed weight-average molecular weight Mw and varying number-average molecular weight Mₙ were prepared from nearly monodisperse polybutadienes. Their steady state slip behavior was examined at shear rates over the range of ∼0.1–15 s–¹. The results show that the slip behavior in the transition regime depends on Mₙ at constant Mw. This study also revealed that weakly entangled and unentangled chains in the mixtures influence wall slip differently: mixtures containing moderate amounts of weakly entangled chains exhibited enhanced slip while those containing unentangled chains did not. We explain this observation using the tube theory through the slip disentanglement mechanism proposed by Brochard and de Gennes in 1992 and conclude that the slip behavior is changed because of the force balance between the mobile and adsorbed chains and the reduced entanglement density and coil stiffness related to the incorporation of short chains of different lengths.  aPublisher supplied data 3amelting 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3asilicon 3avelocimetry1 aKohen, Itai,1 aWood-Adams, Paula M.0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Nov. 25, v. 47, no. 22 p.8033-8040dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma501320d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002500113040001800138100001500156245005700171300001800228520084900246592002801095650001101123650002601134650001201160650002401172650001701196650002701213650001701240650001301257650001701270650002401287650001301311650001201324650003001336650002001366650001101386650001701397650003701414650002401451700001801475773012701493856003801620852000901658655001201667IND50059472420221119165910.0200220e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005947242DNAL7 a229458532pmid7 a10.1002/ps.33952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKliot, Adi10aFitness costs associated with insecticide resistance  ap. 1431-1437.  aInsects are exposed to a variety of stress factors in their environment, and, in many cases for insect pests to agriculture, those factors include toxic chemical insecticides. Coping with the toxicity of insecticides can be costly and requires energy and resource allocation for adaptation and survival. Several behavioural, physiological and genetic mechanisms are used by insects to handle toxic insecticides, sometimes leading to resistance by constitutive overexpression of detoxification enzymes or inducing mutations in the target sites. Such actions are costly and may affect reproduction, impair dispersal ability and have several other effects on the insect's fitness. Fitness costs resulting from resistance to insecticides has been reported in many insects from different orders, and several examples are given in this mini‐review.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzymes 3agene overexpression 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsecticides 3amutation 3areproduction 3aresource allocation 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aDrug Resistancexgenetics 2aGenetic Fitness 2aHumans 2aInsecticides 2aInsectaxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aSpecies Specificity1 aGhanim, Murad0 tPest management science.g2012 Nov., v. 68, no. 11 p.1431-1437dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.3395  aDNAL 7aarticle01843naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010900166300001600275520086500291592002801156650001201184650001101196650001101207650001301218650002301231700001601254700001801270700002001288773009601308856008101404990002301485852000901508655001201517IND60093762020221122052011.0141104e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009376202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2011.05.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Byung Tae10aUnderstanding the junction degradation mechanism in CdS/CdTe solar cells using a Cd-deficient CdTe layer  ap. 174-178.  aIt is known that CdTe solar cells are often degraded under solar illumination. But the degradation mechanism is not fully proved because it does not appear consistently. The junction degradation in CdS/CdTe solar cells was investigated using a CdTe layer with Cd deficient composition, where Cd vacancy concentration is high. It was found that the Cu atoms easily filled the Cd vacancies in CdTe and transport to junction area from Cu back contact. PL measurement and spectral quantum efficiency measurement showed that the incorporation of Cu atoms in CdS forms a defect energy level at 1.55 eV below the conduction band in CdS. As a result, the junction built-in potential is decreased and light penetration into CdTe absorber is shielded. For reliable and stable CdTe cells, the formation of Cd vacancy in CdTe should be avoided by careful control of CdTe.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3acopper 3aenergy 3alighting 3aphotovoltaic cells1 aYun, Jae Ho1 aCha, Eun Seok1 aPark, Kyu Charn0 tCurrent applied physics.g2012 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.174-178dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2011.05.0313Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01757naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009800164300001600262520068600278592002800964650001600992650001701008650001501025650001301040650001501053650002301068700001401091700001601105700002801121700002001149700001701169773009601186856008101282990002301363852000901386655001201395IND60093762220221122051848.0141104e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009376222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2011.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jongrok10aBreakthrough/drainage pressures and X-ray water visualization in gas diffusion layer of PEMFC  ap. 105-108.  aThe primary role of the gas diffusion layers (GDLs) in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) is to maintain the delicate balance between water retention and removal in GDLs.

These pressures are both related to water management in fuel cells. Here we measured these pressures for two different GDLs and used X-ray tomography to visualize the water distributions within them.

However, native prey may avoid predation by adopting new behaviors. To determine whether invasive fish populations consume endemic shrimp in invaded Hawaiian anchialine habitats or if adopted patterns of diel migration prevents predation as previously hypothesized, a total of 183 invasive poeciliids (158 Gambusia affinis and 25 Poecilia reticulata) were collected for gut content analyses from four anchialine sites during wet and dry seasons on the islands of Hawai‘i and Maui. Predation on shrimp was not detected in habitats where they retreat exclusively into the underlying aquifer diurnally and only emerge nocturnally. However, low levels of predation were detected (7/65 fishes, only by Gambusia affinis) at Waianapanapa Cave, Maui, where shrimp retreat into both the aquifer and a cave during the day. Thus, adopted behavioral responses to invasive fishes generally, though not universally, prevent predation on endemic Hawaiian anchialine shrimps. However, non-consumptive effects resulting from behavioral modification of shrimps may have appreciable impacts on the Hawaiian anchialine ecosystem and warrant further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGambusia affinis 3aPoecilia reticulata 3adigestive system 3aecosystems 3afish 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aislands 3apredation 3apredators 3ashrimp 3aMaui1 aWeeks, Jeffrey R.1 aHau, Skippy1 aSantos, Scott R.0 tHydrobiologia.g2013 Oct., v. 716, no. 1 p.189-201dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1568-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03682naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100006700137245008300204300001600287520224200303592002802545650001602573650002402589650002302613650001802636650001202654650001602666650001702682650001302699650001202712650001302724651001502737653001702752653002802769653001202797653001602809653001402825653002302839653002602862653002302888653001602911700002802927700002102955700002302976773010802999856007203107852000903179655001203188IND60754088920221119170639.0211023s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075408892DNAL7 a10.1071/WR201202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPocknee, Christopher A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4435-957110aCost-effectiveness of thermal imaging for monitoring a cryptic arboreal mammal  ap. 625-634.  aContextThe development of reliable and cost-efficient survey techniques is key to the monitoring of all wildlife. One group of species that presents particular challenges for monitoring is the arboreal mammals. Traditional techniques for detecting these species often yield low detection probabilities (detectability) and are time-consuming, suggesting the potential for novel methods to enhance our understanding of their distribution, abundance and population trajectories. One technique that has been shown to increase detectability in a range of terrestrial species is thermal imaging, although it has rarely been applied to arboreal species. The true conservation status of Lumholtz’s tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) is uncertain because of low detectability under typical survey techniques, and a more suitable method is required to enable effective monitoring of the species, making it an ideal candidate for the present study. AimsWe aimed to compare the success and cost-effectiveness of surveys utilising thermal imaging with two traditional methods, namely, spotlighting and daytime surveys, so as to optimise monitoring of D. lumholtzi. MethodsWe conducted surveys at 10 sites in Queensland (Australia) where D. lumholtzi was known to occur, by using each method, and modelled both the detectability of D. lumholtzi and the cost-effectiveness of each technique. Key resultsDetectability of D. lumholtzi was significantly higher with the use of thermal imaging than it was with the other survey methods, and thermal detection is more cost-effective. In average survey conditions with a trained observer, the single-visit estimated detectability of D. lumholtzi was 0.28 [0.04, 0.79] in a transect through rainforest, by using thermal imaging. Using only spotlights, the detection probability was 0.03 [0, 0.28] under the same conditions. ConclusionsThese results show that incorporating thermal technology into monitoring surveys will greatly increase detection probability for D. lumholtzi, a cryptic arboreal mammal.

Its economic subsystem includes the components of production, consumption, reduction, transportation and regulation. While its social subsystem includes technology, institution and culture steered by man. In dealing with this eco-complexity, the key issue is how to image the complicated interactions, how to simplify and integrate the diversified relationships, and how to develop a practical instrument for cultivating the sustainability in helping local people to help themselves. Based on ancient Chinese human ecological philosophy, the SENCE approach for eco-sustainability planning and management was explored, which requires holistic rethinking, institutional reform and technological renovation. A combinatory model consists of mechanism model, planning model, and regulation model has been developed through identification of its key factors, feedback and function, simulation of its partial problems, process and alternative policies, and inducing its technological, institutional and cultural innovation towards sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3ahuman behavior 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aminerals 3amodels 3anutrients 3apeople 3aphilosophy 3aplanning 3asoil 3atransportation 3awood1 aLi, Feng1 aHu, Dan1 aLarry Li, B.0 tEcological complexity.g2011 Mar., v. 8, no. 1 p.15-29dElsevier B.V.x1476-945X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2010.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01062naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245005500167300001300222520015500235592002800390650002300418650002300441650001400464653004200478653002600520773015200546856007700698852000900775655001200784IND60521567620221122040503.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052156762DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1978-09242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSummers, Lindsay A.10aStructure of 4-Arylazo-3-methylisoxazol-5- thiones  ap. 1056.  aContrary to a recent report, 4-arylazo-3- methylisoxazol-5-thiones exist predominately as the 3 -methyl - 4-arylhydrazono-isoxazol- 5-thione tautomer.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3atautomers 0a4-Arylazo-3-methylisoxazol-5 -thiones 0aTautomeric Structures0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 33, no. 9 p.1056-1056dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1978-09243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245013800207300001800345520108200363592002801445650001501473650001801488650001301506650002301519700001801542700005601560700005701616773011401673856008401787852000901871655001201880IND60634928620221122000602.0190326e20181010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063492862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b024912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6510-576510aAnisotropic Wetting of Droplets on Stripe-Patterned Chemically Heterogeneous Surfaces: Effect of Length Ratio and Deposition Position  ap. 4387-4396.  aThe equilibrium state of a droplet deposited on chemically heterogeneous surfaces is studied by using many-body dissipative particle dynamics. The length ratio covers 2 orders from 0.01 to 1 and allows a systematical inspection of the changes of the droplet shape, contact angle, and aspect ratio with this parameter. Moreover, a new parameter, global aspect ratio, is introduced to better characterize the distortion of the droplet. It is found that the droplet shape at the equilibrium stage strongly lies on the deposition position when the length ratio is beyond 0.1. Additionally, the lateral displacement is observed when depositing the droplet on the border of two stripes at large length ratios (over 0.1). On the other hand, the Cassie area fraction also has a significant effect on the wetting behaviors. When the droplet is driven by a body force with a 45° inclined angle to the stripes, the moving direction could be strictly in line with the force direction, deviating from the force direction, or totally in line with the stripes, depending on the length ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acontact angle 3adroplets 3amolecular dynamics1 aJian, Meipeng1 aLiu, Huiyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7206-63571 aZhang, Xiwang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4319-527X0 tLangmuir.g2018 Oct. 10, v. 35, no. 12 p.4387-4396dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b024913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009400174300001600268520108500284592002801369650001401397650003101411650001601442650001901458650001301477650003401490650001801524650000901542650003101551650001701582650001601599650001601615650001001631651001301641651001101654653001601665653001701681653003201698653003301730653003101763700002101794700002301815700001901838700002301857700002401880700002501904700002101929700006401950773011302014856008602127852000902213655001202222IND60542846720221120231224.0190408e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054284672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDias, Daiane de O.10aOptimization of Copaiba oil-based nanoemulsions obtained by different preparation methods  ap. 154-162.  aCopaiba oil has been widely used in popular medicine because of its anti-inflammatory properties. The oil is extracted from trees of the genus Copaifera, found mainly in the Brazilian Amazon. A study was conducted using a 2IV4-1 fractional factorial design to evaluate the effects of oil core and surfactants composition on physicochemical properties of nanoemulsions produced by high-pressure homogenization and spontaneous emulsification. Also, the stability of the formulations stored at 4°C and 25°C was monitored for 90 days. The high-pressure homogenization method proved to be the most efficient technique to obtain stable Copaiba oil nanoemulsions with reduced loss of volatile fraction within 90 days of storage at the recommended temperature (4°C). The most suitable nanoemulsion composition was achieved adding 20% Copaiba oil, 10% medium chain triglycerides, 3% Span 80® and 1% Tween 20®. The use of medium chain triglycerides was shown to be a good strategy to fix volatile fractions of Copaiba oil incorporated into nanoemulsions during preparation and storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopaifera 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aemulsifying 3ahomogenization 3amedicine 3amedium chain triacylglycerols 3ananoemulsions 3aoils 3aphysicochemical properties 3astorage time 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3atrees 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aCopaiba oil 0aNanoemulsion 0aFractional factorial design 0aHigh-pressure homogenization 0aSpontaneous emulsification1 aColombo, Mariana1 aKelmann, Regina G.1 aKaiser, Samuel1 aLucca, Letícia G.1 aTeixeira, Helder F.1 aLimberger, Renata P.1 aVeiga, Valdir F.1 aKoester, Letícia S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1043-58550 tIndustrial crops and products.g2014 Aug., v. 59 p.154-162dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245012200171300001400293520190900307592002802216650002702244650001602271650001402287650002302301650002302324650002102347650002602368650001902394650001602413651001202429651001602441700001502457773008502472856008502557852000902642655001202651IND4483000020221121092727.0141110e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448300002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2011.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHyldgaard, Benita10aIntraspecies differences in phenotypic plasticity: Invasive versus non-invasive populations of Ceratophyllum demersum  ap. 49-56.  aHigh phenotypic plasticity has been hypothesized to affect the invasiveness of plants, as high plasticity may enlarge the breath of environments in which the plants can survive and reproduce. Here we compare the phenotypic plasticity of invasive and non-invasive populations of the same species in response to growth temperature. Populations of the submerged macrophyte Ceratophyllum demersum from New Zealand, where the species is introduced and invasive, and from Denmark, where the species is native and non-invasive, were grown in a common garden setup at temperatures of 12, 18, 25 and 35Â°C. We hypothesized that the phenotypic plasticity in fitness-related traits like growth and photosynthesis were higher in the invasive than in the non-invasive population. The invasive population acclimated to elevated temperatures through increased rates of photosynthesis (range: Pââb: 8â452Î¼molOâgâ»Â¹DMhâ»Â¹) and relative growth rates (range: 0.01â0.05dâ»Â¹) and associated regulations in the photosynthetic machinery. The non-invasive population had a lower acclimation potential (range: Pââb: 43â173Î¼molOâgâ»Â¹DMhâ»Â¹; RGR: 0.01â0.03dâ»Â¹), but was better at acclimating to cooler conditions by regulation of the light-harvesting complex. Hence, the invasive population of C. demersum from New Zealand had higher phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature than the non-invasive Danish population. This might be the result of genetic evolution since its introduction to New Zealand five decades ago, but further studies are needed to test this hypothesis. The study also indicate, that the global increase in temperature may exacerbate the problems experienced with the invasive C. demersum in New Zealand, as the performance and fitness of this population appear to be favoured at elevated temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratophyllum demersum 3aacclimation 3aevolution 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aphotosynthesis 3atemperature 3aDenmark 3aNew Zealand1 aBrix, Hans0 tAquatic botany.g2012 Feb., v. 97, no. 1 p.49-56dElsevier B.V.x0304-37707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2011.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013400162300002000296500001900316520111500335592002801450650001301478650001601491650001701507650002201524700001501546700001501561700001601576700001601592700001801608773012501626856008201751852000901833655001201842IND60698300820221120102052.0200611e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069830082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-04701-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Hao10aImproving cathode/Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 electrolyte interface with a hybrid PVDF-HFP-based buffer layer for solid lithium battery  ap. 11451-11461.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSolid-state lithium battery is considered as a promising solution to improve safety performance. However, huge interfacial resistance and polarization between cathode and solid electrolyte are still big challenges for further application. In this study, an improved cathode/Li₆.₄La₃Zr₁.₄Ta₀.₆O₁₂ garnet electrolyte interface with low resistance and reduced polarization is successfully constructed by introduced a Li₆.₄La₃Zr₁.₄Ta₀.₆O₁₂-C added hybrid PVDF-HFP-based buffer layer. The hybrid buffer layer provides ionic and electronic transport pathways simultaneously at the interface. With the improved interface, the LiFePO₄ cathode in the solid-state battery using LLZTO electrolyte displays an increased Li⁺ diffusion coefficient of 3.42 × 10⁻¹² cm² s⁻¹ and low charge transfer resistance of 345.2 Ω at 1st cycle. The LFP solid-state battery reaches an initial capacity of 152.2 mA h g⁻¹ and, in particular, displays an outstanding cycle performance with a retention of 84.6% over 200 cycles at 0.5 C and an average columbic efficiency of 99.5%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3adiffusivity 3aelectrolytes 3alithium batteries1 aMu, Daobin1 aWu, Borong1 aBi, Jiaying1 aZhang, Ling1 aRao, Shengzhu0 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Sept., v. 55, no. 25 p.11451-11461dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-04701-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245007900164300001600243520102300259592002801282650002501310650001901335650001601354650001501370650001501385650002101400650001701421653002901438653002401467653001501491653001501506653002301521653003101544700005601575700001301631700001401644700002001658773009601678856008401774852000901858655001201867IND60603793920221120060409.0180716e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060379392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yihua10aNew multi-stage DC–DC converters for grid-connected photovoltaic systems  ap. 247-254.  aRenewable energy is high on international and national agendas. Currently, grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems are a popular technology to convert solar energy into electricity. Existing PV panels have a relatively low and varying output voltage so that the converter installed between the PVs and the grid should be equipped with high step-up and versatile control capabilities. In addition, the output current of PV systems is rich in harmonics which affect the power quality of the grid. In this paper, a new multi-stage hysteresis control of a step-up DC–DC converter is proposed for integrating PVs into a single-phase power grid. The proposed circuitry and control method is experimentally validated by testing on a 600 W prototype converter. The developed technology has significant economic implications and could be applied to many distributed generation (DG) systems, especially for the developing countries which have a large number of small PVs connected to their single-phase distribution network.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3ahysteresis 3aprototypes 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 0aDC–DC power conversion 0aHarmonic distortion 0aHysteresis 0aConverters 0aMultilevel systems 0aPhotovoltaic power systems1 aCao, Wenping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8133-30201 aJi, Bing1 aSi, Jikai1 aChen, Xiangping0 tRenewable energy.g2015 Feb., v. 74 p.247-254dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006800167300002000235500002900255520095100284592002801235596005801263596006301321596006301384596007701447650001701524650001601541650001301557650002201570650001201592650001301604650001001617700001701627700005501644773012501699856008201824852000901906655001201915IND60698300920221120080611.0200611e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069830092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-04744-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Zhaowen10aDislocation dissociation induces secondary twinning in titanium  ap. 11679-11686.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aThe twin–twin interaction phenomenon in Ti is studied by incorporating experimental observation and theoretical analysis. Secondary [Formula: see text] twins are stimulated in primary [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] via twinning dislocation dissociation. Primary twin variants are found either share the same [Formula: see text] zone axis or with different zone axes. Schmid law, dislocation theory and crystallographic analysis are used to investigate the formation processes and physical mechanisms of the twin–twin interaction phenomenon. Results show that non-Schmid secondary twins are stimulated under the effect of primary twinning interactions. Besides to secondary twinning dislocations, glissile and sessile dislocations generate as a result of primary dislocation dissociation. Glissile dislocation glide on the easy slip prismatic plane, while sessile dislocation accumulates and leads to the increase of local strain.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFA0204403cthe National Key R&D Program of China  a51741106cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aBK20191292cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province  a30919011256cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3adissociation 3aexhibitions 3ajournals 3amaterials science 3astrains 3atitanium 3atwins1 aNie, Jinfeng1 aLi, Yusheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5786-30160 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Sept., v. 55, no. 25 p.11679-11686dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-04744-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01750naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015900165300001600324520070900340592002801049650001701077650001301094650002601107700001701133700001501150700001501165700001401180700002101194773009601215856008101311990002301392852000901415655001201424IND60093762720221122052018.0141104e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009376272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2011.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yanjie10aEffects of Li₂CO₃ on the sintering behavior and piezoelectric properties of Bi₂O₃-excess (Bi₀.₅Na₀.₅)₀.₉₄Ba₀.₀₆TiO₃ ceramics  ap. 204-209.  a(Bi₀.₅Na₀.₅)₀.₉₄Ba₀.₀₆TiO₃ ceramics doped with Li₂CO₃ and Bi₂O₃ as sintering aids were manufactured, and their micro structural, dielectric and piezoelectric properties were investigated.

More often than not, tourism demands compete for these resources, exerting pressure on them, resulting in decline of the CPRs. Managing tourism and environmental resources has become extremely important, but also more complex, as the interests of different stakeholders are intertwined across international, national, and local levels. Hence, this study aimed to investigate how stakeholder groups perceive the issues relating to the environment using Yakushima Island, Japan for a case study. Quantitative data were collected by administering a questionnaire to residents and tourism practitioners, while qualitative data were gathered through semi-structured interviews conducted with organizations involved with tourism and environmental management in Yakushima. The study reveals that the underlying environmental issues in Yakushima result from an increase in tourists and controversial management of deer populations. Both residents and tourism practitioners indicated that more trash in the community was the most significant impact of tourism on the environment. Some perceptions were contradictory. Management authorities noted an increase in the deer population, which needs to be controlled to prevent damage to natural vegetation. Most tour guides reported a decrease in the sighting of deer along hiking trails, frustrating the genuine expectations of the tourist. The connection of the deer issue to tourism turned out to be very complex, as an overabundance of deer endangers parts of the vegetation tourists come to enjoy, while at the same time deer are an important part of the tourists&rsquo; experience. Different perceptions on deer by different stakeholders add to this complexity, which needs to be taken into consideration for proper management of tourists and deer in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adeer 3aecotourism 3aenvironmental management 3ainterviews 3aman-made trails 3aquestionnaires 3astakeholders 3atourists 3avegetation 3aJapan1 aUsui, Rie 1 aFunck, Carolin 0 tEnvironments.g2019 Aug. 07, v. 6, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27132x2076-32987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments60800933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012600174300001600300520104200316592002801358650001401386650001101400650001501411650001301426650001101439650002901450650001801479653002301497653002001520653002001540653002301560653002101583700001901604700002501623700005701648773009601705856008401801852000901885655001201894IND60603794020221120081905.0180716e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060379402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorreglosa, Juan P.10aEnergy dispatching based on predictive controller of an off-grid wind turbine/photovoltaic/hydrogen/battery hybrid system  ap. 326-336.  aThis paper presents a novel energy dispatching based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) for off-grid photovoltaic (PV)/wind turbine/hydrogen/battery hybrid systems. The renewable energy sources supply energy to the hybrid system and the battery and hydrogen system are used as energy storage devices. The denominated “hydrogen system” is composed of fuel cell, electrolyzer and hydrogen storage tank. The MPC generates the reference powers of the fuel cell and electrolyzer to satisfy different objectives: to track the load power demand and to keep the charge levels of the energy storage devices between their target margins. The modeling of the hybrid system was developed in MATLAB-Simulink, taking into account datasheets of commercially available components. To show the proper operation of the proposed energy dispatching, a simpler strategy based on state control was presented in order to compare and validate the results for long-term simulations of 25 years (expected lifetime of the system) with a sample time of one hour.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3awind turbines 0aEnergy dispatching 0aHydrogen system 0aOff-grid system 0aPredictive control 0aRenewable energy1 aGarcía, Pablo1 aFernández, Luis M.,1 aJurado, Paco,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8122-74150 tRenewable energy.g2015 Feb., v. 74 p.326-336dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009600172300001200268520170400280592002801984650001102012650002002023650002002043650003902063650001302102650001202115650001602127650002802143650001302171650003702184650001902221650001502240700002802255700003702283700002902320700003402349700004102383773014102424856008202565852000902647655001202656IND60592067820221117080904.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059206782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-018-3782-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranco, MaioneWittig10aMercury Methylation Capacity and Removal of Hg Species from Aqueous Medium by Cyanobacteria  ap. 127.  aMost technologies used for decontamination presents good results for high concentrations, but limitations for lower ones. The desirable Hg concentration in the water is extremely low because of its toxicity. The aims of this study were to evaluate inorganic mercury (Hg²⁺) and methylmercury (CH₃Hg⁺) toxicity in Nostoc paludosum, to assess the potential of this cyanobacteria strain to remove these Hg species from aqueous medium and also to investigate Hg methylation by the cyanobacteria. CH₃Hg⁺ determination was performed by gas chromatography-pyrolysis-atomic fluorescence spectrometry in cultures exposed to a concentration of 20 μg L⁻¹ for 30 days. Both Hg species were removed from the supernatant, ranging from 73 to 96% of Hg²⁺ and from 73 to 95% of CH₃Hg⁺. Ultrastructural Hg²⁺ effects in the cyanobacteria cells investigated by transmission electron microscopy revealed higher production of glycogen, cyanophycin, and intrathylacoidal spaces than the control group. When Hg was added to the culture in the form of CH₃Hg⁺, a decrease corresponding to approximately 60% of the initial concentration due to Hg volatilization was observed. The production of CH₃Hg⁺ by the cyanobacteria was detected in concentrations near the limit of detection (0.0025%) of the bioaccumulated THg. This is an advantage for biotechnological decontamination applications, as CH₃Hg⁺ is a very toxic specie and can be bioaccumulated and biomagnified. The results demonstrated that cyanobacteria cells are an efficient alternative to retain and/or remove Hg at low concentrations and they constitute a potential tool for a “final cleaning” of contaminated waste water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNostoc 3adecontamination 3adetection limit 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aglycogen 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avolatilization 3awastewater1 aMendes, LouiseAparecida1 aWindmöller, CláudiaCarvalhinho1 aMoura, KarenAnn Ferreira1 aOliveira, LucasAntônio Gomes1 aBarbosa, FranciscoAntônio Rodrigues0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2018 Apr., v. 229, no. 4 p.127-127dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-018-3782-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008700167300001800254520137500272592002801647650001201675650001101687650001601698650002501714650002301739650001801762650001501780650002201795650001301817650002501830650001101855700005801866700006001924773011401984856008402098852000902182655001202191IND60634928920221121143710.0190326e20190226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063492892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b036592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Yanfei10aControl of Stratification in Drying Particle Suspensions via Temperature Gradients  ap. 4296-4304.  aA potential strategy for controlling stratification in a drying suspension of bidisperse particles is studied using molecular dynamics simulations. When the suspension is maintained at a constant temperature during fast drying, it can exhibit “small-on-top” stratification with an accumulation (depletion) of smaller (larger) particles in the top region of the drying film, consistent with the prediction of current theories based on diffusiophoresis. However, when only the region near the substrate is thermalized at a constant temperature, a negative temperature gradient develops in the suspension because of evaporative cooling at the liquid–vapor interface. Since the associated thermophoresis is stronger for larger nanoparticles, a higher fraction of larger nanoparticles migrate to the top of the drying film at fast evaporation rates. As a result, stratification is converted to “large-on-top”. Very strong small-on-top stratification can be produced with a positive thermal gradient in the drying suspension. Here, we explore a way to produce a positive thermal gradient by thermalizing the vapor at a temperature higher than that of the solvent. Possible experimental approaches to realize various thermal gradients in a suspension undergoing solvent evaporation and thus to produce different stratification states in the drying film are suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3adrying 3aevaporation 3aliquid-air interface 3amolecular dynamics 3ananoparticles 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3asolvents 3atemperature profiles 3avapors1 aGrest, Gary S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5260-97881 aCheng, Shengfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6066-29680 tLangmuir.g2019 Feb. 26, v. 35, no. 12 p.4296-4304dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b036593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03612naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002300169245011100192300001600303520148700319592002801806650002101834650001501855650001101870650001301881650000901894650001001903650001001913650001501923650001101938650001101949650001601960650001001976650001501986650001202001650003502013650004602048650000902094650001502103650002302118650001202141650002702153650002302180650002302203650002902226650006202255651001302317651001302330651001302343651002802356651002802384651002802412653002502440653001102465653002102476653002702497653001502524653001902539700002102558700001902579700002002598700002302618700002302641773012002664856008502784852000902869655001202878IND50060412020221119170211.0190401e20130218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006041202DNAL7 a231315762pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMueller, Elisha K.10aPotential ecological distribution of Cytauxzoon felis in domestic cats in Oklahoma, Missouri, and Arkansas  ap. 104-110.  aThe ecological distribution of Cytauxzoon felis, an often-fatal tick-borne apicomplexan that infects domestic cats, has not been evaluated or identified despite its continued emergence. Infection of C. felis is characterized by lethargy, icterus, fever, anorexia, anemia, and death. The natural vertebrate reservoir of C. felis is the bobcat (Lynx rufus). To determine the possible distribution of C. felis in three states where infection is common (Oklahoma, Missouri, and Arkansas), two separate approaches to ecological niche modeling were implemented. First, a model relating several different climatic layers to geographic locations where cases of C. felis infection were confirmed in domestic cats was developed to predict the possible distribution of the parasite. The second model incorporated occurrences of bobcats with environmental layers and land cover suitable for tick vectors to identify areas of overlap where C. felis transmission was likely. Results of both models indicated a high probability of C. felis from central Oklahoma to south-central Missouri. However, other predicted areas of C. felis occurrence varied between the two modeling approaches. Modeling the vertebrate reservoir and the tick vector predicted a broader possible distribution compared to modeling cases of C. felis infection in domestic cats. Our results suggest that C. felis is likely to extend beyond areas predicted by case modeling due to the presence of both the vector and reservoir.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCytauxzoon felis 3aLynx rufus 3aanemia 3aanorexia 3acats 3adeath 3afever 3aland cover 3amodels 3aniches 3aprobability 3aticks 2aAlgorithms 2aAnimals 2aArachnid Vectorsxparasitology 2aCat Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aCats 2aDemography 2aDisease Reservoirs 2aEcology 2aIxodidaexparasitology 2aLynxxparasitology 2aModels, Biological 2aPiroplasmidaxphysiology 2aProtozoan Infections, Animalxepidemiologyxparasitology. 3aArkansas 3aMissouri 3aOklahoma 0aArkansasxepidemiology. 0aMissourixepidemiology. 0aOklahomaxepidemiology. 0aAmblyomma americanum 0aBobcat 0aCytauxzoon felis 0aEcological niche model 0aLynx rufus 0aLone star tick1 aBaum, Kristen A.1 aPapeş, Monica1 aCohn, Leah, A.,1 aCowell, Annette K.1 aReichard, Mason V.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2013 Feb. 18, v. 192, no. 1-3 p.104-110dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009700167500001900264520207300283592002802356650001002384650004402394650001202438650001202450650000902462650001502471650001102486650001302497650001202510650001102522650002102533650001602554650001702570650000902587653002102596653001802617653003302635653001802668653003802686700001702724700001902741700001902760700001602779700003002795773010402825856008502929852000903014655001203023IND60704805120221117230143.0200913e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070480512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1184442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSher, Farooq10aTorrefied biomass fuels as a renewable alternative to coal in co-firing for power generation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aims to assess the torrefaction of biomass as alternative renewable energy fuel to coal during co-firing. It was evaluated that torrefaction improves biomass grindability to such an extent that it can be used in coal mills with coal in co-firing without capital intensive modification. Torrefaction of beech wood was performed on a batch scale reactor at three different temperatures (200, 250 and 300 °C) with 30 min of residence time. The chemical structural changes in torrefied biomass were investigated with binding energies and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) analysis. Monocombustion and co-combustion tests were performed to examine the combustion behaviour regarding flue gas emissions (CO, NOx and SO₂) at 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 m distance from the burner opening along with fly ash analysis. The FTIR and binding energies showed that lignin hardly affected during light torrefaction while hemicellulosic material was significantly depleted. The Hardgrove grindability index (HGI) was calculated with three methods (DIN51742, IFK and ISO). The medium temperature torrefied biomass (MTTB) yields HGI value in the range of 32–37 that was comparable with HGI of El Cerrejon coal (36–41). A slight change in temperature enabled the torrefied beech wood to be co-milled with coal without capital intensive modification and improved grindability. Comparing the combustion behaviour of single fuels, low temperature torrefied biomass (LTTB) produces less amount of NOx (426 mg/m³), CO (0.002 mg/m³) and SO₂ (2 mg/m³) as compared MTTB and raw beech wood. In the case of co-combustion, it was found that blending of coal with raw biomass does not show a stable behaviour. However, premixing of 50% of coal with 50% of torrefied biomasses (MTTB and LTTB) gives most stable behaviour and reduces NOₓ almost 30% and SOₓ up to almost 50% compared to coal. The fly ash contents analysis proved that K₂O contents much decreased during co-firing of coal and torrefied fuels that could cause ash related issues during combustion of raw biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiomass 3acapital 3acoal 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aflue gas 3afly ash 3alignin 3apower generation 3atemperature 3atorrefaction 3awood 0aRenewable energy 0aCO2 emissions 0aHardgrove grindability index 0aCo-combustion 0aEmissions profile and power plant1 aYaqoob, Aqsa1 aSaeed, Farrukh1 aZhang, Shengfu1 aJahan, Zaib1 aKlemeš, Jiří Jaromír,0 tEnergy.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 209 p.118444-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1184443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011100171300001400282520126300296592002801559650001301587650001301600650001201613650002001625650001901645650000901664650001801673650002501691650001701716650001701733650001101750653001201761653001201773653001701785653001501802653001801817653003901835700002301874700002501897773009001922856008502012852000902097655001202106IND60599438720221119182836.0180702e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059943872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, Diogo L.12aA sensitive flow-based procedure for spectrophotometric speciation analysis of inorganic bromine in waters  ap. 93-99.  aA flow-based system with solenoid micro-pumps and long path-length spectrophotometry for bromate and bromide determination in drinking water is proposed. The method is based on the formation of an unstable dye from the reaction between bromate, 2-(5-dibromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-(diethylamino)phenol (5-Br-PADAP) and thiocyanate ions. A multivariate optimization was carried out. A linear response was observed between 5.0 and 100µgL⁻¹ BrO3⁻ and the detection limit was estimated as 2.0µgL⁻¹ (99.7% confidence level). The coefficient of variation (n=20) and sampling rate were estimated as 1.0% and 40 determinations per hour, respectively. Reagent consumption was estimated as 0.17µg of 5-Br-PADAP and 230μg of NaSCN per measurement, generating 6.0mL of waste. Bromide determination was carried out after UV-assisted conversion with K2S2O8 using 300µL of sample within the range 20–400µgL⁻¹ Br⁻. The generated bromate was then determined by the proposed flow system. The results for tap and commercial mineral water samples agreed with those obtained with the reference procedure at the 95% confidence level. The proposed procedure is therefore a sensitive, environmentally friendly and reliable alternative for inorganic bromine speciation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromates 3abromides 3abromine 3adetection limit 3adrinking water 3aions 3amineral water 3apotassium persulfate 3aspectroscopy 3athiocyanates 3awastes 0aBromide 0aBromate 0aUV digestion 0aSpeciation 0aMulti-pumping 0aLong path-length spectrophotometry1 aMachado, Marcos C.1 aMelchert, Wanessa R.0 tTalanta.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 129 p.93-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012300168300001600291520105100307592002801358650001401386650002501400650001701425650001801442650001601460650002301476650001801499650001701517650002401534650001001558653002401568653002801592653001701620653002201637653001701659653001301676700001601689700002701705700001501732773010801747856008601855852000901941655001201950IND60540781720221123024244.0190318e20140717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054078172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.02.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiao-kui10aEnhancing exopolysaccharide antioxidant formation and yield from Phellinus species through medium optimization studies  ap. 214-220.  aThe study was conducted to enhance exopolysaccharide (EPS) antioxidant formation (as measured by Trolox-Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity, TEAC) by Phellinus sp.

Out of seven medium components, four significant variables were identified based on linear models with statistical significance (p<0.05), namely rutin, FeSO4, and aspartate, which influenced TEAC, and malt extract, which influenced yield. Based on regression analysis of the experimental results from central composite design in response surface models, two second-order polynomial models adequately representing the relationship between these variables and EPS TEAC and yield were obtained, and the optimum concentration of these variables were determined and validated. Variable combinations for high EPS TEAC and yield were optimized through a desirability function test. The maximum EPS TEAC and yield reached 8.49±0.32mM and 10.92±0.68g/L, respectively, in a 7L bioreactor under the optimum variable combinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhellinus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaspartic acid 3abioreactors 3aexopolysaccharides 3alinear models 3amalt extract 3aregression analysis 3arutin 0aPhellinus sp.

Mey. To reveal the anti-cancer effect of CsIV and CsV on liver cancer cells, human hepatic cancer cell lines (HepG2) were exposed to these saponins, and various physiological responses of HepG2 were investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: HepG2 cells were treated with CsIV, CsV and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8 assay. The cell cycle arrest, cell apoptosis and intracellular Ca²⁺ levels were respectively identified by flow cytometry. The mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by fluorescence microscopy. And, the levels of apoptosis-related proteins were analyzed by western blotting. Both CsIV and CsV were demonstrated to inhibit cell viability, and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of HepG2 in a dose-dependent manner. They also enhanced the intracellular Ca²⁺ level and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, p53 and p21 were found up-regulated in HepG2 cells treated by CsIV and CsV. The apoptotic proteins, bax, cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-3/-9, were all found activated in HepG2 cells after CsIV and CsV treatment. The anti-apoptotic protein, bcl-2, was significantly down-regulated in all treated HepG2 cells. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that CsIV and CsV exerted significant cytotoxic effects on HepG2 cells without affecting normal liver cells. And, these chikusetsusaponins, especially for CsIV, showed a potent effect on promoting cell apoptosis in HepG2 cells, which was associated with the activation of p53-mediated apoptosis pathway.  aPublisher supplied data  a2060302cthe key project at central government level: the ability establishment of sustainable use for valuable Chinese medicine resource 3aPanax japonicus 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorouracil 3ahumans 3aliver 3aliver neoplasms 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3amolecular biology 3aneoplasm cells 3aoleanolic acid 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3arhizomes 3asaponins1 aZhang, Zuo1 aJiang, Peng1 aZhang, Rui1 aNi, Danni1 aYuanyuan,1 aZhang, Shaopeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9330-05790 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.4247-4255dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07259-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245008200180300001500262520134100277592002801618650001701646650001401663650000901677650001601686650001401702650002101716650001501737650001401752650001101766650001101777651001101788653002101799653002401820653002501844653002601869653001201895700001501907700001501922700001501937700001501952700001601967773010401983856008502087852000902172655001202181IND60557534920221121040307.0190411e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055753492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2016.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThibault de Chanvalon, A.10aManganese, iron and phosphorus cycling in an estuarine mudflat, Loire, France  ap. 92-102.  aThe sampling of surface sediment from two sites of a mudflat of the Loire Estuary during four contrasting seasons has led to new information about geochemical cycling under transient diagenesis fuelled by flood deposition. Based on stocks of reactive iron-oxides and manganese-oxides (ascorbate-extracted) and pore water concentrations, the progressive evolution of flood deposits is described. Three major steps are observed: at first, there is no manganese, iron and phosphorus release into pore water within the flood-deposited layer. Then, during a period of approximately 1month, Mn oxides are consumed while the dissolved Mn concentration increases. Simultaneously, the Fe oxide-rich layer from flood deposition prevents (or at least limits) phosphorus release into pore water as shown by the increasing P/Fe ratio of the ascorbate extractions. During spring and summer, Fe oxides are reductively dissolved until complete depletion results. This period also corresponds to the saturation of Fe oxides by phosphorus and probably maximum P release to the water column. The site located closer to the shore showed higher density of benthic faunas leading to more intense bioirrigation. The importance of bioturbation on the year scale for biogeochemical processes is discussed according to both bioirrigation and biomixing processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioturbation 3aestuaries 3airon 3airon oxides 3amanganese 3amanganese oxides 3aphosphorus 3asediments 3aspring 3asummer 3aFrance 0aFlood deposition 0aAscorbat extraction 0aTransient diagenesis 0aSavitzky Golay filter 0aRiOMars1 aMouret, A.1 aKnoery, J.1 aGeslin, E.1 aPéron, O.1 aMetzger, E.0 tJournal of sea research.g2016 Dec., v. 118 p.92-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2016.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003100166245011700197300001800314500001500332520165000347592002801997650001502025650001102040650001402051650002002065650001602085650001702101650001002118650001302128650003102141650002102172650001402193650003502207653001002242700002002252700003302272700003202305700003402337700002102371700002802392773012402420856008202544852000902626655001202635IND60080283220221122061854.0181029e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008028322DNAL7 a248743022pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3416-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Ronaldo Celerino10aAssociation of CD209 and CD209L polymorphisms with tuberculosis infection in a Northeastern Brazilian population  ap. 5449-5457.  a2019-12-06  aTuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. So far, many candidate genes have been investigated for their possible association with TB. Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3) grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and Liver/lymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN), encoded by CD209 and CD209L genes respectively, are known for binding to M. tuberculosis on human dendritic cells and macrophages. We screened 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of CD209, namely −939G>A (rs735240), −871A>G (rs735239), −336A>G (rs4804803) and −139G>A (rs2287886) and tandem repeat polymorphisms in exon 4 of CD209 and CD209L genes looking for association with TB in a Northeastern Brazilian population (295 subjects, 131 TB patients and 164 healthy controls). The −139G>A and −939G>A SNPs were associated with susceptibility to TB, and in particular with pulmonary and extra-pulmonary forms respectively. The −871A>G and −336A>G SNPs were associated, the first with protection to both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB, the latter only with the pulmonary form. An association between GGAG haplotype and protection to TB infection was also found. Also tandem repeat polymorphism in CD209L exon 4 was associated with TB infection. This study provides evidence of an association between CD209 and CD209L polymorphisms and TB development in a Brazilian population, suggesting that variations in these genes may influence the protection and susceptibility to infection caused by M. tuberculosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahaplotypes 3ahumans 3amorbidity 3adendritic cells 3amacrophages 3atuberculosis 3aexons 3apatients 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3apromoter regions 3amortality 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0agenes1 aSegat, Ludovica1 ada Cruz, Heidi Lacerda Alves1 aSchindler, Haiana Charifker1 aMontenegro, Lilian Maria Lapa1 aCrovella, Sergio1 aGuimarães, Rafael Lima0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 Aug., v. 41, no. 8 p.5449-5457dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3416-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009100165300001600256500001900272520169300291592002801984650003902012650000802051650001602059650001802075650002202093650002002115650003002135650001602165650001502181650001602196650001202212653001702224653002402241700001702265700001602282700001902298700001802317773016502335856008602500852000902586655001202595IND60680499120221120183615.0200110e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068049912DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(19)62647-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Mei,10aMapping subgenomic promoter of coat protein gene of Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus  ap. 153-163.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMany plant viruses utilize subgenomic RNA as gene expression strategy, therefore mapping subgenomic promoter (SGP) is extremely important for constructing viral vectors. Although Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV)-based virus vectors have been constructed, SGP of the coat protein (CP) has not yet mapped. To this end, we firstly presumed 13 nucleotides upstream of the start codon as the transcription starting site (TSS) as previous study identified by random amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Secondly, the region from nucleotides –110 to +175 is the putative CP SGP, as predicted, a long stem loop structure by the secondary structure of RNA covering movement protein (MP) and CP. To map the CGMMV CP SGP, we further constructed a series of deletion mutants according to RNA secondary structure prediction. The deletion of TSS upstream significantly enhanced CP transcription when 105 nucleotides were retained before the CP TSS. For the downstream of CP TSS, we analyzed the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in a series of vectors with partial deletion of the CGMMV CP and found that the nucleotides from +71 to +91 played a key role in the EGFP expression at the transcription level, while EGFP showed the highest expression level when 160 nucleotides were retained downstream of the CP TSS. To confirm these results, we applied online software MEME to predict the motifs and cis-acting elements in the 466 nucleotides covering the sequences of deletion analysis. Conserved motifs and relative acting elements were in regions in which transcription levels were the highest or enhanced. To our best knowledge, this is the first mapping of CGMMV SGP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumber green mottle mosaic virus 3aRNA 3aagriculture 3acoat proteins 3acomputer software 3agene expression 3agreen fluorescent protein 3anucleotides 3aprediction 3astart codon 3aviruses 0acoat protein 0asubgenomic promoter1 aLIU, Li-ming1 aWU, Hui-jie1 aKANG, Bao-shan1 aGU, Qin-sheng0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2020 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.153-163dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

The activity of HSPs enhances when the cell undergoes undesirable environmental conditions like stress. The protective roles of HSPs are due to their molecular chaperone and anti-apoptotic functions. HSPs have a central role in the eye, and their malfunction has been associated with the manifestation of ocular diseases. Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27, HSPB1) is present in various ocular tissues, and it has been found to protect the eye from disease states such as retinoblastoma, uveal melanoma, glaucoma, and cataract. But some recent studies have shown the destructive role of HSP27 on retinal ganglionic cells. Thus, this article summarizes the role of heat shock protein 27 in eye and ocular diseases and will focus on the expression, regulation, and function of HSP27 in ocular complications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acataract 3aeyes 3aglaucoma 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3amelanoma 3amolecular biology 3aprotective effect1 aShukla, Swati1 aRaṇajīta Kaura,1 aTitiyal, Jeewan Singh1 aKaur, Jasbir0 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.5107-5115dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07222-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245013300193300001800326500001500344520115200359592002801511650001701539650001201556650002301568650002501591650001501616650001401631650002001645650001701665650001301682650001501695650001301710650002101723650003501744653001701779653000901796700003101805700003101836700002501867700003601892700002201928773012401950856008202074852000902156655001202165IND60080283520221122061810.0181029e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008028352DNAL7 a249280872pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3419-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadeira, Klesia Pirola10aEstrogen receptor alpha (ERS1) SNPs c454-397T>C (PvuII) and c454-351A>G (XbaI) are risk biomarkers for breast cancer development  ap. 5459-5466.  a2019-12-06  aThere are several risk factors related to Breast Cancer (BC) risks and response to chemotherapy with SERMs. Recently some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on ESR1 gene have been associated to this disease. However, data are still inconclusive. The present study aimed to investigate the association of SNPs c454-397T>C (also called PvuII) and c454-351A>G (so called XbaI) to incidence of sporadic BC; ERα expression in BC; tamoxifen hormonetherapy (HT-TMX) responsiveness. To do so, a cohort of BC patients was analyzed through retrospective data collection, immunohistochemistry to ERα protein, and genotyping for PvuII and XbaI SNPs by PCR–RFLP, confirmed by sequencing. Significant difference in PvuII alleles frequencies were found BC patients when compared to control samples. Patients with P allele have a 5.14-fold increased BC risk. We found higher P and X alleles frequencies in ERα positive BC and the pp and xx genotypes were observed exclusively in patients with HT-TMX-responsive BC. Taken together, data indicates that P allele as a novel sporadic BC biomarker whereas p and x alleles enhanced chemotherapy responsiveness.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug therapy 3aalleles 3aestrogen receptors 3aimmunohistochemistry 3abiomarkers 3atamoxifen 3adata collection 3arisk factors 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3apatients 3abreast neoplasms 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0achemotherapy 0arisk1 aDaltoé, Renata Dalmaschio1 aSirtoli, Gabriela Modenesi1 aCarvalho, Alex Assis1 aRangel, Leticia Batista Azevedo1 aSilva, Ian Victor0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 Aug., v. 41, no. 8 p.5459-5466dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3419-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002600136245011000162300001600272520163200288592002801920653002001948653002001968653002901988653002102017653002802038653002502066653002002091653003002111653002302141700002202164700002602186700002602212700002102238773012602259856007202385852000902457655001202466IND60126088220221120200132.0151105e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012608822DNAL7 a10.1654/4456.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichardson, Dennis J.10aNew Geographic Distribution Records and Host Specificity of Placobdella ali (Hirudinida: Glossiphoniidae)  ap. 202-206.  aPlacobdella ali Huges and Siddall, 2007 has not been reported since its original description based on 3 specimens from Silver Mine Lake in Orange County, New York. The finding of 3 populations of P. ali in Connecticut along with further collection of this species from its type locality facilitated an investigation of host use by this leech, molecular characterization of the species, and observations on its natural history. Placobdella ali commonly occurred on substrate in Silver Mine Lake in Orange County, New York, and Clark's Pond and North Farms Reservoir in New Haven County, Connecticut. A single specimen was found in Lake Wintergreen in New Haven County, Connecticut. Placobdella ali was represented by individuals of a light-colored form and a melanic or dark-colored form. Sequences of 2 mitochondrial genes, CO-I and ND-1, were virtually identical among individuals from Connecticut and New York populations, as well as between the 2 color morphs. Placobdella ali was collected from 10 of 15 (66.7%%) American snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) in North Farms Reservoir. This observation in conjunction with the absence of P. ali on 55 eastern painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) suggests a fairly high degree of host specificity. Two species of exotic turtles, 3 red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans), and a single southern painted turtle (Chrysemys dorsalis), which is a state record for Connecticut, indicate the potential of introduction of exotic turtles as a vehicle for the introduction of exotic leeches. One of the 3 (33.3%%) red-eared sliders was infested with a single individual of P. ali.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPlacobdella ali 0aGlossiphoniidae 0aAmerican snapping turtle 0ared-eared slider 0asouthern painted turtle 0aChelydra sperpentina 0aChrysemys picta 0aTrachemys scripta elegans 0aChrysemys dorsalis1 aMoser, William E.1 aHammond, Charlotte I.1 aShevchenko, Alexis C.1 aLazo-Wasem, Eric0 tComparative parasitology.g2010 July, v. 77, no. 2 p.202-206dThe Helminthological Society of Washingtonx1525-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1654%2F4456.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03534naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245012600161300001600287520212700303592002802430596007702458650001902535650001102554650001902565650001002584650002002594650002902614650002102643650001202664650001802676650001802694650001802712650001902730650001002749700002002759700005902779700001702838700002002855773013402875856008203009852000903091655001203100IND60682125920221120101855.0200125e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068212592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-019-01415-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qian10aCattle urine and dung additions differently affect nitrification pathways and greenhouse gas emission in a grassland soil  ap. 235-247.  aHow cattle urine and dung addition, and their interaction with the mineral soil regulate cumulative autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrifications and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission is poorly understood. We investigated the effect of urine (applied at 425 mg N kg⁻¹ soil) and dung (applied at 200 mg total N kg⁻¹ soil) addition on cumulative autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrifications, and GHG emission in a grassland soil in a 35-day laboratory incubation experiment under six treatments: CK, unamended control; U, urine addition; Dₛ, dung added on the soil surface; U-Dₛ, urine addition + dung added on the soil surface; Dₘ, dung mixed into the soil; and U-Dₘ, urine addition + dung mixed into the soil. Compared with the CK, the U, U-Dₛ, and U-Dₘ treatments increased cumulative net nitrification (autotrophic + heterotrophic) by 548, 587, and 505% and cumulative autotrophic nitrification by 593, 618, and 508%, but the Dₘ treatment decreased cumulative net and autotrophic nitrifications by 77 and 83%, respectively. However, cumulative heterotrophic nitrification was less than 1% of the cumulative autotrophic nitrification in the CK and it was decreased by Dₛ and Dₘ as compared with the CK at the end of the incubation. Cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) were in the order of CK < U < Dₛ < Dₘ < U-Dₛ < U-Dₘ. In addition, all urine and dung treatments reduced cumulative methane (CH₄) uptake (negative values of CH₄ emission) as compared with the CK. Overall, soil cumulative net and autotrophic nitrifications were higher, but GHG emission was lower, with dung added on the soil surface than with it mixed into the soil. We conclude that urine addition increases but dung addition decreases cumulative autotrophic nitrification; dung addition also decreases heterotrophic nitrification, and how dung is added to the soil is important in regulating the nitrification processes and GHG emission. Therefore, urine and dung management can alter soil N transformations and has implications for mitigating climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  a249664-2013cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3acarbon dioxide 3acattle 3aclimate change 3afeces 3agrassland soils 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amethane 3amineral soils 3anitrification 3anitrous oxide 3atotal nitrogen 3aurine1 aKwak, Jin-Hyeob1 aChang, Scott X.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7624-439X1 aHan, Guodong1 aGong, Xiaoqiang0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2020 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.235-247dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl37530x0178-27627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-019-01415-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245019100176300001600367500001900383520096500402592002801367650003201395650001601427650002601443650001301469653000801482653001101490653002001501653000801521653001201529653001001541700002201551700002501573700005301598773010401651856008301755990002301838852000901861655001201870IND60697473020221119193723.0200605e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069747302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollenbaugh, Joseph A.10aDifferential regulatory activities of viral protein X for anti-viral efficacy of nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors in monocyte-derived macrophages and activated CD4+ T cells  ap. 313-321.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVpx encoded by HIV-2 and SIVsm enhances retroviral reverse transcription in macrophages in vitro by mediating the degradation of the host SAMHD1 protein that hydrolyzes dNTPs and by elevating cellular dNTP levels. Here we employed RT-SHIV constructs (SIV encoding HIV-1 RT) to investigate the contribution of Vpx to the potency of NRTIs, which compete against dNTPs, in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and activated CD4⁺ T cells. Relative to HIV-1, both SIV and RT-SHIV exhibited reduced sensitivities to AZT, 3TC and TDF in MDMs but not in activated CD4⁺ T cells. However, when SIV and RT-SHIV constructs not coding for Vpx were utilized, we observed greater sensitivities to all NRTIs tested using activated CD4⁺ T cells relative to the Vpx-coding counterparts. This latter phenomenon was observed for AZT only when using MDMs. Our data suggest that Vpx in RT-SHIVs may underestimate the antiviral efficacy of NRTIs in a cell type dependent manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3amacrophages 3areverse transcription 3avirology 0aVpx 0aSAMHD1 0aAntiretrovirals 0aSIV 0aRT-SHIV 0aHIV-11 aSchader, Susan M.1 aSchinazi, Raymond F.1 aKim, Baek1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7986-43350 tVirology.g2015 Nov., v. 485 p.313-321dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.08.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245017700179300001400356520173900370592002802109650001802137650001902155650001302174650002602187650001302213650001602226650001002242650001502252650001702267650002202284650001802306650001402324650002202338651001402360653001802374653002602392653003502418653001202453700003502465700002102500700003302521700002502554773010302579856008502682852000902767655001202776IND60557535220221121040249.0190411e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055753522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2016.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolónia, Ana Rita Moura10aArchaeal and bacterial communities of Xestospongia testudinaria and sediment differ in diversity, composition and predicted function in an Indonesian coral reef environment  ap. 37-53.  aLittle is known about the microbial diversity, composition and predicted functional similarities and dissimilarities between prokaryotic kingdoms and among coral reef biotopes located in close spatial proximity to one other. In this study, we compared communities of Archaea and Bacteria in two distinct biotopes, namely, the sponge Xestospongia testudinaria and sediment of the Berau reef system, Indonesia. Using a 16S rRNA gene barcoded pyrosequencing approach and a recently developed predictive metagenomic approach (PICRUSt), we tested to what extent sediment and X. testudinaria host compositionally and functionally distinct communities of Archaea and Bacteria. Although Crenarchaeota (Archaea) and Proteobacteria (Bacteria) were the dominant phyla in the microbial communities of both sediment and sponge, there were significant differences in composition between them. Biotope proved to be the main identifiable factor affecting composition. In line with the compositional differences between sediment and sponge prokaryote communities, there were also differences in predicted functions. The archaeal and bacterial communities of sediment were enriched for functions associated with the Metabolism and Environmental Information Processing categories; those of X. testudinaria were enriched for functions associated with the Genetic Information Processing category. The significant levels of concordance between archaeal and bacterial communities and the similar enrichment of these communities in the same functional categories suggests a certain degree of functional redundancy between Archaea and Bacteria in the studied biotopes, which for the sponge may result in an increased resilience to environmental perturbations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrenarchaeota 3aProteobacteria 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiotopes 3acoral reefs 3agenes 3ametabolism 3ametagenomics 3aprokaryotic cells 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3asequence analysis 3aIndonesia 0a16S rRNA gene 0aFunctional redundancy 0aGenetic information processing 0aPICRUSt1 aCleary, Daniel Francis Richard1 aFreitas, Rossana1 aGomes, Newton Carlos Marcial1 ade Voogd, Nicole Joy0 tJournal of sea research.g2017 Jan., v. 119 p.37-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2016.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010800169300001600277500001900293520108100312536027101393592002801664650002401692650000901716650001301725650001901738653001101757653001001768653001501778653001001793653001701803700001401820700001701834700001701851700001601868700001201884700001901896700001701915700001601932700001501948700001801963700001301981700001501994700001802009773010502027856008602132852000902218655001202227IND60735811220221121061454.0210529e20210603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073581122DNAL7 a10.1080/15476286.2020.18275912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Dongfang10aLong noncoding RNA lnc-NAP sponges mmu-miR-139-5p to modulate Nanog functions in mouse ESCs and embryos  ap. 875-887.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is controlled by a multilayer regulatory network, of which the key factors include core pluripotency genes Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog, and multiple microRNAs (miRNAs). Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been discovered as a class of new regulators for ESCs, and some lncRNAs could function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate mRNAs by competitively binding to miRNAs. Here, we identify mmu-miR-139-5p as a new regulator for Nanog by targeting Nanog 3′ untranslated region (UTR) to repress Nanog expression in mouse ESCs and embryos. Such regulation could be released by an ESC-specifically expressed ceRNA named lnc-NAP. The expression of lnc-NAP is activated by OCT4, SOX2, as well as NANOG through promoter binding. Downregulation of lnc-NAP reduces Nanog abundance, which leads to decreased pluripotency of mouse ESCs and embryonic lethality. These results reveal lnc-NAP as a new regulator for Nanog in mouse ESCs, and uncover a feed-forward regulatory loop of Nanog through the participation of lnc-NAP.  aThis work was supported by grants from Chinese Academy of Sciences (QYZDJ-SSW-SMC015 to X.-J.W.), National Natural Science Foundation of China (91839105 to M.W., 81790622 and 91940304 to X.-J.W.), and CAS Strategic Priority Research Program (XDA16020801 to X.-J.W.).  aPublisher supplied data 3aembryonic mortality 3amice 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 0alncRNA 0aceRNA 0amiR-139-5p 0aNanog 0apluripotency1 aTong, Man1 aXia, Baolong1 aFeng, Guihai1 aWang, Leyun1 aLi, Ang1 aLuo, Guanzheng1 aWan, Haifeng1 aZhang, Zeyu1 aZhang, Hao1 aYang, Yun-Gui1 aZhou, Qi1 aWang, Meng1 aWang, Xiu-Jie0 tRNA biology.g2021 June 03, v. 18, no. 6 p.875-887dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2020.18275913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013000165300001600295520134100311592002801652596005901680596005901739596008701798596007301885596004401958650001902002650002402021650002002045650001702065650002102082650001602103650001502119650002602134650000702160650002102167650000902188650001702197700001802214700001702232700001802249700001502267700001802282700001402300700001402314700002102328700001602349773013402365856008202499852000902581655001202590IND60682126020221121025715.0200125e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068212602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-019-01419-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jipeng10aMicroplate fluorimetric assay of soil leucine aminopeptidase activity: alkalization is not needed before fluorescence reading  ap. 281-285.  aThe fluorescence responses of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) and L-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (L-leucine-AMC) (the fluorescent dye and substrate used in the soil leucine aminopeptidase assay, respectively) to alkalization by NaOH and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (THAM) buffer were analyzed. The leucine aminopeptidase activities were also measured without and with the alkalization procedure using five soils with contrasting properties. The pH optimum of leucine aminopeptidase activity was 8 ± 1 for the five studied soils. In this pH range, the alkalization procedure cannot increase the fluorescence of AMC to improve the assay sensitivity. Excess alkalization (final medium pH of 12 or higher) led to decreasing fluorescence of AMC with time and non-enzymatic hydrolysis of L-leucine-AMC, which caused irreproducible values of the calculated enzyme activities. Moreover, a medium pH of ~ 11 cannot terminate the enzymatic reaction, and thus it seems impractical to stop the enzyme reaction by alkalization without causing the unstable behavior of AMC and L-leucine-AMC. We recommend performing the soil leucine aminopeptidase assay at the optimal pH without alkalization and reading the fluorescence immediately after incubation. This approach may help to simplify and standardize the leucine aminopeptidase assay.  aPublisher supplied data  a41701288cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41630751cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017424cYouth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a2018JY0163cDepartment of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province  a201708515106cChina Scholarship Council 3aalkalinization 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3afluorometry 3ahydrolysis 3aleucyl aminopeptidase 3apH 3asodium hydroxide 3asoil 3asoil enzymes1 aHuang, Shunyu1 aHe, Qingqing1 aBing, Haijian1 aChen, Xiao1 aZhang, Xifeng1 aTian, Xin1 aZhou, Jun1 aWilcke, Wolfgang1 aWu, Yanhong0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2020 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.281-285dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl37530x0178-27627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-019-01419-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03791naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245016200175300001600337520222300353592002802576650001702604650001302621650001602634650002002650650001302670650001602683650001502699650002602714650001402740650001502754650001302769650001302782650001202795650002902807650001002836653000902846653001502855653001702870653002802887653002702915700001802942700001802960700002002978700002302998700002803021700002603049773009203075856008503167852000903252655001203261IND60599439120221119182329.0180702e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059943912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPizzutti, Ionara R.10aDevelopment, optimization and validation of a multimethod for the determination of 36 mycotoxins in wines by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 352-363.  aA fast and efficient multimethod for the determination of 36 mycotoxins in wine, using ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS), was developed, optimized, validated and implemented in routine analysis. A simplified, quick extraction was performed with acetonitrile, derived from the QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) approach, which was traditionally developed for pesticides analysis. This study aimed at a single extraction and chromatographic separation for 36 mycotoxins.Optimization tests were performed to find the proper ratio of wine: water and extraction solvent and the need for an additional buffering step with ammonium formate/formic acid and a dispersive SPE cleanup with various sorbents. The dSPE steps did not show significant improvement in analysis results, therefore, it was not applied in the final method to be validated. The mycotoxins were separated and detected on a UPLC–MS/MS system, used in the ESI positive ionization mode. The various mycotoxins were divided in three different concentration level groups, according to their sensitivity in UPLC–MS/MS. The validation was performed by analyzing recovery samples at three different spike levels with six replicates (n=6) at each level. Linearity (r²) of calibration curves, accuracy (recovery %), instrument limits of detection and method limits of quantification (LOD and LOQ), precision (RSD%) and matrix effects (%) were determined for each individual mycotoxin. From the 36 mycotoxins analyzed by UPLC–MS/MS (ESI+), 35 showed average recoveries in the range 70–120%, and 86% of these with a RSD≤20% at the lowest spike level (for Group I, II and III, respectively, 1, 50 and 10µgkg⁻¹). The higher spike levels showed even better results. Only nivalenol could not be quantified at any concentration level. The method LOQ for 86% of the mycotoxins studied was the lowest spike level tested. The matrix effect observed was low for most mycotoxins analyzed and had no significant influence on the analytical results obtained. The developed procedure was applied successfully in routine analysis in a survey of wine samples originating from different countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aammonium 3acalibration 3adetection limit 3aformates 3aformic acid 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3anivalenol 3apesticides 3asolvents 3asorbents 3asurveys 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awines 0aWine 0aMycotoxins 0aUPLC–MS/MS 0aAcetonitrile extraction 0aMulti-mycotoxin method1 ade Kok, Andre1 aScholten, Jos1 aRighi, Laís W.1 aCardoso, Carmem D.1 aNecchi Rohers, Graciele1 ada Silva, Rosselei C.0 tTalanta.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 129 p.352-363dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245005800177520120400235592002801439650000801467650002101475650002501496650001301521650002301534650002101557650001501578650001901593650002501612650001301637650002201650650003301672650002001705650001601725653001301741653001701754653001001771653002601781700003601807700002601843700002001869700002401889700002601913700002201939700001801961700006001979773011202039856008502151852000902236655001202245IND60704805620221117230144.0200831e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070480562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1184502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUpadhyaya, Lakshmeesha10aNEXARTM-coated hollow fibers for air dehumidification  aAir conditioning is one of the essential requirements for households as well as work stations. Dehumidification in air conditioning is the highest energy-consuming component, where membranes could play a crucial role. In this work, we propose the coating of NEXARᵀᴹ, a commercial pentablock copolymer in tetrahydrofuran on polyetherimide hollow fiber support for separation of water vapor from humidified air. The block copolymer in tetrahydrofuran forms a lamellar/parallel cylindrical structure separated by equidistance during the morphological transformation process giving its unique characteristics with higher water vapor transfer efficiency. Both vacuum and sweep gas modes of membrane dehumidification strategies are investigated along with the detailed study of the morphological transformation process under a controlled environment, which is supported by comprehensive scanning electron microscopic and atomic force microscopic imaging. The membrane has shown water vapor permeance up to 9089 GPU with water vapor to nitrogen selectivity up to 3870. The membrane can reduce the relative humidity from 80% to 41% proving one of the competitive materials for membrane dehumidification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair conditioning 3aartificial membranes 3acoatings 3acomposite polymers 3adehumidification 3ahouseholds 3aimage analysis 3amoisture diffusivity 3anitrogen 3arelative humidity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atetrahydrofuran 3awater vapor 0aMembrane 0aHollow fiber 0aNexar 0aWater vapor transport1 aGebreyohannes, Abaynesh Yihdego1 aAkhtar, Faheem Hassan1 aFalca, Gheorghe1 aMusteata, Valentina1 aMahalingam, Dinesh K.1 aAlmansoury, Rneem1 aNg, Kim Choon1 aNunes, Suzana P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3669-138X0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 614 p.118450-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1184503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011400176300001600290520096400306592002801270650004401298650001301342650001901355650001701374650004401391650000701435650002101442650001101463650002101474653002601495653002701521653002101548700002401569700002301593700002801616700006301644700006101707773010801768856008601876852000901962655001201971IND60540782020221122005513.0190318e20140808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054078202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.02.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChivangkul, Tawroong10aEnhanced water-solubility and mucoadhesion of N,N,N-trimethyl-N-gluconate-N-homocysteine thiolactone chitosan  ap. 224-231.  aA water-soluble chitosan with improved mucoadhesion was prepared by modifying 19.4% of the amine groups of chitosan to trimethylammonium and conjugation of gluconolactone (GLU) and homocysteine thiolactone (HT) onto the remaining amine groups of the chitosan backbone.

The indigenous iron-oxidizing and sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms enriched from PM were primarily Alicyclobacillus and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, respectively. After 12 days of bioleaching, 95% of Cu, 96.5% of Zn, 93.6% of Mn, and 92.7% of Cd were removed from the PM in sulfur-oxidizing bioleaching process. Besides, 92.9% of Cu, 94.1% of Zn, 91.9% of Mn, and 90.5% of Cd were removed in iron-oxidizing bioleaching process. Furthermore, 18.1% of TN, 63.3% of TP, 65.4% of TK, and 45.6% of TOC were leached from the PM in the sulfur-oxidizing bioleaching process, whereas only 21.6% of TN, 32.8% of TP, 4% of TK, and 49% of TOC were solubilized in the iron-oxidizing bioleaching process. The X-ray diffraction analysis results demonstrated that there was a large amount of sulfur remained in bioleached manure from the sulfur-oxidizing process which poses a potential risk of soil re-acidification. The Standards, Measurements and Testing Program extraction protocol study on fraction of P in PM showed that the amount of bioavailable P in the sulfur-oxidizing bioleaching process was dramatically declined, whereas it was elevated by 25.9% in the iron-oxidizing bioleaching process. The results obtained in this study indicated that both the sulfur- and iron-oxidizing bioleaching process were able to efficiently remove HMs from PM at initial unadjusted pH, whereas the iron-oxidizing process was proved better method in reserving the fertilizing property and more friendly to the environment.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0801002-01cAgro-Environment Protection Institute (AEPI) of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) of China  a201601190cTianjin Rural Work Committee of China  a201716cOpen Foundation of the Heilongjiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Microbiology and Recycling of Argo-Waste in Cold Region 3aAcidithiobacillus thiooxidans 3aAlicyclobacillus 3aX-ray diffraction 3abioavailability 3abioleaching 3acadmium 3acomparative study 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3aleaching 3amanganese 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apig manure 3arisk 3asoil 3asolubilization 3asulfur 3azinc1 aLi, Jiajia1 aHuang, Wenli1 aZheng, Xiangqun1 aLi, Songrong1 aChen, Xi1 aLiu, Dongfang0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2020 Feb., v. 231, no. 2 p.34-34dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-4415-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010700169300001600276500001900292520152000311592002801831650002501859650002901884650002701913650001601940650002601956650002301982650003002005650000902035650001602044650001402060650001402074650002002088650001402108650001102122651001002133653002302143653001502166653001602181653001302197653001302210700001902223700001702242700001602259700001902275700002002294700001502314700001502329773016502344856008602509852000902595655001202604IND60680499620221120193752.0200110e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068049962DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(19)62734-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLU, Zhi-xiang10aScreening of antagonistic Trichoderma strains and their application for controlling stalk rot in maize  ap. 145-152.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMaize is one of the major crops in China, but maize stalk rot occurs nationwide and has become one of the major challenges in maize production in China. In order to find an environment-friendly and feasible technology to control this disease, a Trichoderma-based biocontrol agent was selected. Forty-eight strains with various inhibition activities to Fusarium graminearum, and Fusarium verticillioides were tested. A group of Trichoderma strains (DLY31, SG3403, DLY1303 and GDFS1009) were found to provide an inhibition rate to pathogen growth in vitro of over 70%. These strains also prevented pathogen infection over 65% and promoted the maize seedling growth for the main root in vivo by over 50%. Due to its advantage in antifungal activity against pathogens and promotion activity to maize, Trichoderma asperellum GDSF1009 was selected as the most promising strain of the biocontrol agent in the Trichoderma spectrum. Pot experiments showed that the Trichoderma agent at 2–3 g/pot could achieve the best control of seedling stalk rot and promotion of maize seedling growth. In the field experiments, 8–10 g/hole was able to achieve over 65% control to stalk rot, and yield increased by 2–11%. In the case of natural morbidity, the control efficiency ranged from 27.23 to 48.84%, and the rate of yield increase reached 11.70%, with a dosage of Trichoderma granules at 75 kg ha⁻¹. Based on these results, we concluded that the Trichoderma agent is a promising biocontrol approach to stalk rot in maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium verticillioides 3aTrichoderma asperellum 3aagriculture 3aantifungal properties 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acorn 3acorn stover 3amorbidity 3apathogens 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3ayields 3aChina 0astalk rot in maize 0abiocontrol 0aTrichoderma 0aFusarium 0agranules1 aTU, Guang-ping1 aZhang, Ting,1 aLI, Ya-qian1 aWang, Xin-Hua,1 aZHANG, Quan-guo1 aSong, Wei,1 aChen, Jie,0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2020 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.145-152dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

Although previous studies have focused on annexin gene characterization and function from numerous plants, no studies to date have explored annexin1 genes from the poplar, Populus trichocarpa. PtAnnexin1 from P. trichocarpa encodes a putative annexin protein. It is expressed at varying levels in different tissues and is strongly induced by different abiotic stresses. In this study, in vitro enzyme activity assays showed that PtAnnexin1 protein had GTPase/ATPase activity, but no peroxidase activity. Phenotypic analyses demonstrated that transgenic poplar plants overexpressing PtAnnexin1 showed significant growth dominance compared to wild-type (WT) plants in response to drought and salt stresses. In addition, poplars overexpressing PtAnnexin1 had higher total chlorophyll content; increased POD and SOD activities; and higher contents of proline and MDA, all of which contributed to an increase in salt and drought stress tolerance. These findings demonstrate that PtAnnexin1 plays an important role in the abiotic stress response of poplar plants, and that overexpression of PtAnnexin1 in transgenic poplar improves salt and drought tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data  a31570650cNational Science Foundation of China 3aPopulus trichocarpa 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aperoxidase 3aphenotype 3aplant development 3aplant genetics 3aproline 3astress response1 aMovahedi, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5062-504X1 aWei, Hui1 aWu, Xiaolong1 aZhang, Jiaxin1 aSun, Weibo1 aLi, Dawei1 aZhuge, Qiang0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2020 Feb., v. 16, no. 1 p.20-20dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949857x1614-29427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-020-1412-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100002200162245018000184300001800364520139600382592002801778650001901806650002501825650001401850650000901864650000901873650001601882650002301898650001001921650002201931650000901953650001301962650001401975650001001989650002701999650002102026650004702047650001202094650002102106650002902127650002602156650001102182650004102193650001002234650002002244650001002264650002802274700002402302700002302326773010002349856007702449852000902526655001202535IND60083361020221120172656.0141101e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008336102DNAL7 a219437322pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-44242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMárquez-Ruiz, G.10aDetermination of 10-hydroxystearic, 10-ketostearic, 8-hydroxypalmitic, and 8-ketopalmitic acids in milk fat by solid-phase extraction plus gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  ap. 4810-4819.  aFatty acids (FA) bearing oxygenated functions and present in esterified form in triacylglycerols are widespread in nature but very little is known about their occurrence in dairy products. A method based on gas chromatography (with flame ionization detector and mass spectrometry detectors), including the previous isolation of polar FA methyl esters by solid-phase extraction, was applied to quantify oxygenated FA in milk fat. Samples obtained from ewes and goats fed with a variety of oil sources were studied. Fatty acids identified were 8-ketopalmitic, 8-hydroxypalmitic, 10-ketostearic, and mainly 10-hydroxystearic acids. The highest levels of 10-ketostearic acid were obtained in milk from animals fed olive oil (up to 1.5%) and from those fed long-chain n-3 FA-enriched diets (0.5–1.0%). In all samples, 10-hydroxystearic acid, not reported so far in milk, was the second most abundant oxygenated FA (up to 0.8%). The high correlation obtained between contents of 10-ketostearic and 10-hydroxystearic acids would confirm the existence of a common pathway of formation in the rumen, whereas the presence of 8-ketopalmitate and 8-hydroxypalmitate could be putatively attributed to mechanisms of β-oxidation in the tissues. The influence of cis-9 C18:1 and trans-10 C18:1 as precursors of these compounds in milk and the metabolic pathways involved in their formation are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta oxidation 3abiochemical pathways 3adetectors 3adiet 3aewes 3afatty acids 3agas chromatography 3agoats 3amass spectrometry 3amilk 3amilk fat 3aolive oil 3arumen 3asolid phase extraction 3atriacylglycerols 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Fatsxmetabolism 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aGoats 2aMilkxchemistry 2aSheep 2aStearic Acidsxanalysis1 aRodríguez-Pino, V.1 ade la Fuente, M.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Oct., v. 94, no. 10 p.4810-4819dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-44243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245012100175300001600296520103200312592002801344650005001372650001201422650001001434650001801444650002201462650001701484650000901501650000701510650001401517653001301531653001601544653001401560653001601574653001401590653001701604653001701621700003001638700003101668700002401699700003301723700002801756700001801784700002601802700001901828773008901847856008301936990002302019852000902042655001202051IND60697473420221119194942.0200605e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069747342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNieto-Torres, Jose L.10aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus E protein transports calcium ions and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome  ap. 330-339.  aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope (E) protein is a viroporin involved in virulence. E protein ion channel (IC) activity is specifically correlated with enhanced pulmonary damage, edema accumulation and death. IL-1β driven proinflammation is associated with those pathological signatures, however its link to IC activity remains unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV E protein forms protein–lipid channels in ERGIC/Golgi membranes that are permeable to calcium ions, a highly relevant feature never reported before. Calcium ions together with pH modulated E protein pore charge and selectivity. Interestingly, E protein IC activity boosted the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to IL-1β overproduction. Calcium transport through the E protein IC was the main trigger of this process. These findings strikingly link SARS-CoV E protein IC induced ionic disturbances at the cell level to immunopathological consequences and disease worsening in the infected organism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3acalcium 3aedema 3ainflammasomes 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aion channels 3aions 3apH 3avirulence 0aSARS-CoV 0aCoronavirus 0aE protein 0aIon channel 0aViroporin 0aInflammasome 0aPathogenesis1 aVerdiá-Báguena, Carmina1 aJimenez-Guardeño, Jose M.1 aRegla-Nava, Jose A.1 aCastaño Rodríguez, Carlos,1 aFernandez-Delgado, Raul1 aTorres, Jaume1 aAguilella, Vicente M.1 aEnjuanes, Luis0 tVirology.g2015 Nov., v. 485 p.330-339dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.08.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01979naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008600175300001600261520084900277592002801126650001601154650001201170650001901182650002101201650002301222650001601245650001401261653001601275653002901291653001901320653002301339653001601362700002401378773010801402856008601510852000901596655001201605IND60540782220221121231746.0190318e20140808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054078222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.02.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowittaya, Chutarat10aMolecular weight, chain profile of rice amylopectin and starch pasting properties  ap. 216-223.  aDifferences in fine structure, average molecular size of amylopectin (AP) as well as clarity of the AP solution from indica waxy rice and high amylose (HAM) rice were examined.

The magnetic ionic liquid 1‐octyl‐3‐methylimidazolium tetrachloroferrate was successfully synthesized and used as the optimal extraction solvent. An aliquot of 9 μL of magnetic ionic liquid could be stably suspended on the weighing paper for long time extraction. The increase of the extractant volume resulted in a significantly enhanced in extracting efficiency of the weighing paper‐assisted magnetic ionic liquid headspace single‐drop microextraction than traditional headspace single‐drop microextraction method. In this experiment, the optimal conditions were 1‐octyl‐3‐methylimidazolium tetrachloroferrate as the extraction solvent, extraction time of 12 min, microwave power of 600 W, cyclohexane as back‐extractant and sample amount of 30 mg. The developed method was successfully applied to analyze 16 lavender samples from three different harvest years. A total of 39 compounds in lavender were identified and the principal component analysis provided a clear separation between those lavender samples harvested in different years. The results indicated that the proposed weighing paper‐assisted magnetic ionic liquid headspace single‐drop microextraction is a novel, fast, simple and sensitive microextration technique for the determination of the essential oil components in lavender.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020D01C032cNatural Science Foundation of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region  a21565024cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aLavandula 3acyclohexanes 3adistillation 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3aionic liquids 3amagnetism 3amicroextraction 3apaper 3aprincipal component analysis 3aseparation1 aLiu, Xin1 aWang, Lili1 aWang, Caijuan1 aFu, Jihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0608-56850 tJournal of separation science.g2021 Jan., v. 44, no. 2 p.585-599dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2020007513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015300164300001100317520162400328592002801952650001301980650001401993650003302007650002302040650001402063650001202077650000702089650001302096650001902109650002002128650001202148650002802160700001302188700001702201700001502218700003102233773014802264856008202412852000902494655001202503IND60681782820221119222249.0200707e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068178282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-019-1211-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Wenchao10aSea salt bittern-driven forward osmosis for nutrient recovery from black water: A dual waste-to-resource innovation via the osmotic membrane process  ap. 32.  aA dual “waste-to-resource” innovation in nutrient enrichment and recovery from domestic black water using a sea salt bittern (SSB)-driven forward osmosis (FO) process is proposed and demonstrated. The performance of SSB as a “waste-to-resource” draw solution for FO was first evaluated. A synthetic SSB-driven FO provided a water flux of 25.67±3.36 L/m² · h, which was 1.5–1.7 times compared with synthetic seawater, 1 M NaCl, and 1 M MgCl₂. Slightly compromised performance regarding reverse solute selectivity was observed. In compensation, the enhanced reverse diffusion of Mg²⁺ suggested superior potential in terms of recovering nutrients in the form of struvite precipitation. The nutrient enrichment was performed using both the pre-filtered influent and effluent of a domestic septic tank. Over 80% of phosphate-P recovery was achieved from both low- and high-strength black water at a feed volume reduction up to 80%–90%. With an elevated feed pH (∼9), approximately 60%–85% enriched phosphate-P was able to be recovered in the form of precipitated stuvite. Whereas the enrichment performance of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) largely differed depending on the strength of black water. Improved concentration factor (i.e., 3-folds) and retention (>60%) of TKN was obtained in the high-nutrient-strength black water at a feed volume reduction of 80%, in comparison with a weak TKN enrichment observed in low-strength black water. The results suggested a good potential for nutrient recovery based on this dual “waste-to-resource” FO system with proper management of membrane cleaning.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleaning 3amagnesium 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3amagnesium chloride 3anutrients 3aosmosis 3apH 3aseawater 3aseptic systems 3asodium chloride 3asolutes 3atotal Kjeldahl nitrogen1 aZaw, May1 aAn, Xiaochan1 aHu, Yunxia1 aTabucanon, Allan Sriratana0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2020 Apr., v. 14, no. 2 p.32-32dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-019-1211-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245006900180500001900249520185700268592002802125650002102153650001502174650001502189650002102204650001302225650002302238650001702261650001002278650001502288650001202303653001802315653001702333700001502350700002802365773011402393856008602507852000902593655001202602IND60722789820221119083409.0210219e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072278982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1248892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaheed, Ismaila Olalekan10aChitosan modifications for adsorption of pollutants – A review  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn recent times, research interest into the development of biodegradable, cost-effective and environmental friendly adsorbents with favourable properties for adsorption of pollutants is a challenge. Modification of chitosan via different physical and chemical methods have gained attention as a promising approach for removing organic (such as dyes and pharmaceuticals) and inorganic (such as metal/metal ions) pollutants from aqueous medium. In this regard, researchers have reported grafting and cross-linking approach among others as a potentially useful method for chitosan’s modification for improved adsorption efficiency with respect to pollutant uptake. This article reviews the trend in chitosan modification, with regards to the summary of some recently published works on modification of chitosan and their adsorption application in pollutants (metal ion, dyes and pharmaceuticals) removal from aqueous medium. The review uniquely highlights some common cross-linkers and grafting procedures for chitosan modification, their influence on structure and adsorption capacity of modified-chitosan with respect to pollutants removal. Findings revealed that the performance of modified chitosan for adsorption of pollutants depends largely on the modification method adopted, materials used for the modification and adsorption experimental conditions. Cross-linking is commonly utilized for improving the chemical and mechanical stabilities of chitosan but usually decreases adsorption capacity of chitosan/modified-chitosan for adsorption of pollutants. However, literature survey revealed that adsorption capacity of cross-linked chitosan based materials have been enhanced in recently published works either by grafting, incorporation of solid adsorbents (e.g metals, clays and activated carbon) or combination of both prior to cross-linking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiodegradability 3achitosan 3acost effectiveness 3acrosslinking 3adrugs 3apollutants 3asurveys 0aCross-linking 0aModification1 aOh, Wen Da1 aSuah, Faiz Bukhari Mohd0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 408 p.124889-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1248893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01410naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002300136245010300159300001600262520038700278592002800665653002600693653002200719653001500741653002000756653001400776653001900790653001700809653002400826653002700850773012600877856007201003852000901075655001201084IND60126089020221121171455.0151105e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012608902DNAL7 a10.1654/4446.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarger, Michael A.10aMicrohabitat Use of Two Brachylaimid Trematodes in Terrestrial Gastropod Second Intermediate Hosts  ap. 185-187.  aMicrohabitat use of metacercariae of Panopistus pricei and Brachylaima thompsoni in 2 terrestrial gastropods, Neohelix albolabris and Webbhelix multilineata, was studied.

Consequently, calcium lactate crystals (CLC) are a common defect in Cheddar cheese. A novel approach for preventing CLC is the addition of sodium gluconate. Sodium gluconate has the potential to increase the solubility of calcium and lactate by forming soluble complexes with calcium and lactate ions, and preventing them from being available for the formation of CLC. The objective of this study was to determine if sodium gluconate could increase the solubility of calcium lactate (CaL₂). Seven CaL₂ solutions (5.31% wt/wt) with 7 levels of sodium gluconate (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4% wt/wt) were made in triplicate. Solutions were stored at 7°C for 21 d, and were visually inspected for CLC formation. Subsequently, they were filtered to remove CLC and the supernatant was analyzed for lactic acid and gluconic acid by HPLC and for calcium by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The visual inspection demonstrated that CLC were formed in the solution with 0% gluconate after the first day of storage and CLC continued to accumulate over time. A minute amount of CLC was also visible in the solution with 0.5% gluconate after 21 d of storage, whereas CLC were not visible in the other solutions. The HPLC results indicated a higher concentration of calcium and lactic acid in the filtrate from the solutions containing added gluconate. Thus, sodium gluconate can increase the solubility of CaL₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCheddar cheese 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acalcium 3acrystals 3agluconic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aions 3alactic acid 3asolubility 2aCalciumxanalysis 2aCalcium Compoundsxchemistry 2aFood Technology 2aGluconatesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aLactatesxchemistry 2aLactic Acidxanalysis 2aSolubility1 aMetzger, L.E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Oct., v. 94, no. 10 p.4843-4849dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-45493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012500167300001600292520189400308592002802202650001202230650001802242650001902260650001602279650001502295650001102310650001002321650001702331650001302348650001002361650001602371653001702387653002902404653001602433653002002449653001602469700001602485700001402501700001702515700001802532773009802550856008702648852000902735655001202744IND60581721520221119090506.0180830e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058172152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.2362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wan10aCO2 capture by carbide slag calcined under high-concentration steam and energy requirement in calcium looping conditions  ap. 869-878.  aIn this work, calcination under high-concentration steam that can be implemented by O2/H2O combustion was proposed to replace high-concentration CO2 that usually was implemented by O2/CO2 combustion in calcium looping. CO2 capture performance of the carbide slag, an industrial solid waste from chlor-alkali plants, was investigated in a dual fixed-bed reactor under high-concentration steam calcination condition during the calcium looping cycles. Calcined under high-concentration steam (95%) atmosphere, the carbide slag can be completely and quickly decomposed at 800°C, which is 150°C lower than the calcination temperature under high-concentration CO2 (100%) atmosphere. The carbonation conversions of the carbide slag calcined under high-concentration steam condition after 1 and 10 cycles are about 42% and 36% higher than those calcined under high-concentration CO2 condition, respectively. This is because when the carbide slag is calcined under high-concentration steam, the relatively smaller CaO grains and more porous structure are generated, which are beneficial for CO2 capture by carbide slag. Due to the low calcination temperature and the high CO2 capture capacity of the carbide slag, the energy requirement in the calciner to capture per mole CO2 under high-concentration steam condition is lower than that under high-concentration CO2 condition. High-concentration steam calcination in place of high-concentration CO2 calcination improves the CO2 capture efficiency from 0.68 to 0.88 and saves a quarter of the energy consumption in the calciner for capturing per mole CO2 in the calcium looping system, when the ratio of recycled carbide slag flow rate to CO2 flow rate is 2 and the sorbent make-up ratio is 0.09. Thus, it is reasonable to consider O2/H2O combustion as an alternative energy-supply way of O2/CO2 combustion for the calcium looping of carbide slag.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonation 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aslags 3asolid wastes 3asorbents 3asteam 3atemperature 0aCarbide slag 0aHigh-concentration steam 0aCalcination 0aCalcium looping 0aCO2 capture1 aLi, Yingjie1 aHe, Zirui1 aMa, Xiaotong1 aSong, Haiping0 tApplied energy.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 206 p.869-878dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.2363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245009100192300001800283520162800301592002801929650002201957650001201979650001301991650001902004650002002023650001602043650001602059650002002075650002202095650001202117650001302129650003002142650002502172700002202197700003002219700002202249700003102271700003002302700002102332773012402353856008202477852000902559655001202568IND60080284320221116173001.0181029e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008028432DNAL7 a249039712pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3427-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGharesi-Fard, Behrouz10aHLA-DRBl and susceptibility to kidney allograft rejection in Southern Iranian patients  ap. 5513-5518.  aKidney transplantation is the best treatment option for the patients with end-stage renal disease. Viral infections and genetic factors such as HLA-II antigens may affect the kidney transplant outcome. The compatibility of HLA-DRB1 molecules in the survival of kidney transplant is important. Also, the correlation between these molecules and viral infections is significant. The current study investigates the allele frequency of HLA-DRB1 in 41 recipient kidney transplant and 203 normal healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction using sequence specific primers. Moreover the relation between HLA-DRB1 allelic groups and hepatitis B, hepatitis C and cytomegalovirus viral infections was also studied. However statistical analysis of the allele frequencies didn’t show any significant association between HLA-DRB1 allelic group distributions or sharing and susceptibility to acute kidney transplant rejection (P > 0.05). Comparing the allele frequencies between HLA-DRB1*14 and DRB1*04 allelic showed a significant difference in controls and patients (P = 0.03 and P = 0.05 respectively). The results of the present study also showed a significant association between possession of HLA-DRB1*07 allele in kidney transplant recipients and hepatitis C virus infection (P = 0.009). In conclusion however the results of the present study did not showed relation between HLA-DRB1 allele’s frequencies or sharing and kidney transplantation outcome, the results indicated that HLA-DRB1 alleles may susceptible individuals to renal disease or play a role in susceptibility to viral infection in kidney transplant patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis C virus 3aalleles 3aantigens 3agene frequency 3agraft rejection 3ahepatitis B 3ahepatitis C 3akidney diseases 3akidney transplant 3akidneys 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astatistical analysis1 aRezanezhad, Leila1 aKarimi, Mohammad-Hossein,1 aGeramizadeh, Bita1 aSalehipour, Mohammad Mehdi1 aHosseini, Seyed Ali Malek1 aRoozbeh, Jamshid0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 Aug., v. 41, no. 8 p.5513-5518dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3427-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245013800171300001800309520172600327592002802053596006802081650002502149650001102174650001302185650001602198650001402214650001402228700001802242700002002260773014702280856008302427852000902510655001202519IND60735811920221121201813.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073581192DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-021-03274-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhammed, Abdellah10aSpeciation of chromium in water samples using microfluidic paper-based analytical devices with online oxidation of trivalent chromium  ap. 3339-3347.  aSpeciation of chromium (Cr) was demonstrated using microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μ-PADs) that permit the colorimetric determination of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) via online oxidation. The μ-PADs consist of left and right channels that allow the simultaneous measurements of Cr(VI) and total Cr based on the colorimetric reaction of Cr(VI) with 1,5-diphenylcarbazide (DPC). For the determination of Cr(VI), a sample solution was directly reacted with DPC in the left channels whereas total Cr was determined in the right channels, which permitted online oxidation in the pretreatment zone containing cerium (IV) (Ce(IV)) followed by a colorimetric reaction with DPC. We found that the online oxidation of Cr(III) proceeded 100% whereas Ce(IV) inhibited the reaction of Cr(VI) with DPC. Therefore, speciation can be achieved by measuring the Cr(VI) and total Cr in the left and right channels followed by the subtraction of Cr(VI) from total Cr. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.008 and 0.02 mg L⁻¹ for Cr(VI) and 0.07 and 0.1 mg L⁻¹ for Cr(III) or total Cr, respectively. The linear dynamic ranges were 0.02–100 mg L⁻¹ and 0.1–60 mg L⁻¹ for Cr(VI) and Cr(III), respectively. The RSDs were less than 7.5%. The results obtained using μ-PADs were in good agreement with those obtained via ICP-OES with recoveries of 92–108% for Cr(III) and 108–110% for Cr (VI) using μ-PADs, and 106–110% for total Cr using ICP-OES. Thus, the μ-PADs could potentially be utilized for the speciation of chromium in developing countries where environmental pollution and the availability of sophisticated instruments are significant problems.  aPublisher supplied data  aKAKENHI/ JP20H02766cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aanalytical chemistry 3acerium 3achromium 3acolorimetry 3aoxidation 3apollution1 aHussen, Ahmed1 aKaneta, Takashi0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2021 May, v. 413, no. 12 p.3339-3347dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-021-03274-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245015500206500001900361520118500380592002801565650001501593650001301608650002001621650002101641650001601662650001001678650001901688650001401707650002101721650002001742653002101762653001901783653003301802700001901835700001801854700005101872700001601923700001601939700002001955700001501975700001301990700001602003773011302019856008602132852000902218655001202227IND60722790020221119084846.0210226e20210505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072279002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1248942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Lifang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3996-497X10aVisible-light-driven photoelectrochemical sensing platform based on BiOI nanoflowers/TiO2 nanotubes for detection of atrazine in environmental samples  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, a visible-light-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing platform was developed based on BiOI nanoflowers/TiO₂ nanotubes (BiOI NFs/TiO₂ NTs) for detection of atrazine (ATZ). The BiOI NFs/TiO₂ NTs p–n heterojunctions synthesized by decorating BiOI NFs on TiO₂ NTs via simple hydrothermal approach exhibit strong visible-light absorption ability, high photocurrent response and PEC activity. Thus BiOI NFs/TiO₂ NTs heterostructures were first explored to act as the photoelectrode for the immobilization of the anti-ATZ aptamer to develop a PEC sensing platform. The design PEC aptasensing platform exhibits prominent analytical performance for determination of ATZ with a low detection limit of 0.5 pM under visible-light irradiation, and displays good selectivity for ATZ in the control experiments. The superior behavior of the sensing platform could be ascribed to the design of the appropriate sensing material with tubular microstructure, excellent PEC response of the photoelectrode, and the large loading amount of aptamer. Meanwhile, the PEC sensing platform was used to determine ATZ in environmental samples and a satisfied result was obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aatrazine 3adetection limit 3aelectric current 3airradiation 3alight 3amicrostructure 3ananotubes 3aoligonucleotides 3aphotoelectrodes 0aBiOI nanoflowers 0aTiO2 nanotubes 0aPhotoelectrochemical sensing1 aLiang, Guifang1 aZhang, Caiyun1 aFan, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3996-497X1 aYan, Wenjun1 aGuo, Yujing1 aShuang, Shaomin1 aBi, Yingpu1 aLi, Feng1 aDong, Chuan0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 May 05, v. 409 p.124894-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1248943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245018600163300001600349500001900365500002000384520110600404592002801510596005901538596009401597650001501691650002501706650002701731650002201758650002001780650004301800650001401843650002501857650002101882650001501903700001901918700001601937700001801953700001501971700001901986700001502005700005502020773013102075856007802206852000902284655001202293IND60725501520221119181118.0210126e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072550152DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2020009502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Weihong10aSelective enrichment‐release of trace dibutyl phthalate via molecular‐imprinting based photo‐controlled switching followed by high‐performance liquid chromatography analysis  ap. 513-520.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA novel intelligent photo‐controlled molecularly imprinted polymers were synthesized, based on the magnetic core‐shell structure, with 4‐[(4‐methacryloyloxy) phenylazo] benzenesulfonic acid as the functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethyl acrylate as the cross‐linking agent.

Most GBC related deaths occur due to secondary progression and metastasis to distant organs. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important pre-requisite for tumor metastasis, however its mechanism in GBC has not yet been defined. Using the GBC-SD cell line, we have uncovered an important mediator, poly r(C) binding protein-1 (PCBP1), of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)-induced EMT in GBC. Our results show that TGF-β treatment resulted in PCBP1 phosphorylation in accordance with similar observation in other model systems. We further showed through gain- and loss-of-function assays that PCBP1 expression levels regulate the capacity of GBC-SD cells to migrate and invade in vitro. Finally, our results showed that PCBP1 expression levels also regulate generation of CD44⁺CD24⁻ progenitor cell population in GBC-SD cells after TGF-β treatment. Cumulatively, our results indicate, pending further validation, that PCBP1 might be a prognostic marker for GBC metastasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinoma 3agall bladder 3ametastasis 3aphosphorylation 3astem cells 3atransforming growth factor beta 3aurinary bladder neoplasms1 aDou, Ke-Feng0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 Aug., v. 41, no. 8 p.5519-5524dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3428-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009400168300001600262520172600278592002802004653001402032653001102046653001502057653001402072653002102086700001902107700001902126773016702145856008202312852000902394655001202403IND60517075620221123012640.0190728e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051707562DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154140012102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTyler, Carrie L.14aThe utility of wax replicas as a measure of crab attack frequency in the rocky intertidal  ap. 361-369.  aCrabs are thought to play a vital role in structuring gastropod populations. Studies quantifying the frequencies with which crabs attack gastropods in natural settings are, however, scarce. Although a wide variety of techniques exist with which predator–prey interactions can be investigated (e.g. laboratory experiments, exclusion caging, tethering and population surveys), there is a need for methods that can provide large amounts of quantitative data, particularly documenting the frequency with which crabs attack gastropods. This study examines the utility of using wax replicas of gastropods to determine crab attack frequencies. Replicas of Chlorostoma funebralis, Nucella ostrina and Nucella lamellosa were bolted to mesh screens and deployed in the rocky intertidal. Crabs attacked wax replicas of gastropods, leaving characteristic marks in the wax. In most cases, the appendage used in the attack could be identified from the marks (i.e. chelae vs walking legs). The effectiveness of this technique was verified using surveys of repair scar frequencies of the gastropod populations; patterns in attack frequency, determined from the number of marked wax replicas, were consistent with those of repair frequency, in that both were greater at the wave protected, quiet water locality. This study confirms the value of wax replicas in investigations of crab predation to determine the frequency and type of attack, and illustrates the potential of this method for quantifying predation intensity. The development of techniques that quantify the magnitude and exact nature of the effects of crab predation on intertidal communities is pivotal, given the intensity of commercial fishing of some species of crabs.  aPublisher supplied data 0apredation 0arepair 0aGastropoda 0adurophagy 0apredation traces1 aStafford, E.S.1 aLeighton, L.R.0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2015 Mar., v. 95, no. 2 p.361-369dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154140012103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014400169300001600313520126900329592002801598650001501626650001101641650000901652650001301661650002401674650002201698650001601720650001301736653003201749653002201781653004801803653001901851653002001870653003101890700001501921700001901936700001401955700002301969700002301992700002102015700001902036700002202055700001802077700002202095700002102117700006002138773011202198856008702310852000902397655001202406IND60581721720221119091057.0180830e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058172172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Zhenye10aThin film surface modifications of thin/tunable liquid/gas diffusion layers for high-efficiency proton exchange membrane electrolyzer cells  ap. 983-990.  aA proton exchange membrane electrolyzer cell (PEMEC) is one of the most promising devices for high-efficiency and low-cost energy storage and ultrahigh purity hydrogen production. As one of the critical components in PEMECs, the titanium thin/tunable LGDL (TT-LGDL) with its advantages of small thickness, planar surface, straight-through pores, and well-controlled pore morphologies, achieved superior multifunctional performance for hydrogen and oxygen production from water splitting even at low temperature. Different thin film surface treatments on the novel TT-LGDLs for enhancing the interfacial contacts and PEMEC performance were investigated both in-situ and ex-situ for the first time. Surface modified TT-LGDLs with about 180nm thick Au thin film yielded performance improvement (voltage reduction), from 1.6849V with untreated TT-LGDLs to only 1.6328V with treated TT-LGDLs at 2.0A/cm² and 80°C. Furthermore, the hydrogen/oxygen production rate was increased by about 28.2% at 1.60V and 80°C. The durability test demonstrated that the surface treated TT-LGDL has good stability as well. The gold electroplating surface treatment is a promising method for the PEMEC performance enhancement and titanium material protection even in harsh environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3adurability 3aenergy 3agold 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aoxygen production 3atemperature 3atitanium 0aLiquid/gas diffusion layers 0aSurface treatment 0aProton exchange membrane electrolyzer cells 0aElectroplating 0aWater splitting 0aHydrogen/oxygen production1 aMo, Jingke1 aYang, Gaoqiang1 aLi, Yifan1 aTalley, Derrick A.1 aRetterer, Scott T.1 aCullen, David A.1 aToops, Todd J.1 aBrady, Michael P.1 aBender, Guido1 aPivovar, Bryan S.1 aGreen, Johney B.1 aZhang, Feng-Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2535-09660 tApplied energy.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 206 p.983-990dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03821naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113024003400144040001800178100001600196245009800212300001800310506002800328506005900356520165800415592002802073596007602101596004502177506003702222650001202259650001602271650001702287650002502304650001202329650001702341650003902358650001702397650001302414650000902427650001102436650001502447650001502462650001702477650002202494650001502516650001402531650001802545650000902563650001202572650001102584650002202595650001702617650001802634650002902652650002002681650002502701650002502726650002402751700001902775700001602794700002202810700002402832700001702856773011802873856007702991903002203068852000903090655001203099IND60083361520221207095108.0141101e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008336152DNAL7 a220323572pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-43992doi7 a10.3168/jds.2011-43992chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFagan, C.C.10aPreliminary evaluation of endogenous milk fluorophores as tracer molecules for curd syneresis  ap. 5350-5358.  aResource is Open Access  aAmerican Dairy Science Association License Information  aA front-face fluorescence spectroscopy probe was installed in the wall of a laboratory-scale cheese vat. Excitation and emission filters were chosen for the selective detection of vitamin A, tryptophan, and riboflavin fluorescence. The evolution of the fluorescence of each fluorophore during milk coagulation and syneresis was monitored to determine if they had the potential to act as intrinsic tracers of syneresis and also coagulation. The fluorescence profiles for 2 of the fluorophores during coagulation could be divided into 3 sections relating to enzymatic hydrolysis of κ-casein, aggregation of casein micelles, and crosslinking. A parameter relating to coagulation kinetics was derived from the tryptophan and riboflavin profiles but this was not possible for the vitamin A response. The study also indicated that tryptophan and riboflavin may act as tracer molecules for syneresis, but this was not shown for vitamin A. The evolution of tryptophan and riboflavin fluorescence during syneresis followed a first-order reaction and had strong relationships with curd moisture and whey total solids content (r=0.86–0.96). Simple 1- and 2-parameter models were developed to predict curd moisture content, curd yield, and whey total solids using parameters derived from the sensor profiles (standard error of prediction=0.0005–0.394%; R²=0.963–0.999). The results of this study highlight the potential of tryptophan and riboflavin to act as intrinsic tracer molecules for noninvasive inline monitoring of milk coagulation and curd syneresis. Further work is required to validate these findings under a wider range of processing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  cFood Institutional Research Measuredhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100013206  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acheeses 3acoagulation 3acrosslinking 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afilters 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3akappa-casein 3amicelles 3amilk 3amodels 3amonitoring 3ariboflavin 3atotal solids 3atracer techniques 3atryptophan 3avitamin A 3awater content 3awhey 2aAnimals 2aCheese 2aDairyingxmethods 2aFluorescence 2aFood Handling 2aFood Technologyxmethods 2aMilkxchemistry 2aRiboflavinxanalysis 2aTryptophanxanalysis 2aVitamin Axanalysis1 aFerreira, T.G.1 aPayne, F.A.1 aO’Donnell, C.P.1 aO’Callaghan, D.J.1 aCastillo, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Nov., v. 94, no. 11 p.5350-5358dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl40712x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-43993Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002000176245012800196300001500324520146200339592002801801650002401829650001301853650002201866650001301888650002201901650001101923650001201934650004401946650001001990650001202000650001302012650002402025650000802049650001202057700002102069700002102090773015202111856007002263856009802333990002302431852000902454655001202463IND60608461220221119031641.0190510e20161128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060846122DNAL7 a10.3791/544982doi7 aPMC52263162pmcid7 a279294602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinder, Mareike14aThe synthesis of [sn10(si(sime3)3)4]2- using a metastable sn(i) halide solution synthesized via a co-condensation technique  ap. e54498.  aThe number of well-characterized metalloid tin clusters, synthesized by applying the disproportionation of a metastable Sn(I) halide in the presence of a sterically demanding ligand, has increased in recent years. The metastable Sn(I) halide is synthesized at "outer space conditions" via the preparative co-condensation technique. Thereby, the subhalide is synthesized in an oven at high temperatures, around 1,300 °C, and at reduced pressure by the reaction of elemental tin with hydrogen halide gas (e.g., HCl). The subhalide (e.g., SnCl) is trapped within a matrix of an inert solvent, like toluene at -196 °C. Heating the solid matrix to -78 °C gives a metastable solution of the subhalide. The metastable subhalide solution is highly reactive but can be stored at -78 °C for several weeks. On heating the solution to room temperature, a disproportionation reaction occurs, leading to elemental tin and the corresponding dihalide. By applying bulky ligands like Si(SiMe3)3, the intermediate metalloid cluster compounds can be trapped before complete disproportionation to elemental tin. Hence, the reaction of a metastable Sn(I)Cl solution with Li-Si(SiMe3)3 gives [Sn10(Si(SiMe3)3)4]2- 1 as black crystals in high yield. 1 is formed via a complex reaction sequence including salt metathesis, disproportionation, and degradation of larger clusters. Further, 1 can be analyzed by various methods like NMR or single crystal X-ray structure analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3achlorine 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3ahydrochloric acid 3aiodine 3aligands 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aovens 3asilicon 3asolvents 3astorage temperature 3atin 3atoluene1 aSchrenk, Claudio1 aSchnepf, Andreas0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Nov. 28, , no. 117 p.e54498-e54498dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/544983Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54498/the-synthesis-sn10-si-sime3-3-42-using-metastable-sn-i-halide  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015900166520105900325592002801384650001701412650001701429650002201446650001701468650001901485650001901504650001801523650001601541650002901557650001501586650001901601650002001620650002301640650003401663650002301697653004601720653001801766653001701784700001501801700001901816700001701835700001501852773011201867856008501979852000902064655001202073IND60704806420221117230316.0200831e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070480642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1184962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yanyi10aEffect of aminophend/formaldehyde resin polymeric nanospheres as nanofiller on polyamide thin film nanocomposite membranes for reverse osmosis application  aAminophend/formaldehyde resin polymeric nanospheres (APFNSs) synthesized by the sol-gel method with monomers of 3-aminophenol and formaldehyde were used as nanofillers incorporated into polyamide (PA) layers to fabricate thin-film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes via interfacial polymerization of trimesoyl chloride (TMC) and m-phenylenediamine (MPD). Due to the monomer of 3-aminophenol, the APFNSs are rich in hydroxyl and amino groups. Therefore, the APFNSs nanoparticles have good hydrophilicity and can react with TMC, resulting in chemically bonded to polyamide matrix of TFN membrane. The water flux of TFN-As membrane modified by APFNSs nanoparticles is 71.3 L/m²·h nearly twice of the pristine TFC membrane, and the salt rejection all keeps over 96%. TFN-As membranes also exhibit excellent anti-chlorine, anti-fouling and reuse performances. This work demonstrates that aminophend/formaldehyde resin polymeric nanospheres (APFNSs) can be used as a promising nanofiller for developing novel TFN membranes with improved desalination performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaminophenols 3adesalination 3afilms (materials) 3aformaldehyde 3ahydrophilicity 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ananospheres 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apolyamides 3apolymerization 3areverse osmosis 3asol-gel processing 3athin film composite membranes 3atrimesoyl chloride 0aAminophend/formaldehyde resin nanospheres 0aAnti-chlorine 0aAnti-fouling1 aZhang, Han1 aSong, Chenghao1 aGao, Congjie1 aZhu, Guiru0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 614 p.118496-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1184963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245008700212300001600299506007600315520102200391536017001413592002801583596004101611506003701652650002001689650001701709650001601726650002001742650001201762650001001774650001201784650001201796650002601808650001701834650001101851650002401862650001801886650003101904650002001935650002201955650001601977653000901993653002502002653001702027653001302044653001702057653001202074653001102086653001602097700002502113773014602138856008502284852000902369655001202378IND60636179320221207104630.0190404e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063617932DNAL7 a10.1080/21551197.2018.15647212doi7 aPMC64803562pmcid7 a307940992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Bryan C.10aWeight Loss-Induced Reduction of Bone Mineral Density in Older Adults with Obesity  ap. 100-114.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aObesity in older adults is a growing public health problem, yet the appropriate treatment remains controversial partly due to evidence that weight loss reduces bone mass and may increase fracture risk. The purpose of this review is to summarize the research to date on the effects of diet-induced weight loss on bone health in obese (body mass index 30 kg/m² and above) older (aged 65 years or older) adults. Observational studies have shown that weight loss in this population decreases total hip bone mineral density and increases the risk of frailty fractures (composite of proximal femur, pelvis, and proximal humerus fractures). Randomized controlled trials have largely confirmed these earlier observations but have also shown that exercise, particularly progressive resistance training, can attenuate or even alleviate this bone loss. Further research incorporating outcomes concerning bone quality and mass are needed to identify the optimal exercise and nutritional regimens to counteract the bone loss.  aThis work was supported by the following grants: CX000906, DK109950A, AG031176, and 1-14-LLYQ2 as well as with resources at the Michael E.

Due to the high transmission/mortality rates and socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19, its control is crucial. In the absence of specific treatment, vaccines represent the most efficient way to control and stop the pandemic. Many companies around the world are currently making efforts to develop the vaccine to combat COVID-19. This review outlines key strategies for generating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, along with the mechanism of action, advantages, and potential limitations of each vaccine. The use of nanomaterials and nanotechnology for COVID-19 vaccines development will also be discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3amechanism of action 3amolecular biology 3amortality 3apandemic 3apublic health 3avaccine development 3avaccines1 aDanesh Pouya, Fahima1 aNiknam, Zahra1 aAbdollahpour‑Alitappeh, Meghdad1 aRezaei-Tavirani, Mostafa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1767-74751 aRasmi, Yousef0 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.4943-4957dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07132-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002700176245012700203300001500330520168800345592002802033650002602061650001302087650004402100650002402144650001902168700002202187700002002209700002302229773015202252856007002404856010402474990002302578852000902601655001202610IND60608461320221119031541.0190510e20161112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060846132DNAL7 a10.3791/544992doi7 aPMC52262242pmcid7 a279113612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuirós, María Teresa10aSpin saturation transfer difference nmr (sstd nmr): a new tool to obtain kinetic parameters of chemical exchange processes  ap. e54499.  aThis detailed protocol describes the new Spin Saturation Transfer Difference Nuclear Magnetic Resonance protocol (SSTD NMR), recently developed in our group to study processes of mutual-site chemical exchange that are difficult to analyze by traditional methods. As the name suggests, this method combines the Spin Saturation Transfer method used for small molecules, with the Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR method employed for the study of protein-ligand interactions, by measuring transient spin saturation transfer along increasing saturation times (build-up curves) in small organic and organometallic molecules undergoing chemical exchange. Advantages of this method over existing ones are: there is no need to reach coalescence of the exchanging signals; the method can be applied as long as one signal of the exchanging sites is isolated; there is no need to measure T1 or reach steady state saturation; rate constant values are measured directly, and T1 values are obtained in the same experiment, using only one set of experiments. To test the method, we have studied the dynamics of the hindered rotation of N,N-dimethylamides, for which much data is available for comparison. The thermodynamic parameters obtained using SSTD are very similar to the reported ones (spin-saturation transfer techniques and line-shape analysis). The method can be applied to more challenging substrates that cannot be studied by previous methods. We envisage that the simple experimental set up and the wide applicability of the method to a great variety of substrates will make this a common technique amongst organic and organometallic chemists without extensive expertise in NMR.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical interactions 3akinetics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3areaction mechanisms 3athermodynamics1 aMacDonald, Colin,1 aAngulo, Jesús,1 aMuñoz, María Paz0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Nov. 12, , no. 117 p.e54499-e54499dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/544993Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54499/spin-saturation-transfer-difference-nmr-sstd-nmr-new-tool-to-obtain  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011800166300001800284520145700302592002801759596006501787650001301852650002001865650002601885650001301911650001901924650001901943650002101962650001301983650001701996650001502013650002002028650002202048650002902070650001702099700002502116700006302141773012402204856008302328852000902411655001202420IND60782383220221121104439.0220822e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078238322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-022-07290-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohit, Kumar,10aDraft genome of Serratia sp. R1 gives an insight into the antibiotic resistant genes against multiple antibiotics  ap. 4479-4484.  aBACKGROUND: Serratia is a pathogenic bacterium, commonly associated with neonatal intensive care units, and harbors antibiotic-resistant genes against multiple antibiotics e.g., resistance against penams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, cephalosporins, and macrolides. In the long-term contaminated habitat, the bacterial communities carry both antibiotic and metal resistance genes. This draft genome sequencing aimed to explore the alarming level of ARGs in the environment, additionally heavy metal-resistant genes were also explored in the draft genome. METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing was used to investigate ARGs in Serratia sp. R1. The bacteria were sequenced using Illumina Nova seq sequencer and subjected to genome annotation. The bacterial genome was explored for antibiotic- and metal-resistant genes. RESULTS: Sequencing resulted in 8.4 Mb genome and a total of 4411 functional genes were characterized in the draft genome. Genes resistant to Beta-lactams, cephalosporins, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and tetracycline are present in the draft genome. Multiple metal-resistant genes are also present in the sequenced genome. CONCLUSION: The genes and proteins providing heavy metal and antibiotic resistance may be used in the bioremediation of environmental antibiotic residues to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance. The current study can help us to adopt suitable mitigation measures against the multidrug-resistant Serratia.  aPublisher supplied data  aNASF/CA-6030/2017-18cIndian Agricultural Research Institute 3aSerratia 3aaminoglycosides 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3acephalosporins 3afluoroquinolones 3ahabitats 3aheavy metals 3amacrolides 3ametal tolerance 3amolecular biology 3amultiple drug resistance 3atetracycline1 aSodhi, Kushneet Kaur1 aSingh, Dileep Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8686-98550 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.4479-4484dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07290-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245016700168300001800335520222700353592002802580650001702608650001702625650001302642650002102655650002402676650002602700650001602726651001302742700002202755700002702777700002102804773014302825856008302968852000903051655001203060IND60648543120221118183347.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064854312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.5532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGideon, Savanah10aP177 Military Dining Facility Staff Perspectives on the Implementation Barriers and Facilitators of Go for Green 2.0, a Department of Defense Nutrition Initiative  ap. S112-S113.  aIn an effort to optimize performance, readiness, and health of military service members, the Department of Defense (DoD) created a performance nutrition initiative, Go for Green (G4G). Challenges led to program revision and development of G4G 2.0, however successful implementation has yet to be accomplished.The purpose of this study was to improve the G4G 2.0 program framework by informing and developing best practices through explication of dining facility (DFAC) staff perspectives.Focus groups were conducted in two phases (May 2017 to February 2018) with supervisors and staff of Wolf DFAC, at Fort Carson, Colorado prior to G4G 2.0 implementation. Participants were recruited by purposive sampling (n = 89). Focus groups were audio recorded to capture all verbal responses, transcribed verbatim, and lasted an average of 31 minutes (range 24 to 58 minutes).Focus group transcripts of DFAC staff perspectives were reviewed via qualitative content analysis using an exploratory, inductive approach to elucidate emergent themes from the data.DFAC staff perspectives of barriers to G4G implementation included lack of, or ineffective training, inconsistent preparation of food items, fidelity issues, staff perceptions of patron preferences, lack of patron familiarity to new G4G food items and lack of buy-in. Implementation facilitators included training, G4G team site visits, and patron exposure to G4G menu items. Staff suggestions for G4G implementation and program improvement included training on preparation methods, having a flexible implementation timeline, up front provision of all G4G materials, for the G4G team to conduct a needs assessment, and G4G and nutrition education and awareness outside the DFAC.Results demonstrated that barriers to G4G 2.0 implementation outweighed facilitators, and supported the idea that there may be more viable, less time and work-intensive methods to promote healthier food selection by patrons. Incorporating methods to improve patron selection of healthful items in DFACs could play an instrumental role in improving Service Member health, thereby enhancing readiness to meet mission requirements.United States Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3afocus groups 3afood choices 3amedicine 3aneeds assessment 3anutrition education 3aresearch institutions 3asupervisors 3aColorado1 aBustillos, Brenda1 aArmstrong, Nicholes J.1 aCole, Renèe S.,0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S112-S113dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.5533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245007300161520153200234592002801766650002001794650002201814650002501836650000901861650001101870650002601881650001601907650001501923700002401938773012001962856007302082852000902155655001202164IND60744121720221122223304.0210709e20210628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074412172DNAL7 a10.3390/w131317872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShevade, Leena J.10aForensic Investigation of Four Monitored Green Infrastructure Inlets  aGreen infrastructure (GI) is viewed as a sustainable approach to stormwater management that is being rapidly implemented, outpacing the ability of researchers to compare the effectiveness of alternate design configurations. This paper investigated inflow data collected at four GI inlets. The performance of these four GI inlets, all of which were engineered with the same inlet lengths and shapes, was evaluated through field monitoring. A forensic interpretation of the observed inlet performance was conducted using conclusions regarding the role of inlet clogging and inflow rate as described in the previously published work. The mean inlet efficiency (meanPE), which represents the percentage of tributary area runoff that enters the inlet was 65% for the Nashville inlet, while at Happyland the NW inlet averaged 30%, the SW inlet 25%, and the SE inlet 10%, considering all recorded events during the monitoring periods. The analysis suggests that inlet clogging was the main reason for lower inlet efficiency at the SW and NW inlets, while for the SE inlet, performance was compromised by a reverse cross slope of the street. Spatial variability of rainfall, measurement uncertainty, uncertain tributary catchment area, and inlet depression characteristics are also correlated with inlet PE. The research suggests that placement of monitoring sensors should consider low flow conditions and a strategy to measure them. Additional research on the role of various maintenance protocols in inlet hydraulics is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluid mechanics 3aforensic sciences 3agreen infrastructure 3arain 3arunoff 3astormwater management 3auncertainty 3awatersheds1 aMontalto, Franco A.0 tWater.g2021 June 28, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131317873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01194naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245005300166300001600219520026600235592002800501650001400529650001400543650001600557650004400573700002200617700002200639700002100661773011800682856008300800852000900883655001200892IND60698297720221117012632.0220225e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069829772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-020-03065-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBobaev, I.

As African catfish cannot be stripped for semen as in most other fish species; they have to be killed to obtain semen from the testes. This method could be used to ensure that males used to obtain sperm are sexually mature to increase the concentration and quality of mature sperm for egg fertilization in the production of C. gariepinus. Morphological features including the length and width of the urogenital papillae (UGP), an external secondary sexual characteristic of C. gariepinus (n = 89) were measured and calculated as a percentage of total body length. The urogenital papillae length (LUGP) and width (WUGP) index of each fish were used and compared with the macroscopic and microscopic maturity stage of the testes. The results revealed that although positive, a significant correlation does not exist between the LUGP or WUGP and maturity stage of the testes. Therefore, although this procedure would be valuable as an initial non‐invasive assessment of maturity, it does not provide an accurate or reliable indication of the maturity stage of the fish.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Research Foundation of South Africa  a86056cIncentive Funding for Rated Researchers  a88875cScarce Skills Bursary Fund 3aClarias gariepinus 3abody length 3acatfish 3aeggs 3amales 3amaturity stage 3asemen 3asexual maturity 3aspermatozoa 3atestes1 aCoetzee, Helene1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9302-396X1 aBarnhoorn, Irene1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6635-304X1 aWagenaar, Ina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5852-19070 tAquaculture research.g2019 Dec., v. 50, no. 12 p.3519-3527dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.142833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245011900162300001600281520195600297592002802253650001502281650002202296650001302318650001502331650001302346650002202359650001902381650003002400650001502430650000902445650001302454650000902467700001502476773012702491856007802618852000902696655001202705IND60764729920221121055408.0220409e20200921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076472992DNAL7 a10.17221/118/2019-swr2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jinquan10aSponge effect of aerated concrete on phosphorus adsorption-desorption from agricultural drainage water in rainfall  ap. 220-227.  aIn the initial stage of the rainfall, the nutrient element phosphorus (P) in the farmland, one of the most important factors causing agricultural non-point source pollution, flows into agriculture drainage ditches rapidly, and an instantaneous phosphorus peak value in the ditch water often occurs. Aerated concrete with high P adsorption properties was chosen as the experiment material in the laboratory to reduce the instantaneous P peak value in the drainage water in the initial stage of the rainfall. The three total P (TP) concentrations of the simulated drainage water (1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mg/L) stood for three treatments were designed in the adsorption experiment; the same three TP concentrations of the simulated drainage water and the three TP concentrations of the simulated natural water (0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mg/L) stood for nine treatments in the desorption experiment. The sponge effect of the aerated concrete on the P adsorption-desorption was explored by studying the dynamics of the P adsorption-desorption of the aerated concrete with an increase in the experiment’s time. The results showed the following details: (1) Both the adsorption rate and desorption rate of the aerated concrete decrease with an increase in the experiment’s time. The initial adsorption is dominant during the entire adsorption, as with the initial desorption during the entire desorption. (2) The adsorption capacity of the aerated concrete slightly decreases with the increase in the re-adsorption, whereas the desorption capacity of the aerated concrete significantly decreases with the increase in the re-desorption. Thus, the aerated concrete can be introduced into the agricultural drainage ditch to reduce the instantaneous P peak value in the drainage water in the initial stage of the rainfall, and potential further studies should explore the relationship between the different drainage water loads and the amount of the aerated concrete.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aagricultural land 3aconcrete 3adesorption 3adrainage 3adrainage channels 3adrainage water 3anonpoint source pollution 3aphosphorus 3arain 3aresearch 3asoil1 aFu, Weiguo0 tSoil and Water Research.g, v. 15, no. 4 p.220-227dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21421x1801-53957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/118/2019-swr3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245013200184300001600316520168400332592002802016650001502044650001802059650002002077650000902097650002002106650001202126650002002138650002302158650001302181650003302194650002802227650002602255650002202281650004502303650000902348650001902357651001202376653001302388653001902401653001202420653001502432653002002447700002202467700001902489700002102508700002602529700002002555773010502575856005102680852000902731655001202740IND50087623620221120122832.0140412e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008762362DNAL7 a10.1080/21501203.2011.5921552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakkali Yakhlef, Salah Eddine10aIntraspecific variability of Pisolithus spp. as a response to changes in soil characteristics in a Moroccan cork oak plantation  ap. 283-290.  aSoil characteristics may be an important factor in structuring fungal communities. We relate the above- and below-ground distribution of the ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) Pisolithus spp. to changes in soil chemistry in a Quercus suber plantation located in the Maâmora forest (Morocco). Intrageneric variability of 115 fruit bodies was studied, using morphological characterization, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing. Two Pisolithus spp. genotypes were identified: 97% of the fruit bodies represent Pisolithus arhizus; the remaining 3% correspond to Pisolithus species 4, as previously described by Martin et al. [New Phytologist 153 (2002) 345-357]. Multivariate analysis (PCA) showed that species structure was strongly correlated with soil characteristics. P.arhizus fruit bodies were frequently found in the Eastern part of the plot at low molasic clay, N and P contents, while Pisolithus species 4 were collected only in the Western part at the high molasic clay, N and P contents. To determine whether this change in fruit body structure was expressed at the belowground level, we used morphological and molecular techniques to characterize the Pisolithus ectomycorrhizas. Only ectomycorrhizas of P. arhizus were identified at the low P–N–molasic clay site and disappeared completely at the high P–N–red clay site, where no Pisolithus species 4 mycorrhizas were found. However, autocorrelation among soil parameters makes it difficult to isolate the effects of individual parameters. These results show the local-scale impact of natural spatial heterogeneity on an ectomycorrhizal fungal genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisolithus 3aQuercus suber 3aautocorrelation 3aclay 3aectomycorrhizae 3aforests 3afruiting bodies 3afungal communities 3agenotype 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aintraspecific variation 3amultivariate analysis 3amycorrhizal fungi 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asoil 3asoil chemistry 3aMorocco 0acork oak 0aITS sequencing 0aMorocco 0aPisolithus 0asoil parameters1 aAbourouh, Mohamed1 aDucousso, Marc1 aDuponnois, Robin1 aDelaruelle, Christine1 aMousain, Daniel0 tMycology.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 2, no. 4 p.283-290dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000125x2150-12037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21501203.2011.592155  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001100135245008700146300001500233500001900248520114700267592002801414650002701442650001201469650001701481650001301498650002101511700002301532773015101555856006901706856009201775852000901867655001201876IND60737073320221119131714.0210514e20200523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073707332DNAL7 a10.3791/612432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Li10aProtein extract preparation and co-immunoprecipitation from Caenorhabditis elegans  ap. e61243.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCo-immunoprecipitation methods are frequently used to study protein-protein interactions. Confirmation of hypothesized protein-protein interactions or identification of new ones can provide invaluable information about the function of a protein of interest. Some of the traditional methods for extract preparation frequently require labor-intensive and time-consuming techniques. Here, a modified extract preparation protocol using a bead mill homogenizer and metal beads is described as a rapid alternative to traditional protein preparation methods. This extract preparation method is compatible with downstream co-immunoprecipitation studies. As an example, the method was used to successfully co-immunoprecipitate C. elegans microRNA Argonaute ALG-1 and two known ALG-1 interactors: AIN-1, and HRPK-1. This protocol includes descriptions of animal sample collection, extract preparation, extract clarification, and protein immunoprecipitation. The described protocol can be adapted to test for interactions between any two or more endogenous, endogenously tagged, or overexpressed C. elegans proteins in a variety of genetic backgrounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aanimals 3ahomogenizers 3amicroRNA 3aprecipitin tests1 aZinovyeva, Anna Y.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2020 May 23, , no. 159 p.e61243-e61243dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/612433Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/61243/protein-extract-preparation-co-immunoprecipitation-from  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014100167520116400308592002801472650001601500650001901516650001101535650001201546650001601558650002501574650001401599650001501613650002101628650001001649651001001659653001701669653001701686653001701703653002001720653002801740653001801768700001301786773012601799856008301925852000902008655001202017IND60776013520221118084733.0220531e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077601352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2022.1079932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Zhiming10aResponse of soil fungal species, phylogenetic and functional diversity to diurnal asymmetric warming in an alpine agricultural ecosystem  aA diurnal asymmetric warming (CK: control; DW: daytime warming; NW: nighttime warming; DW+NW: daily warming) was conducted in an alpine agricultural system of the Tibet to investigate the effect of diurnal asymmetric warming on soil fungal diversity. Soil fungal community in May and August in 2017 was determined by the high-throughput sequencing. The 'NW' rather than the 'DW' and 'DW+NW' significantly increased the abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE), Chao1 and species richness at the 0–10 cm but not the 10–20 cm depth in May and August, 2017. However, the 'DW', 'NW' and 'DW+NW' did not significantly affect phylogenetic and functional α-diversity, species, phylogenic and functional composition. The straw yield of highland barley was correlated with soil fungal diversity. Therefore, daytime and nighttime warming may have different effects on soil fungal diversity, and their effects are not additive. Different dimensions diversity of soil fungal community may have different responses to climate warming. Diurnal asymmetrical warming should be considered in future agricultural managements in alpine regions under asymmetrical warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aagroecosystems 3abarley 3aclimate 3aenvironment 3afunctional diversity 3aphylogeny 3asoil fungi 3aspecies richness 3astraw 3aChina 0aBiodiversity 0aα-diversity 0aβ-diversity 0aHighland barley 0aTemperature sensitivity 0aSoil microbes1 aFu, Gang0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 335 p.107993-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.1079933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245007500164300001400239500001500253520125800268592002801526650001201554650001201566650001501578650001501593650001101608650001401619650001101633650001001644650001201654650000701666650002001673650002701693653001401720700001801734700001701752700002101769700001401790700001901804700001901823700001401842700001701856773008701873856004801960852000902008655001202017IND4445530420221121050559.0120727e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444553042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-010-0461-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGleason, F.

Rhizophlyctis rosea AUS 13 is capable of the digestion of crystalline cellulose in the form of lens paper, filter paper and powdered filter paper and grows well with noncrystaline carboxymethyl cellulose or cellobiose, but cannot use starch or maltose as sole carbon sources in liquid and on solid media. None of the other sixteen isolates tested can digest crystalline cellulose, but all grow well on starch and maltose and several can also use cellobiose and/or sucrose as a sole carbon source. Four of the other sixteen isolates could also digest carboxymethyl cellulose slowly. Glucose is an excellent sole source of carbon in synthetic media for all seventeen isolates in the present study. In general, these data suggest variability in the ability of zoosporic true fungi to use carbohydrates other than glucose as sole sources of carbon. Four patterns of carbohydrate utilization emerged from this study of seventeen isolates. R. rosea degrades cellulose over a relatively wide pH range which suggests that the cellulase enzymes are stable over a wide pH range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglucose 3asucrose 3acellulases 3acellobiose 3astarch 3adigestion 3acarbon 3afungi 3amaltose 3apH 3aChytridiomycota 3acarboxymethylcellulose 0acellulose1 aMarano, A.

In this work, the simultaneous centralized control of elemental mercury emission and deep desulfurization from the flue gas using magnetic Mn–Fe spinel was developed as a co-benefit of the WESP. Mn–Fe spinel showed an excellent ability for the simultaneous capture of SO2 and Hg⁰ at the temperature window of the WESP (i.e. 50–100°C). Its excellent magnetization ensured that it can be easily separated from the mixture with ultrafine particulates in the WESP for the centralized control of Hg pollution. However, Mn–Fe spinel after Hg⁰ capture had a serious biological toxicity due to the formation of water soluble HgSO4. Therefore, Mn–Fe spinel after Hg⁰ capture was regenerated by the washing of a NaClO solution and the adsorbed Hg on Mn–Fe spinel was then collected as a high concentration of Hg²⁺ for the safe disposition. Meanwhile, the centralized control of Hg⁰ emission by Mn–Fe spinel was cost-effective because Mn–Fe spinel after the regeneration can be used to capture Hg⁰ and SO2 for the next cycle with no degradation of the adsorption ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acost effectiveness 3aflue gas 3aflue gas desulfurization 3agypsum 3amercury 3aparticulates 3apollution 3asodium hypochlorite 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3awashing 0aMn–Fe spinel 0aHg0 emission 0aWet electrostatic precipitator 0aBiological toxicity 0aRegeneration1 aLiao, Yong1 aNg, Tsz Wai1 aHuang, Guocheng1 aXiong, Shangchao1 aXiao Xin,1 aYang, Shijian1 aWong, Po-Keung,0 tFuel processing technology.g2016 Feb., v. 142 p.345-351dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.10.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245012600159300001600285520177200301592002802073650001102101650001402112650001402126650001002140650001202150650001702162650002502179650001102204651001102215651001402226653001402240653002202254653001202276653001602288653001402304653001402318700002502332700002002357700002302377700001902400773009902419856003802518852000902556655001202565IND50070302020221119073419.0131101s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007030202DNAL7 a10.1071/BT131492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Joseph T.10aComparative dating of Acacia: combining fossils and multiple phylogenies to infer ages of clades with poor fossil records  ap. 436-445.  aThe ubiquitous and highly diverse element Australian Acacia makes an ideal candidate for investigating a range of questions about the evolution of the flora of continental Australia. In the past, such efforts have been hampered by a lack of well-supported phylogenies and by the relatively poor macrofossil record, which probably reflects the depositional environment in which Acacia species are predominantly found. However, the broader subfamily Mimosoideae offers several reliably age-constrained fossils that can be used as calibrations in divergence-dating analyses of DNA sequence data. In addition, the microfossil pollen record of Acacia is relatively rich and provides a good age constraint for the entire Acacia clade. By using multiple reliable fossil constraints, we applied a combination of primary calibration points to produce a comprehensive study of divergence dates in Acacia s.s. and related mimosoid legumes. Previous dating studies included very limited samples of the diversity of Australian Acacia and experienced difficulties in identifying appropriate age calibrations for the lineage, leading to considerable variation in their results. We used novel calibration schemes and multiple nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequence markers to produce the first estimates of divergence dates for major lineages within the Australian Acacia s.s. clade and for related lineages across the Mimosoideae subfamily. We estimate average crown divergence dates for Vachellia at 13–17Ma, Senegalia at 31.0–33.4Ma and Acacia s.s. at 21.0–23.9Ma. The timing of radiations within these lineages is consistent with the hypothesis that Miocene aridification in Africa, the Americas and Australia was a driver for the diversificationss of lineages in Acacia s.l.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aVachellia 3aevolution 3aflora 3alegumes 3amicrofossils 3anucleotide sequences 3apollen 3aAfrica 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0adivergence dating 0alegumes 0aMimosoideae 0aSenegalia 0aVachellia1 aMurphy, D.q(Daniel)1 aHo, Simon Y.

We determined the influences of early life ceftriaxone and WGP treatment on intestinal microbiota and immunity both in newborn and adulthood mice. The results showed that ceftriaxone significantly altered the intestinal microbiota, short-chain fatty acids’ (SCFAs) metabolism, organ index, and serum OVA-specific IgE levels in newborn mice. Comparing adulthood mice to ceftriaxone-treated mice, the diversity and composition of intestinal microbiota were significantly improved after WGP treatment. In addition, the levels of OVA-specific IgE in the WGP-treated mice were significantly decreased, and the expression of cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) were obviously increased. Therefore, we speculate that the mechanism of action of the indigestible carbohydrate fibers of WGPs is through maintaining immune homeostasis in newborns, which may partly last into adulthood. More importantly, this may be closely related to alterations in the intestinal microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulthood 3ablood serum 3aceftriaxone 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3amice 3aneonates 3apolysaccharides 3ashort chain fatty acids 3awheat germ1 aLi, Wen1 aLiu, Yanan1 aWu, Tao1 aZhang, Min0 tFood & function.g2020 Nov. 18, v. 11, no. 11 p.9662-9674dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo02031a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245014700184300001600331520088400347592002801231650002201259650001401281650001601295650001201311650001301323650001301336650002101349650001701370650001201387650002101399650004101420650002701461650002901488650002401517650002501541650002501566650000901591650002501600650002501625650002601650650002601676650004101702700001701743700001901760773013001779856004801909852000901957655001201966IND50068638220221120175946.0130817e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006863822DNAL7 a238776252pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-013-1061-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Wenting10aAssessment of In Vivo Estrogenic Response and Identification of Environmental Estrogens in Influent and Effluent from a Sewage Treatment Plant  ap. 324-329.  aThe in vivo estrogenic response and estrogenic contents of the influent and effluent collected from a sewage treatment plant located in Jiaozuo were assessed.

This method enables enhancement of metabolic activity and an optimized bacterial community structure of microbes under the conditions of low C/N ratio and temperature. The control reactor was operated at a constant temperature of 20 °C, and the plug-flow microaerobic sludge blanket was subjected to a high temperature shock treatment with three cycles for 94 d. Starting with the initial temperature of 20 °C, after three cycles at temperature (30 °C) shock, the removal efficiencies of ammonium and total nitrogen at the terminal period increased to 68.0% and 54.7% from 51.1% to 35.6%, respectively. The activity and relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria, nitrite oxidizing bacteria, and anammox bacteria, dominated by Candidatus Brocadia at low temperature, were accordingly enhanced after periodic temperature shocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aammonium 3abacterial communities 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acommunity structure 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3asludge 3atemperature 3atotal nitrogen 0aPeriodic temperature shock 0aLow temperature 0aNitrogen removal 0aMicrobial community structure 0aLow C/N ratio1 aZhao, Bowei1 aZhang, Xiao1 aXie, Fei1 aCui, Ying1 aLi, Hui1 aYue, Xiuping0 tChemosphere.g2020 Feb., v. 241 p.124934-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1249343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01805naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245006300180300001600243500000900259520071700268592002800985650002501013650002101038650001701059650001301076650001601089650001501105650001101120650001401131650000901145650001801154700001801172773014801190856009601338852000901434655001201443IND60668172220221119181356.0191125e196407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066817222DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1964.03615995002800040025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobson, Ann L.10aRespiration Studies on Soil Treated with Some Hydrocarbons  ap. 536-539.  aepub  aRespiration studies, as measured by the uptake of O₂, were made upon oil-free and oil-impregnated soils.

Ethnicity and nutritional habits may affect responses to nutritional ergogenic aids. We examined the effects of NZBC extract on cardiovascular, metabolic, and physiological responses during seated rest and moderate-intensity exercise in Southeast Asian men. Seventeen healthy Thai men (age: 22 &plusmn; 3 years; body mass index (BMI): 21.8 &plusmn; 1.1 kg&middot;m&minus;2) participated. Resting metabolic equivalent (1-MET) was measured (Oxycon&trade; mobile, Germany), and an incremental walking protocol was completed to establish the relationship between walking speed and MET. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design, cardiovascular (Physioflow, n = 12) and physiological responses (Oxycon, n = 17) were measured during both seated rest and a 30-min treadmill walk at five metabolic equivalent (5-MET), with either a seven-day intake of placebo (PL) or two capsules of NZBC extract (each 300 mg capsule contains 35% blackcurrant extract) with a 14-day washout. Paired t-tests were used with significance accepted at p < 0.05 and a trend for 0.05 > p &le; 0.10. During 30 min of treadmill walking at 5-MET, no differences were observed for heart rate and substrate oxidation. With intake of NZBC during treadmill walking, there was a trend for increased stroke volume by 12% (PL: 83.2 &plusmn; 25.1; NZBC: 93.0 &plusmn; 24.3 mL; p = 0.072) and cardiac output increased by 12% (PL: 9.2 &plusmn; 2.6; NZBC: 10.3 &plusmn; 2.8 L&middot;min&minus;1; p = 0.057). Systemic vascular resistance decreased by 10% (PL: 779 &plusmn; 267; NZBC: 697 &plusmn; 245 dyn&middot;s&middot;cm&minus;5; p = 0.048). NZBC extract had no effect on metabolic, physiological, and cardiovascular parameters during seated rest and exercise-induced fat oxidation in Thai men, in contrast to observations in Caucasian men. During treadmill walking, Thai men showed cardiovascular response, indicating vasodilatory effects during moderate-intensity exercise with the intake of NZBC extract. Our findings suggest that the ergogenic responses to anthocyanin intake from New Zealand blackcurrant may be ethnicity-dependent.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aThai people 3aWhites 3aanthocyanins 3abiochemical pathways 3ablack currants 3abody mass index 3acardiac output 3across-over studies 3aergogenic aids 3aexercise 3afruit extracts 3aheart rate 3alipid metabolism 3amen 3aoxidation 3aphysiological response 3aplacebos 3at-test 3avasodilator agents 3awalking 3aGermany 3aNew Zealand1 aParktin, Nisakorn1 aWidjaja, Waree1 aAjjimaporn, Amornpan0 tNutrients.g2018 Nov. 12, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu101117323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014400169300001800313520147300331592002801804650001901832650001901851650002001870650002001890650001601910650001601926650001101942650001001953650001901963650002201982650002902004650002102033650001502054650001202069650002502081650001802106650002602124650001902150650001002169651000902179700003302188700002402221773014602245856008102391852000902472655001202481IND60519354920221123044430.0160427e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051935492DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-5964-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousefi, Mohammad10aComparison greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global warming potential (GWP) effect of energy use in different wheat agroecosystems in Iran  ap. 7390-7397.  aThe aims of this study were to determine energy requirement and global warming potential (GWP) in low and high input wheat production systems in western of Iran. For this purpose, data were collected from 120 wheat farms applying questionnaires via face-to-face interviews. Results showed that total energy input and output were 60,000 and 180,000 MJ ha⁻¹ in high input systems and 14,000 and 56,000 MJ ha⁻¹ in low input wheat production systems, respectively. The highest share of total input energy in high input systems recorded for electricity power, N fertilizer, and diesel fuel with 36, 18, and 13 %, respectively, while the highest share of input energy in low input systems observed for N fertilizer, diesel fuel, and seed with 32, 31, and 27 %. Energy use efficiency in high input systems (3.03) was lower than of low input systems (3.94). Total CO₂, N₂O, and CH₄ emissions in high input systems were 1981.25, 31.18, and 1.87 kg ha⁻¹, respectively. These amounts were 699.88, 0.02, and 0.96 kg ha⁻¹ in low input systems. In high input wheat production systems, total GWP was 11686.63 kg CO₂eq ha⁻¹ wheat. This amount was 725.89 kg CO₂eq ha⁻¹ in low input systems. The results show that 1 ha of high input system will produce greenhouse effect 17 times of low input systems. So, high input production systems need to have an efficient and sustainable management for reducing environmental crises such as change climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3acarbon dioxide 3acrop production 3adata collection 3adiesel fuel 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3afarms 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse effect 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ainterviews 3amethane 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3aproduction technology 3aquestionnaires 3awheat 3aIran1 aMahdavi Damghani, Abdolmajid1 aKhoramivafa, Mahmud0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Apr., v. 23, no. 8 p.7390-7397dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5964-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001800158245008200176300001600258520121600274592002801490650001801518650002101536650002201557650002401579650001001603650001801613650002701631650001401658650002001672650001201692700001601704700001601720700001701736700001701753700001401770700001401784773011701798856007301915852000901988655001201997IND60114212320221120035345.0141112e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011421232DNAL7 a253878642pmid7 a10.1111/mve.120452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDE FREECE, C.10aDetection and isolation of the α‐proteobacterium Asaia in Culex mosquitoes  ap. 438-442.  aInvestigations of microbiota within mosquitoes continue to widen the spectrum of possible symbiont‐based applications against vector‐borne diseases. In this context, α‐proteobacteria of the genus Asaia (Rhodospirillales: Acetobacteraceae) are emerging as possible endosymbiotic candidates, particularly in paratransgenic approaches aimed at interrupting pathogen transmission. Previous studies have shown that Asaia spp. distribution among Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes displayed positive rates of infection in isolated midguts, salivary glands and reproductive tissues. Similarly, Asaia has been detected in Aedes albopictus (Stegomyia albopicta) and Aedes aegypti (Stegomyia aegypti) (Diptera: Culicidae) populations. Within the Culex pipiens complex (Diptera: Culicidae), Asaia infection is still largely unexplored. Here, we summarize a preliminary survey of laboratory‐reared Cx. pipiens complex and field‐collected Culex quinquefasciatus for the presence of Asaia spp., and present the first identification of Asaia in some of the members of the Cx. pipiens complex and the first description in West African populations of Cx. quinquefasciatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aAedes albopictus 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aAnopheles stephensi 3aAsaia 3aCulex pipiens 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3apathogens 3asalivary glands 3asurveys1 aDAMIANI, C.1 aVALZANO, M.1 aD'AMELIO, S.1 aCAPPELLI, A.1 aRICCI, I.1 aFAVIA, G.0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2014 Dec., v. 28, no. 4 p.438-442dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-283X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mve.120453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01900naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245007000162300001600232520097500248592002801223650003201251650001301283650001401296650001001310650001601320650003001336700001801366700002501384773012001409856004801529852000901577655001201586IND4474565620221118215241.0121003e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447456562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-010-0498-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Ruisheng10aReliable fusion PCR using Taq polymerases and pGEM-T easy vectors  ap. 727-730.  aWe describe a reliable method for the production of fusion PCR products that can be used to transform the wild-type bacteria to replace target genes for mutagenesis studies. The relevant gene fragments and selective cassette are first amplified separately by PCR using primers that produce overlapping ends. As economic Taq DNA polymerase is disappointed in producing overlap ends due to adding an extra 3′-end ‘A’ base which potentially blocks the successful fusion of the amplified fragments, we use a new primer design strategy to overcome this disadvantage by introducing an additional ‘A’ base in the overlap primers. The amplified gene fragments were then separately cloned into a pGEM-T easy vector and re-amplified with the aid of a universal primer T7/SP6. This procedure enables performing nested PCR with the outmost primers in the fusion reaction to reliably splice the gene fragments into a single molecule with all sequences in the desired order.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3abacteria 3aeconomics 3agenes 3amutagenesis 3apolymerase chain reaction1 aBai, Xiaodong1 aGrewal, Parwinder S.0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2011 Mar., v. 27, no. 3 p.727-730dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-010-0498-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245011300180300001400293520159900307592002801906650002001934650002001954650001301974650002901987650001402016650002302030650001702053650001502070650001802085650001802103650001202121650001602133650002502149650003302174650002402207650001302231650001002244650001102254650002302265651001102288653003202299653001502331653005202346653001602398653002302414700003402437700003002471700003502501773011402536856008602650852000902736655001202745IND60542918620221120140138.0190408e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054291862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.04.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Díaz, Yesenia10aGeographic structure of chemical variation in wild populations of the fuel crop Jatropha curcas L. in Mexico  ap. 63-68.  aJatropha curcas L. (Euphorbiaceae) is a shrub that produces seeds with a high oil content that can be converted to biodiesel. Some studies have shown that this plant contains phytochemicals that cause adverse effects on herbivores; however, it is not known whether the phytochemical variation is geographically structured and, in turn, if it is associated with herbivory intensity. This knowledge would enable the selection of individuals with adequate chemical variation to decrease the herbivory of this plant. With this objective, total foliar content of saponins, trypsin inhibitors, phytic acids, and phenols were analyzed and herbivory quantified in eight wild populations of J. curcas in Chiapas, Michoacán, and Veracruz, Mexico. Using principal components analysis (PCA), the content of phenols, saponins, trypsin inhibitors, and phytic acids grouped individuals to their state or frequently to their population. A multiple linear regression model considering total phytochemical content, altitude and precipitation, explained herbivory intensity (multiple adjusted R2=0.62). The concentration of trypsin inhibitors (par. corr.=0.51, P<0.0001) and altitude (par. corr.=0.769, P<0.0001) were positively associated with herbivory, whereas the concentration of phytic acid (par. corr.=−0.299, P<0.019) and precipitation (par. corr.=−0.503, P<0.0001) were negatively associated. It can be concluded that phytochemical variation is structured geographically at the local level and that herbivory intensity is associated with the total phytochemical content, precipitation, and altitude.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha curcas 3aadverse effects 3aaltitude 3abiochemical polymorphism 3abiodiesel 3achemical structure 3aenergy crops 3aherbivores 3alinear models 3alipid content 3aphenols 3aphytic acid 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3asaponins 3aseeds 3ashrubs 3atrypsin inhibitors 3aMexico 0aJatropha curcas plantations 0aFuel crops 0aGeographic structure of phytochemical variation 0aPhytic acid 0aTrypsin inhibitors1 aGonzález-Rodríguez, Antonio1 aDelgado Lamas, Guillermo,1 aEspinosa-García, Francisco J.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 74 p.63-68dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.04.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03752naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245013300171300001600304520208200320592002802402650001202430650001302442650001802455650001502473650002002488650001102508650002402519650001602543650002502559650003002584650001902614650001502633650001302648650002602661650002302687650001002710650001202720651001302732653002602745653001302771653002202784653003002806653003002836653002302866653002102889653002302910700001802933700001602951700002102967773010202988856008703090852000903177655001203186IND60546664320221116152615.0161027e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054666432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Rebekah10aEnvironmental and economic analyses of recycled asphalt concrete mixtures based on material production and potential performance  ap. 141-151.  aAs roadway construction is a material and energy intensive activity with potential impacts on the environment, the pavement industry has been seeking for more sustainable construction practices in the past decades. The use of recycled materials such as reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) and recycled asphalt shingle (RAS) is widely accepted as among the most commonly used sustainable strategies for asphalt concrete (AC) pavement due to its ability to partially substitute virgin asphalt binder and aggregate in AC mixtures. This study evaluated the environmental and economic benefits and trade-offs of including recycled materials in pavements using a life-cycle approach. Eleven AC mix designs from Illinois with various asphalt binder replacement (ABR) rates were evaluated in terms of environmental and economic impacts using life-cycle assessment (LCA) and an itemized cost analysis. The LCA was conducted in accordance to International Standard Organization ISO 14044:2006 guidelines. The life-cycle impacts of producing the AC mixtures were calculated in terms of energy, global warming potential, and cost. A general trend of reduction in these three sustainability metrics was observed for mix production with increasing ABR. However, without proper modification and engineering of mix designs (e.g. addition of a softer grade virgin asphalt binder), AC mixtures with high ABR can experience reduced fatigue life. Thus, the effect of pavement performance on the environmental impacts of using mixtures with various ABR was also considered, assuming that these mixtures are used in a 4-in. (102-mm) overlay over a four-lane-mile (1.6km) roadway. A breakeven concept was used to find the decreased service life at which the energy savings from using recycled asphaltic materials in the overlay equal the additional energy consumption incurred from a potential reduced performance in the pavement use phase. The breakeven point was found to be very sensitive to the traffic level of the overlay, with the breakeven service life decreasing rapidly with increased traffic.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3aconcrete 3acost analysis 3adurability 3aeconomic impact 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aengineering 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3aglobal warming 3aguidelines 3aindustry 3alife cycle assessment 3arecycled materials 3aroads 3atraffic 3aIllinois 0aLife-cycle assessment 0aPavement 0aRoad construction 0aRecycled asphalt pavement 0aRecycled asphalt shingles 0aPavement roughness 0aGreenhouse gases 0aEnergy consumption1 aKang, Seunggu1 aOzer, Hasan1 aAl-Qadi, Imad L.0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2015 Nov., v. 104 p.141-151dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245008100179300001800260500000900278520112900287592002801416650002401444650001501468650001501483650001501498650002401513650001701537650002101554650001001575650002001585650002201605650001301627650002301640650002001663650000901683650002001692650002001712650002301732650001801755650001101773650000801784700001701792700002001809700001601829773015001845856009601995852000902091655001202100IND60668172420221119181126.0191125e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066817242DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300060016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrooks, P. D.10aDiffusion Method To Prepare Soil Extracts For Automated Nitrogen-15 Analysis  ap. 1707-1711.  aepub  aA diffusion method that requires less labor than distillation methods was developed for preparing soil KCl extracts for ¹⁵NH⁺₄ and ¹⁵NO⁻₃ analyses. The procedure is ideal for preparing samples having low N mass (50–200 µg N) with no cross contamination. The method uses 140 mL disposable specimen containers to hold the sample, and 7-mm diam, disks of acidified GF/D glass fiber filter paper on stainless steel wire as the acid trap. Devarda's alloy and MgO are used as the reductant and base respectively. Complete diffusion for 40 to 60 mL of sample takes 6 d at room temperature with no shaking. Paired t-tests comparing analyses of soil extracts of varying ¹⁵N enrichment by this method and steam distillation showed no significant difference (p = 0.64). Use of KHSO₄ as the trapping acid allows the paper disks to be placed in a Sn capsule and analyzed by direct combustion mass spectrometry. Alternately, H₂SO₄ can be used and the disks analyzed by an automated NaOBr method.

From a resource perspective, there could be benefits from using excavated soil and rock as a construction material. The aim of this paper is to describe the material flow and management practices of urban excavated soil and rock from the perspective of resource efficiency. A conceptual model for the urban flow of excavated soil and rock was developed and a literature review concerning the management of excavated soil and rock was conducted. The conceptual model was subsequently used to clarify the different perspectives of the scientific literature and knowledge gaps. Conclusions drawn are that there is little knowledge about the quantities and the fate of excavated soil and rock in urban areas. Current research is focusing on the waste flows of construction material and little is known about the overall management practices of excavated soil and rock. Clearly, excavated soil and rock are often disposed at landfills and the recycling rate for high quality purposes is low. There is a need to evaluate the potential for an increased use of excavated soil and rock as construction material. However, the overall efficiency of urban construction material management can only be evaluated and improved by also including construction materials produced in quarries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconstruction materials 3alandfills 3amodels 3arecycling 3arocks 3asoil 3aurban areas 0aExcavated soil and rock 0aConstruction and demolition waste 0aMaterial flow analysis 0aSustainable management 0aResource 0aC&D1 aLundberg, Kristina1 aSvedberg, Bo1 aKnutsson, Sven0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 Apr. 15, v. 93 p.18-25dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010400167300001800271520122900289592002801518650002201546650001201568650001501580650001401595650002001609650001501629650001801644650002301662650001301685700001501698700001501713700001601728700001801744700001301762700002001775773014601795856008101941852000902022655001202031IND60519355420221122020516.0160427e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051935542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-5873-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lingling10aEnhancing the water purification efficiency of a floating treatment wetland using a biofilm carrier  ap. 7437-7443.  aFloating treatment wetlands (FTWs) and biofilm carriers are widely used in water purification. The objective of the present work was to explore whether and to what extent an FTW integrated with plants and biofilm carriers (FTW-I) could enhance the nutrient removal efficiency. Significantly higher removal rates of ammonia nitrogen (85.2 %), total phosphorus (82.7 %), and orthophosphate (82.5 %) were observed in the FTW-I treatment relative to the FTW with plants (FTW-P; 80.0, 78.5, and 77.6 %, respectively) and the FTW with biofilm carriers (FTW-B; 56.7, 12.9, and 13.4 %, respectively) (p < 0.05). The mass balance results indicated that plant uptake was the main pathway for N and P removal (accounting for 58.1 and 91.4 %, respectively) in FTW-I, in which only 1.2 % of the N and 5.7 % of the P was deposited on the bottom of the tank. In addition, the plants translocated 43.9 and 80.2 % of the N and P in the water and 83.5 and 88.3 % of the absorbed N and P, respectively, into their aboveground tissues. The combination of an FTW and biofilm carriers can improve the efficiency of water purification, and nutrients can be rapidly removed from the system by harvesting the aboveground plant tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiofilm 3aharvesting 3anutrients 3aorthophosphates 3aphosphorus 3aplant tissues 3awater purification 3awetlands1 aZhao, Jing1 aCui, Naxin1 aDai, Yanran1 aKong, Lingwei1 aWu, Juan1 aCheng, Shuiping0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Apr., v. 23, no. 8 p.7437-7443dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5873-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015000170520096200320592002801282650001101310650001801321650001301339650001801352650001201370650002301382650000801405650001301413650001601426653002001442653001301462653001301475653002001488653001801508653001401526700002301540700006201563773011201625856008601737852000901823655001201832IND60740212920221118025428.0220523e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074021292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1104782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeita, Dalloba10aRheological and water binding properties of xanthan, guar and ultra-finely milled oatmeal in white birch sap: Influence of sap minor constituents  aWhite Birch Sap (WBS) contains appreciable amounts of mineral ions and phenolic compounds and can be used as alternate solvent for food applications. In this study, the effect of the mineral and phenolic composition of WBS was evaluated on the physical properties of xanthan gum, guar gum, ultra-finely milled oatmeal and their combinations in solution. Solutions were formulated with WBS and with solvents mimicking WBS without phenolic compounds and WBS without phenolics nor mineral ions. The influence of solvent composition was evaluated on flow properties and water mobility of the solutions. From WBS without mineral ions nor phenolics, the addition of mineral ions led to increased pseudo-plasticity and decreased flow consistency, and decreased water mobility. Addition of phenolic compounds through WBS led to opposite effects possibly due to phenolic-driven aggregation of the hydrocolloids which also seemed to inhibit guar/xanthan interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3afood research 3aguar gum 3ahydrocolloids 3aoatmeal 3aphenolic compounds 3asap 3asolvents 3axanthan gum 0aWhite birch sap 0aColloids 0aRheology 0aTime domain-NMR 0aWater binding 0aViscosity1 aLéger, Geneviève1 aBordenave, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1253-44940 tFood research international.g2021 Sept., v. 147 p.110478-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1104783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001800158245017000176300001600346520113100362592002801493650003301521650002101554650001501575650001601590650001101606650001701617650002601634650001101660650001101671650001401682650001701696650001001713650001001723651002101733651001001754700001701764700002701781700001801808700002001826773011701846856007301963852000902036655001202045IND60114212820221120035450.0141112e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011421282DNAL7 a248906422pmid7 a10.1111/mve.120722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRío, R. del,10aSusceptibility of Culicoides species biting midges to deltamethrin‐treated nets as determined under laboratory and field conditions in the Balearic Islands, Spain  ap. 414-420.  aCulicoides Latreille (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are vectors of several arboviruses, including bluetongue virus (BTV) and African horse sickness virus (AHSV), which cause diseases in, respectively, sheep and cattle, and horses, and have economic repercussions mainly as a result of trade restrictions. Insecticides can be used to reduce vector populations and hence the spread of disease. Despite the economic importance of these diseases, relatively few studies have evaluated the efficacy of commercially available insecticides and the effectiveness of treated nets against Culicoides species. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the insecticidal effect of commercially available polyethylene nets (ZeroVector®) treated with deltamethrin (4.4 g/kg ± 15%) on Culicoides species. Laboratory and field trials were conducted in Culicoides populations collected in Majorca in the Balearic Islands, Spain. The present study shows that deltamethrin‐treated nets provoke high and rapid mortality (90–100%) in Culicoides midges under laboratory conditions and increase mortality by 13% when deployed in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican horse sickness virus 3aBluetongue virus 3aCulicoides 3aarboviruses 3acattle 3adeltamethrin 3afield experimentation 3ahorses 3amidges 3amortality 3apolyethylene 3asheep 3atrade 3aBalearic Islands 3aSpain1 aBARCELÓ, C.1 aPAREDES‐ESQUIVEL, C.1 aLUCIENTES, J.1 aMiranda, M.

Soil bulk density is a standard variable needed along with element concentrations to calculate nutrient pools. This study aimed to determine the optimal sample size, the number of observation (n), for predicting the soil bulk density with a precision of ±10% at a 95% confidence level among different soil types. We determined soil bulk density samples at three depths at 186 points distributed over three different 1-ha forest sites. We calculated n needed for estimating means of bulk density using a traditional method. This estimate was compared to a bootstrapping method n where the variance was estimated by re-sampling our original sample over 500 times. The results showed that patterns of soil bulk density varied by sites. Bootstrapping indicated 3 to 17 samples were needed to estimate mean soil bulk density at ± 10% at a 95% confidence level at the three sites and three depths. Sample sizes determined by the bootstrap method were larger than the numbers estimated by the traditional method. Bootstrapping is considered theoretically to be more robust, especially at a site with more variability or for site measures that are not normally distributed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3aforest soils 3aforests 3aprediction 3asoil density 3asoil sampling 3avariance 3aCalifornia1 aZhang, Jianwei1 aMattson, Kim G.1 aZhang, Weidong1 aWeber, Thomas A.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2016 May, v. 80, no. 3 p.756-764dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2015.12.04223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100003200181245016100213506007600374520158800450592002802038506003702066650001402103650003102117650001202148650001302160650001802173650001102191650001502202650001302217650001302230650003102243650001402274650002202288650001702310700002702327700002602354700002002380700002102400700002802421773012302449856007402572852000902646655001202655IND60650624320221207062446.0190710e20181112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065062432DNAL7 a10.3390/nu101117372doi7 aPMC62665082pmcid7 a304245142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrammatikopoulou, Maria  G.10aOral Adjuvant Curcumin Therapy for Attaining Clinical Remission in Ulcerative Colitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCurcumin has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties and has been investigated as an adjuvant therapy of ulcerative colitis (UC). The scope of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyze the efficacy of oral curcumin administration as an adjuvant therapy of UC. MEDLINE, Cochrane/CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO-ICT Registry, EMBASE and grey literature were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcome was clinical remission (attainment) and the secondary outcome was clinical response (maintenance/failure). Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with a Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) random effects model and with a beta-binomial (B-B) random effects model when zero events/cells occurred. Four RCTs met the criteria, but one was removed from the analyses due to inconsistency in protocol details. With the M-H method, treatment with curcumin was significantly superior to placebo in attaining remission in the per-protocol (PP) analysis (OR = 5.83, 95%CI = 1.24&ndash;27.43), but not in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (OR = 4.33, 95%CI = 0.78&ndash;24.00). However, with the more accurate B-B method, both analyses were insignificant (for PP OR = 4.26, 95%CI = 0.59&ndash;31.00, for ITT OR = 3.80, 95%CI = 0.55&ndash;26.28). Based on the current available evidence, oral curcumin administration does not seem superior to placebo in attaining remission in patients with UC. Future RCTs should be planned more cautiously with sufficient size and adhere to the ITT analysis in all outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadjuvants 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acolitis 3acurcumin 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3aplacebos 3arandomized clinical trials 3aremission 3asystematic review 3atherapeutics1 aGkiouras, Konstantinos1 aTheodoridis, Xenophon1 aAsteriou, Eleni1 aForbes, Alastair1 aBogdanos, Dimitrios  P.0 tNutrients.g2018 Nov. 12, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu101117373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245009300172300001400265520143800279592002801717650002201745650001501767650001301782650001601795650001301811650002301824650001601847650001401863650000901877650001101886650002001897650001001917653001301927653003301940653001101973653001801984653001602002653002002018700002302038773011002061856008402171852000902255655001202264IND60613190120221122085523.0190318e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061319012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2018.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacker, Kirsten F.10aQuantifying N-loss by root abscission: consequences for wheat N budgets and δ15N values  ap. 49-56.  aLower plant δ15N values relative to source δ15N are commonly attributed to 15N efflux. We determined the extent to which root abscission contributes to plant N-loss and consequences for plant δ15N. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. SST015) was grown in hydroponics with direct aeration, aeration constrained within a pipe and circulation of nutrient solution through sand, representing three levels of stability for root growth. The δ15N of nutrient solutions and root fragments were periodically determined, as well as root and shoot δ15N. Plants in solution had significantly more negative δ15N (−8.9 and −9.2‰) than plants in sand (−6.9‰), suggesting greater 15N-loss; root fragments were major biomass- (six-fold greater than root dry weight) and N-loss (two-fold greater than plant net N uptake) pathways in solution. These plants had more ephemeral roots and two-fold more root tips than the sand treatment. We estimated that root fragment loss decreased plant δ15N by at least −3.7, −2.6 and −1.0‰ in the direct, pipe and sand treatments, respectively. Positive nutrient solution δ15N in all treatments relative to the source δ15N suggests that plant N, probably derived from efflux, was present in solution. Despite this, root abscission and root turnover are also important N-loss pathways in plants, while plant δ15N values are probably influenced by a combination of root abscission and N efflux.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aabscission 3aaeration 3ahydroponics 3anitrogen 3anutrient solutions 3aroot growth 3aroot tips 3asand 3ashoots 3astable isotopes 3awheat 0aNitrogen 0aPlant isotope discrimination 0aEfflux 0aRoot turnover 0aHydroponics 0aRoot morphology1 aCramer, Michael D.0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2018 Dec., v. 231 p.49-56dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2018.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01045naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007300169300001600242520017300258592002800431650001800459650002100477650001200498650001300510650001400523700002200537773010500559856008200664852000900746655001200755IND60615480120221118023210.0181010e196907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061548012DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985869006004062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, Robert A.10aReticulum Cell Sarcoma in a Sykes Monkey (Cercopithecus albogularis)  ap. 369-374.  aThe gross and microscopic characteristics are described of a reticulum cell sarcoma found in a Sykes monkey during the course of 112 postmortem examinations of monkeys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCercopithecus 3aanimal pathology 3amonkeys 3anecropsy 3areticulum1 aPowers, Robert D.0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 6, no. 4 p.369-374dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300985869006004063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007600166300001600242520151100258592002801769650001201797650001101809650001901820650002001839650002001859650002501879650001501904650002401919650001501943650000901958650000901967650001101976650001101987650001401998650001402012650001602026653002602042653003002068653003202098700002002130700001702150700001802167773012402185856008202309852000902391655001202400IND60604388720221118022429.0180717e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060438872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2013.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Xiaojuan10aStudy on low-temperature pyrolysis of large-size printed circuit boards  ap. 151-156.  aAn energy-saving pyrolysis process of FR4-type printed circuit board (PCB) was designed with lower pyrolysis temperature (500°C) and large-size PCB sample (16–20cm²). The pyrolysis experiment of the PCB was carried out based on the process. The properties of pyrolytic gas and tar were compared to the pyrolysis results of previous process with high temperature (800°C) and small-size PCB (1.5–2cm² or powder). Endothermic heat of PCB pyrolysis reaction was calculated based on the experiment data collected. The results showed that: (1) PCB pyrolysis produced 10.17wt% of gas, 18.23wt% of tar and 71.60wt% of solid particle. Similar to previous studies, CO, CO2, 2-methyl propene was the main components in pyrolysis gas and the pyrolysis tar consisted of phenol and alkyl aromatics. However, the content of propylene, bromomethane, and bromine were significantly different in the pyrolysis gas of this study. (2) Metals and fiberglass were easier to be separated compared to the case of regular pyrolysis with 800°C pyrolysis final temperature and small-size sample. Copper sheets and fiberglass which adhere to a plenty of carbon were collected manually; a little amount of gold and nickel stayed in the residue. (3) Endothermic heat of PCB pyrolysis reaction is about 19.692MJ/kg. The calorific capacity is about 2.386MJ for pyrolytic gas and 4.502MJ for tar from each kilogram PCB pyrolysis. The overall calorific capacity of pyrolytic gas and tar accounts for 35% of required pyrolysis heat.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromine 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3adata collection 3aelectronic equipment 3aendothermy 3aenergy conservation 3afiberglass 3agold 3aheat 3anickel 3aphenol 3apropylene 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aPrinted circuit board 0aLow-temperature pyrolysis 0aPyrolysis products analysis1 aQin, Frank G.F.1 aYang, Xiaoxi1 aJiang, Runhua0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 Jan., v. 105 p.151-156dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2013.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245014600173520149400319592002801813650001601841650002701857650001701884650000901901650001301910650001201923650001001935650001501945650001401960650001401974650001501988650001002003653002602013653001302039653001802052653001402070653001502084653001402099700001802113700001802131700006302149700002402212700002002236700002002256773009102276856009002367852000902457655001202466IND60671670920221122041352.0191231e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067167092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1249632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolz, Sina N.10aDo you smell the danger? Effects of three commonly used pesticides on the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio)  aFish are warned about the presence of predators via an alarm cue released from the skin of injured conspecifics. The detection of this odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate that fish exposed to 20 μg/L of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity. Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aantipredatory behavior 3achlorpyrifos 3afish 3afreezing 3alinuron 3aodors 3apermethrin 3apredation 3apredators 3apyrethrins 3asmell 0aAntipredator response 0aBehavior 0aNeurotoxicity 0aOlfaction 0aPesticides 0aZebrafish1 aHausen, Jonas1 aSmith, Kilian1 aOttermanns, Richard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2168-94551 aSchäffer, Andreas,1 aSchiwy, Sabrina1 aHollert, Henner0 tChemosphere.g2020 Feb., v. 241 p.124963-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1249633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245013900209520137600348592002801724650001201752650000801764650001901772650003401791650001401825650001801839650002301857650001101880650000901891650001101900650002801911650001901939650001301958650002401971653002801995653003002023653004002053700003902093700002802132700003002160700002602190700002602216700002702242700002002269700005902289700005702348773011202405856008602517852000902603655001202612IND60740213220221118025348.0220523e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074021322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1104832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLudwig, Vagner1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0528-305714aThe effects of soybean storage under controlled atmosphere at different temperatures on lipid oxidation and volatile compounds profile  aThis study aimed to evaluate the effects of low oxygen partial pressure (pO₂) and high carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO₂) combined with different temperatures on the oil acidity and peroxide values of two soybean cultivars (NA 5909 RG and FEPAGRO 37 RR). The volatile compounds correlated to lipid oxidation were also evaluated. Soybeans were stored for seven months under ambient and controlled atmosphere (CA) conditions at three temperatures (20, 25, and 30 °C). Storage under ambient conditions increased acidity and peroxide value regardless of the temperature. CA storage with low pO₂ reduced oil acidity and its combination with high pCO₂ had no positive effects on oil acidity and peroxide values. Grains of FEPAGRO 37 RR stored under ambient air showed higher 1-octne-3-ol amount compared to CA. The higher storage temperature increased (E)-2-heptenal and decanal amount in grains of cultivar NA 5909 RG. In addition, the ambiente air storage provide higher γ-Butyrolactone in relation to CA storage. Moreover, in both cultivars the CA storage technique provides lower (E)-2-hexenal content. This compound, together with hexanal are potential lipid deterioration markers of soybeans. CA storage is a promising tool for soybean grains preservation and the effect is mainly due to the oxygen reduction, with no additional effect of CO₂ increasing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3acultivars 3afood research 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3aoils 3aoxygen 3aoxygen partial pressure 3aperoxide value 3asoybeans 3astorage temperature 0aGlycine max L.

Wildfire increased surface soil nutrient availability long‐term, mostly in shrub canopies. Soil nutrients of greatest increase with long‐lasting elevated levels included mineral N and Mn. Wildfires occurring in Artemisia (sagebrush) ecosystems can temporarily increase soil nutrient availability in surface soil. Less is known, however, on how soil nutrient availability changes over time and microsite post‐wildfire. In October 2013 a wildfire approximately 30 km north of Reno, Nevada, occurred in an Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana (mountain big sagebrush) community. We quantified soil nutrient availability of surface soil (0–10 cm) by microsite (shrub interspace and shrub canopy), treatment (burned and unburned), and temporally (monthly from November 2013 through May 2015). Changes in nutrient availability, due to wildfire, largely occurred in shrub canopy microsites. For most months and relative to unburned shrub canopies, burned shrub canopies had elevated availability of mineral N (dominantly NH₄⁺‐N), bicarbonate‐extractable P, DTPA‐extractable Mn, and solution‐phase Ca⁺², Mg⁺², SO₄–², K⁺, and ortho‐P. Burned shrub canopies also had, for most months, far less N mineralization potentials than unburned shrub canopies. The large increase in Mn availability in burned shrub canopies significantly correlates with mineral N and solution‐phase Ca⁺² and SO₄–², suggesting release via pyrolysis of soil organic matter. Except for a slight increase in solution‐phase Mg⁺², SO₄–², and ortho‐P for particular months, there is little evidence for nutrient translocation from burned canopies to adjacent interspaces during the study. Density of the exotic annual grass Bromus tectorum increased from 5 to 10% cover pre‐wildfire to about 60% in the post‐wildfire growing season attesting to the importance of elevated soil nutrient availability to its growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia tridentata subsp. vaseyana 3aBromus tectorum 3aammonium nitrogen 3aannuals 3acalcium 3acanopy 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3agrowing season 3aintroduced plants 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aorthophosphates 3apotassium 3apyrolysis 3ashrubs 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic matter 3asulfates 3awildfires 3aNevada1 aClementsTye, Charlie1 aHarmon, MorganDan0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2017 Sept., v. 81, no. 5 p.1203-1210dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2017.02.00393Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03819naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245011700184300001400301500001500315520153900330592002801869650000901897650002501906650002101931650001501952650004101967650001202008650001602020650002902036650001302065650002002078650001502098650002002113650002002133650001102153650000902164650002002173650000902193650002802202650000902230650001402239650001802253650001902271650001302290650001002303651001102313653000702324653000802331653001402339653000702353653001802360653000802378653001202386653000802398653000702406653000602413653002502419653000802444653000802452653000802460653001902468653000702487653001602494653001602510653002002526653000702546653000602553653000802559653000802567653000802575700002702583700002902610700003402639700002002673700005902693773009502752856008502847852000902932655001202941IND60546952720221121150542.0160903e20150415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054695272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaciel, Vinícius Gonçalves10aLife Cycle Inventory for the agricultural stages of soybean production in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil  ap. 65-74.  a2019-12-06  aSoybean is an important feedstock and its oil represents 70% of the raw material used for the production of Brazilian biodiesel. The main purposes of this work was to present a Life Cycle Inventory of soybean produced in Rio Grande do Sul, state in Brazil, based on primary data of agricultural soybean production in this region. Inventory data was collected in 23 municipalities that account for 32% of total soybean production. A Machinery Operation Modeling was suggested to adjust agricultural machinery inputs/outputs for harvesting under study. The soybean cultivation Life Cycle Inventory was divided into four stages and not as a black box. Based on questionnaire responses, it was possible to characterize some regional peculiarities of soybean production. For the estimation of Greenhouse Gas emissions from direct land use change and nitrous oxide emissions from soil, an assessment of soybean advancement over distinguished areas was performed. The results showed that for 15.4% of cultivated area from 1992/93 to 2012/13 transition from pasture to farming has occurred, mainly over rice and corn crops. It should be underscore that no evidence of soybean advances from forest to farming was found for the region. Moreover, this work considered nitrous oxide emissions from soil and a complete inventory was presented. Lastly, this works aims to offer soybean inventory data specifically to Rio Grande do Sul state and presents a new approach to perform environmental results related to agricultural life cycle assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3arice 3alife cycle inventory 3acultivation area 3afeedstocks 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3aforests 3ainventories 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3apastures 3adata collection 3aharvesting 3aland use change 3acrop production 3amodels 3acorn 3afarming systems 3asoil 3aagricultural statistics 3aoils 3abiodiesel 3anitrous oxide 3aquestionnaires 3asoybeans 3acrops 3aBrazil 0aRS 0ahia 0aBiodiesel 0aFC 0araw materials 0awsa 0aSoybean 0aFgi 0aDC 0ad 0aLife Cycle Inventory 0aLUC 0aMOM 0aGHG 0aGlobal warming 0aWF 0aAgriculture 0aConsumption 0aLand use change 0aWS 0ap 0aTCi 0aEgi 0aLCI1 aZortea, Rafael Batista1 aMenezes da Silva, Wagner1 aCybis, Luiz Fernando de Abreu1 aEinloft, Sandra1 aSeferin, Marcus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5821-009X0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 Apr. 15, v. 93 p.65-74dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009900165300001800264520200300282592002802285650002002313650001302333650002702346650002302373650001302396650001602409650002302425650001602448650002002464650001102484650001502495650001902510650002102529650001802550650001002568650002502578651001002603700002102613700001802634700001502652700002102667700001902688773014602707856008102853852000902934655001202943IND60519355820221123045306.0160427e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051935582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-5987-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChai, Li-Yuan10aGrowth, photosynthesis, and defense mechanism of antimony (Sb)-contaminated Boehmeria nivea L.  ap. 7470-7481.  aRamie (Boehmeria nivea L.) is the oldest cash fiber crop in China and is widely grown in antimony (Sb) mining areas. To evaluate the extent of Sb resistance and tolerance, the growth, tolerance index (TI), Sb content in plant parts and in Hoagland solution, bioaccumulation factor (BF), photosynthesis, and physiological changes in Sb-contaminated B. nivea (20, 40, 80, and 200 mg L⁻¹ Sb) grown hydroponically were investigated. The Sb tolerance and resistance of ramie were clearly revealed by growth inhibition, a TI between 13 and 99 %, non-significant changes in the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem (F ᵥ /F ₘ), energy-harvesting efficiency (photosystem II (PSII)) and single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) value, a significant increase in Sb in plant parts, BF >1, and an increase in catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) at 200 mg L⁻¹ Sb. Under increasing Sb stress, nearly the same non-significant decline in the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem (F ᵥ /F ₘ), energy-harvesting efficiency (PSII), relative quantum yield of photosystem II (φPSII), and photochemical quenching (qP), except for F ᵥ /F ₘ at 20 mg L⁻¹ Sb, were recorded. SPAD values for chlorophyll under Sb stress showed an increasing trend, except for a slight decrease, i.e., <2 %, than the control SPAD value at 200 mg L⁻¹ Sb. With a continuous increase in MDA, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and CAT activities were suppressed under Sb addition up to 40 mg L⁻¹ Sb and the addition of Sb enhanced enzyme production at 80 and 200 mg L⁻¹ Sb. A continuous decrease in SOD, POD, and CAT up to 40 mg L⁻¹ Sb and enhancements at ≥80 mg L⁻¹, along with the continuous enhancement of MDA activity and inhibited biomass production, clearly reveal the roles of these enzymes in detoxifying Sb stress and the defense mechanism of ramie at 80 mg L⁻¹ Sb. Thus, B. nivea constitutes a promising candidate for Sb phytoremediation at mining sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoehmeria nivea 3aantimony 3abioaccumulation factor 3abiomass production 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3agrowth retardation 3ahydroponics 3amalondialdehyde 3amining 3aperoxidase 3aphotosystem II 3aphytoremediation 3aplant anatomy 3aramie 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aChina1 aMubarak, Hussani1 aYang, Zhi-Hui1 aYong, Wang1 aTang, Chong-Jian1 aMirza, Nosheen0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Apr., v. 23, no. 8 p.7470-7481dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5987-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245013100161520144500292592002801737650002201765650001401787650002001801650002201821650002301843650001401866650002001880650002501900650000901925650001201934650001601946650002301962650000901985650001501994650001802009651001802027700001802045700002202063773012002085856007602205852000902281655001202290IND60762514420221120120401.0220110e20211230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076251442DNAL7 a10.3390/ani120100812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHale, Amanda M.10aAcoustic and Genetic Data Can Reduce Uncertainty Regarding Populations of Migratory Tree-Roosting Bats Impacted by Wind Energy  aWind turbine-related mortality may pose a population-level threat for migratory tree-roosting bats, such as the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) in North America. These species are dispersed within their range, making it impractical to estimate census populations size using traditional survey methods. Nonetheless, understanding population size and trends is essential for evaluating and mitigating risk from wind turbine mortality. Using various sampling techniques, including systematic acoustic sampling and genetic analyses, we argue that building a weight of evidence regarding bat population status and trends is possible to (1) assess the sustainability of mortality associated with wind turbines; (2) determine the level of mitigation required; and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures to ensure population viability for these species. Long-term, systematic data collection remains the most viable option for reducing uncertainty regarding population trends for migratory tree-roosting bats. We recommend collecting acoustic data using the statistically robust North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) protocols and that genetic diversity is monitored at repeated time intervals to show species trends. There are no short-term actions to resolve these population-level questions; however, we discuss opportunities for relatively short-term investments that will lead to long-term success in reducing uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLasiurus cinereus 3aacoustics 3adata collection 3agenetic variation 3amigratory behavior 3amortality 3apopulation size 3apopulation viability 3arisk 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3aweight-of-evidence 3awind 3awind power 3awind turbines 3aNorth America1 aHein, Cris D.1 aStraw, Bethany R.0 tAnimals.g2021 Dec. 30, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani120100813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011700170300001600287520106800303592002801371650002101399650001201420650001901432650002701451650001501478650002101493650001401514650001801528650001201546650001701558650002601575650001301601650001301614650001801627653002201645653001801667653003001685653002901715700006501744700001801809700005801827700002201885700002201907773009701929856008502026852000902111655001202120IND60546952820221121231127.0160903e20150415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054695282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrison, Nicola10aMitigating off-gas emissions in the biological nitrogen removal via nitrite process treating anaerobic effluents  ap. 126-133.  aA sequencing batch reactor treating the reject water produced from the dewatering of the anaerobic co-digestate of waste activated sludge and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste was monitored in order to assess the off-gas emissions that were produced. The gaseous emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3) and methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) produced during the biological nitrogen removal via nitrite route were monitored. During experimental period 1 a volumetric nitrogen loading rate (vNLR) of 1.08 kg N/m3 d was applied, while in period 2 the vNLR was 0.81 kg N/m3 d. Nitrous oxide emissions decreased from 1.49% of the influent nitrogen load in period 1 to 0.24% in period 2. The higher dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and the lower accumulation of nitrite in the reactor resulted in significantly lower nitrous oxide emissions in period 2. Some methane (5.8% of influent COD load) was emitted during period 1, as the lower DO concentration created micro-anaerobic conditions within the sludge flocs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aammonia 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical oxygen demand 3adewatering 3adissolved oxygen 3aeffluents 3agas emissions 3amethane 3amethanethiol 3amunicipal solid waste 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 0aOff-gas emissions 0aNitrous oxide 0aNitritation/denitritation 0aSequencing batch reactor1 aChiumenti, Alessandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2131-09081 aKatsou, Evina1 aMalamis, Simos1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2377-22171 aBolzonella, David1 aFatone, Francesco0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 Apr. 15, v. 93 p.126-133dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245007900168300001200247520135400259592002801613650001101641650002601652650001201678650001201690650001401702650001401716650003001730650000701760650001401767650001801781650001101799650002301810651001001833700002101843700001401864700001601878700003301894773008401927856008602011852000902097655001202106IND60089146320221121032833.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008914632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.07.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDueñas, C.10aChemical and radioactive composition of bulk deposition in Málaga (Spain)  ap. 1-8.  aChemical and radioactive composition of bulk deposition samples, which were collected monthly over a 5 year period (January 2007 until 31 December 2011) at a site located 30 m.a.l. in Málaga (4°28′ 8″W; 36°43′ 40″N) have been analysed. All samples were analysed for pH, major ions and gamma radionuclides. The average pH of bulk deposition was 6.4. Cl⁻ and [Formula: see text] were the main anions, while Ca⁺ and Na⁺ were the main cations. Significant correlations were found in soil-derived species among Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺ and K⁺ and sea-salt species between Na⁺ and Cl⁻. Other relatively good correlations were also observed between acidic anions [Formula: see text] and crustal-derived cations (Ca²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺). Sources of the major ions were assessed based on the enrichment factor method. The radionuclides present in all samples are ⁷Be and ²¹⁰Pb and ⁴⁰K appears in 50% of the samples. Relatively poor correlations were observed between the specific activities of gamma radionuclides and the major ions. The temporal variations of major ions and radionuclides exhibit similar seasonal behaviour with low values in winter–autumn months and maximum values in spring–summer months. The fluxes of major ions and gamma radionuclides have been discussed with meteorological factors controlling depositions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acalcium 3acations 3achlorides 3amagnesium 3ameteorological parameters 3apH 3apotassium 3aradionuclides 3asodium 3atemporal variation 3aSpain1 aFernández, M.C.1 aGordo, E.1 aCañete, S.1 aPerets, Mikhaʼel ben Yosef,0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Dec., v. 62 p.1-8dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.07.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01301naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245011600178300001600294500000900310520034100319592002800660650001500688650001400703650003700717700001600754773014800770856009600918852000901014655001201023IND60668173020221119181237.0191125e198303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066817302DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1983.03615995004700020033x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParra, M.

Compared with traditional chicken essence or clam extract, BE is cheaper to produce and may be used for wound healing, as a chemotherapy supplement, or to prevent fatigue. In this study, we evaluated the potential beneficial effects of BE on exercise performance and the related role of the gut microbiota. Pathogen-free male BALB/c mice were divided into three groups to receive vehicle or BE (0, 12.3, or 24.6 mL/kg) by oral gavage for 28 days. Exercise performance was evaluated using forelimb grip strength, swimming time to exhaustion, and physiological levels of fatigue-related biomarkers (serum lactate, blood urea nitrogen, and glucose levels) after physical challenges. BE supplementation elevated endurance and grip strength in a dose-dependent manner; significantly decreased lactate and blood urea nitrogen levels after physical challenge; and significantly increased muscle glycogen content. The germ-free mice supplemented with BE or an equal-calorie portion of albumin did not show significant differences from the other groups in exercise performance and levels of related biomarkers. Therefore, BE supplementation improved endurance and reduced fatigue, which might be related to BE composition, but had no correlation with the gut microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalbumins 3aathletic performance 3abeef 3abeef extracts 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3aclams 3acooking 3adose response 3adrug therapy 3agerm-free animals 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alactic acid 3amales 3amice 3amuscles 3aswimming 3atissue repair 3aurea nitrogen1 aChiu, Chien-Chao1 aWang, Yuzhi,1 aChen, Ter-Hsin1 aChen, Yi-Hsun1 aLee, Yen-Peng1 aHung, Shao-Wen1 aWu, Chean-Ping1 aChuang, Hsiao-Li0 tNutrients.g2018 Nov. 12, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu101117403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01702naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100006500181245005500246300001800301506007600319520037600395592002800771506003700799650001300836650001000849650002300859650001400882650001300896650002100909650001700930700002100947700001400968700002100982700002201003700002001025700001801045773013401063856007401197852000901271655001201280IND60617431120221207063044.0181025e20180213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061743112DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc09134f2doi7 aPMC62317132pmcid7 a293087992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXueThe two authors contribute equally to this article., Song13aAn enzymatic advance in nicotine cessation therapy  ap. 1686-1689.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA nicotine-degrading enzyme termed NicA2 was altered (NicA2-J1) through fusion of an albumin binding domain to increase its half-life.

Establishing a map of aquifer vulnerability is considerably critical for planning a scheme of groundwater quality protection. This study developed a novel probability-based DRASTIC model of aquifer vulnerability in the Choushui River alluvial fan, Taiwan, using indicator kriging and to determine various risk categories of contamination potentials based on estimated vulnerability indexes. Categories and ratings of six parameters in the probability-based DRASTIC model were probabilistically characterized according to the parameter classification methods of selecting a maximum estimation probability and calculating an expected value. Moreover, the probability-based estimation and assessment gave us an excellent insight into propagating the uncertainty of parameters due to limited observation data. To examine the prediction capacity of pollutants for the developed probability-based DRASTIC model, medium, high, and very high risk categories of contamination potentials were compared with observed nitrate-N exceeding 0.5mg/L indicating the anthropogenic groundwater pollution. The analyzed results reveal that the developed probability-based DRASTIC model is capable of predicting high nitrate-N groundwater pollution and characterizing the parameter uncertainty via the probability estimation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3agroundwater contamination 3akriging 3amodels 3anitrate nitrogen 3aparameter uncertainty 3apollutants 3aprediction 3arisk 3arivers 3awater quality 3aTaiwan 0aGroundwater 0aIndicator kriging 0aDRASTIC 0aUncertainty 0aAquifer vulnerability 0aNitrate-N1 aJang, Cheng-Shin1 aPeng, Yi-Huei0 tJournal of hydrology.g2013 Apr. 12, v. 486 p.494-504dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01538naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245011200203300001800315520029300333592002800626650002300654650002300677650002000700650002100720650001900741650001500760700001800775700002000793700001600813700001400829700001900843700001600862700001900878700001400897700001200911773013400923856007401057852000901131655001201140IND60617431220221122034332.0181025e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061743122DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc09135d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiangThese authors contributed equally to this work., Quan12aA fluorescent peptidyl substrate for visualizing peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity in live cells  ap. 1857-1860.  aThis communication reports on a fluorescent probe (PPI-P) for imaging active peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases in live cells.

To be able to interpret the resulting data with greater meaning it was necessary to determine the variability of depth to fragipan and the relations between this variability, the slope of the surface, and the thickness of the Ap horizon. Two methods of determining depth to the fragipan surface were used. The more feasible one, auger borings taken on a 100-foot grid was evaluated for precision in relation to the method of examining drain trench walls. Thickness of Ap horizon and the depth to the fragipan surface were measured at 161 locations 2 feet apart along tile drain trenches. Fragipan surface at 143 points over the research area was located by the auger grid system. The mean depth of the Ap horizon was 7.4 inches and 83% of the measurements fell in the 6- to 9-inch range. Of all fragipan depths, 74% were in the 11- to 17-inch range. Mean depth by augering was 13.9 inches; along the trench profile it was 14.4 inches. In this area of Cabot silt loam, the lower boundary of the Ap and the fragipan surfaces generally follow surface slopes. The auger method data follow the trend of the measurements derived from the trench profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aA horizons 3adrainage 3afragipans 3asilt 3asilt loam soils 3aVermont1 aBartlett, Richmond J.1 aHoward, Montague0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1965 Mar., v. 29, no. 2 p.201-205dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1965.03615995002900020026x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245013400162520169900296592002801995650001002023650001402033650001902047650002402066650001502090650001602105650000902121700002502130700002102155773012002176856007602296852000902372655001202381IND60762514620221120120250.0220110e20211230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076251462DNAL7 a10.3390/ani120100822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowell, Misha K.10aCorticosterone Metabolite Concentration Is Not Related to Problem Solving in the Fawn-Footed Mosaic-Tailed Rat Melomys Cervinipes  aAnimals can respond physiologically, such as by adjusting glucocorticoid hormone concentrations, to sudden environmental challenges. These physiological changes can then affect behavioural and cognitive responses. While the relationships between adrenocortical activity and behaviour and cognition are well documented, results are equivocal, suggesting species-specific responses. We investigated whether adrenocortical activity, measured using corticosterone metabolite concentration, was related to problem solving in an Australian rodent, the fawn-footed mosaic-tailed rat (Melomys cervinipes). Mosaic-tailed rats live in complex environments that are prone to disturbance, suggesting a potential need to solve novel problems, and have been found to show relationships between physiology and other behaviours. We measured problem solving using five food-baited puzzles (matchbox and cylinder in the home cage, and activity board with pillars to push, tiles to slide and levers to lift in an open field), and an escape-motivated obstruction task in a light/dark box. Faecal samples were collected from individuals during routine cage cleaning. Adrenocortical activity was evaluated non-invasively by measuring faecal corticosterone metabolites using an enzyme immunoassay, which was biochemically and biologically validated. Despite varying over time, adrenocortical activity was not significantly related to problem solving success or time spent interacting for any task. However, as adrenocortical activity is reflective of multiple physiological processes, including stress and metabolism, future studies should consider how other measures of physiology are also linked to problem solving.  aPublisher supplied data 3acages 3acognition 3acorticosterone 3aenzyme immunoassays 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3arats1 aSantymire, Rachel M.1 aRymer, Tasmin L.0 tAnimals.g2021 Dec. 30, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani120100823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03771naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245010200178300001600280500000900296520241800305592002802723650002002751650001102771650001602782650001902798650001802817650001102835650001502846650002602861650001902887650001102906650002202917650002402939650002402963650001202987651002102999651001403020700001803034700002003052773014803072856009603220852000903316655001203325IND60668173220221119181306.0191125e198403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066817322DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1984.03615995004800020001x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, S. C.10aPredicting Soil Temperature and Soil Heat Flux under Different Tillage-Surface Residue Conditions  ap. 223-232.  aepub  aModel descriptions for soil temperature utilizing readily available information are needed to project management effects of tillage. In many cases these model descriptions must cover periods of a month or more during the growing season. A procedure was developed to utilize daily maximum and minimum air temperature along with normalized root zone temperatures. Root zone temperatures were much more sensitive to the surface residue than the surface roughness (or other tilled layer property) characteristic of tillage-residue cover combinations. However, root zone temperatures normalized with respect to daily maximum and minimum temperatures were of a similar shape for all tillage-residue cover combinations. These normalized soil temperatures also afforded easy comparison among treatments and locations. A Fourier series analysis of daily normalized soil temperatures averaged over part of a growing season showed that the average value around which average normalized soil-temperature curves (diurnal wave) oscillate varies with depth and season. Amplitudes and phase angles of the first two harmonics of the Fourier series were approximately the same for all treatments over four seasons. A model was developed to estimate soil temperatures for various tillage-residue cover treatments with and without a crop cover for the northern Corn Belt states. The model utilizes the first two harmonics of the Fourier series and the relationships between the daily maximum and minimum soil surface temperatures vs. maximum and minimum air temperatures. Input needed for the model are: daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, thermal diffusivity of soil, and coefficients of the Fourier series fitted to average normalized soil temperatures. At one location in southern Minnesota the model predicted soil temperatures at 0.05 and 0.10-m depths over 45 d during the spring of 1980 within an average difference of 2.0°C and a deviation of no more than 3.8°C 67% of the time. A procedure to estimate hourly soil surface heat flux under different tillage and residue conditions is also presented. The procedure is based on the Fourier series soil temperature model. Inputs needed for the model are: (i) daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, (ii) thermal diffusivity, and (iii) volumetric heat capacity. Soil surface heat flux is often needed in the calculation of evaporation from the energy budget methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3agrowing season 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3aprediction 3aroot zone temperature 3asoil heat flux 3aspring 3asurface roughness 3asurface temperature 3athermal diffusivity 3atillage 3aCorn Belt region 3aMinnesota1 aLarson, W.

In this study, we have screened the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and analyzed pigments (chlorophylls, carotenoids) as well as phenolic compounds in Azolla filiculoides–T. azollae symbionts exposed to different light intensities. Our results revealed VOC emission mainly comprising isoprene and methanol (~82% and ~13% of the overall blend, respectively). In particular, by dissecting VOC emission from A. filiculoides and T. azollae, we found that the cyanobacterium does not emit isoprene, whereas it relevantly contributes to the methanol flux. Enhanced isoprene emission capacity (15.95 ± 2.95 nmol m⁻² s⁻¹), along with increased content of both phenolic compounds and carotenoids, was measured in A. filiculoides grown for long‐term under high (700 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) rather than medium (400 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) and low (100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) light intensity. Moreover, light‐responses of chlorophyll fluorescence demonstrated that A. filiculoides was able to acclimate to high growth light. However, exposure of A. filiculoides from low (100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) to very high light (1000 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) did not affect, in the short term, photosynthesis, but slightly decreased isoprene emission and leaf pigment content whereas, at the same time, dramatically raised the accumulation of phenolic compounds (i.e. deoxyanthocyanidins and phlobaphenes).

In order to determine effects of local harvesting policies, we evaluated the population dynamics of this resource in intact, frequently disturbed, and permanently and completely harvested areas. Recruitment, frond length, reproductive phenology and standing crop were assessed monthly. In intact areas, frond length and ratio of reproductive individuals were higher, but recruitment was poorly stimulated. On the other hand, complete harvest had an important effect on Macrocystis population dynamics. Whereas recruitment and growth were much higher after harvest events, reproductive phenology was lower. The harvest techniques with different frequencies practiced by Bahia Chasco fishermen were less harmful than complete harvest, and we conclude that current exploitation techniques applied in this location are not deleterious for the giant kelp beds. They even have favorable effects by renewing the population through stimulation of sexual reproduction, recruitment and growth of young individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3amacroalgae 3aMacrocystis 3aphenology 3asexual reproduction 3afisheries 3aChile 0arecruitment1 aMurúa, Pedro,1 aPatiño, David J.1 aMuñoz, Liliana1 aMüller, Dieter G.0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2014 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.1071-1079dSpringer-Verlagx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-013-0176-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008400168300001600252520094900268592002801217650004401245650002201289650001201311650001901323650001401342650001101356650000901367650001801376650001901394650001201413650004401425650001601469650001701485653001901502653001701521653001701538653002301555653001901578700001201597700001501609700001501624700001601639700001801655773011601673856008601789852000901875655001201884IND60542919620221120145322.0190408e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054291962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.04.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ming-Fei10aInfluence of temperature on bamboo torrefaction under carbon dioxide atmosphere  ap. 149-157.  aBamboo was torrefied under carbon dioxide atmosphere at 240–340°C, obtaining solid products with mass yield 40.58–96.89%, energy yield 63.01–99.09%, and higher heating value 18.78–28.51MJ/kg. The solid products were characterized by FTIR, NMR, TG/DTA, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Under the severest torrefaction condition, cellulose and hemicelluloses were completely decomposed. From the initial bamboo to the heavily torrefied sample, C concentration increased but H and O concentrations decreased. A high temperature of 320°C yielded product having atomic H/C and O/C ratios in the region of lignite, and a higher temperature of 340°C produced torrefied sample with atomic H/C and O/C ratios in the region of coal. The hydrophobicity of torrefied bamboo was increased with the increase of torrefaction temperature. Results indicated that torrefaction under carbon dioxide was a promising process for the utilization of bamboo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abamboos 3acarbon dioxide 3acellulose 3aenergy 3aheat 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrophobicity 3alignite 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atemperature 3atorrefaction 0aCarbon dioxide 0aTorrefaction 0aEnergy yield 0aStructural changes 0aHydrophobicity1 aLi, Xun1 aBian, Jing1 aXu, Ji-Kun1 aYang, Sheng1 aSun, Runcang,0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 76 p.149-157dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.04.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01680naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245004500172300001600217520058300233592002800816650001500844650002200859650002100881650002700902650001200929650001000941650001200951650001400963650001900977650004400996650001301040650001201053650001401065700001901079773010501098856008201203852000901285655001201294IND60615480720221118023232.0181010e196909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061548072DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985869006005052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Kampen, Kent R.10aPathology of Locoweed Poisoning in Sheep  ap. 413-423.  aThree locoweeds, Oxytropis sericea, Astragalus pubentissimus, and A. lentigimosus were fed experimentally to yearling wethers for 60 days.

In this study, N-doped porous carbon supported Ni catalysts (denoted as Ni/NC) were prepared using furfuryl alcohol (FA) loaded Ni-MOF-74 as the precursor followed by NH₄OH treatment and pyrolysis under N₂ atmosphere. For comparison purpose, Ni catalysts supported on porous carbon (denoted as Ni/C) were also prepared by direct pyrolysis of Ni-MOF-74. The selective gas phase catalytic hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane to ethylene was carried out to evaluate the catalytic performances of the catalysts. It was found that for Ni catalysts prepared at the same pyrolysis temperature, Ni particle sizes in Ni/NC catalysts were significantly smaller (20–40% smaller) than that of Ni/C. This reflected that pre-modification of Ni-MOF-74 using FA and NH₄OH could effectively increase Ni dispersion in Ni catalysts derived from Ni-MOF-74. Moreover, Ni/NC had a markedly stronger ability to form spillover H₂ owing to the enhanced metal-support interactions by N-doping. Accordingly, Ni/NC catalysts exhibited much higher catalytic activities than Ni/C catalysts. The turnover frequencies of Ni/NC catalysts were found to be 1.22–1.65 times higher than Ni/C catalysts. Increasing pyrolysis temperature led to decreased catalytic activities of both Ni/C and Ni/NC catalysts, due to the aggregation of Ni particles at higher treatment temperature. The findings from this study demonstrate that the MOF-mediated synthesis method offers a promising way to prepare Ni-based catalysts for catalytic hydrodechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium hydroxide 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoordination compounds 3adechlorination 3aethylene 3aethylene dichloride 3afurfuryl alcohol 3agases 3ahydrogen 3anickel 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aMOFs-derived carbon 0aSupported Ni catalysts 0aN-doping 0aCatalytic hydrodechlorination1 aSun, Yuhan1 aFu, Heyun1 aQu, Xiaolei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9157-42741 aXu, Zhaoyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9109-16701 aZheng, Shourong0 tChemosphere.g2020 Feb., v. 241 p.124978-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1249783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245009700180300001600277520135800293592002801651650002101679650001501700650001501715650001401730650001901744650002201763650001301785650001401798650001101812650001001823650001401833650001401847650002601861653001801887653000901905653001401914653002901928653002001957700001701977700001801994773012402012856008202136852000902218655001202227IND60604389220221118022428.0180717e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060438922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2013.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdelodun, Adedeji Adebukola10aEffect of UV-C on pre-oxidation prior amination for preparation of a selective CO2 adsorbent  ap. 191-198.  aIn order to enhance the selectivity of activated carbon (AC) toward CO2, surface modification was carried out in a two-step approach viz. pre-oxidation and amination. First, the most suitable oxidation was determined by using O3 and H2O2 with or without UV-C (λ≈253.7nm), to impregnate surface oxygen functionalities (SOFs) on the AC surface, followed by optimization of the most efficient technique. Chemical characterization showed that pre-oxidation increased the total amount of SOFs tethered on the AC surface. However, it was reduced when the oxidation was carried out under the influence of UV-C. Upon amination, less thermally refractory SOFs such as ether, carbonyl and carboxylic groups, tend to favor the formation of surface nitrogen functionalities such as pyridine and pyrrole-N types, which showed comparatively higher affinity toward CO2. Pre-oxidation and amination parameters of AC treatment with O3 in the presence of UV-C (ROUV), which exhibited most favorable condition for CO2 low-level selectivity, were optimized. The intrinsic capture affinity of AC for low and high levels CO2 was ultimately enhanced from 0.016 and 0.46 to 0.36 and 0.9mmol/g respectively. Conclusively, UV-C inhibits the formation of recalcitrant SOFs during oxidation, thereby reducing steric hindrance and promoting amination and eventual CO2 adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aamination 3acarbon dioxide 3ahydrogen peroxide 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aozone 3apyridines 3apyrolysis 3aultraviolet radiation 0aPre-oxidation 0aUV-C 0aAmination 0aCarbon surface chemistry 0aCO2 selectivity1 aLim, Yun-Hui1 aJo, Young-Min0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 Jan., v. 105 p.191-198dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2013.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01085naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245005200210300001800262520011900280592002800399650001400427650001400441650001800455700002100473700001700494700001800511773011600529856008200645990002300727852000900750655001200759IND60090774320221120200801.0141102e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009077432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.01.0312doi7 aPMC37255772pmcid7 a213068972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKraus, George A.10aSynthesis of chroman aldehydes that inhibit HIV  ap. 1399-1401.  aChroman aldehydes bearing an acetyl group plus alkoxyl or hydroxyl groups inhibit HIV infectivity in HeLa37 cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3achemistry 3apathogenicity1 aMengwasser, John1 aMaury, Wendy1 aOh, ChoonSeok0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 21, no. 5 p.1399-1401dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.01.0313Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245016700171520145000338592002801788650001401816650002301830650000901853650001301862650001901875650002501894650001301919650001501932650001501947653003301962653002101995653002702016653002202043653001502065700001802080700001702098700001702115700001302132700001202145700002002157700002202177700002402199773009102223856009002314852000902404655001202413IND60671671520221122032325.0200110e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067167152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1249792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Dongqin10aSynergistic activation of peroxymonosulfate and persulfate by ferrous ion and molybdenum disulfide for pollutant degradation: Theoretical and experimental studies  aActivation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and persulfate (PS) by Fe²⁺ is widely used for oxidizing organic pollutants. However, their application is limited by the slow conversion rate of Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺ and the accumulation of Fe³⁺. Here, we introduce commercial molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) to promote the activation of PMS and PS by Fe²⁺, and explore the mechanism of this promotion using experimental and theoretical methods. The Fe²⁺/PMS/MoS₂ and Fe²⁺/PS/MoS₂ systems achieved faster rate of PMS and PS conversion and also higher degradation efficiency toward pollutants. About 94.7% and 87.6% of rhodamine B (RhB) could be degraded in Fe²⁺/PMS/MoS₂ (54 μM Fe²⁺, 1 mM PMS) and Fe²⁺/PS/MoS₂ (54 μM Fe²⁺, 0.25 mM PS) system, respectively. MoS₂ addition simultaneously promoted the Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ cycle, the PMS and PS conversion, and the RhB mineralization. As a co-catalyst, MoS₂ exhibited excellent stability for eight successive cycles of use. The predominant oxidant was identified as SO₄⁻ in Fe²⁺/PMS/MoS₂ and Fe²⁺/PS/MoS₂ systems. Theoretical calculations and a kinetic model were employed to evaluate the catalytic performance of the systems. These novel findings indicate that the combination of a commercially available MoS₂ catalyst with a low dosage of Fe²⁺ is a promising and effective approach for efficient activation of PMS and PS to produce SO₄⁻ and OH.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3airon 3akinetics 3amineralization 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aoxidants 3apollutants 3arhodamines 0aAdvanced oxidation processes 0aSulfate radicals 0aSynergistic activation 0aPeroxymonosulfate 0aPersulfate1 aFan, Zhushan,1 aZeng, Yifeng1 aLuo, Hongwei1 aLuo, Kai1 aLi, Jun1 aPan, Xiangliang1 aBarceló, Damià,1 aCrittenden, John C.0 tChemosphere.g2020 Feb., v. 240 p.124979-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1249793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012900170300001300299500001500312520190900327592002802236650001102264650001302275650002002288650001902308650002102327650002502348650001202373650003002385650001502415650001102430650001702441650002102458650001702479650001702496650002302513651001002536653002502546653002602571653003302597653002702630653003102657653002202688653001802710700001802728700001402746773009902760856008702859852000902946655001202955IND60546665720221116152603.0161027e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054666572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Junying12aA structure–efficiency based performance evaluation of the urban water cycle in northern China and its policy implications  ap. 1-11.  a2019-12-06  aUnderstanding the urban water cycle is critical, as the watershed water cycle is greatly influenced by cities under the processes of urbanization with problems of high frequency of water shortage, environment deterioration and ecological degradation. Different from traditional evaluation method which focuses on one or some component of the whole system, this research aims to propose an innovative framework to evaluate the performance of the urban water cycle by means of the structure–efficiency index (SE_index). This index aggregates key indicators from structure and efficiency aspects (i.e. S_index and E_index), based on the water balance principle (which considers a multi-source water distribution process, water consumption process, and the wastewater treatment and discharge process). An entropy weight method is used to determine the weights of different indicators in an objective way. The performance levels of the urban water cycle of case study cities in Haihe River basin are evaluated, and key indicators are identified by sensitivity analysis. Four city categories with different structures or efficiency characteristics are presented by cluster analysis technique and their associated policy implications are discussed. For cities with relatively low S_index and E_index values (such as Xingtai, Hebi, Shjiazhuang and Hebi), it is meaningful to both optimize their urban water cycle structure and improve the efficiency of the water supply and different water use sectors. Although cities such as Beijing and Tianjin have relatively high S_index and E_index values, there is still room for them to make structure optimization compared with other cities in the basin. The proposed SE_index and its application can help provide quantitative information on the urban water cycle performance status to promote sustainable urban water policy making and related infrastructure planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aplanning 3awater shortages 3ainfrastructure 3acluster analysis 3awastewater treatment 3aentropy 3aenvironmental degradation 3awatersheds 3acities 3awater policy 3ahydrologic cycle 3acase studies 3aurbanization 3awater distribution 3aChina 0aSensitivity analysis 0aEntropy weight method 0aStructure–efficiency index 0aUrban water management 0aCluster analysis technique 0aHaihe River basin 0awater balance1 aWang, Jianhua1 aWang, Can0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2015 Nov., v. 104 p.1-11dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001700171245010600188300001600294520097800310592002801288650002101316650001201337650002301349650001701372650001101389650001101400650001301411650003601424650003201460650003001492650002401522650003101546650004801577650002001625650001701645653001501662653001201677653001401689653001701703653001701720700002001737700001401757700001701771700002201788700002101810700001601831700002101847773010601868856008701974852000902061655001202070IND50071039620221121051747.0190409e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007103962DNAL7 a241771542pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.09.1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChi, Zhanyou10aOverliming detoxification of pyrolytic sugar syrup for direct fermentation of levoglucosan to ethanol  ap. 220-227.  aThe application of pyrolytic sugars for biofuel production through fermentation is challenged by inhibitory contaminant compounds. Inhibition is so severe that only 0.25% sugar syrup can be used. In this study, overliming was tested as a simple detoxification method, using the Escherichia coli KO11+ lgk to directly convert levoglucosan into ethanol. After treatment with at least 14.8g/L of Ca(OH)2, fermentation with 2% (w/v) pyrolytic sugar syrup was observed with no inhibition of ethanol production. Further investigation of treatment time and temperature showed that 8–16h of treatment at 20°C, and 1–4h of treatment at 60°C are necessary to obtain consistent ethanol production. The samples treated with 18.5g/L Ca(OH)2 at 60°C for 4h showed no inhibition at 2.5%. Multiple contaminants removed by the overliming treatment were identified. This study demonstrates that overliming is a promising method for detoxification of pyrolytic sugars for fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3asugars 3asyrups 2aBiofuels 2aCalcium Hydroxidexpharmacology 2aCarbohydratesxpharmacology 2aDisaccharidesxmetabolism 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentationxdrug effects 2aGlucosexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aHot Temperature 2aTime Factors 0aOverliming 0aBiomass 0aPyrolysis 0aLevoglucosan 0aContaminants1 aRover, Marjorie1 aJun, Erin1 aDeaton, Mark1 aJohnston, Patrick1 aBrown, Robert C.1 aWen, Zhiyou1 aJarboe, Laura R.0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Dec., v. 150 p.220-227dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.09.1383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008000164300001800244500001400262520169000276592002801966650001401994650001702008650001602025650001902041650001602060650001402076650001402090650001802104650001102122650001102133650001802144650003102162650001402193650001502207650001102222650001302233650001702246650001402263700001902277700001602296773012602312856007402438852000902512655001202521IND60719113120221120054635.0201126e20201118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071911312DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo01655a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeichtinger, Annika10aEffect of particle size distribution on rheological properties of chocolate  ap. 9547-9559.  aNAL-light  aThis study focused on the influence of the particle size distribution (PSD) of ingredients used for chocolate preparation (cocoa powder and sugar) on viscosity of model chocolates with different fat contents. Model chocolates with varying PSDs and two particle size ratios (cocoa particles : sugar of 1 : 4 and 1 : 6) were prepared by mixing highly defatted cocoa powder as a fine fraction and sugar as coarse fraction in several proportions. Samples containing spherical quartz beads were included as a reference to gain insight into the role of particle properties. Comparing chocolate samples with the same composition, but different particle size ratio, the largest difference in viscosity was found at a proportion of coarse fraction of 0.6. This shows that at this proportion of coarse particles, the highest maximum packing fraction was reached, which is in accordance with theoretical predictions. However, for the investigated chocolate samples, the lowest viscosity values were obtained at a proportion of the coarse fraction of 0.8 or 1. This could be attributed to parameters other than PSD, such as a decrease in surface area with an increasing amount of coarse particles. Also the morphology and surface properties were shown to influence viscosity. Compared to cocoa and sugar particles, spherical and smooth quartz beads led to an improved particle packing, and therefore a lower viscosity. The addition of lecithin led to a decrease in viscosity due to a decrease in particle–particle interactions, particularly for hydrophilic sugar particles. The knowledge obtained in this study provides possible approaches on how to reduce fat content of chocolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3achocolate 3acocoa powder 3aexhibitions 3ahydrophilicity 3aingredients 3aknowledge 3alecithins 3alipid content 3amixing 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aparticles 3aprediction 3aquartz 3asampling 3asurface area 3aviscosity1 aScholten, Elke1 aSala, Guido0 tFood & function.g2020 Nov. 18, v. 11, no. 11 p.9547-9559dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo01655a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03727naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111024002100141040001800162072000900180100002000189245013900209300001800348500002400366520170400390650002402094650001702118650001602135650001602151650002502167650001002192650001502202650002502217650001002242650001202252650001402264650001402278650001902292650002402311650001202335650003502347650003102382650003702413650002202450650001102472650000902483650002902492650002402521650002202545650003002567700002502597700002002622700003002642773012002672852000902792856011202801856008002913930003302993945002503026946001303051961001303064655001203077IND4424448420221118040150.0090812e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442444842DNAL7 a196899082pmid7 a10.1603/022.038.04372doi7 a10113/343242hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aKendra, Paul E.10aElectroantennogram and Behavioral Responses of Anastrepha suspensa (Diptera: Tephritidae) to Putrescine and Ammonium Bicarbonate Lures  ap. 1259-1266.  aIncludes references  aAt present, the most effective synthetic lures for pest Anastrepha fruit flies are multicomponent blends that include ammonia and the diamine synergist putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane). Both chemicals generally have been regarded as protein cues that result in female-biased attraction. Using electroantennography (EAG) and flight tunnel bioassays, this study evaluated response of the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa (Loew) to vapors released from commercial lure formulations of ammonium bicarbonate and putrescine. Over a range of doses tested, EAG response to ammonium bicarbonate was equivalent for both sexes, but female response was significantly greater than male response to putrescine and to a 1:1 mixture of ammonium bicarbonate and putrescine. Amplitude of EAG response to the mixture was approximately equal to the summation of responses to the individual substrates. Using a fixed dose of substrate, EAG measurements from females 1-14 d old indicated that antennal sensitivity to both lures varied according to physiological state of the fly. Peak response to ammonium bicarbonate was recorded from immature females, peak response to putrescine from sexually mature females. In bioassays, more females were captured with ammonium bicarbonate plus putrescine than with ammonium bicarbonate alone. This difference was not observed in males, resulting in a higher female to male ratio in captures with ammonium bicarbonate plus putreseine (3:1) versus ammonium bicarbonate alone (1:1). Results suggest that separate olfactory receptors are involved in detection of the two semiochemicals, and that the putrescine component is primarily responsible for the female-biased attraction. 3aAnastrepha suspensa 3ainsect pests 3afruit flies 3aplant pests 3aelectroantennography 3abaits 3aputrescine 3aammonium bicarbonate 3amales 3afemales 3abioassays 3asex ratio 3asemiochemicals 3aolfactory receptors 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aBicarbonatesxpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aElectrophysiology 2aFemale 2aMale 2aPutrescinexpharmacology 2aSex Characteristics 2aSexual Maturation 2aTephritidaexdrug effects1 aMontgomery, Wayne S.1 aEpsky, Nancy D.1 aHeath, R.

We show that along the BGP equilibrium an inverted U-shaped income–pollution relationship may occur as a response to structural changes, but whether this is the case or not it will crucially depend upon the magnitude of a production externality parameter. Moreover, we show that the negative relationship between income and pollution can only be a transitory phenomenon, and in the long run pollution will increase as income rises, generating overall an N-shaped pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aincome 3amacroeconomics 3amodels 3apollution1 aAnsuategi, Alberto1 aGallastegui, Ma.

The objective of the present article is to elucidate the reinforcement effect of graphite oxide nanoplates (GONP) on the thermal, flexural and creep performance of glass fiber/epoxy (GE) composites. Thermal analyses by DSC, DMA and TGA showed reduced glass transition temperature of GE composite due to GONP incorporation, whereas no significant impact has been observed on the decomposition temperature. GONP addition has been found to be beneficial on the flexural properties of GE composite. To understand the effect of temperature on long-term mechanical durability, creep tests have been performed at various temperatures (50, 80 and 110°C). Further, elevated temperature creep behaviour has been assessed at various stresses (10, 20 and 40MPa) to comprehend the combined effect of temperature and stress.

Fram Strait, located in the Greenland Sea sector, is the principal gateway for ice export from the Arctic Ocean. The consequences of lower sea ice flux through Fram Strait on ocean dynamics and primary production in the Greenland Sea remain unknown. By using the most recent 16 years (2003–2018) of satellite imagery available and hydrographic in situ observations, the role of exported Arctic sea ice on water column stratification and phytoplankton production in the Greenland Sea is evaluated. Years with high Arctic sea ice flux through Fram Strait resulted in high sea ice concentration in the Greenland Sea, stronger water column stratification, and an earlier spring phytoplankton bloom associated with high primary production levels. Similarly, years with low Fram Strait ice flux were associated with a weak water column stratification and a delayed phytoplankton spring bloom. This work emphasizes that sea ice and phytoplankton production in subarctic “outflow seas” can be strongly influenced by changes occurring in the Arctic Ocean.  aPublisher supplied data  aNA15OAR4320063cNOAA  aPLR‐1503298cNSF  a80NSSC8K0081cNASA  aNNX17AB99GcNASA 3aalgal blooms 3aclimate models 3aexports 3ageophysics 3aphytoplankton 3aprimary productivity 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3asea ice 3aspring 3aArctic Ocean 3aGreenland Sea1 aMatrai, P.

The PZS functional layers not only improved the dispersion of CNTs in aqueous solution but also used as a platform for subsequent immobilization of Au nanoparticles. The functionalized CNTs and the Au@PZS@CNTs nanohybrids were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, Atomic absorption spectrum, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results showed that the PZS layers with thickness of about 25 nm were formed uniformly on CNT surfaces by polycondensation between hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene and 4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol, and that high density of homogeneously dispersed spherical Au nanoparticles with average size of 6 nm was immobilized on their outer surface. Meanwhile, the catalytic activity and reusability of the Au@PZS@CNTs nanohybrids were investigated by employing the reduction of 4-nitrophenol into 4-aminophenol by NaBH₄as a model reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aaminophenols 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3agold 3ananogold 3ap-nitrophenol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aFu, Jianwei1 aWang, Minghuan1 aWang, Yajie1 aChen, Zhimin1 aZhang, Jianan1 aChen, Jiafu1 aXu, Qun0 tJournal of materials science.g2014 July, v. 49, no. 14 p.5056-5065dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-014-8212-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013700167300001600304500001900320520152300339592002801862650003301890650003401923650001201957650001301969650003701982650001302019650001302032650001502045653000802060653000802068653001602076653001002092653000802102700002002110700001802130700002002148700005802168700002402226700002102250700002002271700002102291700001902312700005902331773014602390856008302536852000902619655001202628IND60675420220221118004132.0200110e20200122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067542022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.1962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshii, Hiroshi10aDetermination of a T cell receptor of potent CD8+ T cells against simian immunodeficiency virus infection in Burmese rhesus macaques  ap. 894-899.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCumulative studies on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals have shown association of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) polymorphisms with lower viral load and delayed AIDS progression, suggesting that HIV replication can be controlled by potent CD8⁺ T-cell responses. We have previously established an AIDS model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in Burmese rhesus macaques and found a potent CD8⁺ T cell targeting the Mamu-A1*065:01-restricted Gag₂₄₁₋₂₄₉ epitope, which is located in a region corresponding to the HIV Gag₂₄₀₋₂₄₉ TW10 epitope restricted by a protective MHC-I allele, HLA-B*57. In the present study, we determined a T cell receptor (TCR) of this Gag₂₄₁₋₂₄₉ epitope-specific CD8⁺ T cell. cDNA clones encoding TCR-α and TCR-β chains were obtained from a Gag₂₄₁₋₂₄₉-specific CD8⁺ T-cell clone. Coexpression of these TCR-α and TCR-β cDNAs resulted in reconstitution of a functional TCR specifically detected by Gag₂₄₁₋₂₄₉ epitope-Mamu-A1*065:01 tetramer. Two of three previously-reported CD8⁺ T-cell escape mutations reduced binding affinity of Gag₂₄₁₋₂₄₉ peptide to Mamu-A1*065:01 but the remaining one not. This is consistent with the data obtained by molecular modeling of the epitope-MHC-I complex and TCR. These results would contribute to understanding how viral CD8⁺ T-cell escape mutations are selected under structural constraint of viral proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aSimian immunodeficiency virus 3aalleles 3aepitopes 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3apeptides 3aresearch 3aviral load 0aHIV 0aSIV 0aCD8+ T cell 0aMHC-I 0aTCR1 aMatsuoka, Saori1 aIkeda, Noriko1 aKurihara, Kyoko1 aUeno, Takamasa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4852-42361 aTakiguchi, Masafumi1 aNaruse, Taeko K.1 aKimura, Akinori1 aYokoyama, Masaru1 aSato, Hironori1 aMatano, Tetsuro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3096-67490 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Jan. 22, v. 521, no. 4 p.894-899dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.1963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010900167520161800276592002801894650001301922650000801935650002001943650001301963650001801976650002201994650001302016650000902029650001002038650001002048650001602058650001902074650001902093653002302112653002802135653001902163653002402182700001302206700001502219700001702234700005702251700001602308700001602324773009802340856008702438852000902525655001202534IND60749663920221123043601.0211017e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074966392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1176452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Yi-Wen12aA hybrid cooling system to enable adhesion-free heat recovery from centrifugal granulated slag particles  aIt remains a long-standing challenge to recover high-temperature heat from blast furnace slag. Centrifugal granulation assisted thermal energy recovery (CGATER), although being proposed for tens of years, has gained renewed interests for its potential to enable green and sustainable slag treatment. Yet, the CGATER technology is still not sufficiently mature to be applied in iron and steel industry. One key hurdle towards its industrialization is the easy adhesion of granulated slag particles, which deteriorates heat removal from slag particles. To address this issue, a new method that combines both water and air cooling to eliminate particles adhesion in the course of heat recovery was proposed. As a proof of principle, a hybrid cooling system was built and the behavior of the hot, sticky slag particles inside the system was studied experimentally. Encouragingly, this hybrid cooling system was observed with superb anti-adhesion performance. Such attractive trait of the new system is enabled by the fast slag particles cooling by water and timely slag particles transportation by air. Further, the operational factors including initial slag temperature, air flowrate and rotating speed of granulator were also considered. The optimal rotating speed of granulator was 1800 rpm in the present operating conditions. The maximum heat recovery efficiency of 52% and vitreous content of ~ 98% were achieved when the initial slag temperature was 1500 ℃. This work provides a new attempt to resolve the cumbersome slag adhesion issue and advances the state of the art in the realm of CGATER technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aair 3aenergy recovery 3afurnaces 3aheat recovery 3aindustrialization 3aindustry 3airon 3aslags 3asteel 3atemperature 3athermal energy 3atransportation 0aBlast furnace slag 0aCentrifugal granulation 0aHybrid cooling 0aWaste heat recovery1 aZhu, Xun1 aWang, Hong1 aDai, Mao-Lin1 aDing, Yu-Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0202-25401 aWu, Jun-Jun1 aLiao, Qiang0 tApplied energy.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 303 p.117645-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1176453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006400142245010800206300001800314500002900332520136300361592002801724650001401752650001101766650001101777650001301788650001401801650001301815650001301828650001401841650001101855650001601866700006001882700006101942700005802003700006202061700005802123773014702181856007602328852000902404655001202413IND60737070920210811000000.0210514e20210420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073707092DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c022352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesnoyer, Addison N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1767-264X12aA Dicopper Nitrenoid by Oxidation of a CuᴵCuᴵ Core: Synthesis, Electronic Structure, and Reactivity  ap. 7135-7143.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aA dicopper nitrenoid complex was prepared by formal oxidative addition of the nitrenoid fragment to a dicopper(I) center by reaction with the iminoiodinane PhINTs (Ts = tosylate). This nitrenoid complex, (DPFN)Cu₂(μ-NTs)[NTf₂]₂ (DPFN = 2,7-bis(fluorodi(2-pyridyl)methyl)-1,8-naphthyridine), is a powerful H atom abstractor that reacts with a range of strong C–H bonds to form a mixed-valence Cu(I)/Cu(II) μ-NHTs amido complex in the first example of a clean H atom transfer to a dicopper nitrenoid core. In line with this reactivity, DFT calculations reveal that the nitrenoid is best described as an iminyl (NR radical anion) complex. The nitrenoid was trapped by the addition of water to form a mixed-donor hydroxo/amido dicopper(II) complex, which was independently obtained by reaction of a Cu₂(μ-OH)₂ complex with an amine through a protonolysis pathway. This mixed-donor complex is an analogue for the proposed intermediate in copper-catalyzed Chan–Evans–Lam coupling, which proceeds via C–X (X = N or O) bond formation. Treatment of the dicopper(II) mixed donor complex with MgPh₂(THF)₂ resulted in generation of a mixture that includes both phenol and a previously reported dicopper(I) bridging phenyl complex, illustrating that both reduction of dicopper(II) to dicopper(I) and concomitant C–X bond formation are feasible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3aamines 3aanions 3acleaning 3acouplings 3ajournals 3amixtures 3aoxidation 3aphenol 3awater traps1 aNicolay, Amélie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0495-20551 aZiegler, Micah S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8549-506X1 aLakshmi, K.

This large-scale cross-sectional study explored the associations of meal timing and frequency with obesity and metabolic syndrome among Korean adults. Meal timing was defined as nightly fasting duration and morning, evening, and night eating, and meal frequency was estimated as the number of daily eating episodes using a single-day 24-hour dietary recall method. Meal frequency was inversely associated with prevalence of abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, and elevated triglycerides in men only. Independent of the nightly fasting duration and eating episodes, morning eating was associated with a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome (odds ratio (OR), 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.57&ndash;0.93 for men and OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54&ndash;0.89 for women) than no morning eating, whereas night eating was associated with a 48% higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.15&ndash;1.90) than no night eating in men only. Longer fasting duration and less sleep were associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. These findings suggest that overall eating patterns, including energy distribution across the day, eating frequency, and sleep duration, rather than fasting duration alone, are related to cardiometabolic risks in free-living Korean adults.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3ablood pressure 3acircadian rhythm 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3adiet recall 3aenergy 3afasting 3afood intake 3amen 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3aodds ratio 3asleep 3atriacylglycerols 3awomen1 aSong, YoonJu 0 tNutrients.g2019 Oct. 13, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu111024373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245009000211520174900301592002802050650001302078650002202091650002002113650001102133650002502144653002802169653003202197653002102229653002802250653002702278700005602305700006002361773009802421856008702519852000902606655001202615IND60749664220221122062051.0211213e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074966422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1176552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Dongyeon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4175-111310aMissing data imputation using mixture factor analysis for building electric load data  aWe propose a mixture factor analysis (MFA) method for estimating missing values in building electric load data. Buildings consume a tremendous amount of energy. Thanks to the recent advances in data technologies such as machine learning and applied statistics, data-driven approaches to making buildings more energy-efficient become a major research area. However, building electric load data suffer from quality issues due to data missing originated from malfunctioning sensors, network stability, and other environmental causes. We note that data missing can occur even under advanced Internet Technology (IT) systems such as energy information systems (EIS) and energy management systems (EMS) due to signal stability and low-speed computers. The existence of missing data may significantly affect building operations, causing inaccuracy in evaluating building status and forecasting future electric demands. In this respect, dealing with missing data problems should be as important as developing highly accurate forecasting algorithms. While investigating load data, we find that building electric loads exhibit distinct patterns with cyclic rotations that we can take advantage of in both model design and selection stages. Motivated by the finding, unlike the previous studies designed for general time-series data, we propose a novel data imputation model to represent patterns and their cyclic rotations in electric load data. Simulation studies reveal that the proposed model works well when the time window size is a divisor of the cycle length, which significantly reduces model selection efforts. Numerical results with two real data sets justify our findings and the performance of the proposed approach against benchmark methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aenergy efficiency 3afactor analysis 3amodels 3atime series analysis 0aMissing data imputation 0aBuilding electric load data 0aTime series data 0aMixture factor analysis 0aCurve pattern analysis1 aPark, Chiwoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2463-89011 aKo, Young Myoung1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0659-66880 tApplied energy.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 304 p.117655-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1176553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03755naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013700154300001800291500001400309520189200323592002802215650001602243650001602259650001402275650002802289650001702317650001802334650002802352650003002380650001402410650002502424650002002449650002502469650001602494650001502510650001502525650001702540650001902557650001802576650003002594650001102624650001602635650001702651650000902668650001302677650002202690651001002712700001202722700002202734700001402756700001202770700001702782700001902799700001702818700001502835700001702850700001702867773012602884856007403010852000903084655001203093IND60719113620221120054632.0201126e20201118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071911362DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo01731k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Jie14aThe chemopreventive effects of Huangqin-tea against AOM-induced preneoplastic colonic aberrant crypt foci in rats and omics analysis  ap. 9634-9650.  aNAL-light  aDespite that colorectal cancer (CRC) is a severe global health problem, effective chemopreventive strategies against CRC are still lacking. Huang-qin tea (HQT), a healthy herbal tea, is prepared from the aerial parts of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and has been consumed in China for thousands of years. HQT contains abundant flavonoids, which display potent anticancer effects, but no research studies have investigated the cancer-preventive effects of HQT on CRC in vivo. Here, we found that HQT inhibits azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation in a preneoplastic colonic ACF rat model. The essential role of the gut microbiota in the chemopreventive effect of HQT on CRC in a pseudo-germ-free rat model was confirmed. Besides, HQT modulates inflammatory cytokine expression by significantly decreasing IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α expression, and elevating IFN-γ production. 16S rDNA sequencing analysis indicated that HQT regulated the gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria (Lachnoclostridium, Alistipes, Roseburia, and Lactococcus) and reducing the levels of Bacteroides, Parasutterella, and unidentified_Clostridiales. Fecal metabolomics showed that HQT modulated the AOM-induced metabolomic disorder, and these altered metabolites were almost involved in the lipid metabolic pathways. The Spearman correlation analysis revealed a correlation between the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites. Collectively, these results suggested that HQT exerted beneficial effects on host health by inhibiting inflammation, and by regulating the gut microbiota profile and certain metabolic pathways. In conclusion, HQT inhibits AOM-induced ACF formation by modulating the gut microbiota composition and improving metabolomic disorders, indicating the potential of HQT as a functional beverage candidate for the prevention and treatment of CRC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aLactococcus 3aRoseburia 3aScutellaria baicalensis 3aaerial parts 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic activity 3abeneficial microorganisms 3abeverages 3abiochemical pathways 3achemoprevention 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acorrelation 3aflavonoids 3aherbal tea 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipids 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3arats 3aresearch 3asequence analysis 3aChina1 aLi, Pei1 aLiu, Shuangshuang1 aLiu, Qing1 aLi, Yue1 aZhang, Zheng1 aYang, Chengmin1 aHu, Mengying1 aSun, Yuhua1 aHe, Chunnian1 aXiao, Peigen0 tFood & function.g2020 Nov. 18, v. 11, no. 11 p.9634-9650dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo01731k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001200184245012500196300002000321506007600341520171900417592002802136506003702164650002002201650001602221650001002237650001402247650002402261650001102285650001202296650001302308650001702321650001302338650001302351650003002364700002002394700001702414700001802431700002302449700002102472700002202493773017602515856008302691852000902774655001202783IND4481643220221207121321.0120502e20111227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448164322DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11191811092doi7 aPMC32485452pmcid7 a221607152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Jie10aHistone deacetylase inhibitors prevent the degradation and restore the activity of glucocerebrosidase in Gaucher disease  ap. 21200-21205.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGaucher disease (GD) is caused by a spectrum of genetic mutations within the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase). These mutations often lead to misfolded proteins that are recognized by the unfolded protein response system and are degraded through the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Modulating this pathway with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) has been shown to improve protein stability in other disease settings. To identify the mechanisms involved in the regulation of GCase and determine the effects of HDACis on protein stability, we investigated the most prevalent mutations for nonneuronopathic (N370S) and neuronopathic (L444P) GD in cultured fibroblasts derived from GD patients and HeLa cells transfected with these mutations. The half-lives of mutant GCase proteins correspond to decreases in protein levels and enzymatic activity. GCase was found to bind to Hsp70, which directed the protein to TCP1 for proper folding, and to Hsp90, which directed the protein to the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Using a known HDACi (SAHA) and a unique small-molecule HDACi (LB-205), GCase levels increased rescuing enzymatic activity in mutant cells. The increase in the quantity of protein can be attributed to increases in protein half-life that correspond primarily with a decrease in degradation rather than an increase in chaperoned folding. HDACis reduce binding to Hsp90 and prevent subsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation without affecting binding to Hsp70 or TCP1. These findings provide insight into the pathogenesis of GD and indicate a potent therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of GD and other human protein misfolding disorders.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenzyme activity 3afibroblasts 3agenes 3ahalf life 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahumans 3amutants 3amutation 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aproteins 3aunfolded protein response1 aYang, Chunzhang1 aChen, Masako1 aYe, Donald Y.1 aLonser, Russell R.1 aBrady, Roscoe O.1 aZhuang, Zhengping0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Dec. 27, v. 108, no. 52 p.21200-21205dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11191811093Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013800167300001600305520114400321592002801465650001701493650002901510650000901539650001701548650001201565650001201577650001401589650001401603650001001617651000901627700002001636700001901656700001501675700001801690700002101708773011101729856004801840852000901888655001201897IND50061937820221117223641.0130320e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006193782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-012-0081-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl Adawi, A.

Although it has previously been assumed that this beetle plays a role in the dispersal of the pathogen, this has not been established experimentally. The aim of this study was to determine whether H. mangiferae vectors C. manginecans from infected to healthy mango trees. A survey conducted in northern Al Batinah region of Oman revealed that H. mangiferae was closely associated with mango sudden decline disease symptoms and it was found on trees in the early stages of the disease. Healthy, 2-year-old mango seedlings were exposed to H. mangiferae collected from diseased mango trees. Seedlings were infested by the bark beetles and after 6 weeks, typical mango sudden decline disease symptoms were observed. Ceratocystis manginecans was isolated from the wilted mango seedlings while uncolonized control seedlings remained healthy. The results show that H. mangiferae vectors C. manginecans in Oman and is, therefore, an important factor in the epidemiology of this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratocystis 3aHypocryphalus mangiferae 3abark 3abark beetles 3adecline 3amangoes 3apathogens 3aseedlings 3atrees 3aOman1 aAl Jabri, R.

Ferralsols can present anomalous behavior when dispersion is performed for grain size analysis using settling methods. This study evaluates the effect of total dispersion and dispersed solution stability of two Ferralsols from Brazil, under cultivated areas and native savannah vegetation with or without organic matter removal using hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), on percent clay, silt, and sand estimation. Samples of a Rhodic Ferralsol and an Orthic Ferralsol were dispersed using a reciprocating shaker for 16 h at 120 rpm in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solutions. Results show that chemical modifications associated with agriculture alter the dispersion behavior of the two Ferralsols. Removal of organic matter in cultivated areas caused coagulation of fine particles. For native vegetation sites, removal of organic matter increased soil dispersion increasing clay content and decreasing sand content. NaOH was not an effective dispersant agent in all conditions and thus there is a need for investigating better chemical compounds or combinations of thereof for the dispersion of Ferralsols. Standardization of grain size analysis of Ferralsols is needed for comparisons between different studies and laboratories to be possible.  aThis research was funded by the Fundação de Apoio à Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF) [Foundation for Research Support of the Federal District-Brazil] grant 0193.001701/2017.  aPublisher supplied data  a0193.001701/2017 3aFerralsols 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3acoagulation 3adispersants 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindigenous species 3aorganic matter 3aplant analysis 3asand 3asand fraction 3asavannas 3asilt 3asodium hydroxide 3aBrazil 0aLatossolo 0aOxisol 0aCerrado 0ano-tillage 0aPanicum maximum1 aWendt, Thatiane Degrandis1 aCampos, Geovana Alves Santos1 ade Figueiredo, Cícero Célio0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2022 June 17, v. 53, no. 11 p.1311-1325dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2022.20460293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245002800167300001600195520154300211592002801754650001901782650002301801650001201824650002001836650001601856650001601872650001101888650001901899650001301918650002001931650001101951650001101962650002101973700001701994773012202011856004802133852000902181655001202190IND4486047520221120045515.0120510e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448604752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-011-0359-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoucks, Daniel P.10aManaging water for life  ap. 255-264.  aWater is essential for life. In spite of the entire engineering infrastructure devoted to the treatment, regulation and beneficial uses of water, occasionally sufficient quantities and qualities of water become scarce. When this happens, just how do we decide how much less water to allocate to all of us and the activities we engage in to sustain and enhance our quality of life? This paper addresses some of the complexities of answering such a question, especially as society increasingly recognizes the need to provide flow regimes that will maintain healthy aquatic and floodplain ecosystems that also impact the economic, physical and even the spiritual quality of our lives. For we depend on these ecosystems to sustain our wellbeing. We are indeed a part of our ecosystems. We depend upon on aquatic ecosystems to moderate river flow qualities and quantities, reduce the extremes of floods and droughts, reduce erosion, detoxify and decompose waterborne wastes, generate and preserve flood plain soils and renew their fertility, regulate disease carrying organisms, and to enhance recreational benefits of river systems. This question of deciding just how much water to allocate to each water user and for the maintenance of viable aquatic ecosystems, especially when there is not enough, is a complex, and largely political, issue. This issue is likely to become even more complex and political and contentious in the future as populations grow and as water quantities and their qualities become even more variable and uncertain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvial soils 3aaquatic ecosystems 3adrought 3aeconomic impact 3aengineering 3afloodplains 3afloods 3ainfrastructure 3apolitics 3aquality of life 3arivers 3awastes 3awater management1 aJia, Haifeng0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2012 Apr., v. 6, no. 2 p.255-264dSpringer-Verlagx2095-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-011-0359-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002100172245009300193300001600286520158000302592002801882650001601910650001201926650002401938650001201962650002401974650001101998650001502009650001602024650002402040650001202064650001102076650003802087650002302125650002702148650002502175650002302200650001202223650004702235650002802282651001202310651001202322653001202334653002402346653003302370653000802403653000902411653001202420653002202432700002202454700002002476700002002496700002102516773012702537856008802664852000902752655001202761IND50061775720221120032334.0190318e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006177572DNAL7 a229954742pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByrne, Andrew W.10aFactors affecting European badger (Meles meles) capture numbers in one county in Ireland  ap. 128-135.  aUnderstanding factors affecting the number of badgers captured at and around badger setts (burrows) is of considerable applied importance. These factors could be used to estimate probable badger densities for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) control and also for monitoring badger populations from a conservation perspective. Furthermore, badger management and vaccination programs would benefit by increasing the probability of efficiently capturing the target badger populations. Within this context, it was investigated whether badger capture numbers can be estimated from field signs and previous capture histories. Badger capture records (initial and repeated capture numbers at a sett) from a large-scale removal program (405km2, 643setts) were used. Univariable count models indicated that there were a number of significant potential predictors of badger numbers, during initial capture attempts. Using a multivariable zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model of initial captures we found that badger capture numbers were significantly affected by sett type, season, year, and the number of sett entrances in active use. Badger capture numbers were also affected by the total previous catch during repeated capture events and by the number of previous capture attempts. There was a significant negative trend in badger captures across events. Measures of the ability of these models to estimate badger captures suggested that the models might be useful in estimating badger numbers across a population; however the confidence intervals associated with these predictions were large.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeles meles 3abadgers 3abovine tuberculosis 3aburrows 3aconfidence interval 3amodels 3aprediction 3avaccination 2aAnimal Distribution 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aModels, Biological 2aMustelidaexphysiology 2aPoisson Distribution 2aPopulation Density 2aSeasons 2aTuberculosis, Bovinexprevention & control 2aVaccinationxveterinary 3aIreland 0aIreland 0aBadgers 0aBovine tuberculosis 0aGeneralized linear modelling 0aZIP 0aZINB 0aPoisson 0aNegative binomial1 aO’Keeffe, James1 aSleeman, Paddy,1 aDavenport, John1 aMartin, S.

The purpose of this study was to study the effect of pitting and organic fertilizers on the growth and physiological characteristics of vetiver grass in drought stress conditions. After cultivating the seedlings in the pots in the greenhouse and their growth for three months, the seedlings were transformed to the field and the treatments were applied to them for six months. This experiment was conducted as a factorial experiment based on randomized complete block design in the field. The treatments applied to the seedlings were cultivation with pitting and without pitting, three levels of fertilizer (0, 150, and 300 kg fertilizer per hectare), and two levels of irrigation determined based on field capacity (FC) (FC and 1/4FC). After harvest, the plants were transferred to the laboratory for measurements. The results showed that by applying pitting and fertilizers, shoot height changed from 9.8 cm to 16.68 cm, root length from 18.81 cm to 25.55 cm, potassium (K) from 25.95 mg/kg to 34.30 mg/kg, calcium (Ca) from 1.20 mg/kg in pitting treatment to 2.27 mg/kg in non-pitting treatment, phenol from 0.22 mg/g DW to 0.83 mg/g DW and phosphorus (P) from 2.99 mg/kg to 11.95 mg/kg. The results indicated the interactive effects of organic fertilizer and pitting due to improvement in soil physicochemical conditions and increase in growth and nutrient uptake of vetiver grass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysopogon zizanioides 3adrought 3afield capacity 3agreenhouses 3anutrient content 3anutrient uptake 3aorganic fertilizers 3aphenol 3aphosphorus 3aplant analysis 3apotassium 3awater stress 3aIran 0aDrought stress 0aphysiological characteristics 0ashoot length1 aPessarakli, Mohammad0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2022 June 17, v. 53, no. 11 p.1326-1333dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2022.20460303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04523naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006600142245015300208500002000361520273500381592002803116596003203144596009103176650004703267650001203314650002003326650001503346650001203361650002603373650002603399650001503425650001303440650001203453650003003465650001603495650001603511650001503527651001803542700005803560700002003618700002203638700002403660700006503684700005803749773013603807856007703943852000904020655001204029IND60772069620221119013716.0220331e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077206962DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JC0157492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScarlat, Raul Cristian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3622-740210aSea Ice and Atmospheric Parameter Retrieval From Satellite Microwave Radiometers: Synergy of AMSR2 and SMOS Compared With the CIMR Candidate Mission  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResearch on improving the prediction skill of climate models requires refining the quality of observational data used for initializing and tuning the models. This is especially true in the polar regions where uncertainties about the interactions between sea ice, ocean, and atmosphere are driving ongoing monitoring efforts. The Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) is an European Space Agency (ESA) candidate mission which promises to offer high resolution, low uncertainty observation capabilities at the 1.4, 6.9, 10.65, 18.7, and 36.5 GHz frequencies. To assess the potential impact of CIMR for sea ice parameter retrieval, a comparison is made between retrievals based on present AMSR2 observations and a retrieval using future CIMR equivalent observations over a data set of validated sea ice concentration (SIC) values. An optimal estimation retrieval method (OEM) is used which can use input from different channel combinations to retrieve seven geophysical parameters (sea ice concentration, multi‐year ice fraction, ice surface temperature, columnar water vapor, liquid water path, over ocean wind speed, and sea surface temperature). An advantage of CIMR over existing radiometers is that it would provide higher spatial resolution observations at the lower frequency channels (6.9, 10.65, and 18.7 GHz) which are less sensitive to atmospheric influence. This enables the passive microwave based retrieval of SIC and other surface parameters with higher resolution and lower uncertainty than is currently possible. An information content analysis expands the comparison between AMSR2 and CIMR to all retrievable surface and atmospheric parameters. This analysis quantifies the contributions to the observed signal and highlights the differences between different input channel combinations. The higher resolution of the low frequency CIMR channels allow for unprecedented detail to be achieved in Arctic passive microwave sea ice retrievals. The presence of 1.4 GHz channels on board CIMR opens up the possibility for thin sea ice thickness (SIT) retrieval. A combination of collocated AMSR2 and SMOS observations is used to simulate a full CIMR suite of measurements, and the OEM is modified to include SIT as a retrieval parameter. The output from different retrieval configurations is compared with an operational SIT product. The CIMR instrument can provide increased accuracy for SIC retrieval at very high resolutions with a combination of the 18.7 and 36.5 GHz channels while also maintaining sensitivity for atmospheric water vapor retrieval. In combination with the 1.4 GHz channels, SIT can be added as an eighth retrieval parameter with performance on par with existing operational products.  aPublisher supplied data  cEuropean Space Agency (ESA)  a268020496‐TRR 172cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) 3aSoil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite 3aclimate 3adata collection 3ageophysics 3aliquids 3amicrowave radiometers 3aobservational studies 3aprediction 3aresearch 3asea ice 3asurface water temperature 3auncertainty 3awater vapor 3awind speed 3aArctic region1 aSpreen, Gunnar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0165-84481 aHeygster, Georg1 aHuntemann, Marcus1 aPaţilea, Cătălin1 aPedersen, Leif Toudal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7913-62821 aSaldo, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4716-438X0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Mar., v. 125, no. 3 p.e2019JC015749-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JC0157493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03769naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012900165520210500294592002802399650003902427650002502466650001702491650000902508650002502517650002402542650001802566650001502584650002702599650001302626650000902639650000902648650002102657650001502678650001802693651002402711653002702735653001702762653002002779653003002799653003902829700002602868700002702894700003002921700002702951700003802978700002203016773010803038856008403146852000903230655001203239IND60776011620221118085520.0220523e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077601162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2022.1054212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDutta, Asik10aImpact of long-term residue burning versus retention on soil organic carbon sequestration under a rice-wheat cropping system  aDespite rice residue burning is popularized against its retention under rice-wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), limited information is available on the impacts of long-term rice residue burning versus its retention on carbon stock, soil aggregation and aggregated-associated carbon in the region. Hence, a 18 (1998–2016) years old conservation agriculture (different combinations of tillage and residue management) experiment was selected to understand the impact of CA on soil aggregation, carbon pools and soil organic carbon (SOC) stock in a rice-wheat system. Experiment was laid down in a split-plot design with three replications having three tillage management viz. zero-tillage (ZT), conventional tillage (CT) and strip tillage (ST) as main plots and three residue management options namely residue retention (R), residue burning (RB) and no-residue (NR). The total SOC content was 20% higher (p < 0.05) under ZT and residues retention over CT and residue removal, in the 0–5 cm layer. The SOC stock increased with depth (from 0 to 5 cm to 5–15 cm). ZT with added residues had 25% higher (p < 0.05) SOC stock than CT without residues because of higher aggregation with lesser disturbance in ZT promoted SOC accumulation over time. Macro-aggregate fraction was higher in ZT by 18% (p < 0.05) than CT in the 0–5 cm soil depth. Whereas, CT without residues resulted in higher silt and clay size fraction than ZT. Labile carbon (very labile + labile fractions) was 7–25% increased (p < 0.05) under ZT+R than CT-R across depth. Recalcitrant carbon (less-labile + non-labile) followed the same trend. Notably, ZT with residues retention (conservation agriculture, CA) increased 32.6–41.7% potassium permanganate oxidizable carbon than CT without residues in the 0–5 cm and 5–15 cm, respectively. No mechanical tillage in ZT with added residues over the years promoted bridging between aggregates that brought about carbon accumulation. The study highlighted the importance of CA in enhancing SOC stock, soil aggregation and managing long-term SOC content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural conservation practice 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aclay 3aconventional tillage 3aexperimental design 3alabile carbon 3ano-tillage 3apotassium permanganate 3aresearch 3arice 3asilt 3asoil aggregation 3asoil depth 3astrip tillage 3aIndo-Gangetic Plain 0aAggregate distribution 0aCarbon pools 0aResidue burning 0aSoil organic carbon stock 0aZero tillage and residue retention1 aBhattacharyya, Ranjan1 aChaudhary, Ved Prakash1 aSharma, C.q(Chhemendra),1 aNath, Chaitanya Prasad1 aKumar, S.

The yield of soluble xylanases increased with decreasing cultivation temperature and inducer level. In addition, co-expression of DnaKJE chaperone resulted in increased soluble xylanases though the time of induction of chaperone and target protein had a bearing on this yield. A combination of chaperone co-expression and partial induction resulted in ∼40% (in DnaKJE) and 33% (in GroEL–GroES) of total xylanase yield in soluble fraction. However, the conditions for maximum yield of soluble r-XynB and maximum % soluble expression of r-XynB were different. Higher expression of soluble xylanases in a scalable semi-synthetic medium showed potential of the process for soluble enzyme production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3acell growth 3agrowth models 3amolecular chaperones 3arecombinant proteins 3atemperature 3axylanases 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aEndo-1,4-beta Xylanasesxbiosynthesis 2aEscherichia colixcytologyxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aIsopropyl Thiogalactosidexpharmacology 2aMolecular Chaperonesxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aSolubility 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors1 aSahoo, Debendra K.0 tBioresource technology.g2012 Nov., v. 123 p.135-143dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01974naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012500164300001600289520093800305592002801243650001901271650002801290651001201318651001901330651001801349700001501367700002001382700002101402700001901423773011601442856008101558852000901639655001201648IND60481136220221118153151.0160202e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048113622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-015-9928-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanley, Nick10aEmpirical Testing of Genuine Savings as an Indicator of Weak Sustainability: A Three-Country Analysis of Long-Run Trends  ap. 313-338.  aGenuine Savings has emerged as a widely-used indicator of sustainable development. This approach to conceptualising what sustainability is about has strong links to work published by Anil Markandya and colleagues over 20 years ago. In this paper, we use long-term data stretching back to 1870 to undertake empirical tests of the relationship between Genuine Savings (GS) and future well-being for three countries: Britain, the USA and Germany. Our tests are based on an underlying theoretical relationship between GS and changes in the present value of future consumption. Based on both single country and panel results, we find evidence supporting the existence of a cointegrating (long run equilibrium) relationship between GS and future well-being, and fail to reject the basic theoretical result on the relationship between these two macroeconomic variables. This provides some support for the GS measure of weak sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3amacroeconomics 3asustainable development 3aGermany 3aUnited Kingdom 3aUnited States1 aOxley, Les1 aGreasley, David1 aMcLaughlin, Eoin1 aBlum, Matthias0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2016 Feb., v. 63, no. 2 p.313-338dSpringer Netherlandsx0924-64607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-015-9928-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010000173300001800273500001500291520104900306592002801355650001901383650002201402650002601424650001101450650001401461650001901475650001501494650002001509650001401529650001101543650000701554650001401561650001601575650001901591650001801610650002301628653001801651700002201669700001901691773010601710856008101816852000901897655001201906IND60121078320221120085439.0150214e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012107832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8223-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Hamdi, Abdullah M.10aPhotocatalytic degradation of phenol in aqueous solution by rare earth-doped SnO2 nanoparticles  ap. 5151-5159.  a2019-12-04  aThe influence of heterogeneous semiconductors on the photodegradation of phenol in water was investigated using doped tin dioxide (SnO₂) nanoparticles. Photocatalysts of SnO₂were synthesized with lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), and neodymium (Nd) dopants. These photocatalysts were synthesized from tin tetrachloride by sol–gel method with different dopant concentrations, and its photocatalytic degradation was investigated up to 0.8 % under UV-A light in aqueous suspensions. The photocatalytic oxidation reactions were studied by varying photocatalyst composition, light intensity, reaction time, pH of the reaction medium, and phenol concentration. It was found that the photocatalytic activity of rare earth-doped SnO₂for phenol decomposition under UV light irradiation was considerably higher than that of pure SnO₂nanoparticles. The experimental results also indicate that more than 95 % phenol was effectively oxidized in the presence of an aqueous suspension of La: SnO₂nanoparticles within 120 min of UV light irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3asemiconductors 3aaqueous solutions 3aultraviolet radiation 3acerium 3alanthanum 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3alight intensity 3aneodymium 3aphenol 3apH 3aoxidation 3airradiation 3aphotocatalysts 3ananoparticles 3asol-gel processing 0aphotocatalyst1 aSillanpää, Mika1 aDutta, Joydeep0 tJournal of materials science.g2014 July, v. 49, no. 14 p.5151-5159dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-014-8223-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009000167300001400257520106100271592002801332650001401360650001301374650001801387650003201405650001201437650001201449650001301461650004401474650003301518650002601551650002401577650001301601651002101614653002501635653002101660653002301681653004401704653002701748700001801775700001801793700001801811773010401829856005101933852000901984655001201993IND50087621620221120123310.0140412e20110324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008762162DNAL7 a10.1080/21501203.2011.5549062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Changon10aPTP1B inhibitory secondary metabolites from the Antarctic lichen Lecidella carpathica  ap. 18-23.  aProtein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is an attractive therapeutic target for diabetes, playing a major role in negative regulation of the insulin signaling pathway. Bioassay-guided investigations of an MeOH extract of the Antarctic lichen, Lecidella carpathica, afforded three PTP1B inhibitory metabolites: hopane-6α,22-diol (1), brialmontin 1 (2), and atraric acid (3), along with two aromatic metabolites (4 and 5) previously isolated from a different Antarctic lichen species. Their structures were determined by analysis of NMR and MS data. Compounds 1–3 inhibited PTP1B activity in a dose-dependent manner with IC₅₀ values of 3.7, 14.0 and 51.5 μM, respectively, and kinetic analyses of PTP1B inhibition by compounds 1 and 2 suggested that these compounds inhibit PTP1B activity in a competitive manner. In addition, 6,22-hopanediol (1) displayed some selectivity toward PTP1B over other protein tyrosine phosphatases, such as TCPTP (IC₅₀ = 8.4 μM), SHP-2 (IC₅₀ > 68 μM), LAR (IC₅₀ > 68 μM), and CD45 (IC₅₀ > 68 μM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLecidella 3adiabetes 3adose response 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainsulin 3alichens 3amethanol 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3asecondary metabolites 3asignal transduction 3atyrosine 3aAntarctic region 0aLecidella carpathica 0aAntarctic lichen 0alichen metabolites 0aprotein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) 0acompetitive inhibitors1 aHanYim, Joung1 aKum Lee, Hong1 aOh, Hyuncheol0 tMycology.g2011 Mar. 24, v. 2, no. 1 p.18-23dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000125x2150-12037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21501203.2011.554906  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245012800204506007600332520138200408592002801790506003701818650001101855650001301866650002001879650001801899650001201917650001601929650001501945650001401960650002101974650001201995650001802007650001602025700002602041700001802067700001902085700002802104700002502132773012302157856007402280852000902354655001202363IND60674536820221207100245.0191025e20191014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067453682DNAL7 a10.3390/nu111024422doi7 aPMC68360172pmcid7 a316149922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRynders, Corey  A.10aEffectiveness of Intermittent Fasting and Time-Restricted Feeding Compared to Continuous Energy Restriction for Weight Loss  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe current obesity epidemic is staggering in terms of its magnitude and public health impact. Current guidelines recommend continuous energy restriction (CER) along with a comprehensive lifestyle intervention as the cornerstone of obesity treatment, yet this approach produces modest weight loss on average. Recently, there has been increased interest in identifying alternative dietary weight loss strategies that involve restricting energy intake to certain periods of the day or prolonging the fasting interval between meals (i.e., intermittent energy restriction, IER). These strategies include intermittent fasting (IMF; >60% energy restriction on 2&ndash;3 days per week, or on alternate days) and time-restricted feeding (TRF; limiting the daily period of food intake to 8&ndash;10 h or less on most days of the week). Here, we summarize the current evidence for IER regimens as treatments for overweight and obesity. Specifically, we review randomized trials of &ge;8 weeks in duration performed in adults with overweight or obesity (BMI &ge; 25 kg/m2) in which an IER paradigm (IMF or TRF) was compared to CER, with the primary outcome being weight loss. Overall, the available evidence suggests that IER paradigms produce equivalent weight loss when compared to CER, with 9 out of 11 studies reviewed showing no differences between groups in weight or body fat loss.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3aenergy intake 3afasting 3afood intake 3aguidelines 3alifestyle 3alow calorie diet 3aobesity 3apublic health 3aweight loss1 aThomas, Elizabeth A.,1 aZaman, Adnin 1 aPan, Zhaoxing 1 aCatenacci, Victoria  A.1 aMelanson, Edward  L.0 tNutrients.g2019 Oct. 14, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu111024423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245012800177300001600305520123800321592002801559650002201587650001501609650001101624650001401635650002301649650001101672650001201683650001301695650002401708650001901732650003301751650001001784653001601794653002001810653001301830653001501843653002801858700002401886700002401910700002401934773010801958856008502066852000902151655001202160IND60561299820221120181718.0180830e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056129982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, Flávio L.S.10aBio-ethanol steam reforming for hydrogen production over Co3O4/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by one-step polymerization method  ap. 182-191.  aBio-ethanol is a renewable energy carrier and its use in the reforming of bio-ethanol is promising for hydrogen production. In this work, a set of materials containing mixtures of Co3O4/CeO2 (5, 10 and 20% Cowt.%) were synthesized by one-step polymerization method (OSP method), and were tested in ethanol steam reforming (SRE). For comparison purposes, the best catalyst of this set was compared with a similar one synthesized by the impregnation method. The XRD, SEM and TPR analyses of the CoCe catalysts prepared by the OSP method showed that the increase of the cobalt content increases Co–O–Ce interaction, this interaction had positive effects on the catalysis of SRE. The OSP method provides a more homogeneous material leading to finely dispersed metallic cobalt which favored the catalysis of the SRE at 500°C; the best catalyst was the Co3O4/CeO2 mixture with cobalt content of 20wt.% (20CoCe catalyst). This catalyst reported high metallic dispersion, high-surface-area, high selectivity to H2, good catalytic stability and low carbon deposition rate. This catalyst is promising for the steam reforming of bio-ethanol. The catalyst prepared by the impregnation method was not good for the catalysis of SRE at 500°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abioethanol 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3aethanol 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asteam 0aBio-ethanol 0aSteam-reforming 0aHydrogen 0aCo3O4/CeO2 0aOne-step polymerization1 aAsencios, Yvan J.O.1 aBellido, Jorge D.A.1 aAssaf, Elisabete M.0 tFuel processing technology.g2016 Feb., v. 142 p.182-191dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001600161245013400177300001400311520080500325592002801130650001201158650001501170650001101185650001301196650002301209650001701232650002601249650001001275650001701285650001001302650001201312650001101324650001301335650005001348650002101398650003601419650005401455650001001509700001101519700001401530700001701544700001401561700001701575700002001592700001401612700001701626700001301643773010501656856004501761852000901806655001201815IND4482679220221122031631.0120302e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448267922DNAL7 a221400072pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2011006002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yupu10aDetermination of sulfonamides in livers using matrix solid‐phase dispersion extraction high‐performance liquid chromatography  ap. 45-52.  aThe matrix solid‐phase dispersion (MSPD) was applied for extracting seven sulfonamides (SAs) in liver samples.

This study explores to fabricate nanocomposite functional fibers by embedding highly oriented graphene oxide (GO) into the poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix. The GO/PVA nanocomposite fibers were prepared via gel spinning and subsequent hot drawing process. The tensile strength of the produced GO/PVA nanocomposite fibers was significantly enhanced owing to the uniformly dispersed and oriented GO nanosheets. Additionally, the ultraviolet protection factor of the highly aligned GO/PVA nanocomposite fibers is about 16 times than that of the neat PVA fiber. The as-prepared GO/PVA nanocomposite fibers also exhibit significant activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. This highly aligned and integrated approach suggests an effective method to prepare graphene-based nanocomposites fibers with high performances and novel functional characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aantibacterial properties 3afunctional properties 3agels 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3aspinning 3atensile strength 3atextile industry 0aFibers 0aMultifunctional composites 0aPolymer-matrix composites (PMCs) 0aMechanical testing1 aRen, Nan1 aChao, Yuanzhi1 aLan, Huilin1 aYan, Xiaojie1 aSha, Yan1 aSha, Xiaolin1 aBai, Yongxiao0 tComposites.g2017 Nov., v. 102 p.297-304dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2017.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245022600164300001800390520125300408592002801661650001201689650001101701650002301712650003301735650001101768650003301779650001201812650002101824650002401845700001601869700001701885700001101902700001701913700001301930773010601943856008102049852000902130655001202139IND60121078620221120095434.0150214e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012107862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8225-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Lingling10aIn-chain multi-functionalized random butadiene–styrene copolymer via anionic copolymerization with 1,1-bis(4-dimethylaminophenyl)ethylene: synthesis and its application as a rubber matrix of carbon black-based composite  ap. 5171-5181.  aIn-chain multi-functionalized random butadiene–styrene copolymer possessing definite dimethylamino groups along the polymer backbone, poly(butadiene-co-styrene-co-1,1-bis(4-dimethylaminophenyl)ethylene) (poly(Bd-co-St-co-BDADPE)), has been designed and synthesized via living anionic copolymerization of excess BDADPE with butadiene and styrene in benzene at 50 °C, using sec-butyllithium as initiator. The incorporation of BDADPE unit results in increases both in glass transition temperature and thermal decomposition temperature of the terpolymers. Such multiple dimethylamino groups along the rubber backbone effectively improve the dispersity of carbon black (CB) in the corresponding composites, as verified by scanning electronic microscopy observation. Also the tensile strength, elongation at break and the value of dynamic loss coefficient at 0 °C of the CB/poly(Bd-co-St-co-BDADPE) vulcanized composites, are significantly enhanced. This in-chain multi-functionalization of matrix rubber via anionic copolymerization employing BDADPE as copolymerizable monomer, provides a facile and effective method to prepare CB-based rubber composites with improved tensile strength and elongation at break, as well as good wet skid resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3acarbon 3acomposite polymers 3aglass transition temperature 3arubber 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astyrene 3atensile strength 3athermal degradation1 aMa, Hongwei1 aWang, Qiuyun1 aLi, Li1 aWang, Yurong1 aLi, Yang0 tJournal of materials science.g2014 July, v. 49, no. 14 p.5171-5181dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-014-8225-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245010900207300001600316500001900332520111600351592002801467650001401495650000901509650001301518650002301531650001201554650001301566650001301579650002001592653001501612653001101627653000901638653002001647653002301667653001001690653001001700653001001710653000701720653000701727653001101734653000901745653000701754653000901761653000701770700002001777700002101797700002401818773014601842856008301988852000902071655001202080IND60675421420221118004036.0200110e20200129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067542142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChikazawa, Miho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7447-838710aBridging molecules are secreted from the skeletal muscle and potentially regulate muscle differentiation  ap. 113-120.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMuscle myogenesis is an essential step for muscle development and recovery. During muscle fusion, multiple molecules are thought to be necessary for the formation of normal myotubes. Milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) and Gas6 are phosphatidylserine-recognizing bridging molecules that are secreted mainly from immune cells. In this study, we confirmed that these molecules are expressed and secreted from C2C12 cells. Mouse muscle and satellite cells also expressed these molecules. MFG-E8 was highly expressed and secreted in both undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 cells. We observed that MFG-E8 and Gas6 were bound to the surface of differentiated C2C12 cells more compared with undifferentiated cells.Additionally, the treatment of recombinant MFG-E8 upregulated expression of myogenic genes and suppressed apoptosis during myogenesis in C2C12 cells. In this paper, we discuss the presence of novel functional molecules expressed and secreted in the skeletal muscle. The results of this study suggest that bridging molecules are one of the determinants of myogenesis or other muscle responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3amice 3amilk fat 3amuscle development 3amuscles 3amyotubes 3aresearch 3askeletal muscle 0aMyogenesis 0aMFG-E8 0aGas6 0aSatellite cells 0aPhosphatidylserine 0aABCA1 0aBaCl2 0aBAI-1 0aDM 0aGM 0aMFG-E8 0aMyh3 0aPS 0aRAGE 0aTA1 aShimizu, Makoto1 aYamauchi, Yoshio1 aSatō, Ryūichirō,0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Jan. 29, v. 522, no. 1 p.113-120dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245011600162300001600278520115100294592002801445650001701473650001301490650001501503650001201518650001701530650001801547650001401565650001401579650001101593650001001604700002201614773010201636856004801738852000901786655001201795IND4476962520221120210845.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447696252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-011-0798-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalra, Charu10aStimulatory and period-specific effect of nitric oxide on in vitro caulogenesis in Albizzia lebbeck (L.) Benth.  ap. 387-392.  aThe paper reports stimulatory effect of nitric oxide (NO) on in vitro caulogenesis in Albizzia lebbeck, a tree legume. Exogenously supplied NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) stimulated shoot differentiation from hypocotyl explants of Albizzia lebbeck, excised from its in vitro seedlings. Potassium ferrocyanide, a structural analog of SNP incapable of releasing NO, did not promote shoot organogenesis. Likewise, metabolic products of NO, NO2 − and NO3 −, provided as NaNO2 and NaNO3 did not enhance shoot differentiation. The NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxy-phenyl)-4, 4, 5, 5-tetramethylimideazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO), supplemented along with SNP, at equimolar concentration, reversed the stimulatory effect of the latter, thus, confirming the role of NO in promotion of in vitro caulogenesis. The transfer of explants cultured on the basal medium (BM) to the same containing SNP and vice versa after different time intervals revealed that for its enhancing effect, SNP was required only during the initial phase (5 days) of culture. Its presence or administration beyond 5 days neither promoted nor inhibited the caulogenic response.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaulogenesis 3aexplants 3ahypocotyls 3alegumes 3anitric oxide 3aorganogenesis 3apotassium 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3atrees1 aBabbar, Shashi B.0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2012 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.387-392dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-011-0798-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001600143245009400159300001800253500000900271520106800280592002801348650002101376650002001397650001801417650003101435650001201466650002301478700001801501700001501519700001601534773014001550852000901690856008001699655001201779IND4410016420221118010948.0191228e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441001642DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2007.0413N2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanchi, S.10aChemical and Physical Treatment Effects on Aggregate Breakup in the 0- to 2-mm Size Range  ap. 1418-1421.  aepub  aThe <2-mm size range in soils may contain aggregates as well as primary particles. We investigated the breakup of aggregates <2 mm after applying different chemical and physical agents to 10 samples. Mass-size distributions were obtained by combining wet sieving and x-ray centrifugation after five treatments: water dispersion, chemical dispersion, organic matter removal, physical dispersion, and all of the above combined. The <2-mm range was subdivided into 20 size classes and the fragment production was evaluated with respect to water dispersion. Cluster analysis helped identify similar fragmentation patterns among samples for each determination method. The effectiveness of the single methods differed considerably among samples. Only their combination resulted in pronounced permanent dispersion. An empirical effectiveness index was developed to provide a quantitative assessment of the overall effectiveness of each method. This index indicated that both organic and inorganic binding agents contribute to topsoil aggregation in the <2-mm size range.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil aggregation 3asoil aggregates 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3atopsoil 3abinding properties1 aBonifacio, E.1 aZanini, E.1 aPerfect, E.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2008 Sept., v. 72, no. 5 p.1418-1421dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2007.0413N3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01590naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015900156300001800315520055200333592002800885650001000913650002000923650001100943650002300954650002600977700002301003700001601026700001701042773013401059856007401193852000901267655001201276IND60617783220221119155315.0181026e20180719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061778322DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc04535f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hai-Jun10aTransforming benzylideneamine N,C-chelate boron compounds to BN-cycloocta-/cyclohepta-trienes bearing a tetrasubstituted BN unit via photoisomerization  ap. 8245-8248.  aA series of benzylideneamine N,C-chelate boron compounds have been found to undergo rapid multistructural transformations with UV irradiation, yielding new BN-cycloocta-1,3,6-triene ((4Z,6Z)-1,2,3,8-tetrahydro-1,2-azaborocine) and BN-cyclohepta-1,3,5-triene (2,7-dihydro-1H-1,2-azaborepine) derivatives with a tetrasubstituted BN unit quantitatively.

Catalytic cracking of vacuum gas oil (VGO) and atmospheric residue (AR), specifically the influence of the pore size of the catalysts on the reactivity of VGO and AR, was investigated using a Curie point pyrolyzer, as a new evaluation technique. Comparing the catalytic cracking of VGO with that of AR, the selectivity for gas products in AR cracking was higher than that in VGO cracking, indicating that dealkylation of aromatic components proceeded. With respect to cracking of VGO the conversion was improved due to the increase in diffusion rate of raw materials with increasing pore size for both β and Y zeolite-containing catalysts. In contrast to the reaction of VGO, the remarkable dependence was hardly observed between conversion and pore size in the cracking of AR presumably because AR, which contained large amounts of heavy fractions with higher boiling point than 500°C, was difficult to diffuse even in the inside of large pores.Regarding on the type of zeolite included, more than 70% gasoline selectivity from both VGO and AR was obtained by Y zeolite-containing catalysts. In contrast to this, the gasoline selectivity of about 60% from VGO cracking and 50% from AR cracking, was observed for β zeolite containing catalysts. These results suggested that so-called “supercage”, which is included in the inside of the micropores of Y zeolite, would be rather larger than a similar cage of β zeolite which induced higher gasoline selectivity for Y zeolite-containing catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboiling point 3acatalysts 3acatalytic cracking 3agasoline 3agels 3amicropores 3aoils 3aporosity 3aporous media 3araw materials 3azeolites 0aCatalytic cracking 0aVacuum gas oil 0aAtmospheric residue 0aLarge mesopore 0aGel skeletal reinforcement 0aCurie point pyrolyzer1 aNakanishi, Takehiro1 aNasu, Hiroyuki1 aHashimoto, Tadanori1 aIshihara, Atsushi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6390-88980 tFuel processing technology.g2016 Feb., v. 142 p.337-344dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245014500161300001600306500001500322520194300337592002802280650001502308650001402323650001002337650002102347650003702368650002102405650001102426650003302437650001502470650002302485650001602508650001402524650002302538651001802561651001002579653003602589700001902625700002102644700001302665700001802678700002002696700001702716773010502733856004802838852000902886655001202895IND4470902320221118215054.0120516e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447090232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-012-0526-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuan10aSeasonal variations of concentrations, profiles and possible sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sediments from Taihu Lake, China  ap. 933-941.  a2019-12-06  aPURPOSE: Obtaining a better understanding of the concentrations and origins of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the sediments Taihu Lake, China, is of paramount importance for the environmental protection and remediation of this lake. To investigate temporal and spatial variations in PAH concentrations, composition and possible source categories, 29 sediment samples were collected from Taihu Lake during both the flooding and dry seasons of the lake. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs were detected in 58 surface sediments (29 for each season) by gas chromatograph/mass selective detection, following extraction by accelerated solvent extraction. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The concentrations of the total and individual PAHs in the flooding season were higher than those in the dry season, suggesting that high levels of fishing activity may be an important contributor to PAH pollution in the flooding season. The fractions of high molecular weight PAHs in the flooding season ranged from 63 % to 71 % and were higher than those in the dry season (which ranged from 52 % to 65 %). These results indicate that vehicle exhaust may be a more important pollutant source in the flooding season than in the dry season. Diagnostic ratios, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to study possible source categories in the different seasons. Consistent results were obtained for all techniques. Seasonal and spatial variations were also investigated by the coefficient of divergence method. The results of previous studies support the conclusion of source identification. CONCLUSIONS: Vehicle emissions were the dominant contributor to PAHs in the flooding season, while PAHs in the dry season sediments may have come from multiple sources. The findings of this study may provide a theoretical basis for seasonal PAH control strategies for Taihu Lake.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry season 3asediments 3alakes 3amolecular weight 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3acluster analysis 3afloods 3aprincipal component analysis 3apollutants 3aseasonal variation 3aremediation 3aemissions 3agas chromatography 3aUnited States 3aChina 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency1 aShi, Guo-Liang1 aGuo, Chang-Sheng1 aXu, Jian1 aTian, Ying-Ze1 aFeng, Yin-Chang1 aWang, Yu-Qiu0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2012 June, v. 12, no. 6 p.933-941dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-012-0526-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009000158300001800248520135000266592002801616650001601644650001801660650001701678650001201695700001501707773013301722856007401855852000901929655001201938IND60617429020221122101058.0181025e20180206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061742902DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc09063c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeichmann, J.10aSilicon chemistry in zero to three dimensions: from dichlorosilylene to silafullerane  ap. 1397-1412.  aSilylenes and silanides, prominent Si(ii) species, are not only interesting in their own right, but also constitute important building blocks in oligosilane and organosilane chemistry. The past decade has witnessed tremendous advances in the understanding of the ambiphilic behavior of silylenes and the nucleophilic properties of silanides, as well as the mutual relationships between both species. Especially the readily available SiCl₂/[SiCl₃]⁻ system is intriguing, because it features highly functionalized silicon centers, amenable to late-stage modifications. Moreover, SiCl₂ and [SiCl₃]⁻ are interconvertible by mere chloride association/dissociation. This Feature Article first provides a brief introduction to isolable (functionalized) silylenes and silanides and then focusses on the SiCl₂/[SiCl₃]⁻ couple. Classical high-temperature protocols for the generation of SiCl₂ are juxtaposed with convenient recent solution phase methods that provide access to R₃N–SiCl₂ and [SiCl₃]⁻via deprotonation of HSiCl₃ or the amine-/chloride-induced disproportionation of Si₂Cl₆. We give a comprehensive overview of key mechanistic issues and highlight the utility of R₃N–SiCl₂ and [SiCl₃]⁻ for the synthesis of open-chain and cyclic oligosilanes as well as nanoscale, fullerene-type silicon clusters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3adeprotonation 3adissociation 3asilicon1 aWagner, M.0 tChemical communications.g2018 Feb. 6, v. 54, no. 12 p.1397-1412dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7cc09063c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012500153300001800278500002000296520131300316592002801629596009001657596009001747596008901837650002001926650002101946650001601967650000801983650001601991650002002007650001202027650001402039650004302053650001302096650002202109650001702131650001102148650001802159650002002177651001002197700005302207700001802260700001302278700005502291700001402346700005602360773012302416856007402539852000902613655001202622IND60754002820221121003241.0211020e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075400282DNAL7 a10.1111/are.154572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Mei10aComprehensive analysis of genome‐wide DNA methylation and transcriptomics between ovary and testis in Monopterus albus  ap. 5829-5839.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe ricefield eel (Monopterus albus), a protogynous hermaphroditic Synbranchiform species, is one of the most economically valuable freshwater fish in China. Studies on the sexual change of the ricefield eel will contribute to artificial culture and understanding the sex determination and differentiation in fish. In this study, the whole‐genome DNA methylation and transcriptomes of ovary and testis were analysed in ricefield eel. An elevated methylation level in the genome was observed in the testis compared with the ovary. A total of 457 genes showed a negative correlation between DNA methylation status and expression level in the testis compared with the ovary. Of these genes, 16 candidates were screened on the basis of their vital roles reported in gonadal development. The methylation statuses and expression levels of dnmt3a, piwil1, tdrd1, sox30, nanos2, socs2, mei4 and zmiz1 were further validated using bisulphite sequencing PCR and quantitative real‐time PCR respectively. These potential vital genes would be useful for future studies on the molecular mechanism of sex reversal in ricefield eel. Besides, the integrated analysis of DNA methylation and expression level of gonads provides basic information for epigenetic regulation in the process of sexual reversal in ricefield eel.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020JBF05cCentral Public‐interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund, CAFS  a2018JBF15cCentral Public‐interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund, CAFS  a2020TD33cCentral Public‐interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund, CAFS 3aDNA methylation 3aMonopterus albus 3aaquaculture 3aeel 3aepigenetics 3afreshwater fish 3apaddies 3aprotogyny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresearch 3asex determination 3asex reversal 3atestes 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aChina1 aRuan, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7607-73251 aZhong, Xuqing1 aYe, Huan1 aYue, Huamei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3795-77761 aLi, Zhong1 aLi, Chuangju1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9531-46830 tAquaculture research.g2021 Nov., v. 52, no. 11 p.5829-5839dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.154573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136040001800175100001900193245009500212506007600307506003100383520136400414592002801778596003901806506003701845650001601882650001601898650002001914650002501934650001401959650001401973650001801987650002102005650001702026650001502043650001802058650001602076650001602092650001502108650001902123653001402142653001202156653000902168653001502177653001902192653001602211653000802227653000602235653000702241653000802248700002002256700002602276700005602302700001402358700001702372700001402389773012602403856008602529961001302615852000902628655001202637IND60740210820221207140818.0220523e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074021082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1104532chorus7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1104532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRose, Devin J.10aPulse processing affects gas production by gut bacteria during in vitro fecal fermentation  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aFlatulence is one barrier to pulse consumption for many people. Therefore, we examined how processing affects gas production by the microbiome in three classes of pulses. Processing did not affect gas production from Navy beans. However, in Pardina lentils and green peas, (−1.9 ± 0.3 mL/24 h, p < 0.001; −2.3 ± 0.3 mL/24 h, p < 0.001, respectively). In Pardina lentils and green peas, germination diminished carbohydrate utilization by the microbiome compared with unprocessed samples. In Pardina lentils germination reduced abundance germination resulted in the greatest reduction in gas production among six processing methods of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from Bacteroides and Lachnospiraceae and reduced propionate production compared with unprocessed samples. In green peas, germination reduced ASVs from Lachnospiraceae, including one from Roseburia, and reduced proportion of butyrate production during fermentation. Three ASVs from Clostridium sensu stricto (cluster 1), Megasphaera elsdenii, and unclassified Veillonellaceae, were strongly associated with increased gas production across all samples (ρ = 0.67–0.69, p < 0.001). This study showed that processing can reduce gas production by the microbiome in some pulses, but also reduces saccharolytic fermentation and production of beneficial microbial metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA Agricultural Research Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacteroides 3aClostridium 3aLachnospiraceae 3aMegasphaera elsdenii 3aRoseburia 3abutyrates 3acarbohydrates 3adigestive system 3afermentation 3aflatulence 3afood research 3agermination 3ametabolites 3amicrobiome 3apropionic acid 0aDry beans 0aLentils 0aPeas 0aFlatulence 0aGut microbiome 0aGermination 0aRFO 0aG 0aUN 0aCHO1 aPoudel, Rachana1 aVan Haute, Mallory J.1 aYang, Qinnan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6444-69311 aWang, Lei1 aSingh, Mukti1 aLiu, Sean0 tFood research international.g2021 Sept., v. 147 p.110453-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1104533Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01660naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245010400172300001800276520027000294592002800564650001100592650001400603650001400617650001400631700001200645700002000657700001700677700001700694700002200711700002400733700001600757700002000773700001700793700002300810700002700833700001800860700002100878700001600899700002300915700002100938773011700959856008201076990002301158852000901181655001201190IND60090771420221120064748.0141102e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009077142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2010.12.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuckmelter, Alex J.14aThe Discovery of furo[2,3-c]pyridine-based indanone oximes as potent and selective B-Raf inhibitors  ap. 1248-1252.  aVirtual and high-throughput screening identified imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines as inhibitors of B-Raf.

However, knowledge about how companies can adopt and implement PSS has remained limited. In this study, a systematic literature review is conducted related to understanding implementation of PSS business models and five sets of tactical practices. Based on an in-depth analysis of 67 articles, it was found that PSS is increasing rapidly as a research field, which is spread across a variety of disciplines and research domains. More specifically, research findings were accumulated from the field to present a framework supporting the implementation of well-established categories of PSS business models, that is, product-oriented, use-oriented, and result-oriented business models. Each business model category is linked to five operational-level tactics that ensure the model can be implemented successfully and subsequently generates value. These tactical sets include 1) contracts, 2) marketing, 3) networks, 4) product and service design, and 5) sustainability operational practices. This study concludes by proposing suggestions for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3afield experimentation 3amarketing 3amodels 3aresource management 0aProduct–Service Systems (PSS) 0aBusiness model 0aTactics 0aLiterature review 0aServitization 0aSustainability1 aParida, Vinit1 aÖrtqvist, Daniel0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 June 15, v. 97 p.61-75dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04634naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009700171300001600268520271500284592002802999650001903027650002503046650001303071650001903084650002303103650001203126650002403138650000903162650001803171650002103189650001503210650002403225650001503249650002003264650001003284650002303294650001003317650001103327650002303338650001903361650002903380650001703409650001403426650001003440650001903450650002003469651001103489653002403500653001603524653001203540653001903552653002103571653001403592700002203606700002003628700002403648700002303672700006203695773010803757856008603865852000903951655001203960IND60525112820221121073421.0190318e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052511282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSauvadet, Marie14aThe dynamics of soil micro-food web structure and functions vary according to litter quality  ap. 262-274.  aAnthropogenic pressures on agricultural soils are known to alter the properties of soil food webs, which may affect ecosystem functions and the capacity to deliver services. Cropping systems fuel belowground biota by supplying litter, but litter quality varies from year to year. In this study, we hypothesized that (i) the structure and function of the soil biota may respond strongly to the quality of crop residue, and (ii) this response may vary with the complexity of the food web. To test this hypothesis, a 3-month incubation experiment was performed using soil columns filled with a silty loam agricultural soil (Estrées-Mons, Northern France), and plant litter was incorporated into the 0–5-cm layer. The quality of the litter was modulated by using either high quality (maize leaves) or low quality materials (maize roots), and two levels of biotic complexity were tested by introducing or not introducing an ecosystem engineer (Lumbricus terrestris, anecic earthworm) into the columns. We then investigated litter decomposition and enzymatic activities, as well as the biomass and diversity of the bacterial, fungal and nematode communities. The C mineralization and enzymatic profiles varied according to litter quality, and the most obvious differences were observed in the hydrolytic enzymes and phenol oxidase. Micro-food web interactions and structure were mainly impacted by litter type and the time since litter incorporation, and as expected, we observed a temporal succession of cellulolytic organisms followed by lignolytic organisms. This progression was mirrored by the nematode community; the ratio of fungal feeders/bacterial feeders increased between 35 and 91 days. Initial litter quality primarily impacted bacterial and fungal community structure, and the development of the bacterial channel was greater with the addition of leaf litter. This was related to an increase in specific, favored phyla, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, whereas Actinobacteria increased more with the addition of root litter. However, we could not statistically link the changes in the structure of the microbial communities over time with those in enzyme activity, which led us to assume that other factors, such as top-down regulation, are more important than microbial community structure in the determination of the enzyme secretions in the soil. Finally, the addition of earthworms did not significantly impact litter decomposition and had a low impact on micro-food web structure and interactions. However, the presence of L. terrestris did modify the enzymatic secretions, probably through its endemic microbial population, as well as the stimulation of microbial activity through predation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aLumbricus terrestris 3aNematoda 3aProteobacteria 3aagricultural soils 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3acorn 3acrop residues 3acropping systems 3aearthworms 3aecosystem engineers 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3afuels 3afungal communities 3afungi 3aleaves 3amicrobial activity 3amineralization 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aplant litter 3apredation 3aroots 3asoil food webs 3asoil properties 3aFrance 0aMaize decomposition 0aRespiration 0aEnzymes 0aPyrosequencing 0aNetwork analysis 0aNematodes1 aChauvat, Matthieu1 aCluzeau, Daniel1 aMaron, Pierre-Alain1 aVillenave, Cécile1 aBertrand, Isabelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2233-631X0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2016 Apr., v. 95 p.262-274dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245006900205506007600274520123800350592002801588506003701616650002601653650001701679650002001696650001901716650001601735650002101751650001601772650002101788650002401809700001901833700001701852700002001869700001901889700002301908773012301931856007402054852000902128655001202137IND60650622420221207070944.0190710e20181109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065062242DNAL7 a10.3390/nu101117202doi7 aPMC62674732pmcid7 a304239892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchön, Christiane,10aBioavailability Study of Maqui Berry Extract in Healthy Subjects  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSeveral health promoting effects have been reported for maqui berry, rich in anthocyanins. Direct effects of anthocyanins as well as bioactive metabolites might be involved. Within the study, bioavailability of a proprietary standardized maqui berry extract Delphinol&reg; was investigated based on two selected anthocyanins (delphinidin-3-O-glucoside (DS) + cyanidin-3-O-sambubioside (CS)) and two breakdown products (protocatechuic acid (PCA) + gallic acid (GA)) after a single-dose supplementation in humans. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from individual concentration time curves. In all 12 subjects a significant increase was noted in plasma values of DG and CS after intake of maqui berry extract. Maximum concentration of DG was observed after 1.0 &plusmn; 0.3 h and CS after 2.0 &plusmn; 1.1 h. Within 8 h, concentrations nearly returned to baseline levels. The results confirm a fast uptake and metabolism of the two selected key substances. Additionally, the phenolic acids GA and PCA were observed as breakdown products of anthocyanins. In summary, the study clearly confirms the bioavailability of maqui berry extract and its specific anthocyanin compounds and related breakdown products in healthy subjects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAristotelia chilensis 3aanthocyanins 3abioavailability 3afruit extracts 3agallic acid 3ahealth promotion 3ametabolites 3apharmacokinetics 3aprotocatechuic acid1 aWacker, Roland1 aMicka, Antje1 aSteudle, Jasmin1 aLang, Stefanie1 aBonnländer, Bernd0 tNutrients.g2018 Nov. 09, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu101117203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014600168300001400314520128300328592002801611650002601639650001601665650001301681650001301694650002401707650003001731650001501761650002301776650001701799650001501816650001101831650001901842650001101861651001001872700002101882773008601903856008601989852000902075655001202084IND60089144220221120133618.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008914422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaolan10aSeasonal variations in dust concentration and dust emission observed over Horqin Sandy Land area in China from December 2010 to November 2011  ap. 56-65.  aHourly mean dust concentration observations and meteorological measurements obtained from a sandstorm monitoring station in Horqin Sandy Land area in China from December 2010 to November 2011 were used to investigate the seasonal variations in dust concentration and dust emission flux as well as their relationship with meteorological parameters and soil condition. Based on 14 local dust emission events in spring 2011, the friction velocity (u*) and free convective velocity (w*) were calculated, and their correlation with dust emission flux was used to evaluate the dynamic and thermal impact on dust emission by turbulence. Results indicated that dust events occur in every season with peak dust activity in spring. The maximum dust concentration is 1654.1 μg m⁻³ and dust emission flux is 98.4 μg m⁻² s⁻¹. Freezing of soil in winter effectively decreases soil erodibility and suppresses dust emission. However, soil moisture does not show a significant impact on dust emission in this semi-arid Horqin Sandy Land area. Both friction velocity and free convective velocity could reflect the trend in dust emission flux, but both with obvious underestimation.

To this end, experiments were conducted with two cultivars (Sumian 15 and PHY370WR) under two temperature regimes: ambient temperature (AT) and elevated temperature (ET, which was 2.5°C–2.7°C higher than AT) and three water regimes: optimum soil moisture (soil relative water content [SRWC] at 75% ± 5%), and drought (SD) including SRWC 60% ± 5% and SRWC 45% ± 5%, during 2016–2018. Results showed that ET plus SD decreased cottonseed kernel yield, seed index, kernel weight, and kernel percentage more than either single stress. The content of hexoses, the carbon skeleton source for oil synthesis, was decreased by ET while increased by SD. The combined stress increased the hexose content by increasing the activities of sucrose synthase (SuSy, EC 2.4.1.13) and invertase (Inv, EC 3.2.1.26) and upregulating GhSuSy expression; however, hexose content under combined stress was lower than that under SD alone. Increased oil content under SD was attributed to the high phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase, EC 4.1.1.31), acetyl‐CoA carboxylase (ACCase, EC 6.4.1.2), and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT, EC 2.3.1.20) activities, whereas the opposite effects were seen under ET. Under combined stress, although ACCase activity decreased, PEPCase and DGAT activities, and GhPEPC‐1 and GhDGAT‐1 expression upregulated, enhancing carbon flow into oil metabolism and triacylglycerol synthesis, ultimately generating higher oil content.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS‐15‐14cChina Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA  a2020M681633cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  cHigh‐level Talent Introduction Program of Nanjing Agricultural University  aJCIC‐MCPcJiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Crop Production  a31630051cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31901463cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBK20190524cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acarbon 3acarbon metabolism 3acotton 3acottonseed 3acottonseed oil 3acultivars 3adiacylglycerol acyltransferase 3adrought 3aheat 3ahexoses 3alipid content 3aoilseed crops 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3aseeds 3asoil water 3asucrose synthase 3atriacylglycerols 3awater content1 aHu, Wei1 aGao, Min1 aZhao, Wenqing1 aWang, Youhua1 aZhou, Zhiguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2895-08790 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2022 Jan., v. 174, no. 1 p.e13643-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.136433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03737naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006200155245011100217520174300328592002802071650001902099650001802118650001702136650001402153650001802167650001402185650002302199650001102222650001102233650001902244650002002263650001002283650001102293650001702304650001802321650001202339650001802351650001802369650001702387650002002404650001402424650001702438650003702455650002402492650003602516650001902552653003202571653003102603653003202634653002702666653002202693653002102715700002102736700002402757700002102781700001602802700002302818700003002841773010502871856009002976852000903066655001203075IND60671669020221120201709.0200110e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067166902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1247462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCervellati, Franco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0051-259710aProinflammatory properties and oxidative effects of atmospheric particle components in human keratinocytes  aThe skin is one of the main organs exposed to airborne particulate matter (PM), which may contain various pollutants linked to a wide range of adverse health endpoints. In the present work, we analyzed the proinflammatory and oxidative effects of some PM components leading to inflammatory responses, cell proliferation or cell death. We investigated four redox-active chemicals, such as Cu (II) metal and quinones generated from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), i.e., 9,10 phenanthrenequinone and isomers 1,2 and 1,4 naphthoquinone. We performed in vitro biological tests on human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells and also acellular assays based on the oxidation of dithiothreitol and ascorbic acid, antioxidants to assess the oxidative potential (OP).We found that treated keratinocytes showed increased activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factor NFκB and increased transcript levels of the NFκB-dependent gene IL8. Moreover, the treatment with Cu(II) and quinones increased the activities and the expression of genes involved in the redox response, SOD1 and GPX, suggesting that PM components induced cellular damage due to redox imbalances. Finally, we found alteration of the mitochondrial ultrastructure and increased apoptosis after 24 h of treatment. The results presented suggest that all of the analyzed pollutant components are able to modulate similar signal transduction pathways, resulting in activation of inflammatory processes in the skin, followed by oxidative damage.Altogether these observations indicate that exposure of skin to air pollutants modifies the redox equilibrium of keratinocytes, which could explain the increased skin damage observed in populations that live in high-pollution cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3aascorbic acid 3abioassays 3acell proliferation 3acities 3acopper 3adithiothreitol 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-8 3aisomers 3akeratinocytes 3amessenger RNA 3amitochondria 3anaphthoquinones 3aoxidation 3aparticulates 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3aultrastructure 0aCu 9,10 phenanthrenequinone 0aNaphthoquinone isomers 1,2 0aAirborne particulate matter 0aRedox-active chemicals 0aCutaneous tissues 0aOxidative damage1 aBenedusi, Mascia1 aManarini, Francesco1 aWoodby, Brittany1 aRusso, Mara1 aValacchi, Giuseppe1 aPietrogrande, Maria Chara0 tChemosphere.g2020 Feb., v. 240 p.124746-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1247463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
