  1 aBahk, G.J.10aDetermination of Quantitative Food Consumption Levels for Use in Microbial Risk Assessments: Cheddar Cheese as an Example  ap. 184-193.  aMicrobial risk assessment (MRA) is becoming increasingly used in the management of food safety because it can be used to quantify risks and help rank intervention strategies. The exposure assessment components of the assessments have become complex with many aspects of the contamination, survival, and growth of a pathogen in a food being taken into consideration. Insufficient consumption data constitutes an important data gap and consequently one of many sources of uncertainty in MRA even though the effects of uncertainty are smaller than those affecting bacterial concentration in foods. Therefore, food consumption data also play an important role in exposure assessment of MRA. In the United States, there are large-scale, nationwide sets of consumption data available for use in MRA, i.e., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Newly released dietary interview data in the NHANES 2001 to 2002 survey show that it has been redesigned and that the data were sufficiently updated from previous versions to have more value for MRAs. We propose a model that can effectively use the new data sets and be incorporated into MRAs, using as an example consumption of Cheddar cheese/American-type cheese. This model included the prevalence of food eaten as well as the amount and frequency. We determined the amount of Cheddar/American cheese consumed per day with probability distribution (e.g., lognormal distribution). These could be further determined by gender, age, pregnancy, and combination food type, which we plan to do in the future. The frequency of the range of serving numbers for Cheddar/American cheese consumed per person per day and prevalence as the proportion of a population (e.g., survey respondents) eating a certain food in a day are also presented. Unlike traditional published mean values, the results of this model provide probability distribution intakes that can be compared with mean and median intakes. This allows values in the upper percentiles to be considered for inclusion in MRAs. We believe this simulation model can be adapted with different variables applicable to different foods, pathogens, and specific health risk population groups. 3aCheddar cheese 3afood consumption 3aquality control 3arisk factors 3apredictive microbiology 3adietary exposure 3afood pathogens 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3afood frequency questionnaires 3aAmerican cheese 3aquantitative analysis 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aModels, Theoretical 2aNutrition Surveys 2aPregnancy 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Management 0aUnited States1 aTodd, E.C.D.0 tJournal of food protection.g2007 Jan., v. 70, no. 1 p.184-193x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20070727b20070802c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/03/30  aOther US 7aarticle04019naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002300163245009700186300001600283500001500299520183400314650002902148650001102177650001402188650001402202650002102216650002802237650002302265650001002288650001702298650001302315650001502328650002502343650001902368650002202387650002102409650001902430650001702449650002802466650001802494650002302512650002902535650002502564650003302589650002902622650001102651650004902662650003002711650004002741650004602781650003902827650001502866650003902881650002402920650003802944653001402982653001402996700001703010700001603027700001403043700002003057700002003077773008403097852000903181930003303190945002503223946001303248655001203261IND4389019420221117222238.0070316e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438901942DNAL7 a172658712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVizoso Pinto, M.G.10aAdhesive and Chemokine Stimulatory Properties of Potentially Probiotic Lactobacillus Strains  ap. 125-134.  a2019-12-05  aFive Lactobacillus plantarum strains and two Lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from African traditionally fermented milk products or children's feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. The relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to HT29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the L. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to HT29 cells. Four L. plantarum and two L. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to HT29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. Most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. The two L. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the intestinal pathogens Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028. The L. plantarum BFE 1685 and L. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with HT29 cells in a strain-dependent way. These two potential probiotic strains also significantly increased interleukin-8 (IL-8) chemokine production by HT29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), did not occur. Altogether, our results suggested that L. plantarum BFE 1685 and L. johnsonii BFE 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains. 3ahydrophilic interactions 3ahumans 3aserotypes 3acoculture 3aepithelial cells 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3abacterial adhesion 3afeces 3acytotoxicity 3achildren 3aprobiotics 3afood biopreservation 3ahydrophobicity 3atraditional foods 3aimmunostimulants 3afermented milk 3ahealth foods 3aLactobacillus johnsonii 3ainterleukin-8 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aChemokinesxbiosynthesis 2aCoculture Techniques 2aEscherichia colixphysiology 2aHT29 Cellsxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aLactobacillusxphysiology 2aLactobacillus plantarumxphysiology 2aLacticaseibacillus rhamnosusxphysiology. 2aListeria monocytogenesxphysiology 2aProbiotics 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxphysiology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aStaphylococcus aureusxphysiology 0acytokines 0aisolation1 aSchuster, T.1 aBriviba, K.1 aWatzl, B.1 aHolzapfel, W.H.1 aFranz, C.M.A.P.0 tJournal of food protection.g2007 Jan., v. 70, no. 1 p.125-134x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20070727b20070802c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/04/01  aOther US 7aarticle03784naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245019400178300001600372520158700388650002201975650001201997650001302009650000902022650002002031650001502051650001702066650001002083650002402093650000702117650002902124650001502153650002102168650002702189650002702216650004002243650001902283650002802302650002302330650002802353650003202381650003202413650002602445650001702471650002802488650005802516650006402574650002402638650001302662650006402675650003802739650006302777650001602840650001002856650002302866700001502889700001802904773008402922852000903006930003303015945002503048946001303073655001203086IND4389018420221117222217.0070316e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438901842DNAL7 a172658672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDeza, M.A.10aEfficacy of Neutral Electrolyzed Water To Inactivate Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus on Plastic and Wooden Kitchen Cutting Boards  ap. 102-108.  aThis study evaluated the efficacy of neutral electrolyzed water (NEW; 64.1 mg/liter of active chlorine) to reduce populations of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes on plastic and wooden kitchen cutting boards. Its effectiveness was compared with that of a sodium hypochlorite solution (NaClO; 62.3 mg/liter of active chlorine). Inoculated portions of cutting boards were rinsed in either NEW or NaClO solutions, or deionized water (control). Plastic boards were rinsed for 1 min and wooden boards for 1 and 5 min. After each treatment, the surviving population of each strain was determined on the surface and in the soaking water. No significant difference (P greater than or equal to 0.05) was found between the final populations of each strain with regard to the treatment solutions (NEW or NaClO). However, a significant difference (P less than or equal to 0.05) was revealed between surface materials after 1 min of washing. Whereas in plastic boards the initial bacterial populations were reduced by 5 log CFU/50 cm2, in wooden cutting boards they underwent a reduction of <3 log CFU/50 cm2. A 5-min exposure time yielded reductions of about 4 log CFU/50 cm2. The surviving populations of all bacteria in NEW and NaClO washing solutions were <1 log CFU/ml after soaking both surfaces. This study revealed that NEW treatment is an effective method for reducing microbial contamination on plastic and wooden cutting boards. NEW efficacy was comparable to that of NaClO, with the advantage of having a larger storage time. 3akitchen equipment 3acutting 3aplastics 3awood 3adecontamination 3asanitizing 3aelectrolytes 3awater 3asodium hypochlorite 3apH 3aantibacterial properties 3ashelf life 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus 3afood pathogens 3abacterial contamination 3afood contamination 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aCooking and Eating Utensils 2aDisinfectantsxpharmacology 2aDisinfectionxmethods 2aElectrolysis 2aEquipment Contamination 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aListeria monocytogenesxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPlastics 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSodium Hypochloritexpharmacology 2aStaphylococcus aureusxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aTemperature 2aWater 2aWoodxmicrobiology1 aAraujo, M.1 aGarrido, M.J.0 tJournal of food protection.g2007 Jan., v. 70, no. 1 p.102-108x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20070727b20070802c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/03/30  aOther US 7aarticle03791naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001200180245006900192300001500261500001500276520181700291650002802108650002102136650001902157650002302176650002102199650001802220650002702238650001702265650001702282650002802299650001602327650001902343650001702362650002002379650001202399650001202411650002602423650002902449650005502478650002802533650005202561650002602613650004202639650003002681650001102711650004202722650001702764650002702781650002102808653002702829700001302856700001302869700001202882700001402894700002202908773008302930852000903013930003303022945002503055946001303080655001203093IND4389018320221117222153.0070316e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438901832DNAL7 a172658662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCho, M.10aTitanium Dioxide/UV Photocatalytic Disinfection in Fresh Carrots  ap. 97-101.  a2019-12-05  aIncreased occurrences of fresh produce-related outbreaks of foodborne illness have focused attention on effective washing processes for fruits and vegetables. A titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalytic reaction under UV radiation provides a high rate of disinfection. The photo-killing effects of TiO2 on bacteria in liquid cultures under experimental conditions have been widely studied. However, the disinfection effects of the TiO2 photocatalytic reaction on fresh vegetables during a washing process have not been evaluated. Our objectives were to design a pilot-scale TiO2/UV photocatalytic reactor for fresh carrots and to compare the bactericidal effects of the TiO2/UV reaction against bacteria in liquid media and on carrots. TiO2/UV photocatalytic reactions for 40, 60, and 30 s were required for the complete killing of Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Bacillus cereus (initial counts of approximately 6.7 log CFU/ml), respectively. The counts of total aerobic bacteria in fresh carrots and foodborne pathogenic bacteria in inoculated carrots were also measured. Counts of total aerobic bacteria were reduced by 1.8 log CFU/g after TiO2/UV photocatalytic disinfection for 20 min compared with a 1.1-log CFU/g reduction by UV alone. E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and B. cereus (8 log CFU/ml) were inoculated onto carrots, and the number of surviving bacteria in carrots was determined after treatment. The TiO2/UV treatment exhibited 2.1-, 2.3-, and 1.8-log CFU/g reductions in the counts of E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and B. cereus, respectively, compared with 1.3-, 1.2-, and 1.2-log CFU/g reductions by UV alone. The TiO2/UV photocatalyst reaction showed significant bactericidal effects, indicating that this process is applicable to nonthermal disinfection of fresh vegetables. 3abacterial contamination 3aEscherichia coli 3araw vegetables 3afood contamination 3atitanium dioxide 3aDaucus carota 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3afood storage 3astorage time 3aphotochemical reactions 3aplate count 3afood pathogens 3adisinfection 3aBacillus cereus 3aaerobes 3acarrots 3aultraviolet radiation 3aantibacterial properties 2aBacteriaxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aDaucus carotaxmicrobiologyxradiation effects. 2aDisinfectionxmethods 2aDose-Response Relationship, Radiation 2aFood Irradiationxmethods 2aHumans 2aPhotosensitizing Agentsxpharmacology 2aTime Factors 2aTitaniumxpharmacology 2aUltraviolet Rays 0aSalmonella typhimurium1 aChoi, Y.1 aPark, H.1 aKim, K.1 aWoo, G.J.1 aPark, J.q(James)0 tJournal of food protection.g2007 Jan., v. 70, no. 1 p.97-101x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20070727b20070802c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/03/30  aOther US 7aarticle02937naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100001400197245007000211300001600281500001500297520093000312650002101242650001901263650002001282650003701302650002301339650002501362650001901387650001901406650002801425650002201453650002801475650001001503650001101513650001701524650002301541650002901564650002201593650002801615650003701643650001701680650004501697650003701742650006501779650005301844650003701897650003201934650003301966650001901999650002302018653001802041700001902059700002102078773008402099852000902183930003302192945002502225946001302250655001202263IND4389018620221117222053.0070316e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438901862DNAL7 a172658692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aConte, A.10aUse of Lemon Extract To Inhibit the Growth of Malolactic Bacteria  ap. 114-118.  a2019-12-05  aThe potential use of lemon extract as a natural preservative to inhibit the growth of Oenococcus oeni and Lactobacillus plantarum, microorganisms involved in the malotactic fermentation of wine, was studied. Growth tests were run at 30 degrees C using laboratory media. Carbon dioxide concentration in the vial headspace was used as metabolic activity index of the investigated microorganisms. The MIC and the noninhibiting concentration (NIC) were calculated for each microorganism. Results suggest that lemon extract was active on each phase of the growth cycle for the tested microorganisms. It was also shown that lemon extract exhibits a nonlinear dose-related inhibitory effect on microbial growth. In particular, the active compound could be added at concentrations slightly higher than the NIC levels in order to appreciably slow down the microbial growth rate as well as to reduce the maximum microbial growth level. 3astarter cultures 3acarbon dioxide 3aOenococcus oeni 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aheadspace analysis 3alactic acid bacteria 3aessential oils 3afruit extracts 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3anatural additives 3amalolactic fermentation 3awines 3alemons 3aCitrus limon 3afood preservatives 3aantibacterial properties 2aCitrusxchemistry 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFermentation 2aFood Contaminationxprevention & control 2aFood Preservativesxpharmacology 2aLactobacillus plantarumxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aLeuconostocxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aMalate Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aVolatilization 2aWinexmicrobiology 0afruits (food)1 aSinigaglia, M.1 aDel Nobile, M.A.0 tJournal of food protection.g2007 Jan., v. 70, no. 1 p.114-118x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20070727b20070802c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/03/30  aOther US 7aarticle03239naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001300146245007700159300001400236520150000250650000901750650002401759650004001783650001901823650002801842650002301870650003001893650001801923650002001941650002101961650001601982650001201998650001802010650001102028650002802039650002802067650002902095650003302124650002002157650001102177650002302188650003902211650003202250650002402282650005202306650001702358700001802375700001502393700002002408700001702428700001802445773008202463852000902545930003302554945002502587946001302612655001202625IND4389018220221117222040.0070316e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438901822DNAL7 a172658652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGoto, M.10aReal-Time PCR Method for Quantification of Staphylococcus aureus in Milk  ap. 90-96.  aA reproducible real-time PCR method that targets the putative transcriptional regulator gene of Staphylococcus aureus was developed to quantify this microorganism in milk samples. On the basis of partial sequences of this gene determined from S. aureus strains, we designed the specific primers and probe for use in a quantitative PCR assay. These specificities were confirmed with 25 strains of S. aureus and 35 strains of other bacteria. A real-time PCR assay with serial 10-fold dilutions of purified DNA and pure culture was conducted. It was possible to construct standard curves with a high correlation coefficient (r2 = 0.99) in the range of 50 ng to 50 fg for purified DNA and 10(7) to 10(1) CFU/ml for a pure culture. The constructed standard curve for milk samples was similar to that for the pure culture, and the quantification of S. aureus in the range of 10(7) to 10(1) CFU/ml was possible. Moreover, to determine how our real-time PCR method would perform under actual analytical conditions, we quantified the DNA from S. aureus after two types of heat treatments were used for the pasteurization of milk. The amount of DNA found was affected after heat treatment at 63 degrees C for 30 min (low-temperature long-time method) but not at 72 degrees C for 15 s (high-temperature short-time method). The results indicate that the real-time PCR method developed in this study is effective for monitoring S. aureus contamination in milk because of its high specificity and sensitivity. 3amilk 3amicrobial detection 3aStaphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus 3afood pathogens 3abacterial contamination 3afood contamination 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asigma factors 3aregulator genes 3apasteurized milk 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCattle 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpecies Specificity 2aStaphylococcus aureusxisolation & purification 2aTime Factors1 aTakahashi, H.1 aSegawa, Y.1 aHayashidani, H.1 aTakatori, K.1 aHara-Kudo, Y.0 tJournal of food protection.g2007 Jan., v. 70, no. 1 p.90-96x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20070727b20070802c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/03/30  aOther US 7aarticle02842naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001800155245017200173300002000345500002400365500001500389520134000404650002101744650001801765650002701783650003201810650002601842650003201868650002901900650001201929650001001941653002801951700002201979700002002001700002502021700001602046773016502062852000902227856007702236930003302313945002502346946001302371655001202384IND4409775920221117222139.0080905e20071226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440977592DNAL7 a10.1021/jf072213e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aMartin, Diana10aChanges in the Fatty Acid Profile of the Subcutaneous Fat of Swine throughout Fattening As Affected by Dietary Conjugated Linoleic Acid and Monounsaturated Fatty Acids  ap. 10820-10826.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe fatty acid profile of the subcutaneous fat of pigs and its evolution throughout fattening as affected by dietary conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and their interaction (CLA x MUFA) were studied. Three levels (0, 1, and 2%) of an enriched CLA oil (28% cis-9,trans-11 and 28% trans-10,cis-12 CLA) were combined with two levels of MUFA (low, 19% average; and high, 39% average) for pig feeding (288 gilts). Subcutaneous shot-biopsies were taken from 48 animals at the beginning of the trial (S1, 70 kg), 14 days later (S2, 80 kg), and at slaughter (S3, 107 kg). Inclusion of CLA in the diet caused an increase during fattening in cis-9,trans-11 CLA, trans-10,cis-12 CLA, and saturated fatty acids (SFA) contents of pig backfat and a decrease in MUFA and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). MUFA supplementation also led to a MUFA enrichment of backfat. The interaction CLA x MUFA affected the SFA content. The rates of accumulation of CLA isomers, SFA, and MUFA throughout the trial did not follow a linear behavior, such rates being higher from S1 to S2 than from S2 to S3. These rates were also influenced by dietary CLA and MUFA levels. The increase in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids of backfat caused by dietary CLA might be balanced by supplementation of pig diets with MUFA. 3asubcutaneous fat 3aswine feeding 3afatty acid composition 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3abackfat 3aswine 0aunsaturated fatty acids1 aAntequera, Teresa1 aGonzalez, Elena1 aLopez-Bote, Clemente1 aRuiz, Jorge0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 Dec. 26, v. 55, no. 26 p.10820-10826dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf072213e3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081106b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/06  aOther US 7aarticle03126naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001900155245015100174300002000325500002400345500001500369520163100384650001602015650001402031650001902045650001702064650002402081650002802105650002102133650002102154650002502175650001702200653003302217653002502250653001702275700002002292700002202312773016502334852000902499856007702508930003302585945002502618946001302643655001202656IND4409775320221117221953.0080905e20071226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440977532DNAL7 a10.1021/jf072256v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ115 0aQ5051 aIshiguro, Koji10aChanges in Polyphenolic Content and Radical-Scavenging Activity of Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas L.) during Storage at Optimal and Low Temperatures  ap. 10773-10778.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPolyphenolic content and radical-scavenging activities (RSA) of four sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas L.) cultivars were characterized after storage at optimal (15 °C) or low temperature (5 °C) for 0, 13, 26, and 37 days. The polyphenolic content increased during storage in three cultivars but not in 'Murasakimasari'. The change in 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity (DPPH-RSA) correlated very well with polyphenolic content. The increases in polyphenolics and the RSA in 'Benimasari' were significantly greater during storage at 5 °C than at 15 °C. The main polyphenolic components in all cultivars were chlorogenic acid (ChA) and 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3,5-diCQA). ChA level increased more at 5 °C than at 15 °C, whereas that of 3,5-diCQA was greater at 15 °C. Caffeoylquinic acids and RSA in 'Murasakimasari', which contains a large amount of anthocyanin in flesh tissue, were extremely high at the beginning of storage and remained nearly constant or decreased over time. A non-caffeoylquinic acid component that increased during storage, especially in 'J-Red' at 15 °C, was purified by successive chromatographic steps. The isolate was identified as caffeoyl sucrose [CSu, 6-O-caffeoyl-(β-D-fructofuranosyl-(2 to 1))-α-D-glucopyranoside] by fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy (FAB-MS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). These results suggest that storage under cultivar-dependent, controlled temperature is one approach for increasing desirable physiologic function associated with RSA of polyphenolic compounds in sweetpotato roots. 3apolyphenols 3acultivars 3asweet potatoes 3afood storage 3astorage temperature 3afree radical scavengers 3afood composition 3achlorogenic acid 3aantioxidant activity 3acold storage 0a3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid 0acaffeoylquinic acids 0aantioxidants1 aYahara, Shōji.1 aYoshimoto, Makoto0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 Dec. 26, v. 55, no. 26 p.10773-10778dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf072256v3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081107b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/06  aOther US 7aarticle02367naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100002400146245011300170300002000283500002400303520101100327650001101338650000901349650001601358650002401374650001901398650004401417650001601461650001401477653003101491653006601522653002301588700002401611773016501635852000901800856007701809930003301886945002501919946001301944655001201957IND4409775120221117222105.0080905e20071226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440977512DNAL7 a10.1021/jf071982v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5011 aLe Feunteun, Steven10aImpact of Casein Gel Microstructure on Self-Diffusion Coefficient of Molecular Probes Measured by 1H PFG-NMR  ap. 10764-10772.  aIncludes references  aThe translational dynamics of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymers with molecular weights (Mw) varying from 6 x 102 to 5 x 10(5) were investigated by pulsed field gradient NMR in casein suspensions and in gels induced by acidification, enzyme action, and a combination of both. For molecules with Mw <= 1020, the diffusion was only dependent on the casein concentration whatever the molecular weight of the probe or the sample studied. However, for PEG with Mw >= 8000, there was strong dependence of diffusion on PEG size and on the casein network structure as revealed by scanning electron microscopy images. The diffusion coefficients of the two largest PEGs were increased after coagulation by amounts that depended on the internal structure of the gel. In addition, the 527 000 g/mol PEG was found to deviate from Gaussian diffusion behavior to greater or lesser extents according to the casein concentration and the sample microstructure. The results are discussed in terms of network rearrangements. 3acasein 3agels 3asuspensions 3apolyethylene glycol 3amicrostructure 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3adiffusivity 3adiffusion 0aself diffusion coefficient 0apulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 0apolyethylene oxide1 aMariette, François0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 Dec. 26, v. 55, no. 26 p.10764-10772dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf071982v3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081106b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/06  aOther US 7aarticle03263naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100002500146245009600171300002000267500002400287500001500311520194200326650001702268650001602285650002202301650001702323650002602340650001702366650002502383650002202408650001502430650001602445651001302461653001702474700001602491773016502507852000902672856007702681930003302758945002502791946001302816655001202829IND4409776120221117222137.0080905e20071226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440977612DNAL7 a10.1021/jf072529m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aHosseinian, Farah S.10aSaskatoon and Wild Blueberries Have Higher Anthocyanin Contents than Other Manitoba Berries  ap. 10832-10838.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aStudies have shown that anthocyanins present in berry fruits have some beneficial health effects such as reducing age-associated oxidative stress and possessing anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, six Manitoba berries (wild blueberry, Saskatoon berry, raspberry, chokecherry, strawberry, and seabuckthorn) were studied for their anthocyanin compositions (mg/100 g) on dry weight basis. Saskatoon berry and wild blueberry showed a high content of total anthocyanins (562.4 and 558.3 mg/100 g, respectively) that were not significantly (P > 0.05) different from each other. The corresponding values for other berries: raspberry (365.2 mg/100 g), chokecherry (177.39 mg/100 g), and strawberry (97.5 mg/100 g) were significantly different from each other (P < 0.05), and the total anthocyanin content of seabuckthorn was negligible (0.84 mg/100 g). Fifteen major anthocyanins were isolated from Manitoba berries. Saskatoon berry and wild blueberry contained higher amounts of delphinidin 3-glucoside (Dp-3-glc), malvidin 3-glucoside (Mv-3-glc), and malvidin 3- galactoside (Mv-3-gal). Dp-3-glc was 263.8 (mg/100 g) in Saskatoon berry and 84.4 (mg/100 g) in wild blueberry, whereas the corresponding values for Mv-3-glc in these berries were 47.4 and 139.6 (mg/100 g), respectively. Raspberry, strawberry, and chokecherry contained higher amounts of cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc), cyanidin 3-rutinoside (Cy-3-rut), and pelargonidin 3-glucoside (Pg-3-glc). The total anthocyanin content of Manitoba fruits followed the order: Saskatoon berry and blueberry (high anthocyanin berries), raspberry and chokecherry (medium anthocyanin berries), strawberry (low anthocyanin berries), and seabuckthorn (negligible anthocyanin berries). This study demonstrated that Saskatoon berries and wild blueberries have high potential value for fruit growers as well as the food and nutraceutical manufacturers because of their high anthocyanin contents. 3aanthocyanins 3araspberries 3aPrunus virginiana 3astrawberries 3aAmelanchier alnifolia 3aRubus idaeus 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3afruit composition 3awild foods 3ablueberries 3aManitoba 0asmall fruits1 aBeta, Trust0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 Dec. 26, v. 55, no. 26 p.10832-10838dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf072529m3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081106b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/06  aOther US 7aarticle02530naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100001900164245008500183300002000268500002400288520126100312650001801573650001801591650002801609653002301637653002501660653002201685653002801707700002201735700002101757700002001778773016501798852000901963856007701972930003302049945002502082946001302107655001202120IND4409779020221117222159.0080905e20071226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440977902DNAL7 a10.1021/jf072357t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX500 0aF600 0aF1001 aNeoh, Tze Loon10aKinetics of Molecular Encapsulation of 1-Methylcyclopropene into α-Cyclodextrin  ap. 11020-11026.  aIncludes references  a1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), an ethylene inhibiting regulator, is commercially available in the form of an inclusion complex with α-cyclodextrin (α-CD). In this study, molecular encapsulation of gaseous 1-MCP into aqueous α-CD was investigated in a closed, agitated vessel with a flat gas-liquid interface. Molecular encapsulation of gaseous 1-MCP by α-CD is a simultaneous two-step reaction which involves the aqueous dissolution of gaseous 1-MCP and the encapsulation of the dissolved molecules by α-CD. The kinetics and mechanism of molecular encapsulation were analyzed based on the depletion rate of 1-MCP in the headspace of the vessel. The encapsulation rates could be explained quantitatively by the gas absorption theory with a pseudo-first-order reaction between 1-MCP and α-CD. The negative value of the calculated apparent activation energy of encapsulation (-24.4 kJ/mol) implied the significant effect of exothermic aqueous dissolution of 1-MCP. An encapsulation temperature of 15 °C was optimal; at this temperature, the highest 1-MCP yield and best inclusion ratio of inclusion complex were obtained. Changes in the X-ray diffraction pattern suggested that the crystal lattice structure of α-CD was altered upon inclusion of 1-MCP. 3acyclodextrins 3aencapsulation 3aplant growth substances 0aalpha-cyclodextrin 0a1-methylcyclopropene 0agas encapsulation 0amolecular encapsulation1 aYamauchi, Kousuke1 aYoshii, Hidefumi1 aFuruta, Takeshi0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 Dec. 26, v. 55, no. 26 p.11020-11026dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf072357t3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081106b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/06  aOther US 7aarticle02441naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245007900174300001600253520095700269650001601226650001401242650001801256650001001274650002501284650001401309650001101323650001401334650002001348650001301368650001301381650002701394650001601421653001601437653002701453653001101480700002101491700001901512700002401531700002601555700002101581700002301602700001801625773014701643852000901790856009201799930003301891946001101924655001201935IND4413619120221117221832.0081212e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441361912DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2007.01696.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarillo, Petronia10aProcess optimisation and physicochemical characterisation of potato powder  ap. 145-151.  aSamples of two potato cultivars (Agria and Merit), cultivated either conventionally or organically, were analysed to evaluate their suitability to transformation into powder. Agria cultivar potatoes from the conventional farming were selected as the most suitable for drying process both for their high-dry matter and good nutritional value. Blanching resulted in the most effective treatment to prevent potato browning. The potato powder was obtained by means of a drum dryer using different process parameters (temperature, time and product thickness) to minimise thermal damage on the final product. The effects of these different processes were evaluated by analysing some quality indicators, as final moisture, nutrients (carbohydrates, proteins and amino acids) and colour of the powder, and rheological properties of the rehydrated puree. The results of such analyses showed that the lower the process temperature, the better the powder quality. 3aamino acids 3ablanching 3acarbohydrates 3acolor 3aconventional farming 3acultivars 3adrying 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3apotatoes 3aproteins 3arheological properties 3atemperature 0aDrum drying 0anutritional properties 0apowder1 aCacace, Domenico1 ade Rosa, Maria1 aDe Martino, Ermanno1 aCozzolino, Concettina1 aNacca, Francesco1 aD'Antonio, Rosaria1 aFuggi, Amodio0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2009 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.145-151dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2007.01696.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081212b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01953naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245015400154300001600308520079000324650001301114650002001127650001201147650002101159650001501180650002201195650001501217650000901232651001401241651001601255700001701271700001501288700001401303773012201317852000901439856007501448930003301523946001101556655001201567IND4410871320221117221922.0081001s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441087132DNAL7 a10.1071/AP080172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStirling, G.R.14aThe history of plant and soil nematology in Australia and New Zealand, with particular reference to the contributions of six pioneering nematologists  ap. 203-219.  aIn an era of rapid technological advancement, it is easy to overlook those who established the knowledge base that underpins today's research programs. This paper traces the history of plant and soil nematology in Australia and New Zealand and recognises six pioneers who contributed significantly to its development, namely N. A. Cobb, R. C. Colbran, H. R. Wallace, A. F. Bird, J. M. Fisher and W. C. Clark. Collectively, these scientists described many unique and economically important nematodes, advanced our understanding of the biology and ecology of both plant-parasitic and free-living species, laid the foundation for many of the nematode control measures that are in use today and also contributed to the development of the discipline of nematology at an international level. 3aNematoda 3acontrol methods 3aecology 3anematode control 3anematology 3aresearch programs 3ascientists 3asoil 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand1 aYeates, G.W.1 aDavies, K.1 aHodda, M.0 tAustralasian plant pathology.g2008, v. 37, no. 3 p.203-219dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0815-31917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AP080173Available from publisher's Web site  a20081022b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01440naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011700125300001400242520062000256650002100876650001000897650001500907650001500922650002400937653001000961700001500971700001900986773007801005852000901083939003301092946001301125655001201138IND9203276220221117221851.0920521s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920327622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMounji, H.10aModelling the process of absorption and desorption of water in two dimensions (transverse) in a square wood beam  ap. 23-37.  aThe process of absorption and desorption of water by two-dimensional transport in wood was studied at a moisture content beyond the fiber saturation point. The transverse directions through a square wood beam were considered. A numerical model capable of describing the process was constructed and successfully tested. It can predict by calculation the kinetics of absorption when wood is immersed into water and the kinetics of desorption when it is exposed to air.

This work, by means of an extensive in vivo study across the whole ranges of the two taxa, and using biometrical investigations, aims at clarifying their status. The names C. imperati and C. suaveolens are typified, several taxonomical complications are discussed and an accurate chorology is outlined. The results show that a single qualitative character is constant (the presence or absence of a bracteole) and two other characters allow discrimination in most cases; their combined use, therefore, ensures certain identification of any single individual. No hybrid individual or intermediate populations were detected and the distributional ranges of the two species were confirmed to be contiguous but not overlapping. As a consequence, treatment of the two taxa at specific level appears to be the most appropriate. 3aphytogeography 3ataxonomy 0aCrocus ser 0aVersicolores1 aCAPUTO, PAOLO0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g2008 Sept., v. 158, no. 1 p.194-214dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2008.00851.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080905b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01531naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245007800165300001400243500002400257520058100281650001300862653002800875653003000903653001400933653001300947773012400960852000901084856009201093930003301185946001101218655001201229IND4409795520221117222047.0080905e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440979552DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.2008.00848.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Qi.12aA revision of Elatostema section Weddelia series Salvinioida (Urticaceae)  ap. 62-66.  aIncludes references  aBased on examinations of specimens of Elatostema and Pellionia housed at K, KUN, L, P, PE, and YUNU, Elatostema section Weddelia series Salvinioida is taxonomically revised.

Nartheciaceae generally differs from the rest of Dioscoreales in having less specialized flowers. Studies of this family are important to elucidate the evolutionary history of the order. Using scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy, we describe the details of the flower structure, initiation, and development in Metanarthecium, which is unique amongst Nartheciaceae in possessing both an almost superior ovary and septal nectaries. This is the first member of Dioscoreales for which all stages of organogenesis have been studied. Within Nartheciaceae, the presence/absence of septal nectaries and the position of the ovary are labile. The presence of post-genital fusion in the gynoecium correlates with the presence of septal nectaries. Septal nectary morphology is complicated in Metanarthecium, which raises the question of whether its floral structure (including superior ovary) is plesiomorphic within Dioscoreales. The septal nectaries of Metanarthecium show homoplastic similarity with those of Allium (Asparagales). The presence/absence of a compitum is probably variable at the infraspecific level in Metanarthecium as a result of alternative possibilities of post-genital fusion between ventral carpel margins. 3agynoecium 3aNarthecium 0aAletris 0acompitum 0acongenital fusion 0aovary position 0apost-genital fusion 0aprophyll 0aseptal nectaries 0asyncarpy1 aSOKOLOFF, DMITRY1 aKONDO, KATSUHIKO0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g2008 Sept., v. 158, no. 1 p.1-18dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2008.00850.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080905b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02813naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100001500180245008700195300001600282500002400298500001500322520089800337650001901235650001601254650001201270650001601282650001201298650001101310650001501321650001701336650001701353650001701370650001901387650002001406650004601426650003901472650002501511650001201536650001801548650001201566650000901578650005201587650006601639650006501705650005701770653001401827700001301841700001701854700001401871700001501885773011701900852000902017856009202026930003302118945002502151946001102176655001202187IND4409793720221117222024.0080905e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440979372DNAL7 a186312262pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.2008.00567.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8401 aNakata, M.10aLocalised radiotherapy for a ferret with possible anal sac apocrine adenocarcinoma  ap. 476-478.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA seven-year-old, neutered male ferret was referred to our hospital with two perianal masses (2·4x3·0 and 2·4x3·5 cm, respectively) that had recurred after initial surgical excision. Complete resection of the masses was impossible as there was deep invasion along the rectum. On histopathology, the masses were diagnosed as apocrine adenocarcinoma possibly of anal gland origin based on tumour location. There was marked response to localised radiotherapy using an orthovoltage unit at 4 Gy, twice weekly. No visible mass was detectable after six doses of radiation. However, at that time, pleural effusion was diagnosed and radiotherapy was discontinued. Cytology of a sample of the pleural effusion suggested mesothelioma, and no obvious pulmonary metastasis of anal sac adenocarcinoma were identified on thoracic radiography.

Forty seven species and three varieties were diploid, with 2n = 16, one species was tetraploid, with 2n = 32, and one species had diploid and tetraploid cytotypes. Three species had B chromosomes, representing the first time the occurrence of B chromosomes has been reported in the genus. The karyotypes of all the diploid species were quite uniform, commonly bimodal, and usually consisted of one pair of large median-centromeric (m), one pair of large submedian-centromeric (sm), five pairs of medium-sized subterminal-centromeric (st), and one pair of smaller sm (rarely st) chromosomes. The low incidence of polyploids in Delphinium from the Hengduan Mountains region indicates that polyploidy has played a minor role in the speciation of this highly diversified genus in the region. 3achromosomes 3achromosome number 0acytotaxonomy 0aspeciation1 aYANG, QIN-ER0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g2008 Sept., v. 158, no. 1 p.172-188dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2008.00849.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080905b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03125naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100001400179245014600193300001600339500002400355500001500379520159600394650002301990650001802013650002302031650002102054650001602075650002202091650002902113650001302142650001702155650002002172650001102192650001602203650001302219650001702232650001602249650002002265650001102285653001702296773012402313852000902437856009202446930003302538945002502571946001102596655001202607IND4409812620221117222009.0080905e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440981262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.2008.00882.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aHamer, C.14aThe impact of combination therapy with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin on the energy intake and body weight of adult hepatitis C patients  ap. 486-493.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIt is recognized that interferon therapy has an adverse effect on the appetite and nutritional status of children with hepatitis B and C. No similar studies have been undertaken in adults. The aim of the present study was to determine if and how combination therapy with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin affects energy intake and body weight in adult hepatitis C patients. A secondary aim was to investigate whether any changes are related to the presence of perceived side effects of treatment. The energy intake of 15 adult hepatitis C patients was measured using a 3-day food diary. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to investigate patients' perception of fatigue, appetite and nausea. These measurements and body weight were taken before the start of treatment and at weeks 1, 3, 11, 24 and 28 in order to assess changes at intervals throughout interferon therapy. Fourteen patients (93%) lost weight during therapy. The greatest rate of mean [95% confidence interval (CI)] weight loss occurred at week 1 [1.64% (0.95-2.33)]. Weight loss continued until week 24. The greatest decrease in mean (95% CI) energy intake occurred at week 1 [9.74% (0.78-18.70)]. Mean VAS scores for fatigue, loss of appetite and nausea increased at week 1 and remained above pretreatment levels throughout the study period. Adult hepatitis C patients treated with a combination of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin are likely to experience decreased energy intake and weight loss during treatment. This may be related to the impact of side effects of treatment and may require dietetic intervention. 3aantiviral proteins 3aenergy intake 3anutritional status 3aantiviral agents 3abody weight 3aHepatitis C virus 3acombination drug therapy 3aappetite 3apatient care 3aviral hepatitis 3anausea 3ainterferons 3apatients 3afood records 3aweight loss 3aadverse effects 3aadults 0adrug therapy0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2008 Oct., v. 21, no. 5 p.486-493dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.2008.00882.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110519b20110603c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/10/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02746naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100001600179245010800195300001600303500002400319500001500343520132400358650001501682650001601697650001801713650001801731650002001749650002901769650001501798650001201813650001201825650002501837650001701862650001401879653000901893653001801902700001901920700001901939773012401958852000902082856009202091930003302183945002502216946001102241655001202252IND4409812720221117222132.0080905e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440981272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.2008.00884.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aT000 0aT3001 aCaswell, S.10aDiet and physical activity in patients with colorectal adenomas: directions for intervention programmes  ap. 494-501.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aScreening programmes provide an opportunity to combine early detection programmes with prevention strategies for chronic disease risk reduction. The aim of the current exploratory research was to identify diet and activity habits in adults diagnosed with colorectal adenomas on screening colonoscopy in order to inform the development of an intervention study in this patient group. Participants were recruited from colonoscopy clinics and completed a 7-day food diary and physical activity record. Valid food diaries were completed by 32 participants. Mean daily intake of nonstarch polysaccharide was estimated at 14.2 (SD 4.2) g per day and fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) at 3.6 (SD 1.9) portions. The highest quartile of FVI consumers reported greater consumption of fruit (on any occasion) and vegetables (at evening meal) compared with low FVI consumers. Physical activity records (n = 36) indicated that walking was the most common method of activity with few indications of leisure time sport. Overall, 37% of participants failed to meet minimum recommend activity levels. The magnitudes of change in activity and diet required to conform with current guidelines were estimated. Food habits that were pertinent to the population were identified and help to provide goal-based guidance for intervention design. 3avegetables 3afood intake 3adietary fiber 3aeating habits 3apolysaccharides 3anutritional intervention 3arecreation 3awalking 3aadenoma 3acolorectal neoplasms 3afood records 3alifestyle 0adiet 0afruits (food)1 aAnderson, A.S.1 aSteele, R.J.C.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2008 Oct., v. 21, no. 5 p.494-501dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.2008.00884.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110519b20110603c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/10/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02183naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001500170245013400185300001600319500009300335500002400428500001500452520077800467650002001245650001301265650002001278650002501298650002101323650001001344650002101354650001801375653000901393653004701402700001701449773011301466852000901579856009201588930003301680945002501713946001101738655001201749IND4409829720221117222025.0080905e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440982972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1863-2378.2008.01143.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aL8001 aElchos, B.10aDiscussion of the Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions: Preventing Zoonotic Disease Transmission in Veterinary Personnel  ap. 526-528.  aIn the special issue on zoonoses and companion animals / edited by Katherine A.

In contrast to the risk of exposure to blood in human medicine, infections from zoonotic diseases in veterinary personnel are primarily related to exposure to animal faeces, infected skin, wounds, droplets and puncture wounds. Infection-control measures in veterinary practices are often insufficient to prevent zoonotic disease transmission. The Veterinary Standard Precautions (VSP) Compendium is designed to help prevent transmission of zoonotic pathogens from animal patients to veterinary personnel in private practice. 3aanimal injuries 3azoonoses 3arisk management 3adisease transmission 3aanimal pathogens 3afeces 3abites and stings 3aveterinarians 0askin 0aVeterinary Standard Precautions Compendium1 aScheftel, J.0 tZoonoses and public health.g2008 Oct., v. 55, no. 8-10 p.526-528dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1863-23787nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1863-2378.2008.01143.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03618naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189100001500198245015100213300001600364500009300380500002400473520113200497650000901629650001401638650001401652650001901666650001501685650002301700650003101723650001501754650001401769650002601783650001301809650003001822650001201852650004301864650002801907650004601935650000901981650003101990650004102021650003302062650002202095650001102117650002702128650003202155650001802187650001702205650005602222650005502278650006302333650002202396650001302418651001102431651001102442653001802453700001902471700001502490700001302505700001902518700001602537773011302553852000902666856009202675930003302767945002502800946001102825655001202836IND4409828920221117222212.0080905e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440982892DNAL7 a188119072pmid7 a10.1111/j.1863-2378.2008.01147.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aR200 0aX3801 aFinley, R.14aThe Occurrence and Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Salmonellae Isolated from Commercially Available Canine Raw Food Diets in Three Canadian Cities  ap. 462-469.  aIn the special issue on zoonoses and companion animals / edited by Katherine A.

A total of 166 commercial frozen raw food diet samples were purchased from randomly selected local pet stores in three Canadian cities for a period of 8 months. All samples were evaluated for the presence of Salmonella, serotyped and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. There was an overall Salmonella prevalence of 21%; chicken was an ingredient for 67% of the Salmonella-positive diets. Eighteen different Salmonella serotypes were recovered, and resistance was observed to 12 of the 16 antimicrobials tested, with the majority of Ontario isolates exhibiting resistance to ampicillin and Calgary isolates to tetracycline. This study demonstrates the potential risk of raw food diets, especially for immunocompromised individuals, and stresses the need for implementing regulatory guidelines for the production of these diets in order to help control and ideally eliminate the bacterial risks associated with their use and consumption. 3adogs 3apet foods 3araw foods 3afood pathogens 3aSalmonella 3afeed contamination 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aprevalence 3aserotypes 3aantibiotic resistance 3achickens 2aAnimal Feedxmicrobiology 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDog Diseasesxepidemiologyxtransmission. 2aDogs 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aHumans 2aImmunocompromised Host 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPublic Health 2aRisk Factors 2aSalmonellaxdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aSalmonella Infectionsxepidemiologyxtransmission. 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalxepidemiologyxtransmission. 2aTreatment Outcome 2aZoonoses 3aCanada 0aCanada 0araw pet foods1 aReid-Smith, R.1 aRibble, C.1 aPopa, M.1 aVandermeer, M.1 aAramini, J.0 tZoonoses and public health.g2008 Oct., v. 55, no. 8-10 p.462-469dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1863-23787nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1863-2378.2008.01147.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle04244naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003600133040001800169072000900187072000900196072000900205100002400214245012900238300001800367500002400385500001500409506007600424520173100500506003702231650002602268650000802294650003402302650001002336650002902346650003102375650002102406650001702427650001302444650002102457650002302478650001502501650001702516650002002533650001102553650002202564650001002586650001502596650002102611650001902632650002802651650005502679650001702734650001102751650003802762650001102800650002502811650000902836650001602845650003002861650004302891650003202934651001802966653001802984653003303002653002003035700002303055700002003078700002503098773013703123852000903260856008603269930003303355945002503388946001303413655001203426IND4409831320221207125201.0080905e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440983132DNAL7 a187553172pmid7 aPMC25860682pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2008.06.4422doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT000 0aX3801 aPencina, Michael J.10aPerformance of a Method for Identifying the Unique Dietary Patterns of Adult Women and Men: The Framingham Nutrition Studies  ap. 1453-1460.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Identification of population dietary patterns has been recommended by experts as a key to developing innovative and targeted nutrition interventions and achieving long-term dietary behavior changes for health promotion and chronic disease risk reduction.

Design: The first examination of Framingham Nutrition Studies took place between 1984 and 1987 and included 1,828 women and 1,666 men who completed the Framingham semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Five unique dietary patterns for each sex were identified. Here we used Fisher's discriminant functions to create classification algorithms for identifying the dietary patterns of new individuals. Its validity and performance was evaluated using a variety of statistical tools. Results: The new Framingham Dietary Pattern algorithm classified about 80% of women or men correctly and κ statistics exceeded 0.70. The cluster-specific sensitivities ranged from 0.70 to 1.00 and specificities were all >0.88. The pooled conditional c statistics were 0.95 and 0.96 for women and men, respectively. Overall, we can be confident that our methodology offers a valid identification of male and female dietary patterns when applied in practice. Conclusions: The Framingham Dietary Pattern technique is a valid and reliable method for identifying the unique dietary behavior of adults. Our approach can also be used to guide the development and evaluation of other composite dietary quality indices.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiet-related diseases 3amen 3afood frequency questionnaires 3awomen 3anutritional intervention 3apopulation characteristics 3ahealth promotion 3arisk factors 3avalidity 3amodel validation 3agender differences 3aalgorithms 3afood choices 3abehavior change 3aadults 3adisease incidence 2aAdult 2aAlgorithms 2aCluster Analysis 2aCohort Studies 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDietxclassificationxstatistics & numerical data. 2aDiet Surveys 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behaviorxclassification. 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aSurveys and Questionnairesxstandards. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0aMassachusetts 0aeating habits 0aFramingham Nutrition Studies 0ahuman nutrition1 aMillen, Barbara E.1 aHayes, Laura J.1 aD'Agostino, Ralph B.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2008 Sept., v. 108, no. 9 p.1453-1460dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2008.06.4423Available from publisher's Web site  a20090107b20090206c00000000  aINDd6CTe2008/12/09  aOther US 7aarticle04467naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183072000900192072000900201100002100210245009200231300001800323500002400341500001500365520205700380650002302437650000902460650002402469650001802493650003702511650002402548650001902572650002402591650002002615650003902635650001302674650001202687650002502699650001702724650001302741650001002754650004002764650005802804650002802862650002502890650001102915650001802926650001102944650000902955650002102964650004902985650003703034650001803071650004303089651001703132651001703149653002603166653007503192653002003267700002203287700002303309700002003332700001803352773013703370852000903507856008603516930003303602945002503635946001303660655001203673IND4409831820221117222005.0080905e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440983182DNAL7 a187553222pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2008.06.4292doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT300 0aX380 0aE310 0aT1201 aProbart, Claudia10aStatewide Assessment of Local Wellness Policies in Pennsylvania Public School Districts  ap. 1497-1502.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWith the passage of the Child Nutrition and Women, Infants, and Children Reauthorization Act of 2004, schools that sponsor school meals programs are required to establish local wellness policies to address childhood obesity. Little is known about how school districts will respond to this mandate, the nature of local wellness policies, and their compliance with this mandate. The objectives of this cross-sectional descriptive study, conducted in early 2007, were to assess local wellness policies established by Pennsylvania public school districts, compare these policies to local wellness policy mandate requirements, and provide information about local wellness policy development and implementation. Local wellness policies were collected from all Pennsylvania public school districts that sponsor school meals programs (N=499). School district representatives also completed and submitted a local wellness policy checklist, providing information about local wellness policy development and implementation. Policy goal data were abstracted and entered into a Microsoft Access database along with local wellness policy data. Frequencies were calculated. All required public school districts (N=499) submitted local wellness policies. Most school district local wellness policies (85.6%-100%) met each mandate requirement (eg, included goals for nutrition education, physical activity, etc.). The most common policy goals were general and may be difficult to measure, suggesting school staff may need assistance developing action plans and measuring policy implementation. Most respondents identified the superintendent (n=377; 75.6%) and school foodservice director (n=301; 60.3%) as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. Questions remain about feasibility of these district-level personnel to ensure policy implementation at the school level. The ability of local wellness policies to impact childhood obesity will depend on efforts at both the school and district levels to implement and enforce local wellness policies. 3adevelopment policy 3adiet 3amathematical models 3apublic health 3aUSDA food and nutrition programs 3anutrition education 3apublic schools 3aschool food service 3apolicy analysis 3agovernmental programs and projects 3achildren 3aobesity 3anutrition assessment 3aschool meals 3astudents 2aChild 2aChild Nutrition Sciencesxeducation 2aChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aExercisexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHealth Policy 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNutrition Policy 2aObesityxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aOutcome Assessment, Health Care. 2aPublic Policy 2aSchoolsxorganization & administration 3aPennsylvania 0aPennsylvania 0adiet-related diseases 0aNutrition and Women, Infants, and Children Reauthorization Act of 2004 0ahuman nutrition1 aMcDonnell, Elaine1 aWeirich, J.

The spatial configuration of the hydro-meteorological station network makes it possible to characterize the catchment-scale hydrological impact of the WSCW. The catchment is subdivided into two parts, the upper subcatchment and the lower subarea. The latter covers 84% of the catchment surface area and gathers 97% of the surfaces controlled by WSCW. The space-time variability of the rainfall-runoff relationship is first analysed, comparing the runoff responses from the two nested catchments for different rain event depth ranges. A non-parametric test, based on a resampling approach, is applied to the lower subarea runoff simulated with the GR4J daily lumped rainfall-runoff model, which is calibrated for several subsets of data. Results indicate that from 1989 to 2005, the runoff produced by rainfall below 40mm in the lower subarea was reduced by some 71-75%, a significant change at the 95% confidence level. This drop in runoff is estimated at 41-50% when considering all rain depths and at 28-32% when including the upper subcatchment in the analysis. No runoff change is found for above-40mm rains in the lower subarea, nor for any rain depth range in the upper subcatchment. An analysis of various possible sources for the runoff reduction such as climate, land use/land cover, or water exchanges with the aquifer, led to the conclusion that WSCW, which were developed over 32% of the lower subarea since 1989, are the most likely cause for that reduction. Their sharp hydrological effects should be taken into account in order to manage the water resources at the river basin scale, especially in populated semi-arid areas where conflicts between water uses increase dramatically. 3asoil conservation 3awater conservation 3aridging 3asemiarid zones 3awatersheds 3arain 3awatershed hydrology 3arunoff 3aTunisia 0acontour ridges 0areservoirs1 aCappelaere, Bernard1 aLeduc, Christian0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 Sept. 30, v. 359, no. 3-4 p.210-224dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.07.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20081125b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/25  aNon-US 7aarticle04109naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175072000900184072000900193072000900202100001400211245010700225300001600332500002400348500001500372520159300387650001501980650001401995650002302009650002002032650002602052650003102078650002102109650001702130650002402147650002102171650001802192650001302210650001402223650001502237650001102252650002302263650002102286650001202307650003102319650005502350650002102405650002102426650004002447650001102487650002002498650002602518650002802544650002802572650006402600650003102664650004102695650004102736650001702777653002402794653001702818653001802835653001802853653003202871700001602903700001502919700001702934700001502951700001802966773010902984852000903093856009603102930003303198945002503231946001103256655001203267IND4409835920221117222051.0080905e20081001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440983592DNAL7 a186026822pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.05.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL200 0aL210 0aL8321 aLavon, Y.10aExposure to endotoxin during estrus alters the timing of ovulation and hormonal concentrations in cows  ap. 956-967.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of intramammary (IMM) or intravenous (IV) administration of E. coli endotoxin (LPS), at the onset of estrus, at the time of ovulation was examined. Steroid and gonadotropin concentrations around ovulation were also determined. Lactating Holstein cows (n =33) were assigned to saline-controls (n =12) and treated with LPS-IV (0.5μg/kg; n =13) or LPS-IMM (10μg; n =8). Synchronized cows were observed continuously for estrus. LPS (or saline) was injected within 30min from the onset of standing estrus, at peak estradiol concentrations. The typical rise of body temperature, somatic cell count, cortisol, and NAGase activity was noted. One-third of both LPS-IV- and LPS-IMM-treated cows were manifested by an extended estrus to ovulation (E-O) interval of around 75h or did not ovulate, compared with about 30h in the other 2/3 of LPS cows and all controls. Estradiol concentrations 24h before and after LPS did not differ between groups. However, LPS-IV cows with extended intervals exhibited another estrus and an additional rise of estradiol followed by delayed ovulation. LPS-treated cows with a delayed E-O interval had low or delayed LH surge; two LPS-treated cows did not exhibit LH surge and did not ovulate. All control cows exhibited normal hormone levels. Delayed ovulation was associated with a delayed rise of luteal progesterone. The results indicated that exposing cows to endotoxin during estrus induced a decreased and delayed LH surge in one-third of the cows. This was associated with delayed ovulation, which reduces the chances of successful fertilization. 3adairy cows 3aestradiol 3atemporal variation 3ablood chemistry 3aintravenous injection 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3abody temperature 3aprogesterone 3aluteinizing hormone 3abacterial toxins 3acorpus luteum 3acortisol 3aovulation 3aendotoxins 3aestrus 3asomatic cell count 3aEscherichia coli 2aAnimals 2aCattlexbloodxphysiology. 2aEndotoxinsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aEscherichia coli 2aEstradiolxblood 2aEstrous Cyclexbloodxdrug effects. 2aFemale 2aHormonesxblood 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aInjections, Intradermal 2aInjections, Intravenous 2aLipopolysaccharidesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aLuteinizing Hormonexblood 2aMammary Glands, Animalxdrug effects 2aOvulationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTime Factors 0aapplication methods 0aluteal phase 0agonadotropins 0aestrous cycle 0aintramammary administration1 aLeitner, G.1 aGoshen, T.1 aBraw-Tal, R.1 aJacoby, S.1 aWolfenson, D.0 tTheriogenology.g2008 Oct. 1, v. 70, no. 6 p.956-967dButterworth-Heinemann; [New York]x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.05.0583Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/15  aNon-US 7aarticle04179naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175072000900184072000900193100001300202245014800215300001600363500002400379500001500403520176600418650002002184650002102204650002202225650002502247650001602272650000902288650002102297650001702318650001802335650001102353650001502364650001202379650001702391650001002408650001802418650001202436650003102448650002902479650003302508650005102541650002002592650003302612650003002645650002202675650004002697650001102737650003702748650000902785650000902794650002402803650002302827650001202850650003802862650004702900650003502947653002902982653002003011653001803031700001403049700001403063700001303077773010903090852000903199856009603208930003303304945002503337946001103362655001203373IND4409835320221117222226.0080905e20081001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440983532DNAL7 a185857742pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.05.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL210 0aL6001 aRoth, Z.14aThe antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) moderates the deleterious effects of maternal hyperthermia on follicle-enclosed oocytes in mice  ap. 887-897.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHyperthermia-induced oxidative stress is one of the mechanisms suggested to underlie loss of developmental competence in mouse embryos. In this study, we examined whether pretreatment with the antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) can alleviate the negative effects of hyperthermia on developmental competence of the ovarian pool of oocytes and improve embryonic development. Female mice (CB6F1) were synchronized (eCG+hCG) and injected with 0.4ml EGCG (100mg/kg body weight) or with saline. Both EGCG- and saline-treated mice were exposed to heat stress (HS; 40°C, 65% RH) or kept under normothermal conditions (Control; 22°C, 45% RH). In vivo-derived zygotes were recovered 20h after hCG administration and cultured in vitro. Maternal hyperthermia attenuated embryonic cleavage rate in association with further disruption in embryonic early cleavage and subsequently, with embryonic development. While pretreatment with EGCG did not affect the proportion of zygotes that cleaved to the two-cell stage, it appeared to moderate the effect of hyperthermia on both cleavage timing and developmental rate, as reflected by an increased rate of early cleaved embryos and blastocyst formation. Blastocyst developmental competence was also improved, as indicated by the increased total cell number and percentage of embryos that underwent hatching, in association with reduced apoptotic status, as reflected by the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells and intensity of caspase activity for the HS-EGCG embryos vs. HS-saline ones. In summary, while hyperthermia disrupts the competence of the follicle-enclosed oocyte, in vivo administration of the antioxidant EGCG improves developmental competence and the quality of the embryos that develop from these oocytes. 3amaternal effect 3aoxidative stress 3aovarian follicles 3adevelopmental stages 3aheat stress 3amice 3aepigallocatechin 3apretreatment 3aanimal models 3azygote 3ablastocyst 3aoocytes 3aantioxidants 3afever 3acell cleavage 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aBlastocystxdrug effects 2aBody Temperaturexphysiology 2aCatechinxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aCells, Cultured 2aCytoprotectionxdrug effects 2aEmbryo Culture Techniques 2aEmbryo, Mammalian 2aEmbryonic Developmentxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aFeverxcomplicationsxpathology. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMothers 2aOocytesxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aOvarian Folliclexdrug effectsxpathology. 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 0adevelopmental competence 0aembryo (animal) 0aembryogenesis1 aAroyo, A.1 aYavin, S.1 aArav, A.0 tTheriogenology.g2008 Oct. 1, v. 70, no. 6 p.887-897dButterworth-Heinemann; [New York]x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.05.0533Available from publisher's Web site  a20090409b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02155naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165100002000174245006500194300001300259500002400272520094900296650001501245650002101260650000901281650001001290650001701300650002201317650001901339650001301358650001101371650002201382650001801404651001001422700001701432773009501449852000901544856008701553930003301640945002501673946001101698655001201709IND4409837520221117221959.0080905e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440983752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2008.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ710 0aF120 0aE2001 aErenstein, Olaf10aZero tillage impacts in India's rice-wheat systems: A review  ap. 1-14.  aIncludes references  aTo date, the most widely adopted resource conserving technology in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of South Asia has been zero-tillage (ZT) wheat after rice, particularly in India. The paper reviews and synthesizes the experience with ZT in the Indian IGP. ZT wheat is particularly appropriate for rice-wheat systems in the IGP by alleviating system constraints by allowing earlier wheat planting, helping control the weed Phalaris minor, reducing production costs and saving water. ZT wheat after rice generates substantial benefits at the farm level (US$97ha⁻¹) through the combination of a 'yield effect' (a 5-7% yield increase, particularly due to more timely planting of wheat) and a 'cost savings effect' (US$52ha⁻¹, particularly tillage savings). These benefits explain the widespread interest of farmers and the rapidity of the diffusion across the Indian IGP, further aided by the wide applicability of this mechanical innovation. 3ano-tillage 3acropping systems 3arice 3awheat 3aOryza sativa 3aTriticum aestivum 3adirect seeding 3adrilling 3ayields 3acosts and returns 3aprofitability 3aIndia1 aVijay Laxmi.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2008 , v. 100, no. 1-2 p.1-14dElsevier Sciencex0167-19877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2008.05.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/11/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02404naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008700129300001600216500001500232520140100247650001501648650001601663650002301679650002001702650001501722650001201737650002101749650000901770650002001779653000901799653000901808653001901817700001601836700001701852773009401869852000901963939003301972946001302005655001202018IND9203258620221117222035.0920521e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920325862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasselli, J.R.10aRelationship of adipocyte size to hyperphagia in developing male obese Zucker rats  ap. R33-R38.  a2019-12-04  aIn growing male obese Zucker rats, hyperphagia reaches a maximum or "breakpoint" and declines at an earlier age with high fat than with chow-type diets. A serial adipose tissue biopsy technique was used to correlate changes of retroperitoneal adipocyte size and feeding behavior in 5- to 7-wk-old male lean and obese rats fed laboratory chow or a 35% fat diet until 30 wk of age. Although chow-fed groups had significantly greater cumulative intake, fat-fed groups had significantly greater body weight gain, retroperitoneal depot weight, and adipocyte number. Mean adipocyte size increased continuously in chow-fed groups but decreased over weeks 20-30 in fat-fed groups, reflecting increased adipocyte number. In fat-fed obese rats, hyperphagia reached a breakpoint at 11 wk and disappeared by 13 wk. In chow-fed obese rats, hyperphagia reached a breakpoint at 15-16 wk and disappeared by 19 wk. Biopsy samples revealed that adipocyte size of fat-fed obese rats was already close to maximal at 10 wk (1.12 microgram lipid), while that of chow-fed obese rats only approached maximal at 20 wk (0.81 microgram lipid). At these time points, lipoprotein lipase activity paralleled adipocyte size. These data indicate that the duration of the growing obese rat's hyperphagia coincides with adipocyte filling and suggest the existence of feeding stimulatory and inhibitory signals from adipose tissue. 3aadipocytes 3adietary fat 3alipoprotein lipase 3aliveweight gain 3aovereating 3aobesity 3afeeding behavior 3arats 3aenzyme activity 0asize 0adiet 0ahigh-fat diets1 aFiene, J.A.1 aMaggio, C.A.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1992 Jan., v. 262, no. 1:pt.2 p.R33-R38x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03876naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195072000900204100002400213245014000237300001600377500002400393520230100417650002002718650001202738650001702750650002402767650002002791650002202811650001302833650002002846650001202866650001902878650001202897650002502909650004102934650003002975650004403005650001303049700001903062773009803081852000903179856008903188930003303277945002503310946001103335655001203346IND4409837020221117222219.0080905e20080917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440983702DNAL7 a186760352pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL810 0aL600 0aL001 0aM0011 aGillis, Patricia L.10aInvestigating a potential mechanism of Cd resistance in Chironomus riparius larvae using kinetic analysis of calcium and cadmium uptake  ap. 180-187.  aIncludes references  aThe uptake kinetics of waterborne Ca and Cd, both independently and in combination, were examined in C. riparius larvae, which are extremely Cd tolerant. Larvae exposed to Ca (100-2500μmolL⁻¹), exhibited classic Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics for Ca influx, measured using ⁴⁵Ca as a radio-tracer. The maximum rate of Ca influx ([formula removed]) was 0.39μmolg⁻¹ h⁻¹, and the Ca concentration where the carrier reached half saturation ( K M Ca ) was 289μmolL⁻¹. Cd influx was measured using ¹⁰⁹Cd as a radio-tracer in larvae exposed to Cd (0-1400μmolL⁻¹) while the Ca concentration was set to the K M Ca . This revealed a [formula removed] (2.26μmolg⁻¹ h⁻¹) which was nearly 6-fold higher that of Ca. This unusually high capacity for Cd uptake is in accordance with the huge tissue Cd burdens that chironomid larvae are able to accumulate during high level exposures. The apparent K M Cd (1133μmolCdL⁻¹), when recalculated to account for the background Ca level, was still high (567μmolCdL⁻¹), suggesting that this organism has a low affinity for Cd relative to most aquatic animals, indeed lower or comparable to its affinity for Ca. In consequence, even well above environmentally relevant Cd exposures, C. riparius does not accumulate Cd at the expense of Ca, thereby avoiding internal hypocalcaemia, in contrast to most other organisms which are much more sensitive to Cd. However, Ca influx was significantly reduced when 1200μmolCdL⁻¹ was added to Ca exposures (96-2410μmolL⁻¹). Michaelis-Menten analysis revealed a similar [formula removed] in Cd-exposed and control larvae (i.e. exposed only to Ca), but that the apparent K M Ca was many-fold higher in larvae which were simultaneously exposed to Ca and Cd. Conversely, increasing Ca concentrations (96-2410μmolL⁻¹) progressively inhibited Cd uptake from a Cd exposure concentration (1200μmolL⁻¹), providing additional support for a common transport system. These results suggest that the interaction of Cd and Ca in C. riparius is one of simple competitive interaction, and that the unusual Cd transport kinetics (low affinity, high capacity) relative to fairly standard Ca transport kinetics help explain the unusual tolerance that this organism has to acute Cd exposure. 3awater pollution 3acadmium 3aheavy metals 3aChironomus riparius 3aaquatic insects 3auptake mechanisms 3akinetics 3ametal tolerance 3acalcium 3aacute toxicity 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transport 2aCadmiumxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aCalciumxpharmacokinetics 2aChironomidaexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aKinetics1 aWood, Chris M.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2008 Sept. 17, v. 89, no. 3 p.180-187dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.06.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20081030b20081101c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/10/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02075naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245013900145300001800284520082200302650002801124650001201152650001101164650000801175650002501183650002501208650001101233650002401244650001801268650002301286650001801309650002801327650004001355650005201395653002801447700001501475700001601490700001901506773006301525852000901588939003301597946001101630655001201641IND9203255820221117221634.0920520s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920325582DNAL7 a18013212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurevitz, M.10aNucleotide sequence and structure analysis of a cDNA encoding an alpha insect toxin from the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus  ap. 1270-1272.  aA approximately 370 base pair cDNA encoding the alpha insect toxin Lqh(alpha)It of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus was cloned and sequenced.

Two additional amino acid residues that do not correspond to the purified toxin are found at the COOH-terminus and may imply post-translation modification.

The tissue-specific abundance of the annexin transcript was found to correlate closely with abundance of annexin protein as revealed by their partial purification and analysis with antisera specific for annexins isolated from tomato suspension-culture cells. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aHordeum vulgare 3aroots 3aleaves 3astems 3acell suspension culture 3aplant proteins 3aDNA 3aRNA 3agene expression1 aGurr, S.J.1 aMcPherson, M.J.1 aRoberts, K.1 aBowles, D.J.0 tBiochemical journal.g1992 Jan. 15, v. 281, no. pt.2 p.501-505x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a20110707b20110805c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02986naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002100135245014200156300001800298500002400316500002300340520149900363650002401862650002201886650001801908650001101926650001401937650001001951650001301961650001501974650001801989650001202007650002302019650002102042650001402063650001302077650001302090650001502103650003502118650001002153651001102163700002502174700002302199700002102222773016502243852000902408856007502417655001202492IND4461771120221117221705.0110915s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446177112DNAL7 a10.1139/x11-0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalbot, Patricia13aAn efficient single nucleotide polymorphism assay to diagnose the genomic identity of poplar species and hybrids on the Canadian prairies  ap. 1102-1111.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aHybridization frequently occurs among poplars, both naturally and artificially, hindering identification. Over 32 million clonal poplars, predominantly hybrids, have been planted throughout the Canadian prairies over the past century, making confirmation of genomic identity important. We developed a genotyping assay that rapidly diagnoses four compatible Populus species (Populus balsamifera L. and Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh.: indigenous, Populus laurifolia Ledeb. and Populus nigra L.: exotics) and their hybrids found throughout this ecozone. First, we sequenced 23 genes from representative provenances of the four Populus species to discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Second, we developed and validated a medium-throughput genotyping assay of 26 diagnostic SNPs within these genes. We used this assay to genotype 198 trees from natural populations as well as 30 clones (pure species and hybrids), including those broadly distributed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s Agroforestry Development Centre since 1910. This suite of SNPs has the resolving power to correctly identify pure species and hybrids of Populus. We confirmed the identity of clones of well-documented origin, complex hybrids with exotic components, and paternity of open-pollinated progenies from breeding programs. This diagnostic tool should prove useful for efficient molecular fingerprinting of breeding material and for further studies of interspecific gene flow on the Canadian prairies. 3aPopulus balsamifera 3aPopulus deltoides 3aPopulus nigra 3aclones 3agene flow 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3aintroduced species 3aopen pollination 3apaternity 3aplanting 3aprairies 3aprovenance 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atrees 3aCanada1 aThompson, Stacey Lee1 aSchroeder, William1 aIsabel, Nathalie0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2011 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.1102-1111dNRC Research Press, National Research Council CanadawJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x11-0253Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03108naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245016400132300001800296500002400314520192700338650002702265650001902292650002102311650001002332650001102342650002002353650001602373650001702389650002402406650000902430650001102439650001402450650002302464650001502487650001102502650001402513650002202527650001802549650001802567650000902585773007102594852000902665655001202674IND4461775320221117221709.0110915s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446177532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbano, Joseph P.10aIron-[S,S']-EDDS (FeEDDS) Chelate as an Iron Source for Horticultural Crop Production: Marigold Growth and Nutrition, Spectral Properties, and Photodegradation  ap. 1148-1153.  aIncludes references  aAminopolycarboxylic acid (APCA) complexones, commonly referred to as ligands or chelating agents, like ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), are commonly used in soluble fertilizers to supply copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and/or zinc (Zn) to plants. Offsite runoff and contamination of surface waters with these chelating agents is of increasing concern as a result of their reported ability to remobilize heavy metals in sediments and their low susceptibility to biodegradation. The APCA ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS) is a structural isomer of EDTA with the [S,S'] stereoisomer of the complexone, a compound naturally produced by actinomycetes, and is biodegradable. Information on the use of [S,S']-EDDS as a chelating agent in formulating soluble fertilizers for the production of horticultural crops is limited. Therefore, a series of studies were conducted with the objectives of evaluating Fe[S,S']-EDDS as an Fe-chelate fertilizer agent in the production of marigold and [S,S']-EDDS (free ligand) and/or Fe[S,S']-EDDS spectral properties and vulnerability to photodegrdation. Marigold grown in peat-based media were fertilized with complete nutrient solution containing 1 mg·L–1 Fe from FeEDDS, FeEDTA, or FeDTPA. There was no significant difference in foliar Fe or Mn between Fe-chelate treatments, averaging 140 µg·g–1 and 88 µg·g–1, respectively, nor were there significant differences in leaf dry weight (2.30 g) between Fe treatments. Spectra of [S,S']-EDDS and Fe[S,S']-EDDS produced from ferrous or ferric sources of Fe absorbed maximally in the 210 to 230 nm and 238 to 240-nm range, respectively. The [S,S']-EDDS complexone used in the current study, a 30% assay solution, had chromaphoric properties, appearing light yellow in color. When exposed to light, Fe[S,S']-EDDS quickly degraded at a rate at least twice that of FeEDTA. 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3abiodegradation 3achelating agents 3acolor 3acopper 3acrop production 3afertilizers 3aheavy metals 3ahorticultural crops 3airon 3aleaves 3amanganese 3anutrient solutions 3aphotolysis 3arunoff 3asediments 3aspectral analysis 3astereoisomers 3asurface water 3azinc0 tHortScience.g2011 Aug., v. 46, no. 8 p.1148-1153x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245019400155300001800349500002400367500002300391520196200414650002502376650002902401650002702430650002702457650001802484650003102502650001202533650001302545650001202558650001802570650001002588650001602598700002002614700002702634773015102661852000902812856007502821655001202896IND4461775920221117221617.0110915s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446177592DNAL7 a10.1139/x11-0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelsey, Rick G.10aEthanol synthesis by anoxic root segments from five cedar species relates to their habitat attributes but not their known differences in vulnerability to Phytophthora lateralis root disease  ap. 1202-1211.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aEthanol synthesis by anoxic root segments from Port Orford cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (A. Murray bis) Parl.); yellow cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Spach); Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides (L.) Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.); western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don), and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens (Torr.) Florin ) was compared to determine whether the amounts that they produced during flooding could contribute the known greater vulnerability of Port Orford cedar to infection by Phytophthora lateralis Tucker & Milbrat. Roots were incubated in water at 5, 15, 25, and 35 °C for 14 days with periodic sampling. After 12 h of anoxic stress, Atlantic white cedar and yellow cedar roots produced equal quantities of ethanol that were about two times more than produced by the other three species, which did not differ from one another. The roots remained anoxic for 14 days, with ethanol concentrations increasing 6 to 11 times depending on the species. After 14 days, Atlantic white cedar remained the highest ethanol producer at two to three times more than the other species, whereas incense cedar yields were the lowest. Yellow cedar, western redcedar, and Port Orford cedar had intermediate levels of ethanol. The similarity in responses of Port Orford cedar to the other species is strong evidence that ethanol is not an important contributor to its known greater vulnerability to P. lateralis infection. In general, root incubation temperature affected ethanol synthesis similarly for all species. Increases in temperature from 5 to 15 °C or 15 to 25 °C doubled the ethanol yields at 12 h. Literature ratings of anaerobic tolerance for these cedars were compared with ratings based on their ethanol yields after 12 h or 14 days of anoxia. The latter rating appears to more closely correspond with the cedars associations to wet, mesic environments and their likelihood of experiencing anoxia via flooding. 3aCalocedrus decurrens 3aChamaecyparis lawsoniana 3aChamaecyparis thyoides 3aPhytophthora lateralis 3aThuja plicata 3aXanthocyparis nootkatensis 3aethanol 3ahabitats 3ahypoxia 3aroot diseases 3aroots 3atemperature1 aJoseph, Gladwin1 aMcWilliams, Michael G.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2011 June, v. 41, no. 6 p.1202-1211dNRC Research Press, National Research Council Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x11-0433Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02382naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002300135245008700158300001800245500002400263500002300287520136300310650001701673650001101690650002001701650001201721650001701733650001101750650001001761651001801771700002001789773015101809852000901960856007501969655001202044IND4461774220221117221624.0110915s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446177422DNAL7 a10.1139/x11-0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchanan, Megan L.12aA methodological analysis of canopy disturbance reconstructions using Quercus alba  ap. 1359-1367.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aForest disturbance history reconstructions in the eastern US commonly rely on the analysis of a single tree-ring series per individual. However, this method can result in an underrepresentation of radial growth releases and canopy disturbance events. We analyzed paired tree-ring series from 884 Quercus alba L. individuals to quantify discrepant patterns of intratree release frequency, magnitude, and initiation years. We also developed a model for Q. alba that accounts for this underrepresentation of releases. Of the 884 trees analyzed, 216 exhibited radial growth releases. Only 13 of these 216 trees recorded the same canopy disturbance events in both series. Through analysis of a single growth-ring series per tree, a minimum of 39 and a maximum of 241 releases could be detected from the trees in the data set. Of the total number of release events, 238 (85%) occurred only in one of the paired tree-ring series. For stand development studies requiring the frequency of canopy disturbance alone, a multiplicative factor of 1.72 can provide the information necessary without deviating from the standard practice in the eastern US of collecting and analyzing a single increment core per tree. Studies requiring spatially and temporally explicit information regarding disturbance should extract and analyze two or more tree-ring series per individual. 3aQuercus alba 3acanopy 3adata collection 3aforests 3agrowth rings 3amodels 3atrees 3aUnited States1 aHart, Justin L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2011 June, v. 41, no. 6 p.1359-1367dNRC Research Press, National Research Council Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x11-0573Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02782naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245010100134300001800235500002400253520174300277650002302020650001402043650001602057650001802073650001602091650001502107650001302122650002302135650002002158650002502178650001402203650002902217650002602246650001302272650001002285700002102295773007102316852000902387655001202396IND4461776720221117221658.0110915s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446177672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinoshita, Takafumi10aDifferential Nutrient Uptake and Its Transport in Tomato Plants on Different Fertilizer Regimens  ap. 1170-1175.  aIncludes references  aApplication of controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) to a root-proof capillary wick irrigation system (a type of subirrigation method) has both economical and environmental benefits, because it does not require any equipment for fertigation and minimizes water leaching. In this study, we examined the effects of CRF and liquid fertilizer (LF), a conventional fertigation method, on fruit production and nutrient uptake and transport in forcing tomato cultures for harvesting 15 trusses per plant from October to June. No significant difference was noted in marketable fruit yield between CRF- and LF-treated plants. The quantity of nutrient uptake per plant and per fruit yield was lower with CRF than with LF, indicating that nutrients were used more efficiently for fruit production in plants grown with CRF. Analysis of the volume and mineral concentrations of xylem exudates indicated that the amount of nutrients absorbed was greater with LF than with CRF, particularly after the tenth truss was harvested. Mineral concentrations in the substrate solution of CRF-treated plants were initially higher than those in the substrate solution of LF-treated plants but extremely low after the second truss was harvested, whereas mineral concentrations in the xylem exudates were similar in CRF and LF plants until the eighth truss was harvested. Thus, the difference in mineral concentrations between the xylem exudates and substrate solution was much larger in the case of CRF than in the case of LF, indicating that the plants absorbed the bulk of nutrients immediately after their release from the CRF surface. Therefore, CRF is suitable in this system, because it combines high fruit production with high nutrient utilization efficiency. 3aecosystem services 3aequipment 3afertigation 3afruit growing 3afruit yield 3aharvesting 3aleaching 3aliquid fertilizers 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient utilization 3anutrients 3aslow-release fertilizers 3asubsurface irrigation 3atomatoes 3axylem1 aMasuda, Masaharu0 tHortScience.g2011 Aug., v. 46, no. 8 p.1170-1175x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009000128300001800218500002400236520179600260650001702056650001202073650002102085650001302106650001502119650002102134650001302155650001102168650002302179650001902202650001302221650002502234650001402259650001302273650000902286650001402295650001102309650000902320650002002329650001002349650001502359650002002374700001902394700002402413700002202437773007102459852000902530655001202539IND4461776920221117221629.0110915s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446177692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtucha, Amaya10aNitrogen Dynamics and Nutrient Budgets in Four Orchard Groundcover Management Systems  ap. 1184-1193.  aIncludes references  aExcessive nitrogen (N) applications can increase surface and water contamination, and leaching losses may occur when N fertilizer rates are too high relative to crop demands and soil N availability. Quantifying nutrient inputs, cycling, and outputs from orchards provides a method to measure surplus of nutrients, particularly N, that may leach or runoff. We conducted a long-term study to develop N budgets based on observed nutrient dynamics under four groundcover management systems (GMSs) with and without N fertilization. Four GMS treatments were randomly assigned to 12 plots and maintained since 1992 in 2-m-wide strips within tree rows: pre-emergence residual herbicide (PreHerb), post-emergence herbicide (PostHerb), mowed-sod (Sod), and hardwood bark mulch (Mulch). We measured system N inputs in fertilizer, mulch biomass, rain, and irrigation water; N outputs in harvested fruit, surface runoff, and subsurface leaching; and internal N cycling from surface vegetation, soil mineralization, leaf fall, and pruned wood. For the year with N fertilizer (2005), the overall N balance was positive (inputs exceeded outputs) in all GMSs but greater in the PostHerb and Mulch treatments. In the year without N fertilizer (2007), the overall N balance was negative for PreHerb and PostHerb and positive for Mulch and Sod treatments. Soil mineralization and recycling groundcover biomass accounted for greater than 60% of internal N fluxes, and harvested fruit represented greater than 70% of N outputs from the system during both years. During the year with N fertilizer, N losses were 1% to 4% and 18% to 22% through surface runoff and subsurface leaching, respectively.

Their patterns of expression, as studied by RNA and in-situ hybridization, were typical for genes transcribed during cell division. A sixth cDNA clone, Sab2, had a 65.7% identity (on a protein basis) to L2-like ribosomal proteins of Escherichia coli and other lower prokaryotes. In a domain of 50 amino acids, the seventh clone, Sab35, showed 69.0% sequence identity to the ribosomal protein L21 of Rattus norvegicus. The Sab35 mRNA contained in its 5'-untranslated leader sequence small open reading frames, a feature pointing to a possible translational control. The Sab35 in-situ hybridization pattern was to a certain degree different from that of the histone-like clone Sab11: it detected transcripts not only in tissues that are associated with vegetative and reproductive apices but also in sub-apical regions. The visualization in situ of transcripts coded by Sab11, 35 and 44 is discussed as a possible technique for studying differential gene expression in barley meristematic tissues. 3aHordeum vulgare 3ameristems 3aDNA 3aclones 3agene expression 3ahybridization 3aplant morphology 3aultrastructure 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 0ashoot apices 0amolecular sequence data 0asab2 0asab11 0asab16 0asab30 0asab35 0asab44 0asab1071 aCoraggio, I.1 aBecker, D.1 aSalamini, F.0 tPlanta.g1992, v. 186, no. 2 p.227-235x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001962523Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01864naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245009700131300001600228500002400244520084900268650002401117650001301141650001501154650001901169650001301188650001401201650002801215650001401243650002101257650001301278650001701291650001401308773009001322852000901412856009301421655001201514IND4461766220221117221649.0110915s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446176622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoenaga, Ricardo10aDry matter production and leaf elemental concentrations of rambutan grown on an acid Ultisol  ap. 753-761.  aIncludes references  aLittle is known about the adaptability of rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum) to highly acidic soils rich in aluminum (Al). A 2-yr field study was conducted to determine the effects of various levels of soil Al on dry matter production, plant growth, and nutrient concentration in the leaves of four cultivars of rambutan. Cultivars and the cultivar x year interaction were not statistically significant for most variables measured in the study. Total, leaf, petiole, stem and root dry weights significantly increased at soil Al concentrations ranging from 0.67 cmol kg−1 to 11.0 cmol kg−1. At this range of soil Al, the concentrations of Al and manganese (Mn) in leaf tissue declined sharply. The results of this study demonstrate that rambutan is highly tolerant to acid soils and that tolerance may involve an Al- and Mn- exclusion mechanism. 3aNephelium lappaceum 3aUltisols 3aacid soils 3aacid tolerance 3aaluminum 3acultivars 3adry matter accumulation 3amanganese 3anutrient content 3apetioles 3aplant growth 3arambutans0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2011 , v. 34, no. 5-8 p.753-761dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02912naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245024000173300001600413520168400429650001302113650001402126650001702140650001902157650002002176650001102196650001702207650002902224650002202253653002302275700001802298700001702316773006002333852000902393856007802402939003302480946001302513655001202526IND9203229920221117221625.0920519s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920322992DNAL7 a241866702pmid7 a10.1007/BF001962602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHofer, M.U.10aDifferential accumulation of the 10-, 16- and 23-kDa peripheral components of the water-splitting complex of photosystem II in mesophyll and bundle-sheath chloroplasts of the dicotyledonous C4 plant Flaveria trinervia (Spreng.) C. Mohr  ap. 304-312.  aThe differential expression of PSII genes was investigated in mesophyll and bundle-sheath cells of Flaveria trinervia, a dicotyledonous C4 plant of the NADP-malic enzyme type. A comprehensive immunoblot analysis showed that three extrinsic proteins of the water-splitting complex (10, 16 and 23 kDa) are selectively depleted in mature bundle-sheath chloroplasts. In contrast, the reaction-centre core remained virtually unaffected as inferred from the abundance of the 47-kDa chlorophyll-a-binding protein, the D1 and D2 polypeptides, cytochrome b559 and the 34-kDa polypeptide. The selective depletion of the 10-, 16- and 23-kDa polypeptides in bundle-sheath chloroplasts was paralleled by a diminished PSII capacity. On the basis of oxygen evolution in the presence of the artifical electron acceptor 2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, bundle-sheath chloroplasts maintained up to 23% of the PSII capacity shown by mesophyll chloroplasts. However, the levels of the 10-, 16- and 23-kDa proteins and, concomitantly, PSII activity varied to some degree and appeared to be correlated with environmental factors caused by seasonal changes. The selective depletion of the three members of the water-splitting complex was not reflected at the transcript level. The corresponding mRNAs were detectable in considerable amounts in bundle-sheath cells, indicating that the depletion of these proteins is regulated by post-transcriptional events. These findings reinforce the view that the peripheral proteins of the water-splitting complex are a focal point for controlling PSII activity in bundle-sheath chloroplasts of both mono- and dicotyledonous C4 plants of the NADP-malic enzyme subtype. 3aFlaveria 3amesophyll 3achloroplasts 3aphotosystem II 3agene expression 3aoxygen 3agas exchange 3atranscription (genetics) 3aelectron transfer 0agenetic regulation1 aSantore, U.J.1 aWesthoff, P.0 tPlanta.g1992, v. 186, no. 2 p.304-312x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001962603Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03648naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001500189245011700204300001800321500002400339520178000363650002802143650002502171650001302196650001902209650001402228650001802242650002302260650002402283650001102307650002102318650001402339650002802353650003002381650002302411650003902434650003302473650003202506650002002538650002402558650002602582650003002608650002702638653002702665700001502692700001502707700001502722700001502737773011002752852000902862856009202871930003302963945002502996946001303021655001203034IND4409786920221117221640.0080905e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440978692DNAL7 a188036962pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00865.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ5051 aLee, O.-H.10aRadical Scavenging-Linked Antioxidant Activity of Ethanolic Extracts of Diverse Types of Extra Virgin Olive Oils  ap.

The antioxidant potential of the olive oil extracts was assessed by radical scavenging assays using DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS (2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), and hydroxyl radical, as well as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion inhibitory activities. Electron donating ability (EDA) using DPPH assay of 80% ethanol extracts from EVOOs, except arbequina oil, was significantly higher than POO. EDA was markedly higher in blended and picual EVOOs than the extracts from arbequina and hojiblanca EVOOs (P < 0.05). Similarly, ABTS radical scavenging activity of the extracts from the EVOOs was in order of picual EVOO > blended EVOO > hojiblanca EVOO >= POO >= arbequina EVOO. Further, the superoxide anion scavenging activity of blended, picual, and arbequina EVOOs was significantly higher than that of hojiblanca EVOO and POO, which were barely detectable. Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of arbequina and hojiblanca was higher than that of blended, picual EVOOs, and POO. In addition, hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity of the extracts from blended, arbequina, hojiblanca, picual EVOOs, and POO was 63.1 ± 3.1%, 44.4 ± 10.2%, 52.0 ± 2.7%, 71.8 ± 2.5%, and 35.7 ± 10.0%, respectively. Our results indicate that ethanol extracts of several EVOOs contained higher radical scavenging and antioxidant activity than the POO. This antioxidant potential is partly due to the phenolic compounds present in different olive oil grade and is influenced by cultivar type. 3afree radical scavengers 3aantioxidant activity 3aextracts 3afood chemistry 3aolive oil 3aOlea europaea 3aphenolic compounds 3amathematical models 3ahexane 3asuperoxide anion 3acultivars 2aAntioxidantsxchemistry 2aBenzothiazolesxchemistry 2aBiphenyl Compounds 2aFree Radical Scavengersxchemistry 2aHydrogen Peroxidexchemistry 2aHydroxyl Radicalxchemistry 2aOleaxchemistry 2aPicratesxchemistry 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aSulfonic Acidsxchemistry 2aSuperoxidesxchemistry 0aextra virgin olive oil1 aLee, B.

We used riparian microclimate data collected at eight headwater streams in the Oregon Coast Range to compare ordinary kriging (OK), universal kriging (UK), and kriging with external drift (KED) for point prediction of mean maximum air temperature (T(air)). Several topographic and forest structure characteristics were considered as site-specific parameters. Height above stream and distance to stream were the most important covariates in the KED models, which outperformed OK and UK in terms of root mean square error. Sample patterns were optimized based on the kriging variance and the weighted means of shortest distance criterion using the simulated annealing algorithm. The optimized sample patterns outperformed systematic sample patterns in terms of mean kriging variance mainly for small sample sizes. These findings suggest methods for increasing efficiency of microclimate monitoring in riparian areas. 3aair 3aair temperature 3aalgorithms 3aannealing 3aforests 3ageostatistics 3akriging 3amicroclimate 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3ariparian areas 3astreams 3avariance 3aOregon1 aAnderson, Paul D.1 aHagar, Joan C.1 aTemesgen, Hailemariam0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2011 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.974-985dNRC Research Press, National Research Council CanadawJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x11-0153Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02571naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002100135245009400156300001600250500002400266500002300290500001500313520133600328650001101664650001401675650002101689650001101710650002001721650001001741650002201751650001401773650001501787650001501802651001801817651002301835653001601858700002201874700002101896773014801917852000902065856007502074655001202149IND4461763820221117221454.0110915s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446176382DNAL7 a10.1139/x11-0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanson, Jacob J.10aPredicting long-term sapling dynamics and canopy recruitment in northern hardwood forests  ap. 903-919.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aPrediction of forest composition and structure over multiple generations of trees is often hampered by limited data on understory tree dynamics and the highly variable process of canopy recruitment in forest openings. In this paper, we describe a model of sapling dynamics and overstory recruitment for CANOPY, a spatially explicit, crown-based, individual-tree model of gap dynamics. The model incorporates gap size as a predictor of sapling recruitment and height growth, and it mimics the processes of sapling release, gap capture, and lateral gap closure. Calibration data were derived from 12 data sets with a wide range of stand ages and disturbance history in northern hardwood stands in the Great Lakes region, USA. The model accounted for 30%–62% of the variation in sapling density, composition, and growth rates. Predicted effects of increasing gap size on growth rate were similar to observed trends. Growth equations that included gap size as an independent variable generally gave better predictions of sapling density, species composition, and growth rates than equations based on conventional plot-level competition metrics. Long-term, 1000-year simulations produced estimates of stand basal areas and tree density in each size class that are close to the mean observed values for old-growth stands in the region. 3acanopy 3aequations 3ahardwood forests 3amodels 3adata collection 3atrees 3aspecies diversity 3aoverstory 3aunderstory 3aprediction 3aUnited States 3aGreat Lakes region 0arecruitment1 aLorimer, Craig G.1 aHalpin, Corey R.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2011 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.903-919dNRC Research Press, National Research Council Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x11-0143Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03156naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245013800172300001600310500001500326520191100341650001902252650002602271650000902297650001802306650000702324650002602331650001902357650001302376650001602389650001002405653001402415700001702429700001802446700001902464700001802483700001602501773006002517852000902577856007802586939003302664946001302697655001202710IND9203228920221117221529.0920519s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920322892DNAL7 a241866602pmid7 a10.1007/BF001962502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToulon, V.10aRole of apoplast acidification by the H+ pump: effect on the sensitivity to pH and CO2 of iron reduction by roots of Brassica napus L  ap. 212-218.  a2019-12-04  aWe have studied the mechanism of the response to iron deficiency in rape (Brassica napus L.), taking into account our previous results: net H+ extrusion maintains a pH shift between the root apoplast and the solution, and the magnitude of the pH shift decreases as the buffering power in the solution increases. The ferric stress increased the ability of roots to reduce Fe[III]EDTA. Buffering the bulk solution (without change in pH) inhibited Fe[III]EDTA reduction. At constant bulk pH, the inhibition (ratio of the Fe[III]EDTA-reduction rates measured in the presence and in the absence of buffer) increased with the rate of H+ extrusion (modulated by the length of a pretreatment in 0.2 mM CaSO4). These results support the hypothesis that the apoplastic pH shift caused by H+ excretion stimulated Fe[III] reduction. The shape of the curves describing the pH-dependency of Fe[III]EDTA reduction in the presence and in the absence of a buffer fitted this hypothesis. When compared to the titration curves of Fe[III]citrate and of Fe[III]EDTA, the curves describing the dependency of the reduction rate of these chelates on pH indicated that the stimulation of Fe[III] reduction by the apoplastic pH shift due to H+ excretion could result from changes in electrostatic interactions between the chelates and the fixed chargers of the cell wall and-or plasmalemma. Blocking H+ excretion by vanadate resulted in complete inhibition of Fe[III] reduction, even in an acidic medium in which there was neither a pH shift nor an inhibitory effect of a buffer. This indicates that the apoplastic pH shift resulting from H+ pumping is not the only mechanism which is involved in the coupling of Fe[III] reduction to H+ transport. Our results shed light on the way by which the strong buffering effect of HCO3(-) in some soils may be involved in iron deficiency encountered by some of the plants which grow in them. 3acarbon dioxide 3anutrient deficiencies 3airon 3aion transport 3apH 3anutrient requirements 3aBrassica napus 3ahydrogen 3aproton pump 3aroots 0areduction1 aSentenac, H.1 aThibaud, J.B.1 aDavidian, J.C.1 aMoulineau, C.1 aGrignon, C.0 tPlanta.g1992, v. 186, no. 2 p.212-218x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001962503Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02938naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245012500174300001600299520196000315650001402275650002802289650001202317650002302329650001202352650001302364700001602377700001402393773006002407852000902467856007802476939003302554946001302587655001202600IND9203228820221117221626.0920519s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920322882DNAL7 a241866592pmid7 a10.1007/BF001962492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreisser, J.10aSolute distribution between vacuole and cytosol of sugarcane suspension cells: Sucrose is not accumulated in the vacuole  ap. 203-211.  aThe compartmentation of solutes in suspension cells of Saccharum sp. during different growth phases in batch culture was determined using CuCl2 to permeabilize the plasma membrane of the cells. The efflux of cytosolic and vacuolar pools of sugars, cations and phosphate was monitored, and the efflux data for phosphate were compared and corrected using data from compartmentation analysis of phosphate as determined by 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results show that sucrose is not accumulated in the vacuoles at any phase of the growth cycle. On the other hand, glucose and fructose are usually accumulated in the vacuole, except at the end of the cell-culture cycle when equal distribution of glucose and fructose between the cytosol and the vacuole is found. Both Na+ and Mg2+ are preferentially located in the vacuoles, but follow the same tendency as glucose and fructose with almost complete location in the vacuole in the early culture phases and increasing cytosolic concentration with increasing age of the cell culture. Potassium ions are always clearly accumulated in the cytosol at a concentration of about 80 mM; only about 20% of the cellular K+ is located inside the vacuole. Cytosolic phosphate is little changed during the cell cycle, whereas the vacuolar phosphate pool changes according to total cellular phosphate. In general there are two different modes of solute compartmentation in sugarcane cells. Some solutes, fructose glucose, Mg2+ and Na+, show high vacuolar compartmentation when the total cellular content of the respective solute is low, whereas in the case of ample supply the cytosolic pools increase. For other solutes, phosphate and K+, the cytosolic concentration tends to be kept constant, and only excess solute is stored in the vacuole and remobilized under starvation conditions. The behaviour of sucrose is somewhat intermediate and it appears to equilibrate easily between cytosol and vacuole. 3aSaccharum 3acell suspension culture 3asucrose 3anutrient transport 3acytosol 3avacuoles1 aSprugel, H.1 aKomor, E.0 tPlanta.g1992, v. 186, no. 2 p.203-211x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001962493Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01134naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010000128300001600228500002400244520023900268650001900507650001900526650001700545650001400562650002200576651002300598700002100621700002300642773008100665852000900746856007700755655001200832IND4461767720221117221640.0110915s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446176772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeif, John W.10aNotice of release of Vintage Germplasm common elderberry: a selected class of natural germplasm  ap. 129-131.  aIncludes references  aA selected germplasm of common elderberry (Sambucus nigra L. ssp. canadensis (L.)

The virus encodes a 135 kDa fusion protein which contains amino acid sequences derived from thviral Gag protein and the two cellular transcription factors c-Myb and c-Ets-1p68. Previously we have shown that like v-myb, v-ets on its own is also active in transformation, but only within the erythroid lineage. To understand better the mechanisms involved in the oncogenic activation of c-Ets-1p68, we used the polyoma PEA3 element, a known Ets binding site, to compare the sequence-specific DNA binding and transactivating properties of v-Ets and c-Ets-1p68. Using Ets protein synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in gel retardation assays, we detected little binding of c-Ets-1p68 to an oligonucleotide containing the PEA3 motif whereas v-Ets bound strongly. However, in transient cotransfection assays in chicken embryo fibroblasts both c-Ets-1p68 and v-ets transactivated transcription from a heterologous promoter linked to PEA3 elements. Interestingly, fragments of c-Ets-1p68 with strong DNA binding activity could be produced by limited proteolysis, indicating that the DNA binding domain is repressed within the full-length molecule. By deletion mapping the DNA binding domain was localized to the most highly conserved region of the Ets-related proteins known as the ETS domain. The C-terminus as well as a region in the middle of the polypeptide chain are involved in repression of DNA binding in c-Ets-1p68. Significantly, v-Ets contains a 16 amino acid substitution at the C-terminus. Our results suggest that intramolecular repression of DNA binding is a regulatory mechanism in c-Ets-1p68 which is lost in v-Ets. 3atranscription factors 3aDNA 3aproto-oncogenes 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviral proteins 3aDNA-binding proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aDNA-binding domains 0agenetic regulation 0aavian acute leukemia virus 226 0apea3 sequence 0ac-ets-1 gene 0av-ets gene 0aavian oncovirus 0aoncogenes1 aKraut, N.1 aFrampton, J.1 aGraf, T.0 tEMBO journal.g1992 Feb., v. 11, no. 2 p.643-652x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02679naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245008700164300001600251500001500267520106600282650002701348650003301375650001101408650001201419650001201431650001601443650001701459650001701476650001401493650002401507650001601531650002001547650001001567650002401577650002001601650002901621650001401650650001701664650002001681650003101701650002401732650001101756650003501767650002401802650002801826650002401854650004101878653001201919653000801931700001501939773007001954852000902024939003302033946001102066655001202077IND9203231220221117221715.0920520e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920323122DNAL7 a15373302pmid7 aPMC5564772pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, G.H.12aA viral gene confers hypovirulence-associated traits to the chestnut blight fungus  ap. 473-477.  a2019-12-04  aA viral double-stranded (ds)RNA associated with reduced virulence (hypovirulence) and the accompanying biological control of the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, was shown recently to contain two contiguous coding domains designated ORF A and ORF B. We report here that transformation of an isogenic virulent, dsRNA-free C. parasitica strain with a cDNA copy of ORF A conferred traits similar to those exhibited by the dsRNA-containing hypovirulent strain: characteristics included reduced pigmentation, reduced laccase accumulation and suppressed conidiation. However virulence was not reduced, indicating an apparent uncoupling of associated traits from hypovirulence. These results establish a direct cause and effect relationship between a viral dsRNA genetic element present in a hypovirulent C. parasitica strain and specific phenotypic traits. They demonstrate further that these traits are not the result of a general reaction of the fungus to the presence of the replicating viral RNA, but are caused by a specific viral coding domain. 3agenetic transformation 3aplant diseases and disorders 3ablight 3alaccase 3aconidia 3asporulation 3apigmentation 3abiosynthesis 3aphenotype 3aopen reading frames 3amycoviruses 3adisease control 3agenes 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aCastanea sativa 3aCryphonectria parasitica 3avirulence 2aGenes, Viral 2aGenetic Vectors 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPlants 2aRNA, Double-Strandedxgenetics 2aRestriction Mapping 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aVirulencexgenetics 2aXylarialesxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 0aviruses 0aRNA1 aNuss, D.L.0 tEMBO journal.g1992 Feb., v. 11, no. 2 p.473-477x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03288naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245011500167300001600282500001500298520133200313650001001645650002301655650001601678650002001694650002001714650002801734650001901762650001001781650001501791650001201806650001201818650001701830650001801847650002001865650001101885650001201896650002301908650002201931650001701953650004501970650003602015650003502051650005602086650002202142650006102164650004502225650002202270653002802292653002502320653001802345653002802363700001402391700001502405700001402420700001802434700001302452700001402465773007002479852000902549939003302558946001102591655001202602IND9203231120221117221754.0920520e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920323112DNAL7 a13714602pmid7 aPMC5564762pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgasawara, T.10aExpression of factor X and its significance for the determination of paramyxovirus tropism in the chick embryo  ap. 467-472.  a2019-12-04  aEnveloped animal viruses usually possess a surface glycoprotein which mediates fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membrane, hence enabling the initiation of infection, and its biosynthesis often involves post-translational endoproteolytic activation of the inactive precursor by a host cell protease(s). Therefore, the protease distribution in the host must be critical for determining the viral tropism. We previously isolated from chick embryo a cogent candidate endoprotease of this kind for paramyxovirus infection, and demonstrated its identity with factor X (FX), a vitamin K-dependent serine protease in the prothrombin family which, in general, is synthesized in the liver and circulates as one of the plasma proteases essential for blood clotting. Here, we examined FX expression with specific cDNA and antibody probes in a series of embryonic tissues. Many tissues other than the liver expressed the specific mRNA but, in most instances, the translation products remained inactive zymogen forms. The enzymatically active FXa was detectable only in the allantoic fluid and amniotic fluid, and virus spreading was strictly confined to the tissues in direct contact with these FXa-containing fluids. Thus, the ectopically expressed FXa is probably the major host determinant of paramyxovirus tropism in ovo. 3aliver 3aserine proteinases 3aproteolysis 3aembryo (animal) 3agene expression 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aviral proteins 3agenes 3aintestines 3astomach 3akidneys 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3aenzyme activity 3achicks 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aBlotting, Western 2aChick Embryo 2aDNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFactor Xxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aNewcastle disease virusxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aOrgan Specificity 2aParainfluenza Virus 1, Humanxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aRNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aVirus Replication 0aexperimental infections 0afusion glycoproteins 0aorganotropism 0aNewcastle disease virus1 aGotoh, B.1 aSuzuki, H.1 aAsaka, J.1 aShimokata, K.1 aRott, R.1 aNagai, Y.0 tEMBO journal.g1992 Feb., v. 11, no. 2 p.467-472x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01665naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001800150245002400168300001600192500001500208520035600223650004500579650001900624650002000643650002300663650001800686650002900704650002300733650002100756650002300777650002000800650002000820650002200840650002700862653001600889653002300905700001500928700001800943700001200961700001700973700001400990700001601004700001701020773006701037852000901104939003301113946001301146655001201159IND9203233620221117221728.0920520e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920323362DNAL7 a15515832pmid7 aPMC12048812pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllis, T.H.N.10aLinkage maps in pea  ap. 649-663.  a2019-12-04  aWe have analyzed segregation patterns of markers among the late generation progeny of several crosses of pea.

In the germline, unregulated expression of Sex-lethal can bypass the requirement for snf+ gene function, implying that snf is required for Sex-lethal activity in the germline. This conclusion is supported by the finding that the Sex-lethal transcription pattern is abnormal in a snf mutant background. In the soma, activation of Sex-lethal appears to be sensitive to snf gene dosage only when the probability of Sex-lethal activation has been otherwise reduced. We also show that the activity of one of the constitutive Sex-lethal alleles (Sxl(m1)) is sensitive to snf gene dosage, demonstrating that, in spite of its constitutive behavior in some assays, Sxl(m1) is still subject to some regulation. In spite of snf's role in the somatic activation of Sex-lethal, no lethal alleles of snf were isolated in a screen of approximately 25,000 chromosomes. The observation that the existing snf mutations present a lethal phenotype only in certain genetic backgrounds suggests that snf is required, but is not essential, for the activation of Sex-lethal in the soma. In contrast, snf does appear to be essential for activation of Sex-lethal in the germline, as evidenced by its female-sterile phenotype. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3atransposons 3aalleles 3asex determination 3asexual development 3agene expression 3achromosome mapping 3agene dosage 3agerm cells 3amutants 3alethal genes 3atranscription (genetics) 3amutation 3aembryo (animal) 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDrosophilaxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenes, Lethal 2aGenes, Regulator 2aGerm Cells 2aMale 2aMutation 2aSex Determination Analysis 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agenetic regulation0 tGenetics.g1992 Mar., v. 130, no. 3 p.547-554x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02468naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001800150245008000168300001600248520113500264650002801399650001601427650001601443650001701459650001601476650001201492650001801504650002101522650002901543650001201572650002301584650003001607650003301637650003801670650001101708650000901719650001401728650002401742653002401766653002501790653001801815700001901833773006701852852000901919939003301928946001301961655001201974IND9203232820221117221903.0920520e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920323282DNAL7 a13129802pmid7 aPMC12048712pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiebert, J.C.10aDosage compensation of the copia retrotransposon in Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 539-545.  aDosage compensation in Drosophila has been studied at the steady state RNA level for several single-copy genes; however, an important point is addressed by analyzing a repetitive, transposable element for dosage compensation. The two issues of gene-specific cis control and genomic position can be studied by determining the extent of dosage compensation of a transposable element at different chromosomal locations. To determine whether the multicopy copia transposable element can dosage compensate, we used the X-linked white-apricot (w(a)) mutation in which a copia element is present. The extent of dosage compensation was determined for the white and copia promoters in larvae and adults in two different genomic locations of the w(a) allele. We conclude that copia is able to dosage compensate, and that the white promoter and the copia promoter are not coordinate in their dosage compensation abilities when assayed under these various conditions. Thus, two transcriptional units, one within the other, both of which are able to dosage compensate, do so differently in response to developmental stage and genomic position. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3atransposons 3agene dosage 3aX chromosome 3asex linkage 3aalleles 3amessenger RNA 3apromoter regions 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDosage Compensation, Genetic 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aFemale 2aMale 2aPhenotype 2aRestriction Mapping 0adosage compensation 0awhite-apricot allele 0awhite alleles1 aBirchler, J.A.0 tGenetics.g1992 Mar., v. 130, no. 3 p.539-545x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02455naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245016000130300001800290500002400308520135100332650002101683650002801704650001601732650001501748650001501763650002701778650001901805650001101824650001901835650002201854700001501876700002001891773009201911852000902003856009302012655001202105IND4461768820221117221758.0110915s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446176882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTahir, Shermeen10aWheat yield and phosphorus fertilizer efficiency as influenced by pre-incubated use of single superphosphate and poultry litter and its time of application  ap. 1034-1040.  aIncludes references  aIn an effort to improve phosphorus (P) fertilizer efficiency on alkaline calcareous soils, the effect of period of pre-incubation of single superphosphate along with poultry litter and its time of application on phosphorous efficiency and yield of wheat was studied in a net house pot experiment. The results showed that application of 3–21 days pre-incubated single super phosphate + poultry litter resulted in higher phosphorous fertilizer efficiency and produced significantly higher dry matter yield of wheat at vegetative stage of growth. At maturity, however, maximum grain yield and highest phosphorous fertilizer efficiency was recorded for seven-days pre-incubation treatment only as compared to the recommended method of single super phosphate alone application at sowing. Application of pre-incubated single super phosphate + poultry litter at first irrigation also produced grain yield equivalent to single super phosphate applied alone at sowing. Under field conditions, top-dressing pre-incubated 22 and 44 kg phosphorous (as single super phosphate) along with 1 ton of poultry litter ha−1 at first irrigation improved phosphorous uptake by 16.4 and 18.7%, phosphorous fertilizer efficiency by 65 and 58% and the grain yield of wheat by 13.4 and 12.5%, respectively as compared to phosphorous alone application at the same time. 3acalcareous soils 3adry matter accumulation 3agrain yield 3airrigation 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apoultry manure 3asowing 3asuperphosphate 3avegetative growth1 aAlam, S.M.1 aAhmad, Zulfiqar0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2011 , v. 34, no. 5-8 p.1034-1040dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03137naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001700150245006700167300001600234500001500250520123700265650001401502650002701516650001201543650001901555650002101574650003001595650002401625650002901649650002201678650002201700650002801722650001601750650001201766650002401778650001201802650001801814650000801832650005401840650002201894650002501916650002801941650003101969650001402000650005302014650002502067650004102092650002502133653001402158653001402172653001602186653002102202653002302223653001802246653001602264653001602280653001502296700001802311773006702329852000902396930003302405946001302438655001202451IND9203233220221117221753.0920520e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920323322DNAL7 a15515792pmid7 aPMC12048752pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWashburn, T.10aNonsense suppression of the major rhodopsin gene of Drosophila  ap. 585-595.  a2019-12-04  aWe placed UAA, UAG and UGA nonsense mutations at two leucine codons, Leu205, and Leu309, in Drosophila's major rhodopsin gene, ninaE, by site-directed mutagenesis, and then created the corresponding mutants by P element-mediated transformation of a ninaE deficiency strain. In the absence of a genetic suppressor, flies harboring any of the nonsense mutations at the 309 site, but not the 205 site, show increased rhodopsin activity. Additionally, all flies with nonsense mutations at either site have better rhabdomere structure than does the ninaE deficiency strain. Construction and analysis of a 3'-deletion mutant of ninaE indicates that translational readthrough accounts for the extra photoreceptor activity of the ninaE309 alleles and that truncated opsins are responsible for the improved rhabdomere structure. The presence of leucine-inserting tRNA nonsense suppressors DtL(a) Su+ and DtL(b) Su+ in the mutant strains produced a small increase (less than 0.04%) in functional rhodopsin. The opal (UGA) suppressor derived from the DtL(a) tRNA gene is more efficient than the amber (UAG) or opal suppressor derived from the DtL(b) gene, and both DtL(a) and DtL(b) derived suppressors are more efficient at site 205 than 309. 3aommatidia 3agenetic transformation 3aalleles 3aphotoreceptors 3astructural genes 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aelectroretinography 3atranscription (genetics) 3anonsense mutation 3aelectrophysiology 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3atransposons 2aAlleles 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA 2aDrosophilaxgeneticsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aElectrophysiology 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPhenotype 2aPhotoreceptor Cellsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aProtein Conformation 2aRhodopsinxgeneticsxultrastructure. 2aSuppression, Genetic 0arhodopsin 0amodifiers 0arhabsomeres 0anonsense alleles 0agenetic regulation 0acompound eyes 0amutagenesis 0atranslation 0aninae gene1 aO'Tousa, J.E.0 tGenetics.g1992 Mar., v. 130, no. 3 p.585-595x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02664naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124072000900142100001800151245008600169300001800255500002400273520131000297650002101607650001201628650001801640650003301658650002201691650002301713650003001736650001101766650002501777650002701802650002001829651001401849700001701863700001901880700001701899700001901916773010901935852000902044856008202053930003302135945002502168946001302193655001202206IND4409763020221117221723.0080904e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440976302DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-92-8-12372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8331 aBreuil, S. de10aOccurrence, Prevalence, and Distribution of Viruses Infecting Peanut in Argentina  ap. 1237-1240.  aIncludes references  aThis is the first survey to determine the occurrence, prevalence, and distribution of peanut (Arachis hypogaea) viral diseases in Argentina. It was conducted in the province of Córdoba, which has 92% of the country's peanut production. It included the main peanut viruses Peanut mottle virus (PeMoV), Peanut stripe virus (PStV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Peanut stunt virus (PSV), Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), and Groundnut ringspot virus (GRSV). Leaf samples from 1,028 individual peanut plants with virus-like symptoms and 986 samples from asymptomatic plants were collected in six counties of Córdoba over 3 years and serologically tested for the presence of viruses. PeMoV was the most frequently detected virus, found in 58.8, 34.2, and 23.4% of samples from the 2003-04, 2004-05, and 2005-06 growing seasons, respectively, and it was found in all sampled counties. Also, it was the only virus detected in asymptomatic plants.

The main carotenoid and tocopherol compounds were studied using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and a fluorescence detector, respectively, whereas polyphenols (including anthocyanins in colored tubers) were identified by means of both HPLC-mass spectrometry and HPLC-DAD. Antioxidant profiling revealed significant genotypic variations as well as cultivars of particular interest from a nutritional point of view. Concentrations of the health-promoting carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, ranged from 1.12 to 17.69 μg g-1 of dry weight (DW) and from 0 to 17.7 μg g-1 of DW, with cultivars 704353 and 702472 showing the highest levels in lutein and zeaxanthin, respectively. Whereas β-carotene is rarely reported in potato tubers, remarkable levels of this dietary provitamin A carotenoid were detected in 16 native varieties, ranging from 0.42 to 2.19 μg g-1 of DW. The amounts of α-tocopherol found in Andean potato tubers, extending from 2.73 to 20.80 μg g-1 of DW, were clearly above the quantities generally reported for commercial varieties. Chlorogenic acid and its isomers dominated the polyphenolic profile of each cultivar. Dark purple-fleshed tubers from the cultivar 704429 contained exceptionally high levels of total anthocyanins (16.33 mg g-1 of DW). The main anthocyanin was identified as petanin (petunidin-3-p-coumaroyl-rutinoside-5-glucoside). The results suggest that Andean potato cultivars should be exploited in screening and breeding programs for the development of potato varieties with enhanced health and nutritional benefits. 3aanthocyanins 3acultivars 3apolyphenols 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aalpha-tocopherol 3azeaxanthin 3abeta-carotene 3apotatoes 3alutein 3afood composition 3achlorogenic acid 3aantioxidants 3aAndes region 0apetanin 0acarotenoids1 aOufir, Mouhssin1 aGuignard, Cédric1 aHoffmann, Lucien1 aHausman, Jean-François1 aEvers, Danièle1 aLarondelle, Yvan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 Dec. 26, v. 55, no. 26 p.10839-10849dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf07265833Available from publisher's Web site  a20081106b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/06  aOther US 7aarticle02567naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100002100155245011400176300002000290500002400310520108900334650004301423650001301466650002601479650001501505650001201520650001401532650002601546650001101572650002301583650001901606650002301625651001001648653002301658700002301681700002101704700001801725700002001743773016501763852000901928856007701937930003302014945002502047946001302072655001202085IND4409776520221117221808.0080905e20071226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440977652DNAL7 a10.1021/jf07186482doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aH0001 aNtow, William J.10aDissipation of Endosulfan in Field-Grown Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and Cropped Soil at Akumadan, Ghana  ap. 10864-10871.  aIncludes references  aThe dissipation and persistence of endosulfan (6,7,8,9,10,10-hexachloro-1,5,5a,6,9,9a-hexahydro-6,9-methano-2,4,3-benzodioxathiepin 3-oxide) applied to field-grown tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) were studied at a vegetable-growing location in Ghana. Plant tissue samples and cropped soil collected at 2 h-14 days and 8 h-112 days, respectively, after application, were analyzed by gas chromatography-electron capture detection (63Ni) to determine the content and dissipation rate of endosulfan isomers (α- and β-endosulfan) and the major metabolite, endosulfan sulfate. After two foliar applications of commercial endosulfan at 500 g of active ingredient/hectare, the first-order reaction kinetic was confirmed to describe the dissipation of endosulfan residues in tomato foliage and cropped soil. However, functions that best fit the experimental data were the biphasic process for foliage and the monophasic process for cropped soil.

The names of the apricot varieties were Alyanak (ALY), Çataloǧlu (CAT), Çöloǧlu (COL), Hacıhaliloǧlu (HAC), Hacıkız (HKI), Hasanbey (HSB), Kabaaşı (KAB), Soǧancı (SOG), and Tokaloǧlu (TOK). The total oil contents of apricot kernels ranged from 40.23 to 53.19%. Oleic acid contributed 70.83% to the total fatty acids, followed by linoleic (21.96%), palmitic (4.92%), and stearic (1.21%) acids. The sn-2 position is mainly occupied with oleic acid (63.54%), linoleic acid (35.0%), and palmitic acid (0.96%). Eight TAG species were identified: LLL, OLL, PLL, OOL + POL, OOO + POO, and SOO (where P, palmitoyl; S, stearoyl; O, oleoyl; and L, linoleoyl), among which mainly OOO + POO contributed to 48.64% of the total, followed by OOL + POL at 32.63% and OLL at 14.33%. Four tocopherol and six phytosterol isomers were identified and quantified; among these, γ-tocopherol (475.11 mg/kg of oil) and β-sitosterol (273.67 mg/100 g of oil) were predominant. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the data from lipid components of apricot kernel oil in order to explore the distribution of the apricot variety according to their kernel's lipid components. PCA separated some varieties including ALY, COL, KAB, CAT, SOG, and HSB in one group and varieties TOK, HAC, and HKI in another group based on their lipid components of apricot kernel oil. So, in the present study, PCA was found to be a powerful tool for classification of the samples. 3aphytosterols 3atocopherols 3alinoleic acid 3afatty acid composition 3aprincipal component analysis 3atriacylglycerols 3aseed oils 3avarieties 3afood composition 3aoleic acid 3aapricots 3aTurkey (country) 0afatty acids 0alipid composition1 aTopcu, Ali1 aKarabulut, Ihsan1 aVural, Halil1 aHayaloglu, Ali Adnan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 Dec. 26, v. 55, no. 26 p.10787-10794dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf071801p3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081106b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/06  aOther US 7aarticle02382naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003000145245012800175300001600303520138500319650001001704653002401714653002101738653001001759653001301769700001601782700001401798773011601812852000901928856008501937930003302022946001302055655001202068IND4418064320221117221921.0090320e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441806432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10764-009-9340-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSunderland-Groves, J. L. 10aNesting Behavior of Gorilla gorilla diehli at Kagwene Mountain, Cameroon: Implications for Assessing Group Size and Density  ap. 253-266.  aWe recorded nesting data at 569 fresh night nest sites, comprising 7032 individual nests, of Cross River gorillas inhabiting the Kagwene Mountain in western Cameroon. The mean night nest group size was 12.4. Overall, 55% of night nests were constructed on the ground and 45% in trees. Significantly more arboreal nests were constructed in the wet season (69%), vs. the dry season (19%). Day nest construction was common at Kagwene (n = 260 nest sites, mean nest group size = 5.98) and we encountered significantly more day nest sites in the wet season. Nest site reuse was also common (35%), though not related to season. Our results of nesting habits concur with those from other western gorilla studies, in which rainfall influences arboreal nesting. However, we encountered wet season arboreal nesting, day nest construction, and overall nest site reuse more frequently than reported for other sites. Our observations have considerable implications when estimating group size and density using traditional nest count data. The gorillas at Kagwene inhabit the highest altitudinal range of all Cross River gorilla subpopulations and rainfall is also high; therefore other subpopulations may demonstrate different nesting characteristics. However, one should consider our findings when attempting to estimate Cross River gorilla density at other localities through nest site data. 3anests 0aCross River gorilla 0aKagwene mountain 0areuse 0aseasonal1 aEkinde, A. 1 aMboh, H. 0 tInternational journal of primatology.g2009 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.253-266dBoston : Springer USx0164-02917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10764-009-9340-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02207naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245008400158300001600242500001500258520076600273650002701039650001601066650000801082650001301090650002501103650001901128650001801147650002401165650001001189650001201199653001101211653001001222653002201232700001501254700001601269700001601285700001601301700001601317700001601333700001601349700001701365700001801382700001601400773013501416852000901551856008501560930003301645946001101678655001201689IND4415164320221117221859.0090120e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441516432DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437090101782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, K. 10aCloning and characterization of SLTI98 encoding ribosomal protein s6 in soybean  ap. 118-125.  a2019-12-04  aWe isolated and characterized a stress-inducible gene designated as SLTI98 encoding ribosomal protein S6 in soybean. The derived amino acid sequence of SLTI98 showed the highest identity of 93% with ribosomal protein S6 from Medicago truncatula (ABD32373). The size of the full-length genomic clone of SLTI98 is 2701 bp containing 6 exons and 5 introns, of which structure is similar to that of Arabidopsis ribosomal protein S6. Genomic southern-blot analysis confirmed that soybean genome has multiple copies of the SLTI98 gene. SLTI98 RNA expression was slightly induced by salt, ABA, or wounding stress, but not by dehydration stress. The present study implies that the nuclear SLTI98 plays an important role in translational control during abiotic stresses. 3atranslation (genetics) 3aArabidopsis 3aRNA 3asoybeans 3aamino acid sequences 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3aMedicago truncatula 3aexons 3aintrons 0astress 0agenes 0aribosomal protein1 aChung, E. 1 aCho, C.

Based on changes in lipid metabolism and deposition that occur in the human brain during postnatal development, we investigated changes in apoD expression in the prefrontal cortex in 69 normal cases ranging in age from 40 days to 49 years utilizing gene microarray, quantitative PCR and western blotting methods. In contrast to the high expression of apolipoprotein E (APOE), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8 (LRP8) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reducatase (HMGCR) (genes that play a role in lipid-related pathways in brain development) early in life, apoD expression was low in neonates and increased in expression throughout life resulting in six- to eight-fold higher levels at the mRNA and protein levels in adults. Recent studies suggest that apoD has a novel antioxidant function in the brain and we found that the increased apoD expression throughout development and into adulthood was correlated with the expression of antioxidant genes superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3) as well as proteins that were modified by the lipid peroxidation end-product 4-hydroxynonenal. These studies reveal that apoD expression is increased throughout life in the human prefrontal cortex and that this is correlated with genetic and biochemical markers of oxidative stress. 3aoxidative stress 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAldehydesxpharmacology 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aApolipoproteins Dxbiosynthesis 2aApolipoproteins Exmetabolism 2aBlotting, Western 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCysteine Proteinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aGene Expressionxphysiology 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aHumans 2aLDL-Receptor Related Proteins 2aMiddle Aged 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aPrefrontal Cortexxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Lipoproteinxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aYoung Adult 0aapolipoprotein-D 0abrain development 0alipid transport1 aWong, Jenny1 aWeickert, Cynthia Shannon1 aWebster, Maree J.1 aBahn, Sabine1 aGarner, Brett0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2009 May, v. 109, no. 4 p.1053-1066dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06031.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090417b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03375naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245010000191300001600291520145000307650001701757650001701774650001701791650001501808650001801823650001101841650001101852650002601863650001901889650001801908650002301926650003001949650001301979650001301992650003002005650001502035650001702050650001202067650002702079650007902106650001402185650002802199650007802227650003302305650002702338650004002365650006402405653002302469700002602492773012202518852000902640856009202649930003302741946001102774655001202785IND4414089220221117221651.0081226e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441408922DNAL7 a190495012pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00619.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyers, Jamie L.10aAdaptation of cyanobacteria to the sulfide-rich microenvironment of black band disease of coral  ap. 242-251.  aBlack band disease (BBD) is a cyanobacteria-dominated microbial mat that migrates across living coral colonies lysing coral tissue and leaving behind exposed coral skeleton. The mat is sulfide-rich due to the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria, integral members of the BBD microbial community, and the sulfide they produce is lethal to corals. The effect of sulfide, normally toxic to cyanobacteria, on the photosynthetic capabilities of five BBD cyanobacterial isolates of the genera Geitlerinema (3), Leptolyngbya (1), and Oscillatoria (1) and six non-BBD cyanobacteria of the genera Leptolyngbya (3), Pseudanabaena (2), and Phormidium (1) was examined. Photosynthetic experiments were performed by measuring the photoincorporation of [¹⁴C] NaHCO₃ under the following conditions: (1) aerobic (no sulfide), (2) anaerobic with 0.5 mM sulfide, and (3) anaerobic with 0.5 mM sulfide and 10 μM 3-(3',4'-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU). All five BBD cyanobacterial isolates tolerated sulfide by conducting sulfide-resistant oxygenic photosynthesis. Five of the non-BBD cyanobacterial isolates did not tolerate sulfide, although one Pseudanabaena isolate continued to photosynthesize in the presence of sulfide at a considerably reduced rate. None of the isolates conducted anoxygenic photosynthesis with sulfide as an electron donor. This is the first report on the physiology of a culture of Oscillatoria sp. found globally in BBD. 3aGeitlerinema 3aLeptolyngbya 3aOscillatoria 3aPhormidium 3aPseudanabaena 3acarbon 3acorals 3amicrobial communities 3aphotosynthesis 3aradionuclides 3asodium bicarbonate 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfides 3atoxicity 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAerobiosis 2aAnaerobiosis 2aAnimals 2aAnthozoaxmicrobiology 2aCyanobacteriaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aEcosystem 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOscillatoriaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effects 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSulfidesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSulfur-Reducing Bacteriaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0ablack band disease1 aRichardson, Laurie L.0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2009 Feb., v. 67, no. 2 p.242-251dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0168-64967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00619.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081226b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02927naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245005800170300001400228520175400242650001501996650001302011650001402024650001302038650001402051650002602065650002602091650004202117650001002159650001702169650001902186650001402205650002602219653002602245773011302271852000902384856009202393930003302485946001102518655001202529IND4415319820221117221820.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441531982DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01442.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDouglas, A.E.14aThe microbial dimension in insect nutritional ecology  ap. 38-47.  a1. Many insects derive nutritional advantage from persistent associations with microorganisms that variously synthesize essential nutrients or digest and detoxify ingested food. These persistent relationships are symbioses. 2. There is strong experimental evidence that symbiotic microorganisms provide plant sap-feeding insects with essential amino acids and contribute to the digestion of cellulose in some wood-feeding insects, including lower termites. Basic nutritional information is, however, lacking for many associations, including the relative roles of microbial and intrinsic sources of cellulose degradation in many insects and B-vitamin provisioning by microorganisms in blood-feeding insects. 3. Some nutritional interactions between insects and their symbiotic microorganisms vary among conspecifics and closely related species. This variation can, in principle, contribute to nutritional explanations for variation in the abundance and distribution of insects. For example, the plant utilization traits of phloem-feeding aphids and stinkbugs have been demonstrated to depend on the identity of microbial partners. Evidence that associations can evolve rapidly comes from the demonstration that the impact of the bacterium Wolbachia on natural populations of its insect host can change from deleterious to beneficial within two decades. 4. Developing genomic tools, especially massively parallel sequencing and metagenomic analyses, offer the opportunity to explore the metabolic capabilities of symbiotic microorganisms and their insect hosts, from which defined hypotheses of nutritional function can be constructed. Nutritional ecology provides the appropriate framework to test these hypotheses in the relevant ecological context. 3aAphidoidea 3aIsoptera 3aWolbachia 3abacteria 3acellulose 3aessential amino acids 3ahematophagous insects 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahosts 3ametagenomics 3amicrosymbionts 3anutrients 3anutrition information 0acellulose degradation0 tFunctional ecology.g2009 Feb., v. 23, no. 1 p.38-47dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01442.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090123b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03832naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245009200175300001600267520215100283650002102434650002402455650001302479650002102492650002402513650002202537650001502559650002302574650002302597650001102620650001802631650001902649650002702668650001402695650001602709650002502725651003002750651001102780651001602791651001802807653002502825653002502850653002502875653001502900653002502915700001702940700002102957700002202978773012103000852000903121856009203130930003303222946001103255655001203266IND4418945320221117221730.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441894532DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00555.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexander, Jake M.10aContrasting patterns of genetic variation and structure in plant invasions of mountains  ap. 502-512.  aTo assess the population genetic consequences of the colonization of two species with contrasting mating systems, Solidago canadensis and Lactuca serriola, along altitudinal gradients in both their native and introduced ranges. Allegheny Mountains, West Virginia and Wallowa Mountains, Oregon, USA; Valais, southern Switzerland. Leaf material was collected from populations along altitudinal gradients and genotyped at seven microsatellite loci for each species. Differences in variability between native and introduced areas and in relation to altitude were analysed using linear models. Differences in the genetic, geographical and altitudinal structure of populations between areas were analysed by AMOVA, cluster analysis and Mantel tests. Genetic variation within and across populations of S. canadensis was significantly reduced, while populations of L. serriola were significantly more variable, in the introduced area. Genetic diversity decreased significantly with altitude for S. canadensis but not L. serriola. Genetic structure of S. canadensis was similar in both areas, and populations were isolated by geographical but not altitudinal distance. By contrast, population structure of L. serriola was much weaker in the introduced area, and populations were not isolated by distance in either area. Solidago canadensis has experienced a strong genetic bottleneck on introduction to the Valais, but this has not prevented it from colonizing a wide altitudinal range. Variation in neutral markers is therefore not necessarily a good measure for judging the ecological behaviour of a species. By contrast, the greater variability of L. serriola in the introduced area, where it also occurs over a greater altitudinal range, can be explained by increased outcrossing among admixed populations. This suggests that the ecological amplitude of alien species might be enhanced after population admixture in the new range, especially for species with highly structured native populations. However, even genetically depauperate introduced populations can be expected to colonize the same environmental range that they occupy in the native area. 3aLactuca serriola 3aSolidago canadensis 3aaltitude 3acluster analysis 3aecological invasion 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aleaves 3alinear models 3amating systems 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amountains 3aoutcrossing 3apopulation structure 3aAllegheny Mountain region 3aOregon 3aSwitzerland 3aWest Virginia 0aAlien invasive plant 0aaltitudinal gradient 0abiological invasions 0abottleneck 0acomparative approach1 aPoll, Myriam1 aDietz, Hansjörg1 aEdwards, Peter J.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2009 May, v. 15, no. 3 p.502-512dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1366-95167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00555.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090410b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02354naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245010100168300001600269500001500285520137200300650001601672650001101688650002301699650001501722653002001737653002001757773011601777852000901893856009201902930003301994946001302027655001202040IND4414523620221117221802.0090105e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441452362DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2008.00487.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurbill, C.10aWinter activity of Australian tree-roosting bats: influence of temperature and climatic patterns  ap. 285-290.  a2019-12-04  aMany bats hibernate to overcome a critical energy shortage in winter. However, unlike strictly seasonal hibernators, bats sometimes alternate prolonged torpor bouts with increased activity coinciding with periods of mild weather. Winter activity may be especially common in hibernating tree-roosting bats because they are less insulated from external conditions than cave-roosting species and must also leave their roosts to drink, socialize or mate. To test this hypothesis, I measured the activity of a community of tree-roosting bats by recording echolocation calls at four sites on 18 nights throughout winter in south-eastern Australia. I also measured insect activity using light traps at each site. I recorded some bat activity on most nights, typically at dusk. Greater bat and insect activity occurred on nights of warmer temperatures, moderate wind speeds and falling barometric pressure, indicating the approach of low-pressure cold fronts. Thus, winter activity of tree-roosting bats is linked to short-term mild conditions caused by a specific, reoccurring weather pattern. Climatic shifts that reduce the frequency of such weather events, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation phenomenon and future human-induced climate change, may also reduce winter activity and/or increase the cost of necessary arousal periods by hibernating tree-roosting bats. 3ahibernation 3awinter 3aenergy expenditure 3aChiroptera 0aresting periods 0aMicrochiroptera0 tJournal of zoology.g2008 Nov., v. 276, no. 3 p.285-290dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2008.00487.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090106b20090206c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03621naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245019800170300001600368520213700384650002502521650002002546650001902566650001802585650003002603650001902633650001402652650001402666650001202680650002302692650001502715650001302730650001002743650001202753650002002765650001402785650001202799653003402811653001402845700001602859773013102875852000903006856009203015930003303107946001103140655001203151IND4411161320221117221622.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441116132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1461-9563.2008.00379.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirling, R.D.10aBehavioural responses of the seven-spot ladybird Coccinella septempunctata to plant headspace chemicals collected from four crop Brassicas and Arabidopsis thaliana, infested with Myzus persicae  ap. 297-306.  a1 Insects using olfactory stimuli to forage for prey/hosts are proposed to encounter a 'reliability-detectability problem', where the usability of a stimulus depends on its reliability as an indicator of herbivore presence and its detectability. 2 We investigated this theory using the responses of female seven-spot ladybirds Coccinella septempunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) to plant headspace chemicals collected from the peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae and four commercially available Brassica cultivars; Brassica rapa L. cultivar 'turnip purple top', Brassica juncea L. cultivar 'red giant mustard', Brassica napus L. cultivar 'Apex', Brassica napus L. cultivar 'Courage' and Arabidopsis thaliana. For each cultivar/species, responses to plants that were undamaged, previously infested by M. persicae and infested with M. persicae, were investigated using dual-choice Petri dish bioassays and circular arenas. 3 There was no evidence that ladybirds responded to headspace chemicals from aphids alone. Ladybirds significantly preferred headspace chemicals from B. napus cv. Apex that were undamaged compared with those from plants infested with aphids. For the other four species/cultivars, there was a consistent trend of the predators being recorded more often in the half of the Petri dish containing plant headspace chemicals from previously damaged and infested plants compared with those from undamaged ones. Furthermore, the mean distance ladybirds walked to reach aphid-infested A. thaliana was significantly shorter than to reach undamaged plants. These results suggest that aphid-induced plant chemicals could act as an arrestment or possibly an attractant stimulus to C. septempunctata. However, it is also possible that C. septempunctata could have been responding to aphid products, such as honeydew, transferred to the previously damaged and infested plants. 4 The results provide evidence to support the 'reliability-detectability' theory and suggest that the effectiveness of C. septempunctata as a natural enemy of aphids may be strongly affected by which species and cultivar of Brassica are being grown. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBrassica juncea 3aBrassica napus 3aBrassica rapa 3aCoccinella septempunctata 3aMyzus persicae 3abioassays 3acultivars 3afemales 3aheadspace analysis 3aherbivores 3ahoneydew 3ahosts 3ainsects 3anatural enemies 3apredators 3aturnips 0aarrestment/attractant stimuli 0avolatiles1 aHassall, M.0 tAgricultural and forest entomology.g2008 Nov., v. 10, no. 4 p.297-306dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-95557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-9563.2008.00379.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081010b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03291naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245012200195300001400317520113100331650002501462650003701487650002701524650002601551650001301577650002001590650000901610650001701619650001001636650001101646650003001657650001401687650001301701650001901714650000901733650001701742650001201759650001601771650002501787650002001812650003201832650002501864650003001889650006601919650001101985650002901996650004302025650003702068650003002105650002302135650003802158653002802196653002902224700002302253700002102276700002102297700002102318773012102339852000902460856009202469930003302561946001102594655001202605IND4416862120221117221559.0090228e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441686212DNAL7 a192364832pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01512.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuglielmetti, Elena10aTransfer of plasmid-mediated resistance to tetracycline in pathogenic bacteria from fish and aquaculture environments  ap. 28-34.  aThe transferability of a large plasmid that harbors a tetracycline resistance gene tet(S), to fish and human pathogens was assessed using electrotransformation and conjugation. The plasmid, originally isolated from fish intestinal Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis KYA-7, has potent antagonistic activity against the selected recipients (Lactococcus garvieae and Listeria monocytogenes), preventing conjugation. Therefore the tetracycline resistance determinant was transferred via electroporation to L. garvieae. A transformant clone was used as the donor in conjugation experiments with three different L. monocytogenes strains. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the transfer of an antibiotic resistance plasmid from fish-associated lactic bacteria to L. monocytogenes, even if the donor L. garvieae was not the original host of the tetracycline resistance but experimentally created by electroporation. These results demonstrate that the antibiotic resistance genes in the fish intestinal bacteria have the potential to spread both to fish and human pathogens, posing a risk to aquaculture and consumer safety. 3aLactococcus garvieae 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3aelectroporation 3afish 3afish culture 3agenes 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3apathogens 3aplasmids 3aproduct safety 3arisk 3atetracycline 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aConjugation, Genetic 2aElectroporation 2aFish Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aFishesxmicrobiology 2aGene Transfer, Horizontal 2aGram-Positive Bacterial Infectionsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aHumans 2aIntestinesxmicrobiology 2aLactococcusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aListeria monocytogenesxgenetics 2aListeriosisxmicrobiology 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aTetracycline Resistancexgenetics 0atetracycline resistance 0ahorizontal gene transfer1 aKorhonen, Jenni M.1 aHeikkinen, Jouni1 aMorelli, Lorenzo1 avon Wright, Atte0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2009 Apr., v. 293, no. 1 p.28-34dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01512.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090228b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02683naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245009300170300001800263500002800281520162700309650001301936653002401949653002901973653001102002700001502013700001402028700001602042700001702058700001902075700002002094773010702114852000902221856009202230946001102322655001202333IND4412731020221117221608.0081121s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441273102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2008.01742.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgostinis, F.14aThe safety of sublingual immunotherapy with one or multiple pollen allergens in children  ap. 1637-1639.  aPublisher supplied data  aSince the majority of allergic patients are polysensitized, it is often necessary to prescribe immunotherapy with multiple allergens. It is crucial to know if the administration of multiple allergens with sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) increases the risk of side-effects in children. Consecutive children with respiratory allergy because of pollens, receiving SLIT for multiple or single allergens were followed-up in a postmarketing survey. Inclusion criteria were those for prescribing SLIT according to guidelines. Parents recorded in a diary card the side-effects (eye symptoms, rhinitis/ear itching, asthma, oral itching/swelling, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, urticaria, angioedema and anaphylaxis). The side-effects were graded as mild, moderate and severe. Four hundred and thirty-three children (285 male, age range 3-18 years) receiving SLIT were surveyed. Of them, 179 received a single extract, and 254 multiple allergens. The total number of doses given was 40 169 (17 143 with single allergen). Overall, 178 episodes were reported. Of them, 76 occurred with the single allergen (42.46% patients, 4.43/1000 doses) and 102 (40.3% patients, 4.42/1000 doses) with multiple allergens (P = NS). 165 episodes (92.5%) were mild and self-resolving and were equally distributed in the two groups. In 13 cases, the events were judged of moderate severity and medical advice was required. Three patients discontinued SLIT, despite the local side-effects being mild. No emergency treatment was required at all. The use of multiple allergens for SLIT does not increase the rate of side-effects in children. 3achildren 0amultiple alllergens 0asublingual immunotherapy 0asafety1 aFoglia, C.1 aLandi, M.1 aCottini, M.1 aLombardi, C.1 aCanonica, G.W.1 aPassalacqua, G.0 tAllergy.g2008 Dec., v. 63, no. 12 p.1637-1639dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2008.01742.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03474naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001900158245007800177300001600255500002400271520157000295650001401865650002301879650000901902650002001911650001601931650001101947650006701958650001202025650002602037650002802063650003502091650002502126650003002151650002402181650000902205650004602214650003002260650000902290650002502299650005202324650003602376650003202412650002802444650002302472650004702495700002602542700002302568700002002591700003002611700002902641700002302670773009102693852000902784856007902793655001202872IND4440659320221117221448.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444065932DNAL7 a205017912pmid7 a10.1530/REP-10-01042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLizama, Carlos10aTACE/ADAM17 is involved in germ cell apoptosis during rat spermatogenesis  ap. 305-317.  aIncludes references  aThe pathways leading to male germ cell apoptosis in vivo are poorly understood, but are highly relevant for the comprehension of sperm production regulation by the testis. In this work, we show the evidence of a mechanism where germ cell apoptosis is induced through the inactivation and shedding of the extracellular domain of KIT (c-kit) by the protease TACE/a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) during the first wave of spermatogenesis in the rat. We show that germ cells undergoing apoptosis lacked the extracellular domain of the KIT receptor. TACE/ADAM17, a membrane-bound metalloprotease, was highly expressed in germ cells undergoing apoptosis as well. On the contrary, cell surface presence of ADAM10, a closely related metalloprotease isoform, was not associated with apoptotic germ cells. Pharmacological inhibition of TACE/ADAM17, but not ADAM10, significantly prevented germ cell apoptosis in the male pubertal rat. Induction of TACE/ADAM17 by the phorbol-ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced germ cell apoptosis, which was prevented when an inhibitor of TACE/ADAM17 was present in the assay. Ex-vivo rat testis culture showed that PMA induced the cleavage of the KIT extracellular domain. Isolation of apoptotic germ cells showed that even though protein levels of TACE/ADAM17 were higher in apoptotic germ cells than in nonapoptotic cells, the contrary was observed for ADAM10. These results suggest that TACE/ADAM17 is one of the elements triggering physiological germ cell apoptosis during the first wave of spermatogenesis. 3aapoptosis 3ametalloproteinases 3arats 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 2aADAM Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxphysiology 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aHydroxamic Acidsxpharmacology 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIn Situ Nick-End Labeling 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMale 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-kitxphysiology 2aRNAxchemistryxgenetics. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aSpermatogenesisxphysiology 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology 2aTestisxphysiology 2aTetradecanoylphorbol Acetatexpharmacology1 aRojas-Benítez, Diego1 aAntonelli, Marcelo1 aLudwig, Andreas1 aBustamante-Marín, Ximena1 aBrouwer-Visser, Jurriaan1 aMoreno, Ricardo D.0 tReproduction.g2010 Aug., v. 140, no. 2 p.305-317dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/REP-10-01043Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02829naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002000178245009100198300001800289500002400307506007600331520092700407506003701334650005301371650001101424650001801435650002001453650002801473650001301501650001201514650001801526650001501544650002301559650003601582650001501618650000901633650001001642650003001652650002801682650001101710650003701721650001101758650000901769650005401778650001601832650001601848651001801864651001801882700002201900700002001922700002201942700002401964700002501988773010402013852000902117856007702126655001202203IND4440649620221207114400.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444064962DNAL7 a205048952pmid7 aPMC29090782pmcid7 a10.2337/dc10-01902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOng, Kwok Leung10aUsing Glycosylated Hemoglobin to Define the Metabolic Syndrome in United States Adults  ap. 1856-1858.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To compare the use of GHb and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) to define the metabolic syndrome (MetS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2006 were used. MetS was defined using the consensus criteria in 2009. Raised blood glucose was defined as either FPG ≥100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) or GHb ≥5.7%. RESULTS: In 2003-2006, there was 91.3% agreement between GHb and FPG when either was used to define MetS. The agreement was good irrespective of age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, and diabetes status (≥87.4%). Similar results were found in 1999-2002. Among subjects without diabetes, only the use of GHb alone, but not FPG, resulted in significant association with cardiovascular diseases (odds ratio 1.45, P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Using GHb instead of FPG to define MetS is feasible. It also identifies individuals with increased cardiovascular risk.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3ablood glucose 3abody mass index 3acardiovascular diseases 3adiabetes 3afasting 3aglycosylation 3ahemoglobin 3ametabolic syndrome 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aodds ratio 3arisk 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexbloodxdiagnosisxmetabolism. 2aMiddle Aged 2aYoung Adult 3aUnited States 0aUnited States1 aTso, Annette W.K.1 aLam, Karen S.L.1 aCherny, Stacey S.1 aSham, Pakq(Pak C.)1 aCheung, Bernard M.Y.0 tDiabetes care.g2010 Aug., v. 33, no. 8 p.1856-1858dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc10-01903Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03112naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100001900178245018000197300001800377500002400395506007600419520111500495506003701610650002001647650002801667650001201695650001201707650001601719650002101735650002301756650000801779650004301787650001701830650002401847650001001871650001001881650003001891650002001921650002801941650005901969650001902028650001102047650001102058650000902069650001602078650001502094650001702109650003602126700001902162700002502181700001902206700001802225700002102243700002002264773010402284852000902388856007702397655001202474IND4440649420221207100925.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444064942DNAL7 a204841312pmid7 aPMC29090762pmcid7 a10.2337/dc10-03682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGautier, Alain10aIncreases in Waist Circumference and Weight As Predictors of Type 2 Diabetes in Individuals With Impaired Fasting Glucose: Influence of Baseline BMI: Data from the DESIR study  ap. 1850-1852.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate in impaired fasting glucose (IFG) the relative importance of increases in waist circumference and weight on progression to type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The 9-year incidence of diabetes was studied in 979 men and women with baseline IFG, from the Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (DESIR) cohort. RESULTS: Increases in both waist circumference and weight were significantly associated with diabetes incidence. Standardized odds ratios (95% CI) were 1.79 (1.45-2.21) and 1.86 (1.51-2.30), respectively, after controlling for baseline risk factors. The impact of waist circumference increase was greater for BMI <25 kg/m² (2.40 [1.63-3.52]) than for BMI ≥25 kg/m² (1.66 [1.28-2.16]) and persisted after adjusting for concurrent changes in either insulinemia or the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index. Weight change had a similar impact in both BMI groups. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with IFG, it is important to monitor and prevent increases in waist circumference, in particular for those with BMI <25 kg/m².0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3aepidemiological studies 3afasting 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ainsulin resistance 3amen 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3arisk factors 3awaist circumference 3awomen 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aFastingxblood 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOdds Ratio 2aRisk Factors 2aWaist Circumferencexphysiology1 aRoussel, Ronan1 aDucluzeau, Pierre H.1 aLange, Céline1 aVol, Sylviane1 aBalkau, Beverley1 aBonnet, Fabrice0 tDiabetes care.g2010 Aug., v. 33, no. 8 p.1850-1852dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc10-03683Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01318naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245010800131300001600239500002300255520045400278650003200732650001100764650001700775651001100792653001600803653001100819700001300830773010000843852000900943939003300952945000800985946001100993655001201004991624797260742620221117221550.0820929e198207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE829215422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez, R.E.10aEnergy and non-energy input substitution possibilities and output scale effects in Canadian agriculture  ap. 115-132.  aSummary in French.  aExtract: A generalized Leontief cost function was used to investigate energy and non-energy input substitution possibilities and output scale effects on factor demand in Canadian agriculture.

This is an ancient occupation practiced for centuries in Turkey. Our objective was to investigate the prevalence of parenchymal lung diseases among coppersmiths in Kahramanmaras city in Turkey. Thirty coppersmiths were included to the study, and they all signed an informed consent. Demographics, spirometric test results and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans, and blood samples were obtained. Laboratory analysis of the serum samples showed that serum copper levels of the subjects were 0.93 ± 0.14 mg/L. Serum copper level in control group was found as 0.70 ± 0.14 mg/L, and it was significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.05). Of 30 coppersmiths, 17 HRCT findings are abnormal and seen with diffuse parenchymal interstitial lung disease pattern—ten (58.8%) respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease, five (29.4%) nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and two (11.8%) usual interstitial pneumonia. The most prevalent HRCT pattern was micronodular pattern in workers. This is the first field study reporting the radiologic findings of coppersmiths and effect of the occupation on lung diseases. 3ablood serum 3acomputed tomography 3acopper 3ademographic statistics 3apneumonia 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCopperxbloodxtoxicity. 2aHumans 2aLungxradiography. 2aLung Diseases, Interstitialxepidemiologyxradiography. 2aMiddle Aged 2aOccupational Diseasesxepidemiologyxradiography. 2aOccupational Exposurexadverse effects 2aTomography, X-Ray Computed 0aTurkeyxepidemiology.1 aTanrikulu, Abdullah Cetin1 aKoksal, Nurhan1 aAbakay, Abdurrahman1 aGelen, Mehmet Emin1 aDemirpolat, Gulen1 aYuksel, Murvet1 aAtilla, Nurhan1 aTolun, Fatma Inanc0 tBiological trace element research.g2010 Oct., v. 137, no. 1 p.63-68dHumana Press Incx0163-49847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-009-8566-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02930naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245012400171300001600295500002400311520158500335650001701920650001101937650001501948650001801963650001201981650001401993650002102007650001502028650001402043650001102057650001102068650002502079650001702104651001002121653001602131653002302147653002002170653002002190653001502210700002602225700002202251773009302273852000902366856008502375655001202460IND4441023720221117221758.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444102372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10453-010-9161-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCristofori, Antonella10aTwenty years of aerobiological monitoring in Trentino (Italy): assessment and evaluation of airborne pollen variability  ap. 253-261.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of the study is to report a reliable airborne pollen spectrum composition and seasonal timings for the monitored area as a basis for allergy management and to ascertain possible modifications through the detection of trends during the 20-year time series (1989-2008). Pollen was collected at San Michele all'Adige (Trento, Italy) by means of a Hirst-type spore trap. Sampling and counting of airborne pollen grains were carried out according to a national standard. Pollen concentration data for the period were processed in order to characterize the main pollen seasons for a subset of taxa, selected on the basis of their allergenicity and local representativeness. Variations in the pollen data over the years surveyed were analyzed using non-parametric tests. The results showed the presence of 63 pollen taxa, 40 of which belonged to tree and shrub species and 23 to herbaceous species. The local pollen spectrum was characterized by the presence of highly allergenic taxa, such as Urticaceae, Graminaceae, Ostrya sp., and Cupressaceae, in terms of percentage contribution as well as mean daily pollen count or peak values over the years surveyed. A significant upward trend was observed for daily mean pollen amount, mainly due to pollen from woody species and probably ascribable to a temperature-driven increase in pollen production. Evaluation of the results presented will form the basis of further research focussed on the climate change-related causes of modifications to vegetational dynamics as well as on the phenology of flowering and on pollen production. 3aCupressaceae 3aOstrya 3aUrticaceae 3aallergenicity 3aclimate 3aflowering 3ahypersensitivity 3amonitoring 3aphenology 3apollen 3ashrubs 3atime series analysis 3awoody plants 3aItaly 0aAerobiology 0aMain pollen season 0aPollen calendar 0aPollen spectrum 0aTime-trend1 aCristofolini, Fabiana1 aGottardini, Elena0 tAerobiologia.g2010 Sept., v. 26, no. 3 p.253-261dSpringer Netherlandsx0393-59657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10453-010-9161-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02788naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245009200178300001400270500002400284520114800308650001901456650001301475650001601488650001501504650001101519650003101530650001201561650001601573650001201589650004201601650001501643650002001658650003301678650003701711650002801748650002101776650004201797650003901839650000901878650002501887650003901912700001701951700001101968700001201979700001801991700001202009700001102021773010802032852000902140856008502149655001202234IND4441004720221117221739.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444100472DNAL7 a199570512pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-009-8565-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei10aCorticosterone Induces Dysregulation of Iron Metabolism in Hippocampal Neurons In Vitro  ap. 88-95.  aIncludes references  aIron is required for neuronal function but in excess generates neurodegeneration. Although the iron homeostasis machinery in neurons has been described extensively, little is known about the influence of corticosterone on the iron homeostasis in neurons. In this study, we characterized the response of hippocampal neurons to a model of progressive corticosterone condition. We found that increasing extracellular corticosterone-induced iron accumulation killed a large proportion of neurons. Iron concentrations were significantly increased in the corticosterone-treated cells. In the hippocampal neurons, corticosterone decreased expression of ferritin and increased expression of transferrin receptor1 (TfR1), iron regulatory protein1 (IRP1), and divalent metal transporter 1. Corticosterone-induced elevation of IRP1 expression can cause increase of TfR1 and decrease of ferritin expression, which further leads to iron accumulation in hippocampal neurons and subsequently increases the oxidative damage of the neurons; it is indicated that corticosterone might be an important reason for iron deposition-caused neurodegenerative diseases. 3acorticosterone 3aferritin 3ahomeostasis 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3atransferrin 2aAnimals 2aCation Transport Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCell Death 2aCells, Cultured 2aCorticosteronexpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHippocampusxmetabolism 2aIronxmetabolism 2aIron Regulatory Protein 1xmetabolism 2aNeuronsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReceptors, Transferrinxmetabolism1 aWang, HuanYu1 aLi, Li1 aLi, Wei1 aDong, XiaoMan1 aLi, Min1 aLv, Li0 tBiological trace element research.g2010 Oct., v. 137, no. 1 p.88-95dHumana Press Incx0163-49847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-009-8565-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03410naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001500135245012800150300001600278500002400294500001500318520174500333650001402078650002202092650001202114650001502126650002502141650001502166650003302181650002002214650001902234650003102253650001402284650001202298650001902310650001602329650001102345650004202356650002202398650001402420650002802434650001002462653001002472700002102482700002202503700002302525700001902548700002202567700002002589700001902609700002102628773009902649852000902748856007502757655001202832IND4440922220221117221744.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444092222DNAL7 a10.1071/AP090842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Anar10aGene expression profiling of the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium lolii in association with its host plant perennial ryegrass  ap. 467-476.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aEndophytes of the Neotyphodium/Epichloë complex are filamentous fungi that typically form mutualistic associations with temperate grasses. The endophytes systemically colonise the intercellular spaces of their grass hosts and confer several biotic and abiotic attributes, but can also cause mammalian toxicoses. These symbioses are therefore of significant agricultural importance, and furthermore, the symbioses represent models to understand how such symbioses are established and maintained. To gain a greater understanding of the Neotyphodium lolii-perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) symbiosis, we have generated, sequenced and analysed four in planta expressed sequence tag libraries, enriched for genes differentially expressed during symbiosis via suppression subtractive hybridisation. Subtracted libraries were largely comprised of perennial ryegrass sequences, and comparative functional profiling of endophyte-infected ryegrass libraries with endophyte-free ryegrass libraries revealed downregulation of carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis during symbiosis, the latter confirming observations made in previous studies. Functional categories upregulated in the plant host in association with endophyte infection included cellular protein transport and protein synthesis and turnover. We also identified 24 N. lolii transcripts expressed during symbiosis, some of which were homologous to demonstrated pathogenicity/virulence genes, and others with proven roles in endophyte secondary metabolism. This study offers insights into biological processes underlying the N. lolii-perennial ryegrass symbiosis, and provides a list of novel candidate genes from both symbionts, which will form the basis for future investigations. 3asymbionts 3aprotein transport 3amammals 3aendophytes 3aintercellular spaces 3aperennials 3aEpichloe festucae var. lolii 3agene expression 3aphotosynthesis 3agene expression regulation 3avirulence 3agrasses 3aLolium perenne 3ahost plants 3amodels 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3aprotein synthesis 3asymbiosis 3aexpressed sequence tags 3afungi 0agenes1 aBassett, Shalome1 aVoisey, Christine1 aGaborit, Charlotte1 aJohnson, Linda1 aChristensen, Mike1 aMcCulloch, Alan1 aBryan, Gregory1 aJohnson, Richard0 tAustralasian plant pathology.g2010, v. 39, no. 5 p.467-476dCSIRO Publishingx0815-31917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AP090843Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02424naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092024002200117024001900139040001800158100002100176245009500197300001600292500002400308500002300332506007600355520108000431506003701511650002901548650001401577650001001591650001301601650003101614650003001645650001101675700002201686700001901708700001901727700002001746773016401766852000901930856007501939655001202014IND4440815820221207124606.0100805s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444081582DNAL7 a10.1139/W10-0272doi7 aPMC28884982pmcid7 a205554032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Wayne A.14aThe subcellular localization of yeast glycogen synthase is dependent upon glycogen content  ap. 408-420.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, accumulates the storage polysaccharide glycogen in response to nutrient limitation. Glycogen synthase, the major form of which is encoded by the GSY2 gene, catalyzes the key regulated step in glycogen storage. Here, we utilized Gsy2p fusions to green fluorescent protein (GFP) to determine where glycogen synthase was located within cells. We demonstrated that the localization pattern of Gsy2-GFP depended upon the glycogen content of the cell. When glycogen was abundant, Gsy2-GFP was found uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, but under low glycogen conditions, Gsy2-GFP localized to discrete spots within cells. Gsy2p is known to bind to glycogen, and we propose that the subcellular distribution of Gsy2-GFP reflects the distribution of glycogen particles. In the absence of glycogen, Gsy2p translocates into the nucleus. We hypothesize that Gsy2p is normally retained in the cytoplasm through its interaction with glycogen particles. When glycogen levels are reduced, Gsy2p loses this anchor and can traffic into the nucleus.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acytoplasm 3agenes 3aglycogen 3aglycogen (starch) synthase 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ayeasts1 aBoyer, Michael P.1 aDavis, Keri D.1 aBurke, Michael1 aRoach, Peter J.0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2010 May, v. 56, no. 5 p.408-420dNRC Research Press, National Research Council of CanadawJournal:jnl44722x0008-41667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/W10-0273Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03296naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245018600172300001600358500002400374520155900398650001701957650001801974650001701992650001502009650001902024650002002043650002302063650001702086650001502103650001302118650002102131650002402152650001102176650002402187650002502211650001002236650001402246650001802260651001202278651001902290653001902309653002402328653003402352653001202386653002802398653001902426700002702445700002202472700002502494773011002519852000902629856009202638655001202730IND4440882720221117221737.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444088272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.00914.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Kelly L.10aComparative analysis of bacterioplankton assemblages from Karenia brevis bloom and nonbloom water on the west Florida shelf (Gulf of Mexico, USA) using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries  ap. 468-485.  aIncludes references  aThe brevetoxin-producing dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis, forms nearly annual blooms off the Florida west coast, severely impacting the region's ecology and economy. Bacteria are often cited as either promoting or interfering with the development of algal blooms, and thus a detailed study of the bacterioplankton assemblages associated with K. brevis was undertaken. We developed sixteen 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from K. brevis bloom and adjacent nonbloom water to determine the bacterial groups present and assess the influence of K. brevis cell number and/or depth on bacterioplankton community composition. Most notably, bacterial groups such as Rhodobacterales (Alphaproteobacteria) and Cytophagales/Sphingobacteriales (Bacteroidetes), reported previously to be associated with other harmful algal species, were often abundant in the presence of K. brevis. Cyanobacteria frequently dominated surface samples containing no detectable K. brevis, consistent with earlier work suggesting that these photosynthetic organisms may be important in promoting the proliferation of these blooms by conditioning the water. Moreover, differences in the abundance/diversity of traditionally more rare and often undocumented phylogenetic groups (e.g. Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Chloroflexus, Firmicutes) were apparent in bloom vs. nonbloom water. This is the first study to document the association of these phylogenetic groups with natural K. brevis populations and suggests a potential role for these microorganisms in K. brevis bloom dynamics. 3aChloroflexus 3aCyanobacteria 3aCytophagales 3aFirmicutes 3aKarenia brevis 3aRhodobacterales 3aSphingobacteriales 3aalgal blooms 3aautotrophs 3abacteria 3abacterioplankton 3abeta-Proteobacteria 3acoasts 3acommunity structure 3adelta-Proteobacteria 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3aFlorida 3aGulf of Mexico 0aKarenia brevis 0aharmful algal bloom 0a16S rRNA gene clone libraries 0aunifrac 0aHAB-associated bacteria 0adinoflagellate1 aMikulski, Christina M.1 aBarnhorst, Amanda1 aDoucette, Gregory J.0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2010 Sept., v. 73, no. 3 p.468-485dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0168-64967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.00914.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02736naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002600135245009700161300001600258500002400274500002300298520126000321650002301581650002101604650001201625650001001637650001201647650001801659650002301677650002401700650002401724650001401748650001301762650001601775650002701791650001801818650003701836700003301873700002801906700003001934700002401964700003001988773016402018852000902182856007502191655001202266IND4440815020221117221516.0100805s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444081502DNAL7 a10.1139/W10-0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Swiany Silveira10aMycovirus in Pseudocercospora griseola, the causal agent of angular leaf spot in common bean  ap. 359-365.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aPseudocercospora griseola (Sacc.) Crous & Braun is a widespread fungal phytopathogen that is responsible for angular leaf spot in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). A number of fungal phytopathogens have been shown to harbour mycoviruses, and this possibility was investigated in populations of Pseudocercospora griseola. The total nucleic acid extracts of 61 fungal isolates were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. Small fragments (800–4800 bp) could be identified in 42 of the samples. The presence of dsRNA in isolate Ig838 was confirmed by treatment of total nucleic acid with DNase, RNase A, and nuclease S1. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of viral-like particles 40 nm in diameter in the mycelia of 2 fungal isolates, namely 29-3 and Ig838. The transmission of dsRNA by means of conidia was 100% for isolate 29-3, but there was loss of 1–6 fragments of dsRNA in monosporic colonies of isolate Ig848. Cycloheximide treatment failed to inhibit the mycovirus in isolate 29-3, but proved efficient in the elimination of the 2.2, 2.0, 1.8, 1.2 and 1.0 kb fragments in 2 colonies of isolate Ig848. The occurrence of a mycovirus in Pseudocercospora griseola was demonstrated for the first time in the present study. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aPseudocercospora 3aagarose 3abeans 3aconidia 3acycloheximide 3adeoxyribonucleases 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agel electrophoresis 3aleaf spot 3amycelium 3amycoviruses 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aribonucleases 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aAbadio, Ana Karina Rodrigues1 aAraújo, Elza Fernandes1 aKitajima, Elliot Watanabe1 aSartorato, Aloísio1 aQueiroz, Marisa Vieira de0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2010 May, v. 56, no. 5 p.359-365dNRC Research Press, National Research Council of CanadawJournal:jnl44722x0008-41667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/W10-0223Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02620naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245010700182300001600289500002400305520085200329650001501181650001601196650001601212650001701228650000901245650002001254650001401274650002201288650002201310650001301332650004001345650004401385650003701429650004101466650002301507650005901530650003101589650003501620650003701655650004001692700001501732700001401747700001501761700001901776700001401795700001101809700001201820700001701832773011101849852000901960856008501969655001202054IND4440676520221117221613.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444067652DNAL7 a198418692pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-009-8549-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Xiaolan10aEffects of Manganese Deficiency on Spectral Characteristics and Oxygen Evolution in Maize Chloroplasts  ap. 372-382.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of Mn²⁺ deficiency on light absorption, transmission, and oxygen evolution of maize chloroplasts were investigated by spectral methods.

Limited data are available regarding the effects of Se-deficiency on toxicokinetics of cadmium, as well as on the levels of key trace elements—copper, zinc, and iron. In the present study, male and female Wistar weanling rats (n = 40/41) were fed either Se-deficient or Se-adequate diet (<0.06 or 0.14 mg Se per kilogram diet, respectively) for 12 weeks, and from week 9 were drinking water containing 0 or 50 mg Cd/l as cadmium chloride. At the end of the 12-week period, trace element concentrations were estimated by AAS. Selenium-deficient rats of both genders showed significantly lower accumulation of cadmium in the liver, compared to Se-adequate rats. Zinc and iron hepatic levels were not affected by Se-deficiency. However, a significant elevation of copper was found in the liver of Se-deficient rats of both genders. Cadmium supplementation increased zinc and decreased iron hepatic level, regardless of Se status and decreased copper concentration in Se-adequate rats. Se-deficiency was also found to influence the effectiveness of cadmium mobilization in male rats. 3acadmium 3acopper 3adiet 3airon 3aliver 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3aselenium 3atoxicity 3aweanlings 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxadministration & dosagexmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aCadmium Chloridexmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSeleniumxadministration & dosagexdeficiencyxmetabolism. 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomic 2aTime Factors 2aTrace Elementsxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aWeaning1 aČerná, Pavla1 aLešetický, Ladislav1 aEybl, Vladislav0 tBiological trace element research.g2010 Sept., v. 136, no. 3 p.287-293dHumana Press Incx0163-49847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-009-8541-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02413naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245009100166300001600257500002400273520102700297650002301324650001601347650001001363650001301373650002201386650002001408650002101428650001501449650001401464650001601478650001401494650002601508650001401534650001701548650001201565700002001577700002201597700002001619700002901639700002101668700002401689700002001713773010001733852000901833856008901842655001201931IND4440494720221117220104.0100727s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444049472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2010.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeemon, Krai10aFasciola gigantica: Histology of the digestive tract and the expression of cathepsin L  ap. 371-379.  aIncludes references  aThe digestive tract of Fasciola gigantica is composed of the oral sucker, buccal tube, pharynx, esophagus, and caecum.

Detailed analyses of bulk water and biomass samples, giving substrate and proportions of ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB) and nitrite oxidising bacteria (NOB) gradients in the HFBR, were carried out using chemical analyses, sensor rate measurements and molecular techniques. Based on these results, proposals for the design of HFBR systems are presented. The HFBR comprised a stack of 60 polystyrene sheets with 10-mm deep frustums. SWW was intermittently dosed at two points, Sheets 1 and 38, in a 2 to 1 volume ratio respectively. Removals of 85.7% COD, 97.4% 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and 61.7% TN were recorded during the study. In the nitrification zones of the HFBR, which were separated by a step-feed zone, little variation in nitrification activity was found, despite decreasing in situ ammonia concentrations. The results further indicate significant simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) activity in the nitrifying zones of the HFBR. Sensor measurements showed a linear increase in potential nitrification rates at temperatures between 7 and 16 °C, and similar rates of nitrification were measured at concentrations between 1 and 20 mg NH4-N/l. These results can be used to optimise HFBR reactor design. The HFBR technology could provide an alternative, low maintenance, economically efficient system for carbon and nitrogen removal for low flow wastewater discharges. 3aammonia 3abacteria 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3acarbon 3achemical analysis 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenitrification 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3apolystyrenes 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBiofilms 2aBiomass 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aBiosensing Techniques 2aCarbonxisolation & purification 2aFormamidesxanalysis 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aNitrogenxisolation & purification 2aOxygenxanalysis 2aParticle Size 2aVolatilization 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxinstrumentation 2aWater Purificationxinstrumentation1 aNielsen, M.1 aSørensen, K.1 aRodgers, M.0 tWater research.g2010 July, v. 44, no. 13 p.3819-3828x0043-13547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2010.04.0423Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02333naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100003500149245009800184300001600282500002400298520096900322650002201291650001101313650001501324650001301339650001701352650001401369650001601383650001201399650001601411650001601427650001201443650000701455650001701462650001001479650001801489700002901507700002901536700003201565700004201597700003801639773010001677852000901777856008901786655001201875IND4440494620221117220111.0100727s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444049462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2010.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Patrícia de Cássia da10aToxoplasma gondii: A morphometric analysis of the wall and epithelial cells of pigs intestine  ap. 380-383.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this study was to perform a morphometric analysis of the different layers of the jejunal wall and epithelial cells of pigs with toxoplasmosis. Experiments were conducted using 10, 88-day-old crossbred (Pietran × Wessex) pigs divided into two groups: control (n = 5) and experimental (n = 5). The experimental group consisted of animals inoculated orally with 5000 sporulated oocysts of a genotype III strain of Toxoplasma gondii. At 30 and 60 days following inoculation, the animals were anaesthetised for jejunal biopsy. The intestinal segments were processed routinely for histology. Transverse cuts (4 μm thick) were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE), Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS), Alcian Blue (AB), pH 2.5, and Alcian Blue (AB), pH 1.0. We observed hypertrophy of the jejunal wall, increased enterocyte height, and a decreased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes in the infected animals. There were no changes in the number of goblet cells. 3aToxoplasma gondii 3abiopsy 3acrossbreds 3agenotype 3agoblet cells 3ahistology 3ahypertrophy 3ajejunum 3alymphocytes 3amorphometry 3aoocysts 3apH 3aparasitology 3aswine 3atoxoplasmosis1 aShiraishi, Celina Sayuri1 aSilva, Aristeu Vieira da1 aGonçalves, Gentil Ferreira1 aSant’Ana, Débora de Mello Goncales1 aAraújo, Eduardo José de Almeida0 tExperimental parasitology.g2010 Aug., v. 125, no. 4 p.380-383dAcademic Pressx0014-48947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2010.03.0043Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02177naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011100163300001600274500002400290520102600314650002601340650001101366650002201377650001601399650000901415653003901424653001501463653002201478653001501500653002301515653002801538700002001566700003001586773009301616852000901709856008501718655001201803IND4440409520221117220138.0100723s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444040952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-009-0626-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonier, Erwan14aThe Madden-Julian oscillation wind-convection coupling and the role of moisture processes in the MM5 model  ap. 435-447.  aIncludes references  aThe Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) produced by a mesoscale model is investigated using standardized statistical diagnostics. Results show that upper- and lower-level zonal winds display the correct MJO structure, phase speed (8 m s⁻¹) and space-time power spectrum. However, the simulated free atmosphere moisture, outgoing longwave radiation and precipitation do not exhibit any clear MJO signal. Yet, the boundary layer moisture, moist static energy and atmospheric instability, measured using a moist static energy instability index, have clear MJO signals. A significant finding is the ability of the model to simulate a realistic MJO phase speed in the winds without reproducing the MJO wind-convection coupling or a realistic propagation in the free atmosphere water vapor. This study suggests that the convergence of boundary layer moisture and the discharge and recharge of the moist static energy and atmospheric instability may be responsible for controlling the speed of propagation of the MJO circulation. 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenergy 3asimulation models 3awater vapor 3awind 0aTropical intraseasonal oscillation 0aSimulation 0aPropagation speed 0aConvection 0aMoisture processes 0aAtmospheric instability1 aWeare, Bryan C.1 aGustafson, William I.

Methods Thirty patients with uT3 rectal carcinoma were examined by FDG-PET/CT at baseline, 14 days after initiation, and after completion of preoperative RCTX. The FDG decreases seen with PET scanning from baseline to day 14 (early metabolic response) and after completion of therapy (late metabolic response) were compared with histopathological tumor response. One patient denied surgery after RCTX. Results The mean (±SD) reduction of tumor FDG uptake in histopathologically responding compared to non-responding tumors was -44.3% (±20.1%) versus -29.6% (±13.1%) (p = 0.085) at day 14 and -66.0% (±20.3%) versus -48.3% (±23.4%) (p = 0.040) after completion of RCTX. Best differentiation of histopathological tumor response was achieved by a cut-off value of 35% reduction of initial FDG uptake at day 14 and 57.5% after completion of therapy. Applying the cut-off values as a criterion for metabolic response, histopathological response was predicted with a sensitivity of 74% (14/19) at day 14 and 79% (15/19) after completion of therapy. The positive predictive value for early metabolic response was 82% (14/17) and for late metabolic response was 83% (15/18). Histopathological evidence of accumulated peritumoral inflammation cells was associated with a minor FDG decrease in five histopathologically responding patients, and influenced the results with negative predictive values of 58% (7/12) and 64% (7/11) at the early and late time points, respectively. Conclusions Metabolic response to a preoperative RCTX using FDG-PET/CT in rectal cancer patients can be correlated with histopathological response, but FDG uptake of peritumoral inflammation cells limited the results and led to false negative results. 3apets 3acolorectal neoplasms 2aEndosonography 2aFemale 2aFluorodeoxyglucose F18xdiagnostic use. 2aHumans 2aMagnetic Resonance Imaging 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPositron-Emission Tomography 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aPreoperative Care 2aROC Curve 2aRectal Neoplasmsxmetabolismxpathologyxradionuclide imagingxtherapy. 2aTomography, X-Ray Computed 0aPreoperative radiochemotherapy 0aResponse1 aHerrmann, Ken 1 aGertler, Ralf 1 aKünzli, Beat 1 aEssler, Markus 1 aLordick, Florian 1 aBecker, Karen 1 aSchuster, Tibor 1 aGeinitz, Hans 1 aMaak, Matthias 1 aSchwaiger, Markus 1 aSiewert, Jörg-Rüdiger 1 aKrause, Bernd 0 tInternational journal of colorectal disease.g2009 Feb., v. 24, no. 2 p.191-200dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0179-19587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00384-008-0616-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01397naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115242008200131245007400213300001200287300001700299520041600316650001500732651001100747653002800758653001400786653001300800653002600813653001600839773015500855852000901010939003301019945000801052946001101060655001201071991624790510742620221117220214.0801010e197911  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aAGC809128362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCameron, G.10aOne hundred questions about cooperation: cooperation and individual interests10aCent questions sur la cooperation: cooperation et interets personnels  ap. 4-5.  ap. 4-5. ill.  aSummary: This article discusses the relationship between private interests and the objectives of the collectivity, a key question during the difficult stages of establishing a cooperative.

  10aSample daily menu plan  ap. 35.  aA menu plan can help maintain weight once a dieter has reached the weight loss goal. Once a weight goal is reached the aim is to stabilize so no more weight is lost. A sample daily menu plan that allows the dieter to add 100 calories a day to a weight maintenance diet is outlined. Variety and restricted foods can be reintroduced. The meal plan contains a morning meal, middaymeal, evening meal, plus snacks at planned times. In addition, a number of foodselections are presented that range from 10 calories per serving to 100 calories per serving. This will eliminate guesswork and let the dieter decide how to use the extra 100 calories.

Specific guidelines for three common special diets are described. In the diabetic diet it is important to eliminate sugar and seriously reduce fat. The sodium free diet requires the elimination of salt from cooking and the avoidance of obviously salty foods. For the bland diet spicy condiments should be avoided.

The coffee bean is actually a cherry pit. Latin America and Africa supply most of the world's coffee. There are two basic special types of coffee: Coffee arabica--the finest, and Coffee sobusta--more neutral in flavor. Coffee may be prepared by the dry method in which cherries are allowed to dry on trees, or the wet method where fully ripened cherries are separated and washed. Roasting time is very important in determining flavor. Coffees are named for the region they are grown in. Suggestions are given on storage, grinds, and amount to use. Three recipes are provided and a picture shows a typical coffee shop scene. 3acoffee (beverage) 0aNon-alcoholic beverages 0abeverages0 tWeight watchers.g1978 Dec., v. 2, no. 11 p.8-54x0043-21807nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19790910c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01445naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245005000137300001400187520064200201650000900843650002400852650001200876653002400888653001900912653002700931653001900958653002000977773007100997852000901068939003301077945000801110946001301118655001201131991624785620742620221117220409.0800703e198004  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800013902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldberg, Jeanne.10aHealthy eating: What our children should know  ap. 32-45.  aAmericans are finally beginning to realize that there is a direct correlation between eating healthful, nutritious foods and being healthy.

Highly effective and sustainable weed control is required in order to meet global food demand. In this context, excessive use of herbicides has resulted in serious environmental and ecological issues. There are several weed control options which neither harm the environment nor require a significant increase in cost of production. Improving crop competition is particularly important and attractive among such options, which can be achieved by using crop cultivars possessing a competitive advantage over weeds, and manipulating the seed rate and direction of crop rows. Crop cultivars possessing traits such as fast germination, quick growth, high biomass, and large leaf area have a competitive advantage over weeds. Sowing such cultivars has been shown to suppress weeds in various crops. The use of high seed rates and narrow row spacing, if properly manipulated, can cause a significant decrease in weed proliferation in the crops. These techniques (cultivar, seed rate, row spacing, and row direction) are under-exploited as weed control methods, and offer considerable potential for achieving environmentally benign weed management. This special issue on “Eco-friendly Weed Management” will address the role of crop competition in managing weeds in different crops as well as in different countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acontrol methods 3acrop production 3acrops 3acultivars 3agermination 3aherbicides 3aleaf area 3aproduction costs 3arow spacing 3asowing 3aweed control 0aWeeds 0aCultivars 0aSeed rate 0aRow-direction 0aWeed control1 aMahajan, Gulshan1 aJabran, Khawar1 aChauhan, Bhagirath S.0 tCrop protection.g2017 May, v. 95 p.1-7dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2016.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01557naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245015100164300001800315520042700333592002800760650002700788650002300815650001200838650001500850650001800865650001300883650001700896650001900913650001300932700001900945700002500964773013400989856007501123852000901198655001201207IND60658661720221119152844.0190826e20100714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065866172DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc00578a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMejía, Michelle L.10aGallium-containing conducting metallopolymers which display chemically tunable reactivity for the growth of Ga₂S₃ semiconducting nanoparticles  ap. 5355-5357.  aElectropolymerization of novel gallium Schiff-base complexes results in conducting metallopolymers containing either coordinatively saturated or unsaturated gallium metal centers.

The biological activities of human C5orf30 are unknown, and neither the gene nor protein show significant homology to any other characterized human sequences. The C5orf30 gene is present only in vertebrate genomes with a high degree of conservation, implying a central function in these organisms. Here, we report that C5orf30 is highly expressed in the synovium of RA patients compared with control synovial tissue, and that it is predominately expressed by synovial fibroblast (RASF) and macrophages in the lining and sublining layer of the tissue. These cells play a central role in the initiation and perpetuation of RA and are implicated in cartilage destruction. RASFs lacking C5orf30 exhibit increased cell migration and invasion in vitro, and gene profiling following C5orf30 inhibition confirmed up-regulation of genes involved in cell migration, adhesion, angiogenesis, and immune and inflammatory pathways. Importantly, loss of C5orf30 contributes to the pathology of inflammatory arthritis in vivo, because inhibition of C5orf30 in the collagen-induced arthritis model markedly accentuated joint inflammation and tissue damage. Our study reveal C5orf30 to be a previously unidentified negative regulator of tissue damage in RA, and this protein may act by modulating the autoaggressive phenotype that is characteristic of RASFs.  aPublisher supplied data 0arheumatoid arthritis 0agenetics 0ainflammation 0atissue damage 0afibroblast1 aHawtree, Sarah1 aWilshaw, Adam1 aLinehan, Eimear1 aRoberts, Hannah1 aKhetan, Sachin1 aAdeleke, Gbadebo1 aWright, Fiona1 aAkil, Mohammed1 aFearon, Ursula1 aVeale, Douglas1 aCiani, Barbara1 aWilson, Anthony G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 112, no. 37 p.11618-11623dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15019471123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245025400167300001400421520117900435592002801614650002201642650001501664650002001679650001401699650001601713650001401729700002101743773009201764856008101856852000901937655001201946IND60440262020221121122707.0151024e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044026202DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-007-0523-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiederich, Paul10aNew lichenicolous, muscicolous, corticolous and lignicolous taxa of Burgoa s. l. and Marchandiomyces s. l.

The new genus Burgella is described for the lichenicolous B. flavoparmeliae, phylogenetically close to Sistotrema oblongisporum and Multiclavula. The genera Pneumatospora and Tricellulortus are placed in synonymy of Minimedusa, the new combination M. obcoronata is proposed, and the new facultative lichenicolous M. pubescens is described. The new facultative lichenicolous Burgoa angulosa is phylogenetically close to the generic type B. verzuoliana, whilst the new B. moriformis and B. splendens are provisionally included in the genus Burgoa. A Burgoa-like species in the Ceratobasidiaceae is left unnamed. Two new species of Marchandiomyces, M. buckii and M. nothofagicola, are described. As Marchandiomyces aurantiacus is phylogenetically more close to Erythricium than to Marchandiomyces, it is proposed to exclude it from that genus and to use the holomorphic generic name Marchandiobasidium for both anamorph and teleomorph of this species. The new genus Marchandiomphalina is introduced for the lichenized Omphalina foliacea, a taxon phylogenetically close to Marchandiobasidium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratobasidiaceae 3aSistotrema 3anew combination 3anew genus 3anew species 3aphylogeny1 aLawrey, James D.0 tMycological progress.g2007 June, v. 6, no. 2 p.61-80dSpringer-Verlagx1617-416X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-007-0523-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009100172300001400263520103300277592002801310650001201338650002201350650001101372650002701383650001601410653000701426653000801433653000801441653000801449653000801457653001901465653002101484653005001505653002001555653002201575653001901597653001601616700002501632773010001657856008701757852000901844655001201853IND60549652220221123044650.0190405e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054965222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoberg, Nikolai10aIrreversibility and uncertainty cause an intergenerational equity-efficiency trade-off  ap. 75-86.  aTwo important policy goals in intergenerational problems are Pareto-efficiency and sustainability, i.e. intergenerational equity. We demonstrate that the pursuit of these goals is subject to an intergenerational equity-efficiency trade-off. Our analysis highlights two salient characteristics of intergenerational problems and policy: (i) temporal irreversibility, i.e. the inability to revise one's past actions; and (ii) uncertainty of future consequences of present actions in human-environment systems. We employ a two-non-overlapping-generations model that combines an intragenerational production decision on the use of circulating capital and a non-renewable resource, with a negative intergenerational externality as an unforeseen contingency. If initially unknown problems become apparent and policy is enacted after irreversible actions were taken, policy-making faces a fundamental trade-off between ex-post Pareto-efficiency and sustainability. That is, one can achieve either one of these two goals, but not both.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3anonrenewable resources 3auncertainty 0aD3 0aH23 0aQ01 0aQ38 0aQ56 0aClimate change 0aClosed ignorance 0aIntergenerational equity-efficiency trade-off 0aIrreversibility 0aPareto-efficiency 0aSustainability 0aUnawareness1 aBaumgärtner, Stefan0 tEcological economics.g2017 Jan., v. 131 p.75-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245010400163300001600267520146000283592002801743650001901771650001901790650002101809650001201830650002101842650001601863651001101879653002801890653002101918653003201939653003001971653002602001700001902027700001502046700001702061700002002078773012502098856007802223852000902301655001202310IND60643981820221123014826.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064398182DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2017-02212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLochhead, Kyle10aMultivariate estimation for accurate and logically consistent forest-attributes maps at macroscales  ap. 345-359.  aSpatially explicit wall-to-wall forest-attributes information is critically important for designing management strategies resilient to climate-induced uncertainties. Multivariate estimation methods that link forest attributes and auxiliary variables at full-information locations can be used to estimate the forest attributes for locations with only auxiliary variables information. However, trade-offs between estimation accuracies versus logical consistency among estimated attributes may occur. This is particularly likely for macroscales (i.e., ≥1 Mha) with large forest-attributes variances and wide spacing between full-information locations. We examined these trade-offs for ∼390 Mha of Canada’s boreal zone using variable-space nearest-neighbours imputation versus two modelling methods (i.e., a system of simultaneous nonlinear models and kriging with external drift). We found logical consistency among estimated forest attributes (i.e., crown closure, average height and age, volume per hectare, species percentages) using (i) k ≤ 2 nearest neighbours or (ii) careful model selection for the modelling methods. Of these logically consistent methods, kriging with external drift was the most accurate, but implementing this for a macroscale is computationally more difficult. This extra cost is justified given the importance of assessing strategies under expected climate changes in Canada’s boreal forest and in other forest regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboreal forests 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3akriging 3anonlinear models 3auncertainty 3aCanada 0amultivariate imputation 0asystem of models 0akriging with external drift 0anational forest inventory 0amultisource inventory1 aLeMay, Valerie1 aBull, Gary1 aSchwab, Olaf1 aHalperin, James0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2018, v. 48, no. 4 p.345-359dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2017-02213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245009800177300001600275520100300291592002801294650002201322650002001344650002301364650003101387650001801418650002301436653003201459653002801491653002301519653002401542653001801566653001401584700002301598773010201621856008701723852000901810655001201819IND60549652320221120225425.0190405e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054965232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, William C.C.10aDrivers of heritage value: A meta-analysis of monetary valuation studies of cultural heritage  ap. 277-284.  aDecisions about cultural and historical heritage conservation can be contentious. Improved insight into the economic benefits derived from preservation could be achieved through a better understanding of the underlying economics. In response to this challenge, a growing number of studies estimate the economic value of heritage sites. The purpose of this study is to identify common drivers of the economic value of cultural and historical heritage by conducting a meta-analysis of heritage valuation studies. We find that heritage sites in areas with higher population density hold higher value, and conservation that supports adaptive re-use of sites generates higher values then passive protection. Valuation studies of tangible heritage dominate our dataset, but our findings are robust across model specifications. We identify a need for more economic and interdisciplinary research on the value of non-built heritage to improve understanding of the composition and drivers of heritage value.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultural heritage 3adata collection 3aeconomic valuation 3ainterdisciplinary research 3ameta-analysis 3apopulation density 0aCultural ecosystem services 0aConservation investment 0aCultural economics 0aHistorical heritage 0aMeta-analysis 0aValuation1 aEppink, Florian V.0 tEcological economics.g2016 Oct., v. 130 p.277-284dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245015500162300001800317520157500335592002801910650001501938650001601953650001401969650002001983650001202003650001402015650001702029650001802046650001902064650001602083650002702099650002602126650000902152653001202161653000902173653001502182653001702197653002102214700001602235700001802251700001902269700001302288700001802301700001602319700001702335700005302352773014802405856008002553852000902633655001202642IND60637706820221119172816.0190424e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063770682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b002322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ding10aZn Supplement-Antagonized Cadmium-Induced Cytotoxicity in Macrophages In Vitro: Involvement of Cadmium Bioaccumulation and Metallothioneins Regulation  ap. 4611-4622.  aCadmium (Cd) is a toxic metal leading to multiple forms of organ damage. Zinc (Zn) was reported as a potential antagonist against Cd toxicity. The present study investigates the antagonistic effect of Zn (20 μM) on Cd (20 or 50 μM) cytotoxicity in macrophages in vitro. The results shows that Cd exposure caused dose-dependent morphologic and ultrastructural alterations in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Zn supplement significantly inhibited Cd cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 or HD-11 macrophages by mitigating cell apoptosis, excessive ROS output, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Notably, Zn supplement for 12 h remarkably prevented intracellular Cd²⁺ accumulation in 20 μM (95.99 ± 9.93 vs 29.64 ± 5.08 ng/10⁶ cells; P = 0.0008) or 50 μM Cd (179.78 ± 28.66 vs 141.62 ± 22.15 ng/10⁶ cells; P = 0.003) exposed RAW 264.7 cells. Further investigation found that Cd promoted metallothioneins (MTs) and metal regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF-1) expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Twenty μM Zn supplement dramatically enhanced MTs and MTF-1 levels in Cd-exposed RAW 264.7 macrophages. Intracellular Zn²⁺ chelation or MTF-1 gene silencing inhibited MTs synthesis in Cd-exposed RAW 264.7 macrophages, which was accompanied by the declined expression of MTF-1, indicating that regulation of Zn on MTs was partially achieved by MTF-1 mobilization. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the antagonism of Zn against Cd cytotoxicity in macrophages and reveals its antagonistic mechanism by preventing Cd²⁺ bioaccumulation and promoting MTs expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonism 3aantagonists 3aapoptosis 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3achelation 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3agene silencing 3amacrophages 3amitochondrial membrane 3atranscription factors 3azinc 0acadmium 0azinc 0amacrophage 0acytotoxicity 0ametallothioneins1 aZhang, Ting1 aLiu, Jingying1 aChen, Jianshan1 aLi, Ying1 aNing, Guanbao1 aHuo, Nairui1 aTian, Wenxia1 aMa, Haili1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8354-49990 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Apr. 03, v. 67, no. 16 p.4611-4622dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b002323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245009400204520160200298592002801900650001101928650001601939650002301955650001701978650001201995650001102007650001202018650002402030650001702054650001702071650002102088651001002109700002402119700002202143700003002165773010302195856008302298852000902381655001202390IND60654434320221118092426.0200128e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065443432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2019.1026682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavez, Iciar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8195-506810aBiosecurity institutions and the choice of contracts in international fruit supply chains  aBiosecurity regulations and standards govern international agricultural inter-firm transactions. Drawing mainly on new institutional economics, our study offers insights into the institutional factors, at both the macro and meso levels, that influence the choice of inter-firm contracts for Chilean apple exports. First and foremost, it examines the influence of the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) provisions included in trade agreements signed by Chile with its trade counterparts on the choice of alternative contracts displaying different degrees of completeness. It also focuses on the institutions in the importing countries, the legal institutions enforcing contracts, the efficiency of logistics and the effect of hidden informal rules such as corruption, on the choice between free consignment, minimum guaranteed and sale contracts. We also explore the private institutions, primarily linked to direct imports by supermarkets. The results of our econometric analysis show that less complete contracts, i.e. free consignment and minimum guaranteed arrangements, are chosen when exporting to countries with safe business environments and higher number of SPS provision in international trade agreements. On the contrary, when exporting to non-reliable countries, exporters tend to protect themselves through more complete contracts, i.e. sale contracts. We found evidence that direct exports to supermarkets are more prone to occur under sale contracts which suggest the dual function of contracts, both as a safeguard and as a coordination tool to adopt specific customers' requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3abiosecurity 3aconsumers (people) 3aeconometrics 3aexports 3afruits 3aimports 3ainternational trade 3asupermarkets 3asupply chain 3atrade agreements 3aChile1 aCodron, Jean Marie,1 aLubello, Pasquale1 aFlorêncio, Maria Cecilia0 tAgricultural systems.g2019 Nov., v. 176 p.102668-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2019.1026683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04524naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245011600199300001600315500002000331520280600351592002803157596004003185650001803225650001503243650001303258650000903271650001803280650002603298650001503324650003503339650001303374650001703387650002203404650001503426650001503441650000903456650001103465650001203476650001403488650001103502650001403513650001703527650002103544650001603565650001503581650002103596650001903617650001503636651001303651700002003664700001803684700002103702773011703723856007303840852000903913655001203922IND60632697020221122150030.0190315e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063269702DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.132482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrause, Kevin P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0255-702710aFish assemblage–environment relationships suggest differential trophic responses to heavy metal contamination  ap. 632-642.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhile ecotoxicology has long recognised the importance of identifying levels at which contaminants pose threats to biota, most estimates of species responses to toxicants are derived from controlled laboratory studies and may hold limited relevance to natural systems. However, designing appropriate field‐based studies investigating contaminant induced changes in assemblages has been challenging, partially due to the difficulty in identifying comparable uncontaminated reference sites. The aim of this study is to characterise the effects of heavy metal contamination on natural fish assemblages using an ecologically relevant catchment‐scale design. We hypothesise that environmental variables, including discharge, sediment, and landscape variables, can be used to characterise differences in fish species richness and abundances between sites contaminated with heavy metals and uncontaminated reference sites. We apply a geographic information systems approach that uses assemblage–environment relationships developed using hydrologic model outputs, land cover, and topographic data from uncontaminated reference sites to predict expected fish species richness and abundance at sites contaminated with heavy‐metals within the Big River catchment in south‐eastern Missouri, U.S.A. These predicted levels of richness and abundance are then compared to observed assemblages at contaminated sites to estimate the potential impacts of historical lead mining activities on freshwater taxa. We developed models that characterised variation in Centrarchidae (bass and sunfish) richness and abundance, Cyprinidae (minnows) abundance, and Percidae (darters) richness using variables including streamflow regime, suspended sediment concentration, and land cover at uncontaminated sites. Using these relationships, we predicted expected fish species richness and abundance at heavy metal contaminated sites across the Big River catchment and found a significant reduction in centrarchid abundance from field‐collected data compared to predicted estimates. Our results suggest that centrarchids, which tend to occupy a higher trophic level than cyprinids and percids, have lower abundances at sites contaminated with heavy metals than predicted by assemblage–environment relationships. These decreases in abundance are not associated with decreases in centrarchid species richness, cyprinid abundance, or percid richness. This geographic information systems‐based approach provides a useful and ecologically relevant framework for understanding the response of taxa to the presence of contaminants without assuming habitat equivalence across sites. Our findings also suggest the need for further research regarding how heavy metals impact fishes of varying trophic levels in natural settings.  aPublisher supplied data  a061716‐01cThe Nature Conservancy 3aCentrarchidae 3aCyprinidae 3aPercidae 3abass 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental factors 3afreshwater 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitats 3aheavy metals 3ahydrologic models 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3alead 3amining 3aminnows 3apollution 3arivers 3asediments 3aspatial data 3aspecies richness 3astream flow 3atopography 3atoxic substances 3atrophic levels 3awatersheds 3aMissouri1 aWu, Chin‐Lung1 aChu, Maria L.1 aKnouft, Jason H.0 tFreshwater biology.g2019 Apr., v. 64, no. 4 p.632-642dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1839x0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.132483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245011000208300002000318520159100338592002801929653001701957653001301974653002801987653002502015653002202040700002202062700001802084700001902102700001102121773019502132856007902327852000902406655001202415IND60517939720221119214033.0160406e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051793972DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15032721122doi7 aPMC45772082pmcid7 a263249042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrauch, Renee C.10aDiscovery of a novel amino acid racemase through exploration of natural variation in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 11726-11731.  aPlants produce diverse low-molecular-weight compounds via specialized metabolism.

This approach allowed us to establish genetic linkages between metabolites and genes. Investigation of one of the metabolite–gene associations led to the identification of N -malonyl- d -allo-isoleucine, and the discovery of a novel amino acid racemase involved in its biosynthesis. This finding provides, to our knowledge, the first functional characterization of a eukaryotic member of a large and widely conserved phenazine biosynthesis protein PhzF-like protein family. Unlike most of known eukaryotic amino acid racemases, the newly discovered enzyme does not require pyridoxal 5′-phosphate for its activity. This study thus identifies a new d -amino acid racemase gene family and advances our knowledge of plant d -amino acid metabolism that is currently largely unexplored. It also demonstrates that exploitation of natural metabolic variation by integrating metabolomics with genome-wide association is a powerful approach for functional genomics study of specialized metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 0ad-amino acid 0aracemase 0agenome-wide association 0asecondary metabolism 0anatural variation1 aSvedin, Elisabeth1 aDilkes, Brian1 aChapple, Clint1 aLi, Xu0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 112, no. 37 p.11726-11731dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15032721123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014000162300001200302520120300314592002801517650002201545650002201567650002201589650002001611650003801631650002701669650001801696650001201714650001101726650001701737650003201754653000901786653000801795653002901803653002301832700001601855700001501871700001201886773009901898856008101997852000902078655001202087IND60599586020221117201755.0180702e20140620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059958602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2014.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yang10aMelting and crystallization behavior of partially miscible high density polyethylene/ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (HDPE/EVA) blends  ap. 1-8.  aCrystallization studies on HDPE/EVA blends and the individual components were performed with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique and wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). Influences of blending on the crystallization kinetics of each component in HDPE/EVA mixture were evaluated by Friedman's activation energy and Khanna's crystallization rate coefficient (CRC). The addition of more HDPE into the EVA matrix causes more heterogeneous nucleation while the addition of EVA would hinder the nucleation of HDPE at the beginning of cooling process. Inter-molecular interaction in the melt facilitated the crystallization of both EVA and HDPE components. X-ray diffraction studies revealed that HDPE and EVA have orthorhombic unit cell. Blending with EVA did not affect the crystalline structure of HDPE. In addition, a little shift of (110), (200) and (020) crystalline peaks toward lower 2θ values of samples indicating a little increase of unit cell parameters of the orthorhombic unit cell of polyethylene. Thermal fractionation results showed that co-crystallization took place in the HDPE/EVA blend. All those results indicated that the polymer pair we choose was partially miscible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivation energy 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aethylene-vinyl acetate 3afractionation 3amelting 3amixing 3apolyethylene 3awide-angle X-ray scattering 0aHDPE 0aEVA 0aCrystallization kinetics 0aPartially miscible1 aZou, Huawei1 aLiang, Mei1 aCao, Ya0 tThermochimica acta.g2014 June 20, v. 586 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2014.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100002300185245010400208300001600312520153400328592002801862596005001890596005301940650002501993650002002018650001702038650001602055650001302071650001202084650001902096650001202115650001102127650001202138650002302150650001802173650001002191650001202201650001402213650001102227650001902238650001102257650001202268650001302280650001602293650001302309651001002322773010802332856008202440852000902522655001202531IND60468975720221119152055.0181114e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046897572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-015-1543-82doi7 a10.1007/s10681-015-1543-82chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChetelat, Roger T.10aOvercoming sterility and unilateral incompatibility of Solanum lycopersicum × S. sitiens hybrids  ap. 319-330.  aThe wild tomato relative Solanum sitiens is a rare endemic plant of the Atacama Desert of Chile. This species exhibits unique traits—tolerance to drought, salinity and low temperatures, resistances to certain pathogens, and modified fruit ripening—that could be of interest to tomato breeders. However, strong reproductive barriers, including hybrid inviability, sterility, and unilateral incompatibility (UI), prevent or impede introgression with cultivated tomato. Using embryo culture, we obtained a large number of F₁ S. lycopersicum × S. sitiens hybrids, and evaluated their fertility and compatibility as male or female parents. Diploid hybrids were functionally male-sterile and strongly rejected pollen of S. lycopersicum by UI. Chromosome doubling produced fertile allotetraploids, from which allotriploids (two genomes of S. lycopersicum, one of S. sitiens) were derived by crossing to diploid tomato. Rejection of tomato pollen occurred lower in styles of allotriploid than diploid hybrids. The pollen compatibility factors ui1.1 and ui6.1 were not sufficient for compatibility on S. sitiens allotriploid hybrids, unlike comparable hybrids with S. lycopersicoides. Pollen from F₁ S. lycopersicum × S. pennellii was used to overcome UI on pistils of diploid S. lycopersicum × S. sitiens hybrids. This cross yielded progeny that were fertile and compatible in direct backcrosses to S. lycopersicum. These results establish a feasible method for transferring the S. sitiens genome into cultivated tomato.  aPublisher supplied data  aMCB 1127059cNational Science Foundation (US)  a2013-67013-21131cU.S. Department of Agriculture 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aSolanum sitiens 3abackcrossing 3achromosomes 3adiploidy 3adrought 3aembryo culture 3afemales 3agenome 3ahybrids 3aindigenous species 3aintrogression 3amales 3aparents 3apathogens 3apistil 3aplant breeding 3apollen 3aprogeny 3asalinity 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3aChile0 tEuphytica.g2016 Jan., v. 207, no. 2 p.319-330dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-015-1543-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012800167520175600295592002802051650001302079650002202092650001802114650002202132650002002154650001202174650001102186650002402197650001002221650002102231650000902252650001502261650001502276650001802291650001002309650001302319651001302332653001802345653001702363653002802380700001902408700001902427773010302446856008302549852000902632655001202641IND60654434420221118092420.0200128e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065443442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2019.1026692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbraham, Hagos10aSimulated alternative breeding schemes for optimizing Begait goat improvement programs in Western Tigray, northern Ethiopia  aIn the absence of well-designed national animal genetic improvement schemes, achieving and monitoring genetic gains is difficult. The objective of the present study was to evaluate three alternative breeding schemes for Begait goat breed in Ethiopia. The breeding schemes were: a) government ranch breeding scheme b) commercial breeding scheme and c) cooperative village breeding scheme. The breeding schemes differed in the number of tiers (two tiers in the case of a and b, one tier in case of scheme c), flock size and selection method. The breeding schemes were compared for annual genetic and economic gains in addition to operational feasibility. Analyses were performed by using ZPLAN computer program, which uses a deterministic approach to estimate genetic and economic gains in breeding programs. The results indicated that the annual genetic and economic gains increased with increased flock size and use of Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) based selection method. The predicted genetic and economic gains were slightly higher under scheme a and b as compared to scheme c. The trait of greater economic impact was six month weight (6 MW) in all schemes. Nevertheless, scheme a seems more operationally feasible when compared to the other schemes. This is as the regional government showed high interest in the maintenance and development of Begait goat, sheep and cattle breeds. Government also planned to export meat by the end of Growth and Transformation Plane III and roadmap has been already developed for these animal breeds. Apparently, these are good opportunities which would make the development and implementation of the breeding program for Begait goat more feasible in the short-term when the public sector is involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3abreeding programs 3acattle breeds 3acomputer software 3aeconomic impact 3aexports 3aflocks 3agenetic improvement 3agoats 3alocal government 3ameat 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3apublic sector 3asheep 3avillages 3aEthiopia 0aEconomic gain 0aGenetic gain 0aOperational feasibility1 aSolomon Gizaw,1 aUrge, Mengistu0 tAgricultural systems.g2019 Nov., v. 176 p.102669-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2019.1026693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007500166300001600241520097500257592002801232650001301260650001301273650002301286650001701309650001801326650003201344650001201376650001301388650001701401700001801418700002001436700001901456773011601475856004801591852000901639655001201648IND50070115220221119144347.0131023e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007011522DNAL7 a10.1007/s12257-013-0173-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoo, Dong Chil10aAldose reductase inhibitory compounds from extracts of Dipsacus asper   ap. 926-931.  aAmethanolic extract of Dipsacus asper, having anti-diabetic activity, was examined as a possible aldose reductase (ALR2) inhibitor, a key enzyme involved in diabetic complications. Bioactivity guided fractionation led to the isolation of ten compounds, ursolic acid (1), oleanolic acid-3-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside (2), daucosterol (3), hederagenin-3-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside (4), sweroside(5), caffeic acid (6), esculetin (7), protocatechualdehyde (8), loganin (9), and vanilic acid (10) from the ethyl acetate fraction of D. asper methanol extract. Among them, compounds 4, 6, 7, and 8 exhibited inhibitory effects on aldose reductase, with IC₅₀ values of 23.70, 16.71, 34.36, and 21.81 μM, respectively. This is the first report on the isolation of these compounds from D. asper, and the ALR2 inhibitory activity of hederagenin-3-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside.

Few QTLs studies for SG have been conducted in temperate maize, apart from some experiments carried out with Chinese lines. The aim of our study was to identify QTLs related to SG in temperate maize using PHG39, an important SG line in private breeding. We developed two large F₂ mapping populations by crossing PHG39 to the no stay-green (NSG) lines B73 (Corn Belt Dent) and EA1070 (European flint). Samples of individuals of the extreme tails (high and low) of the populations for visual score were genotyped. We found an association between markers and SG in three regions at bins 1.04–1.09, 5.02 and 10.04–10.06. The association was strong for some markers in chromosome 1, for example, for bnlg1556 the frequency of the SG allele was 0.75 and 0.34 in the high and the low tail, respectively. Furthermore, for this marker the homozygote’s with the SG allele had 4 times more chlorophyll than the homozygote’s with the NSG allele 2 months after flowering. Some alleles most likely conferred SG because they increased the maximum chlorophyll content at flowering while other alleles did by diminishing the rate of senescence. The SG conferred by some alleles could be functional as some favourable alleles for SG were also favourable for kernel weight. Regardless of the physiological basis of the SG, the significant markers detected could be useful for marker assisted selection.  aPublisher supplied data  a"Au1"cID0EPOAE913  a"Au2"cID0ETPAE914  a"Au5"cID0EXQAE915 3aalleles 3achlorophyll 3achromosomes 3acrossing 3adent corn 3aflowering 3agenotyping 3amarker-assisted selection 3aplant breeding 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseeds1 aRevilla, P.1 aDe La Fuente, M.1 aCaicedo, M.1 aOrdás, B.0 tEuphytica.g2016 Jan., v. 207, no. 2 p.463-473dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-015-1575-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245011400199300002000313520128300333592002801616596009801644596009101742596012301833650001701956650001601973650001501989650001702004650001902021650001302040650003102053653003202084653002502116653001602141653001602157653003002173700001802203700001802221700005702239773014202296856007902438852000902517655001202526IND60782264820221119014042.0220706e20220622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078226482DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c058392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yuseok1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9672-539310aSoft Biomimetic 3D Free-Form Artificial Vascular Graft Using a Highly Uniform Microspherical Porous Structure  ap. 29588-29598.  aThis study presents a biomimetic 3D customizable artificial vascular graft with a highly porous and uniform microscale structure. The structural features were obtained by dip coating of a highly close-packed microsphere suspension on a 3D printed sacrificial template. Considering the structured arrangement of microspherical porogens in the coating layer, the microsphere-leached constructs showed higher uniformity and porosity than the conventionally particulate-leached structures, leading to ultrasoft mechanical compliance. Considering biomechanical compatibility, the resulting elastic moduli were at the sub-MPa level, comparable with those of native vascular tissues. In addition, the developed porous graft was reinforced selectively at the edge regions using a nonporous coating to secure its practical sutureability for clinical use. The sufficiently low cytotoxicity was clinically confirmed to alleviate the stiffness mismatch issues at the anastomotic interface between the native tissue and the artificial graft, thus overcoming the relevant clinical complications. Furthermore, the overall superior properties could be implemented on the 3D printed template for patient-specific medicare, thus implying the manufacturability of patient-specific vascular grafts.  aPublisher supplied data  aHI21C1350cKorea Health Industry Development Institutedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003710  a2021R1A6C101A449cKorea Basic Science Institutedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003716  a2020-0-00228cInstitute for Information and Communications Technology Promotiondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010418 3abiomechanics 3abiomimetics 3acompliance 3acytotoxicity 3amicroparticles 3aporosity 3athree-dimensional printing 0amechanical biocompatibility 0amicrosphere leaching 0adip coating 0a3D printing 0aartificial vascular graft1 aKim, Chae Hwa1 aKim, Tae-Hee,1 aPark, Suk Hee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5515-86600 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 June 22, v. 14, no. 26 p.29588-29598dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c058393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006800150245015900218300001600377520148500393592002801878650001701906650002001923650001201943650002601955650001301981650001501994650001102009650003502020650001802055650002202073653002902095653002602124653002402150653001502174653001202189653002102201700006702222700002902289700001902318700002402337773010702361856008502468852000902553655001202562IND60611378020221119113149.0200424e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061137802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2018.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieira, Marcus Vinícius1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4472-544710aFair tests of the habitat amount hypothesis require appropriate metrics of patch isolation: An example with small mammals in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest  ap. 264-270.  aPatch size and isolation are traditionally considered as main determinants of species richness in fragmented landscapes, grounded on Island Biogeography Theory (IBT). The Habitat Amount Hypothesis (HAH) is the more recent alternative: species richness could be predicted exclusively by the total amount of habitat surrounding sampling sites. However, tests may be biased towards HAH by the use of poor metrics of patch isolation, and because landscape variables are measured only within the scale of effect for habitat amount. Here we compare the HAH, IBT, and patch isolation as predictors of species richness of forest-dependent small mammals in an Atlantic Forest fragmented landscape using two measures of patch isolation: considering all (overall) or only the nearest three (restrict) forest remnants within the scale of effect for each variable. The model with habitat amount had more support than models with patch size and isolation (representing IBT), or patch size alone, but the model with overall patch isolation was equally plausible. Had we used only restricted patch isolation, we would have found support only for the HAH, disregarding patch isolation. The appropriate metric of patch isolation is critical for robust tests of the HAH, which should be considered in future studies to avoid biased results in favour of the HAH. Our results provide strong evidence for either HAH or overall patch isolation over IBT, and both may offer simplicity to decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3adecision making 3aforests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anatural resources conservation 3asmall mammals 3aspecies diversity 0aGuapi-Macacu river basin 0aHabitat configuration 0aIsland biogeography 0aMarsupials 0aRodents 0aSpecies richness1 aAlmeida-Gomes, Mauricio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7938-354X1 aDelciellos, Ana Cláudia1 aCerqueira, Rui1 aCrouzeilles, Renato0 tBiological conservation.g2018 Oct., v. 226 p.264-270dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012000173300001600293520159300309592002801902650001201930650001501942650001701957650001901974650002501993650001902018650001802037650001102055650001402066650003502080650001602115650001602131650001002147651001702157653002402174653001402198653001802212653001902230653002102249653003202270700001902302700002302321773010702344856008502451852000902536655001202545IND60611378120221119113514.0200424e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061137812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2018.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorostiague, Pablo10aWill climate change cause spatial mismatch between plants and their pollinators? A test using Andean cactus species  ap. 247-255.  aClimate change can disrupt mutualisms by causing temporal or spatial mismatch between interacting species. However, the effects of climate change forecasts on biotic interactions remain poorly studied. In cactus species, pollination constitutes a fundamental process in the production of fruits and seeds. Thus, we aimed to analyse the impact of future climate change on the geographical distributions of 11 cactus species from the southern Central Andes and their spatial match with their pollinators. We used species distribution modelling to forecast the geographic range shifts of these cactus species and their pollinators under two future scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) for the years 2050 and 2070. We predicted geographic range contractions under future scenarios that reached almost 80% for some cactus species. Our results indicate that the geographical distributions of cacti would be constrained by the presence of the pollinator species on which they depend in the present; however, climate change would not cause spatial mismatch between cacti and their animal pollinators in the future. For most cactus species, we predicted an increase in the spatial match with their mutualists under future scenarios. This is the first study that estimates the geographic range of cacti using both abiotic and biotic factors. Given the importance that positive interactions have on the life cycle of many plant species, our approach could be used to better understand the potential effects of climate change, particularly on species that are of special interest for conservation actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abiocenosis 3abiogeography 3abiotic factors 3acacti and succulents 3aclimate change 3afruit growing 3amodels 3amutualism 3anatural resources conservation 3apollination 3apollinators 3aseeds 3aAndes region 0aBiotic interactions 0aCactaceae 0aCentral Andes 0aClimate change 0aPlant-pollinator 0aSpecies distribution models1 aSajama, Jesús1 aOrtega-Baes, Pablo0 tBiological conservation.g2018 Oct., v. 226 p.247-255dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012900167300001600296520147400312592002801786650001701814650001201831650001601843650001901859650002301878650001601901650003001917650001901947650002801966650000901994650001402003650001602017700002002033700002302053700002402076700002702100700001602127700001902143700001902162700002402181700002002205773010802225856008202333852000902415655001202424IND60468976020221119152244.0181114e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046897602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-015-1531-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatoh, Tomohiro10aIdentification of QTLs controlling low-temperature germination of the East European rice (Oryza sativa L.) variety Maratteli  ap. 245-254.  aGerminability under low temperature is one of the most important traits in seedling establishment in direct-sowing culture of rice. The objective of this study was the identification of genes responsible for higher and faster germination under low temperature, with the aim of breeding new rice varieties for direct-sowing culture. We identified four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for germination properties under low temperature in an East European rice variety, Maratteli. Maratteli-derived alleles at qLTG3-1 and qLTG3-2 on chromosome 3 and qLTG11-1 on chromosome 11 increased germination rate under low temperature. In contrast, the Maratteli allele at qLTG1-1 on chromosome 1 reduced the rate. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) with the Akitakomachi genetic background harboring qLTG3-1 and qLTG11-1 alleles from Maratteli accelerated germination and a NIL with qLTG1-1 delayed germination under low temperature, resulting in enhanced or suppressed germination rates, respectively. These QTLs altered the germination profile of Akitakomachi. Hence, Maratteli is a better source of genes for the improvement of germination under low temperature. We conclude that the low temperature germinability of various Japanese varieties inferior in this character can be improved by marker-assisted selection without modification of other superior traits. These NILs may also contribute to uncovering the molecular mechanisms of cold tolerance at the germination stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aalleles 3achromosomes 3acold tolerance 3agenetic background 3agermination 3amarker-assisted selection 3aplant breeding 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3aseedlings 3atemperature1 aTezuka, Kouichi1 aKawamoto, Tomohiko1 aMatsumoto, Shinichi1 aSatoh-Nagasawa, Namiko1 aUeda, Kenji1 aSakurai, Kenji1 aWatanabe, Akio1 aTakahashi, Hidekazu1 aAkagi, Hiromori0 tEuphytica.g2016 Jan., v. 207, no. 2 p.245-254dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-015-1531-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03672naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012500169300001600294520224900310592002802559650001102587650002102598650002002619650003702639650001202676650001902688650001302707650002002720650001602740653000802756653001902764653003602783653002102819653002102840653002402861700002302885700002102908700002502929700001902954700002802973700002703001773008303028856008203111852000903193655001203202IND60564126620221119143752.0170307e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056412662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2015.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Ghoch, Marwan10aChanges in lean and skeletal muscle body mass in adult females with anorexia nervosa before and after weight restoration  ap. 170-178.  aData on the deficits in lean body mass (LBM) and total body skeletal muscle mass (SM) in anorexia nervosa (AN) is scarce and inconsistent. Furthermore, the usefulness of the reported body mass index (BMI) severity cut-off for AN has not been tested with respect to these important parameters. The study had two aims, namely to study LBM patterns and SM in adult females with AN before and after weight restoration, and to examine the clinical usefulness of the 16.5 kg/m2 BMI cut-off for assessing the protein status in terms of LBM and SM in AN patients.Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) before and after weight gain in 90 adult female inpatients with AN, and 90 controls matched by post-treatment BMI and age. Patients were stratified into two groups using BMI 16.5 kg/m2 as a cut-off.Before weight restoration, patients in the BMI≤16.5 kg/m2 subgroup (n = 65) had lower LBM, SM and lean extremity mass percentage, but higher %LBM and lean trunk-to-extremity ratio on average than controls. However, those with BMI >16.5 kg/m2 (n = 25) displayed lower lean extremity mass percentage and higher %LBM, but no significant differences in LBM and SM with respect to controls. Moreover the time × subgroup interaction was significant in terms of LBM and SM, meaning that, changes occur in different manner over time in the two AN subgroups. However no differences were found between the two AN subgroups in either demographic or other eating disorder characteristics. After weight gain, normalization of LBM, %LBM, lean extremity mass percentage and SM was achieved across the entire AN sample, and the BMI≤16.5 kg/m2 subgroup. The fat mass was the major determinant of gain in LBM; the higher the FM at baseline, the greater the increase in LBM.Our results suggest a BMI cut-off ≤16.5 kg/m2 as a clinical threshold for determining AN severity. As short-term weight restoration is associated with a normalization in LBM and SM, it appears that biological regulation of weight gain remains intact in AN, i.e., unaffected by the severity of malnutrition.Changes in lean and skeletal muscle body mass in adult females with anorexia nervosa before and after weight restoration (ISRCTN168721194).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanorexia nervosa 3abody mass index 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3afemales 3alean body mass 3apatients 3askeletal muscle 3aweight gain 0aDXA 0aLean body mass 0aTotal body skeletal muscle mass 0aAnorexia nervosa 0aEating disorders 0aInpatient treatment1 aPourhassan, Maryam1 aMilanese, Chiara1 aMüller, Manfred J.,1 aCalugi, Simona1 aBazzani, Paola Vittoria1 aGrave, Riccardo Dalle,0 tClinical nutrition.g2017 Feb., v. 36 p.170-178dElsevier Ltdx0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2015.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245009700210300002000307520138600327592002801713653001701741653002201758653002601780653001301806653003001819700002401849700002701873700001801900700001901918773019501937856007902132852000902211655001202220IND60517940120221119212820.0160406e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051794012DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15039921122doi7 aPMC45772042pmcid7 a263059342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeubauer, Thomas A.10aTectonics, climate, and the rise and demise of continental aquatic species richness hotspots  ap. 11478-11483.  aContinental aquatic species richness hotspots are unevenly distributed across the planet. In present-day Europe, only two centers of biodiversity exist (Lake Ohrid on the Balkans and the Caspian Sea). During the Neogene, a wide variety of hotspots developed in a series of long-lived lakes. The mechanisms underlying the presence of richness hotspots in different geological periods have not been properly examined thus far. Based on Miocene to Recent gastropod distributions, we show that the existence and evolution of such hotspots in inland-water systems are tightly linked to the geodynamic history of the European continent. Both past and present hotspots are related to the formation and persistence of long-lived lake systems in geological basins or to isolation of existing inland basins and embayments from the marine realm. The faunal evolution within hotspots highly depends on warm climates and surface area. During the Quaternary icehouse climate and extensive glaciations, limnic biodiversity sustained a severe decline across the continent and most former hotspots disappeared. The Recent gastropod distribution is mainly a geologically young pattern formed after the Last Glacial Maximum (19 ky) and subsequent formation of postglacial lakes. The major hotspots today are related to long-lived lakes in preglacially formed, permanently subsiding geological basins.  aPublisher supplied data 0abiogeography 0ahotspot evolution 0afreshwater gastropods 0aCenozoic 0aspecies-area relationship1 aHarzhauser, Mathias1 aGeorgopoulou, Elisavet1 aKroh, Andreas1 aMandić, Oleg,0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 112, no. 37 p.11478-11483dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15039921123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245011500173300001400288520122200302592002801524650002101552650002101573650002501594650001801619650001601637650001201653650002801665650001401693650001001707650001201717650001201729653002101741653002101762653002701783653002301810653001301833700002301846773011601869856009001985852000902075655001202084IND50070859120221119195216.0190405e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007085912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2013.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaraca, Hakan10aEffects of ozone treatments on microbial quality and some chemical properties of lettuce, spinach, and parsley  ap. 46-53.  aThe effects of distilled, ozonated (12mgL−1) and chlorinated (100mgL−1) water treatments on inactivation of Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua inoculated on lettuce, spinach, and parsley and on some chemical characteristics (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, ascorbic acid, and total phenolic contents and antioxidant activity) of these vegetables were investigated.

We report successful modification of a surface chemistry method for use with exosomes and identify 21 surface N-glycoproteins on exosomes released by mouse mammary carcinoma-induced MDSCs. These glycoprotein identities and functionalities are compared with 93 N-linked glycoproteins identified on the surface of the parental cells. As with the lysate proteomes examined previously, the exosome surface N-glycoproteins are primarily a subset of the glycoproteins on the surface of the suppressor cells that released them, with related functions and related potential as therapeutic targets. The “don’t eat me” molecule CD47 and its binding partners thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) and signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) were among the surface N-glycoproteins detected. Functional bioassays using antibodies to these three molecules demonstrated that CD47, TSP1, and to a lesser extent SIRPα facilitate exosome-mediated MDSC chemotaxis and migration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3abioassays 3achemistry 3achemotaxis 3aexosomes 3aglycoproteins 3amice 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aregulatory proteins 3asuppressor cells 0aexosomes 0amyeloid derived suppressor cells 0aN-glycoproteome 0acell surface capture1 aDanielson, Steven1 aClements, Virginia1 aEdwards, Nathan1 aOstrand-Rosenberg, Suzanne1 aFenselau, Catherine0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2017 Jan. 06, v. 16, no. 1 p.238-246dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.6b008113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100003000180245015200210300001600362500002000378506007600398520111000474592002801584596004301612506003701655650001601692650001001708650001901718650002801737650000901765650001801774650001501792650001601807650001701823650001401840650001401854650001501868650001201883651001101895700001801906700002701924700001801951700002701969700006201996773012402058856007302182852000902255655001202264IND60632697620221207123515.0190315e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063269762DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.129742doi7 aPMC68497372pmcid7 a308059292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvendsen, Julie Christine10aMonitoring infection with Piscine myocarditis virus and development of cardiomyopathy syndrome in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in Norway  ap. 511-518.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn epidemiological study was carried out in Norway in 2015–2018, investigating the development of infection with Piscine myocarditis virus (PMCV) and development of cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS) in farmed Atlantic salmon. Cohorts from 12 sites were followed and sampled every month or every other month from sea transfer to slaughter. PMCV was detected at all sites and in all sampled cages, and fish in six sites developed clinical CMS. The initial infection happened between 1 and 7 months post‐sea transfer, and the median time from infection with PMCV until outbreak of CMS was 6.5 months. Generally, fish from sites with CMS had higher viral titre and a higher prevalence of PMCV, compared to sites that did not develop clinical CMS. The virus persisted until the point of slaughter at most (11 out of 12) of the sites. The detection of PMCV in all sites suggests that PMCV is more widespread than previously known. Screening for PMCV as a tool to monitor impending outbreaks of CMS must be supported by observations of the health status of the fish and risk factors for development of disease.  aPublisher supplied data  a90118cNorwegian Seafood Research Fund0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmo salar 3acages 3acardiomyopathy 3aepidemiological studies 3afish 3ahealth status 3amonitoring 3amyocarditis 3arisk factors 3ascreening 3aslaughter 3aviral load 3aviruses 3aNorway1 aNylund, Stian1 aKristoffersen, Anja B.1 aTakle, Harald1 aFossberg Buhaug, Julia1 aJensen, Britt Bang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9536-90780 tJournal of fish diseases.g2019 Apr., v. 42, no. 4 p.511-518dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl10108x0140-77757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.129743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012800173300001400301520053700315536014600852592002800998596005001026650001201076650001101088650001501099650001601114650002001130651001201150651001101162651001201173653001301185653001501198653001201213653002301225700002801248773013801276856008501414852000901499655001201508IND60595457920180712000000.0180605e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059545792DNAL7 a10.1080/00379271.2017.14104422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGültekin, Levent10aTwo new species of Larinus Dejean from North Africa (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), with a key to the striped Larinus (s.str.)  ap. 27-44.  aTwo new sibling species, Larinus synthesys n. sp. from Algeria, and Larinus boroveci n. sp. from Algeria and Morocco, are described.

The present study aims at understanding of the effective performance of water efficiency solutions in commercial buildings by reporting and analyzing a specific case study - Colombo Shopping Center. The water efficiency measures implemented in Colombo Shopping Center were the following: (i) in 2008, the restrooms fixtures were replaced by more efficient models; (ii) in 2011, a rainwater harvesting system (RWHS) was introduced for supplying the cogeneration plant; and (iii) also in 2011, a greywater reuse system (GWS) was installed to use the cooling towers purged water to supply the toilets of four restrooms. The methodology included collecting the water metering records and the accounting archives since 2006, assessing the water savings and evaluating the partial life cycle costs of each measure. The partial life cycle cost analysis covers the acquisition and the first years of the operation and maintenance stages. The restroom fixtures present the highest annual water savings along with longest payback period (> 15 years), since both the investment and maintenance costs are high. The estimated payback period for the RWHS is roughly 10 years. The GWS was paid in just over 2 years and has annual water savings similar to the RWHS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3abuildings 3acase studies 3acertification 3acooling towers 3alife cycle costing 3amodels 3astakeholders 3awater harvesting 3awater reuse 0aWater efficient fixtures 0aRainwater harvesting 0aGrey water use 0aWater savings 0aLife cycle cost 0aCommercial buildings1 aSilva, Cristina Matos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5690-04331 aMeireles, Inês0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 Apr., v. 143 p.251-259dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009200175520158100267536029001848592002802138650001302166650001602179650001902195650001902214650000902233650000802242650001602250650001202266650002402278650002602302650002502328650002102353651001402374653001402388653001702402653003002419653002702449653001102476700002402487700001902511700001802530700002502548700002602573773013402599856008602733852000902819655001202828IND60688582520221121100828.0220310e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068858252DNAL7 a10.1080/15230430.2017.14209522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuipers Munneke, P.14aThe K-transect on the western Greenland Ice Sheet: Surface energy balance (2003–2016)  aWe present thirteen years (2003–2016) of surface energy balance calculations from automatic weather stations (AWS) along the K-transect in west Greenland. Although short in a climatological sense, these time series start to become long enough to provide valuable insight into the interannual variability and drivers of melt in this part of Greenland and into trends in certain components of the surface energy balance. For instance, the data clearly reveal that albedo variations explain most of the interannual melt variability at the higher stations in the accumulation zone. Sensible heat becomes a major heat source for melt in the lower ablation zone, while latent heat modulates annual melt by up to 20 W m⁻². Also, at two locations with the longest uninterrupted time series, we see a decreasing trend of incoming longwave radiation (−1.2 to −1.4 W m⁻² y⁻¹, p < 0.10) concurrent with an increase in incoming shortwave radiation (+2.4 to +3.8 W m⁻² y⁻¹, p < 0.10) during the observation period. This suggests that decreasing cloud cover plays a role in the increased availability of melt energy (+0.7 to +2.2 W m⁻² y⁻¹, not statistically significant at p < 0.10). At the AWS situated around the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), the observed negative trend in albedo is strongest of all stations (−0.0087 y⁻¹), as the ELA moves upward and bare ice becomes exposed. These insights are important for modeling the future response of the ice sheet to continued global warming, which is expected to be dominated by surface processes.  aWe acknowledge funding from many sources, the most important ones being NWO (Netherlands Institute for Scientific Research), its Netherlands Polar Programme (NPP), NWO-Spinoza programme, NESSC (Netherlands Earth System Science Centre), and KNAW (Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acloud cover 3aenergy balance 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3aice 3alatent heat 3amelting 3ashortwave radiation 3aterrestrial radiation 3atime series analysis 3aweather stations 3aGreenland 0aGreenland 0asurface melt 0aautomatic weather station 0asurface energy balance 0aalbedo1 aSmeets, C.

As part of the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) Consortium, an initiative was set to make genomics research in Africa an African endeavor and was developed through funding from the United States’ National Institutes of Health Common Fund and the Wellcome Trust. H3Africa is intended to encourage a contemporary research approach by African investigators and to stimulate the study of genomic and environmental determinants of common diseases. The goal of these endeavors is to improve the health of African populations.

The main factors affecting the CPE, such as concentration of thiocyanate, VPB+, CPC, Triton X-114, pH, equilibration temperature and incubation time, were optimized for the best extract efficiency. Under the optimized conditions, a 32-fold enhancement factor was reached. The lower limit of detection (LOD) obtained under the optimal conditions was 2.18μgL−1. The accuracy (REs) and precision (RSDs) for five replicate determinations at 250μgL−1 Mo were 3.25 and 2.36% after preconcentration with CPE. The calibration graph using the preconcentration method was highly linear with a correlation coefficient of 0.9949 in range of 7.5–1800μgL−1. The method was successfully applied to the determination of Mo in beverages and food samples and in certified reference materials. The results of developed method were compared with those of independent ICP-OES method, and quantitatively verified and validated with recoveries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abeverages 3acetylpyridinium chloride 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3amolybdenum 3apH 3asurfactants 3atemperature 0aFood safety 0aFood analysis 0aMo(VI) 0aCPE/FAAS 0aThiocyanate, VPB+ 0aCPC 0aBeverages and food samples 0aFood composition1 aAksoy, Ümmügülsüm1 aUlusoy, Halil İbrahim1 aAkçay, Mehmet0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2013 Nov., v. 32, no. 1 p.74-82dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2013.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007300162300001800235520106900253592002801322650004401350650002201394650002101416650002101437650003801458650001001496650001701506650001801523650001801541650001801559650001301577650001801590650001601608700001801624700001801642700002001660773010601680856008101786852000901867655001201876IND60121059320221118053743.0150214e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012105932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8163-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Ah Ra10aPreparation of alginate–CaCl2 microspheres as resveratrol carriers  ap. 4612-4619.  aResveratrol-loaded calcium alginate microspheres for prolonged drug release were prepared by ionic gelation of alginate with calcium chloride (CaCl₂). Further, resveratrol-loaded calcium alginate microspheres were developed using two concentrations of alginate (0.5 and 1 % w/v) and CaCl₂(0.5 and 1 M) and an encapsulator equipped with a 300-μm nozzle. The mean particle size of the microspheres was between 175.52 and 244.03 μm, and an encapsulation efficiency (EE) of over 95 % was observed. FTIR spectroscopy indicated a polyelectrolyte interaction between alginate and CaCl₂; alginate microsphere thermograms were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry. X-ray diffraction shows the crystalline change of microspheres by cross linking. The release profiles and EE increased depending on the CaCl₂concentration, and a slow initial burst release was observed on freeze-dried microspheres. These results indicate that resveratrol-loaded calcium alginate microspheres can be used as a potential resveratrol delivery system in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acalcium alginate 3acalcium chloride 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrugs 3aelectrolytes 3aencapsulation 3afood industry 3afreeze drying 3agelation 3aparticle size 3aresveratrol1 aChun, Yong Gi1 aKim, Bum Keun1 aPark, Dong June0 tJournal of materials science.g2014 July, v. 49, no. 13 p.4612-4619dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-014-8163-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245022700169300001400396520161200410592002802022653000802050653001002058653001602068653000802084653001702092653000802109653000902117653005202126653006102178653003002239653003302269653003102302700005902333700002102392700002302413700002002436700002102456700002302477700002102500700002202521700002302543700002102566700002002587700001702607700002102624773008902645856008402734852000902818655001202827IND60557756920221121124634.0170412e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055775692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resinv.2016.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshida, Naomi10aAssociation of anti-aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetase antibody and anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 antibody with the therapeutic response of polymyositis/dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease  ap. 24-32.  aWe attempted to clarify whether the presence of anti-aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetase antibody (anti-ARS Ab) or anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 antibody (anti-MDA5 Ab) is associated with the therapeutic response of polymyositis/dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease (PM/DM-ILD).We retrospectively investigated 22 patients with PM/DM-ILD (10 positive for anti-ARS Ab and nine positive for anti-MDA5 Ab) for whom antibody analysis of conserved serum was possible. We assessed mortality in the first three months as the therapeutic response in the acute phase and compared changes in clinical data for up to one year considered as the chronic phase. We classified the clinical changes over the year into three groups: Improvement (increased % vital capacity [%VC] or diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide [%DLCO]≥10 or 15%), deterioration (decreased %VC or %DLCO≥10 or 15%), and no change (remainder of the changes). The extent of abnormality demonstrated by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was scored.Positivity for anti-MDA5 Ab, but not for anti-ARS Ab, was associated with mortality in the first 3 months. Evaluation of the therapeutic response in the first year showed that positivity for the anti-ARS Ab, but not for the anti-MDA5 Ab, was associated with an improvement in %DLCO and a decline in the serum KL-6 levels. Positivity for the anti-ARS Ab or negativity for anti-MDA5 Ab was associated with a greater decrease in bronchial dilatation as seen by HRCT.Anti-ARS and anti-MDA5 Abs are associated with the therapeutic response of PM/DM-ILD.  aPublisher supplied data 0aILD 0aPM/DM 0aAnti-ARS Ab 0aASS 0aAnti-MDA5 Ab 0aCsA 0aIVCY 0aAnti-aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetase antibody 0aAnti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 antibody 0aInterstitial lung disease 0aPolymyositis/dermatomyositis 0aAmyopathic dermatomyositis1 aOkamoto, Masaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9298-35041 aKaieda, Shinjiro1 aFujimoto, Kiminori1 aEbata, Tomohiro1 aTajiri, Morihiro1 aNakamura, Masayuki1 aTominaga, Masaki1 aWakasugi, Daisuke1 aKawayama, Tomotaka1 aKuwana, Masataka1 aMimori, Tsuneyo1 aIda, Hiroaki1 aHoshino, Tomoaki0 tRespiratory Investigation.g2017 Jan., v. 55 p.24-32dElsevier B.V.x2212-53457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resinv.2016.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04441naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245017800166300002000344520295300364592002803317650002303345650003103368650000803399650002703407650000803434650001603442650001603458650001203474650001403486650002003500650001103520650001803531650001403549650001103563650002303574650001203597650001303609650002203622650002203644650001303666700006403679773013803743856008103881852000903962655001203971IND60755607120221117053325.0211104e20211025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075560712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c077442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Abhishek10aDivalent-Metal-Ion Selectivity of the CRISPR-Cas System-Associated Cas1 Protein: Insights from Classical Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Electronic Structure Calculations  ap. 11943-11954.  aCRISPR-associated protein 1 (Cas1) is a universally conserved essential metalloenzyme of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) immune system of prokaryotes (bacteria, archaea) that can cut and integrate a part of viral DNA to its host genome with the help of other proteins. The integrated DNA acts as a memory of viral infection, which can be transcribed to RNA and stop future infection by recognition (based on the RNA/DNA complementarity principle) followed by protein-mediated degradation of the viral DNA. It has been proposed that the presence of a single manganese (Mn²⁺) ion in a conserved divalent-metal-ion binding pocket (key residues: E190, H254, D265, D268) of Cas1 is crucial for its function. Cas1-mediated DNA degradation was proposed to be hindered by metal substitution, metal chelation, or mutation of the binding pocket residues. Cas1 is active toward dsDNA degradation with both Mn²⁺ and Mg²⁺. X-ray structures of Cas1 revealed an intricate atomic interaction network of the divalent-metal-ion binding pocket and opened up the possibility of modeling related metal ions (viz., Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺) in the binding pocket of wild-type (WT) and mutated Cas1 proteins for computational analysis, which includes (1) quantitative estimation of the energetics of the divalent-metal-ion preference and (2) exploring the structural and dynamical aspects of the protein in response to divalent-metal-ion substitution or amino acid mutation. Using the X-ray structure of the Cas1 protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a template (PDB 3GOD), we performed (∼2.23 μs) classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to compare structural and dynamical differences between Mg²⁺- and Ca²⁺-bound binding pockets of wild-type (WT) and mutant (E190A, H254A, D265A, D268A) Cas1. Furthermore, reduced binding pocket models were generated from X-ray and molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, and the resulting structures were subjected to quantum chemical calculations. Results suggest that Cas1 prefers Mg²⁺ binding relative to Ca²⁺ and the preference is the strongest for WT and the weakest for the D268A mutant. Quantum chemical calculations indicate that Mn²⁺ is the most preferred relative to both Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ in the wild-type and mutant Cas1. Substitution of Mg²⁺ by Ca²⁺ does not alter the interaction network between Cas1 and the divalent metal ion but increases the wetness of the binding pocket by introducing a single water molecule in the first coordination shell of the latter. The strength of metal-ion preference (Mg²⁺ versus Ca²⁺) seems to be dependent on the solvent accessibility of the divalent-metal-ion binding pocket, strongest for wild-type Cas1 (in which the metal-ion binding pocket is dry, which includes two water molecules) and the weakest for the D268A mutant (in which the metal-ion binding pocket is wet, which includes four water molecules).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aCRISPR-associated proteins 3aDNA 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aRNA 3aX-radiation 3aamino acids 3acalcium 3achelation 3adivalent metals 3agenome 3aimmune system 3amanganese 3amemory 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants 3amutation 3aprokaryotic cells 3aquantum mechanics 3asolvents1 aSatpati, Priyadarshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0391-35800 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Oct. 25, v. 125, no. 43 p.11943-11954dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c077443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005100150245011900201520089700320592002801217650001101245650000901256650003101265653001401296653002501310653001701335653001501352653001901367653001401386700001601400700005201416700005301468700001401521700005401535773009001589856008501679852000901764655001201773IND60776065120221116194339.0220606e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077606512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1241132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXi, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6152-404110aExperimental investigation on the water hammer characteristic of stalling fluid in eccentric casing-tubing annulus  aThis study aims to analyze the water hammer characteristics of water hammer on tubing offset center in oil project for providing reference for water injection and well washing.

The characteristic of dynamic fluid loss is investigated in eccentric annulus flow channel and tubing and in flow line in terms of velocity, vorticity, and pressure field. Results show that water hammer occurs, and the pressure of oil casing annulus increases at the inside and outside walls with the increase in eccentricity. The water hammer pressure forms double imbalance in the internal and external walls of eccentric annulus tubing. With the increase in eccentricity, flow velocity decreases in the small flow passage, and flow velocity attenuation is fast at oil casing annulus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aoils 3aparticle image velocimetry 0aEccentric 0aAnnulus flow channel 0aDynamic loss 0aFlow field 0aPressure field 0aVorticity1 aWang, Chuan1 aXi, Wang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2413-93951 aLiu, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1068-24901 aWang, Hui1 aYang, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3431-019X0 tEnergy.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 253 p.124113-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1241133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03555naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011400169520146900283536068701752592002802439650001402467650001102481650000802492650001502500650001102515650001402526650001302540650001202553650002302565650001502588651001802603651001402621653002002635653002402655653001802679653002302697653002102720653001702741700001702758700002602775700002602801700001802827773013302845856008602978852000903064655001203073IND60688582820221121100820.0220310e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068858282DNAL7 a10.1080/15230430.2018.14337892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasholt, Bent10aObserved sediment and solute transport from the Kangerlussuaq sector of the Greenland Ice Sheet (2006–2016)  aNew measurements of Watson River sediment and solute concentrations and an extended river discharge record improved by acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements are used to calculate the total sediment and solute transport from a large ice-sheet sector in southern west Greenland. For the 2006–2016 period, the mean annual sediment and solute transport was 17.5 ± 7.2 × 10⁶ t and 85 ± 30 × 10³ t, respectively (standard deviation given). The highest annual transport occurred in 2010, attaining values of 29.6 × 10⁶ t and 138 × 10³ t, respectively. The corresponding annual average values of specific transport are 1.39 × 10³ t km⁻² a⁻¹ for sediment and 6.7 t km⁻² a⁻¹ for solutes from the approximately 12,600 km² (95% ice covered) catchment, yielding an area-average erosion rate of 0.5 mm a⁻¹. The specific transport is likely several times higher under the ice sheet near the margin where all meltwater passes than it is in the interior where the ice sheet is frozen to the bed. We conclude that the Greenland Ice Sheet is a large supplier of sediment and solutes to the surrounding fjords and seas. We find that the proglacial area can be a net source of sediments during high floods and we confirm that an increased amount of meltwater-transported sediments can explain the expansion of deltas around Greenland, contradictory to delta erosion observed elsewhere in the Arctic in recent years.  aOver the years, the Watson River discharge monitoring has been financed through various funding sources: the Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland grants 07-015998, 09-064628 and 2138-08-0003, the Danish Natural Science Research Council grant 272-07-0645, the Center for Permafrost (CENPERM), the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management (IGN), the Greenland Analogue Project (GAP), and the Danish Energy Agency (ENS) through the WASEIS and PROMICE projects.

The structure and morphology of hybrids are characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron-microscopy (TEM). The effect of PEI on the distribution of Fe₃O₄nanoparticles and the microwave absorbing properties of hybrid microwave absorber of Fe₃O₄/MWNTs were investigated. The TEM results show that Fe₃O₄nanoparticles are attached homogeneously on MWNTs, which indicates that the adding of PEI is effective to control the distribution of Fe₃O₄nanoparticles on the surface of MWNTs. The microwave absorbing properties results show that the maximum reflection loss (RL) of PEI modified Fe₃O₄/MWNTs hybrids is improved significantly, which is −30.69 dB at 7.24 GHz and −10 dB bandwidth is 1.84 GHz. However, the RL of the Fe₃O₄/MWNTs without PEI is −21.96 dB at 7.02 GHz and −10 dB bandwidth is 1.2 GHz.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon nanotubes 3acoprecipitation 3apolymers 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aTang, Meng1 aCao, Xiufen1 aLu, Zhengbin1 aShen, Yongtao0 tJournal of materials science.g2014 July, v. 49, no. 13 p.4629-4635dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-014-8165-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014600175300001600321520162600337592002801963650001801991650001802009650001202027650002002039650001302059650001502072650002802087650001602115650001502131650001202146650001502158650001302173650001502186650002302201650002502224650001602249653001702265653001202282653001002294653001302304653001202317653001502329653001202344700002102356773010902377856008602486852000902572655001202581IND60591016020221118155224.0190319e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059101602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2017.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Qurashi, Adel D.10aPostharvest ethanolic extract of propolis treatment affects quality and biochemical changes of ‘Hindi-Besennara’ mangos during shelf life  ap. 520-525.  aQuality and biochemical changes of ‘Hindi-Besennara’ mangos in response to postharvest dipping in ethalonic extract of propolis (EEP) at 2.5, 3.5 or 4.5% were studied during two weeks of shelf life (SL) at 20± 2 °C and 60–70% RH. EEP at medium and high rates showed lower weight loss and decay percentages than control during SL. EPP at all rates retained higher membrane stability index (MSI) of fruit peel and higher pulp firmness especially at the high rate than control during SL. Moreover, EPP at all rates maintained lower total soluble solids (TSS) and at the high rate retained higher titratable acidity (TA) concentrations than control during SL. Both total phenols and flavonoids concentrations of fruit peel were higher after one week of SL than initials but decreased thereafter to a level close to initials. In this respect, EPP at high rate retained higher total phenols and flavonoids concentrations than other treatments. Vitamin C concentration of fruit pulp increased during SL in EEP treatments compared to initial but decreased thereafter to a level close to initial. EEP at all rates retained higher vitamin C concentration than control. Compared to initial, free radical scavenging capacity (FRSC) of peel decreased after one week followed by a sharp increase after two weeks and was not affected by the applied treatments. Relations of such biochemical changes with peroxidase (POD) and α-amylase activities were discussed. In conclusion, EEP treatments at 4.5% retained quality of ‘Hindi-Besennara’ mangos during SL and being suggested as natural alternative to synthetic chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3aascorbic acid 3adipping 3aenzyme activity 3afirmness 3aflavonoids 3afree radical scavengers 3afruit peels 3afruit pulp 3amangoes 3aperoxidase 3apropolis 3ashelf life 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3aweight loss 0aAntioxidants 0aEnzymes 0aMango 0aPropolis 0aQuality 0aShelf life 0aStorage1 aAwad, Mohamed A.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 233 p.520-525dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2017.12.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245018700161300001600348500001900364520083700383592002801220650001901248650002201267650001301289650002301302650002201325650001201347650001901359650002501378650001401403650002201417653001301439653001401452653001401466700001601480700002001496700002101516773009701537856007701634852000901711655001201720IND60736148420221120041404.0210503s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073614842DNAL7 a10.1139/gen-2020-00922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeCuir, James10aSequence of Trypanosoma cruzi reference strain SC43 nuclear genome and kinetoplast maxicircle confirms a strong genetic structure among closely related parasite discrete typing units  ap. 525-531.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChagas disease is a zoonotic, parasitic, vector-borne neglected tropical disease that affects the lives of over 6 million people throughout the Americas. Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent, presents extensive genetic diversity.

The assembled diploid genome was 79 Mbp in size, divided into 1236 contigs with an average coverage reaching 180×. There was extensive synteny of SC43cl1 genome with closely related TcV and TcVI genomes, with limited sequence rearrangements. TcVI genomes included several expansions not present in TcV strains. Comparative analysis of both nuclear and kinetoplast sequences clearly separated TcV from TcVI strains, which strongly supports the current DTU classification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3adiploidy 3aetiological agents 3agenetic variation 3ahybrids 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aparasites 3atropical diseases 0aparasite 0adiversity 0aphylogeny1 aTu, Weihong1 aDumonteil, Eric1 aHerrera, Claudia0 tGenome.g2021, v. 64, no. 5 p.525-531dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl41235x1480-33217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2020-00923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245011400176300001500290520106500305592002801370650002901398650001701427650001901444650002001463650001901483650001701502650001601519650001701535650002001552650000901572650001401581650001201595650001701607653003401624653000801658653001801666653001101684653002401695653001701719653001301736653001601749653001801765653002101783700002401804700003301828700002401861700002001885773013001905856008202035852000902117655001202126IND60113417320221117232202.0190405e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011341732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2013.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLlorent-Martínez, E.J.10aQuantitation of hydroxytyrosol in food products using a sequential injection analysis fluorescence optosensor  ap. 99-104.  aHydroxytyrosol (HXT), one of the most important phenols in olive oil, has been reported to present beneficial effects for human health, such as antioxidant and antimicrobial properties and beneficial effects on the cardio-vascular system. As a result, exhaustive research is being carried out in order to use this compound in enriched foods, such as tomato juice or milk. In this paper, we propose a sequential injection analysis (SIA) optosensor for the fluorimetric (λexc/λem=281/318nm) determination of hydroxytyrosol in several foods. The use of a solid support in the flow-cell increases the sensitivity of the system (detection limit of 0.6μgmL−1) and, especially, the selectivity. In this way, using a QuEChERS extraction procedure, the proposed method was applied to the determination of the analyte in hydroxytyrosol-enriched foods (tomato juice/soup, milk and infant formula). The recoveries (100±10%) and relative standard deviations obtained (3–5%) show the potentiality of the developed system as an alternative to chromatographic methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidants 3achromatography 3adetection limit 3aenriched foods 3afluorescence 3afluorometry 3ahuman health 3ainfant formulas 3amilk 3aolive oil 3aphenols 3atomato juice 0aSequential injection analysis 0aSIA 0aEnriched-food 0aPhenol 0aFlow-through sensor 0aLuminescence 0aQuEChERS 0aAntioxidant 0aFood analysis 0aFood composition1 aJiménez-López, J.1 aCórdova, M.L.

We investigated the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility, resistance mechanisms, molecular epidemiology and genetic support of RMTs in CPE isolates from Spain. This study included a collection of 468 CPE isolates recovered during 2018 from 32 participating Spanish hospitals. MICs were determined using the broth microdilution method, the agar dilution method (fosfomycin) or MIC gradient strips (plazomicin). All isolates were subjected to hybrid whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Sequence types (STs), core genome phylogenetic relatedness, horizontally acquired resistance mechanisms, plasmid analysis and the genetic environment of RMTs were determined in silico from WGS data in all RMT-positive isolates. Among the 468 CPE isolates evaluated, 24 isolates (5.1%) recovered from nine different hospitals spanning five Spanish regions showed resistance to all aminoglycosides and were positive for an RMT (21 RmtF, 2 ArmA and 1 RmtC). All RMT-producers showed high-level resistance to all aminoglycosides, including plazomicin, and in most cases exhibited an extensively drug-resistant susceptibility profile. The RMT-positive isolates showed low genetic diversity and were global clones of Klebsiella pneumoniae (ST147, ST101, ST395) and Enterobacter cloacae (ST93) bearing blaOXA₋₄₈, blaNDM₋₁ or blaVIM₋₁ carbapenemase genes. RMTs were harboured in five different multidrug resistance plasmids and linked to efficient mobile genetic elements. Our findings highlight that RMTs are emerging among clinical CPE isolates from Spain and their spread should be monitored to preserve the future clinical utility of aminoglycosides and plazomicin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aagar 3aaminoglycosides 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeta-lactamase 3acomputer simulation 3afosfomycin 3agenetic variation 3ahybrids 3amethyltransferases 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amolecular epidemiology 3amultiple drug resistance 3aphylogeny 3aplasmids 3aSpain 0aCarbapenemases 0aEnterobacterales1 aRodiño-Janeiro, Bruno K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0633-67741 aPérez, Astrid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1809-33321 aGuijarro-Sánchez, Paula1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8456-00851 aVázquez-Ucha, Juan C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4949-07791 aCruz, Fernando1 aGómez-Garrido, Jèssica1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6409-80091 aAlioto, Tyler S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2960-54201 aÁlvarez-Tejado, Miguel1 aGut, Marta1 aGut, Ivo1 aOviaño, Marina1 aBeceiro, Alejandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6340-78151 aBou, Germán1 aMerino, Irene1 aCercenado, Emilia1 aGómez, Rosa1 aSoler, Tamara1 aGracia-Ahufinger, Irene1 aMartín, Lina1 aGalán, Fátima1 aTormo, Nuria1 aRodríguez, Juan Carlos,1 aCapilla, Silvia1 aMarco, Francesc1 aQuesada, María Dolores1 aPadilla, Emma1 aTubau, Fe1 aGonzález, Juanjo1 aLópez-Calleja, Ana Isabel1 adel Pozo, José Luis1 aGarcía, María Inmaculada1 aMartinez, Mariela1 aCalvo, J.q(Jorge),1 aMulet, Xavier1 aPeña, Fernanda1 aRodríguez, Ana Isabel1 aGude, María José1 aFernández, Ana1 aFernández, Javier,2 aGEMARA-SEIMC/REIPI Enterobacterales Study Groupeauthor0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2022 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.106456-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2021.1064563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245016600161300001200327520149700339592002801836650002501864650002501889650001601914650001701930650001601947650002001963650003201983650002002015650002002035650001102055650000902066650001102075650001702086650001802103700001402121700001302135700001502148773013102163856008202294852000902376655001202385IND60792595920221121225151.0220907e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079259592DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-015-0777-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShuai, Bo10aEffect of Qing’e formula on the in vitro differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells from proximal femurs of postmenopausal osteoporotic mice  ap. 250.  aBACKGROUND: Qing’e formula (QEF), prepared from an ancient Chinese recipe, was previously suggested to regulate bone metabolism and improve bone mineral density in patients with osteoporosis. To study the effects of medicated serum containing QEF on the in vitro differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) isolated from the proximal femurs of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) mice. METHODS: Using an established mouse model of PMOP, mononuclear cells were isolated from the bone marrow present in the proximal femurs and cultured. PMOP mice were also randomly divided into four groups: the untreated group (Group A) and the groups treated with respectively low (Group B), medium (Group C), and high (Group D) concentrations of QEF. Serum was isolated from each and used to treat the cultured BMSCs in conjunction with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). Cell morphology, proliferation rates, intracellular alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) mRNA expression were evaluated. RESULTS: QEF-treated serum, particularly that containing moderate and high concentrations, appears to enhance the rhBMP-2-mediated changes in cell morphology, proliferation, and differentiation (determined via the expression of TGF-β1 mRNA and ALP activity) observed in the BMSCs isolated from PMOP mice. CONCLUSIONS: QEF may play a role in the prevention and treatment of PMOP by enhancing the activity of rhBMP-2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aalternative medicine 3ablood serum 3abone density 3abone marrow 3abone metabolism 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3acell structures 3agene expression 3ahumans 3amice 3amodels 3aosteoporosis 3apostmenopause1 aShen, Lin1 aZhu, Rui1 aZhou, Piqi0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.250-250dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-015-0777-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03891naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245006600174300001600240520189300256592002802149650002302177650001802200650001102218650002402229650002202253650001102275650001202286650001402298650001802312650001602330650001302346650002102359650001502380650001502395650001102410650001802421650001302439650000902452650001702461650001702478650002102495653000902516653000802525653000902533653000902542653000702551653001002558653000902568653000702577653000802584653000802592653000702600653000902607653000702616653000902623653000802632653000802640653001702648653001402665653002502679653002602704653002302730653002302753700002602776700002502802700002002827700002902847700001702876773010902893856008603002852000903088655001203097IND60591016220221118155208.0190319e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059101622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2017.12.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRallo, L.q(Luis),10aQuality of olives: A focus on agricultural preharvest factors  ap. 491-509.  aMore than 11 million ha of olives (Olea europaea L.) are currently grown worldwide, 98% of which are localized in the Mediterranean Basin, with olives being one of the most important fruit trees in the area. The olive fruit is a very particular drupe since it not may be directly consumed but must instead be processed. Table olives and virgin olive oil are the two main processed products derived from olive fruits. Both are considered staple foods of the Mediterranean Diet and have been produced in the area for centuries, presumably since olive domestication occurred approximately 6.000 years ago. Despite their long history and economic importance, the focus on quality is quite recent. The presence of various and copious amounts of bioactive compounds, some of which are exclusive to olives, is drawing attention to the nutraceutical value of these products. This review aims to integrate the available information regarding the quality of table olives and olive oil with a focus on how preharvest factors may affect quality. The first part of the review describes the main quality attributes considered for each product from different perspectives, including the legal, organoleptic and nutritional points of view, among others. The physiological mechanisms involved in fruit development and ripening, which significantly affect the quality of the fruits, i.e., the raw material for obtaining both products, are also discussed. The review also addresses the potential of both the considerable number of traditional olive cultivars and recent olive breeding programs to obtain products with distinct quality attributes (in terms of sensorial profile and bioactive compounds). Finally, the most recent literature concerning the effect of environmental (soil and climate) and agronomical factors (irrigation, fertilization, canopy management and harvesting) is extensively reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3aOlea europaea 3abasins 3abioactive compounds 3abreeding programs 3acanopy 3aclimate 3acultivars 3adomestication 3afruit trees 3afruiting 3afunctional foods 3aharvesting 3airrigation 3aolives 3araw materials 3aripening 3asoil 3astaple foods 3astone fruits 3avirgin olive oil 0aDAFB 0aEEC 0aEFSA 0aEVOO 0aFA 0aFAEEs 0aFATH 0aFR 0aIOC 0aLDL 0aMI 0aMUFA 0aPL 0aPUFA 0aRDI 0aVOO 0aTable olives 0aOlive oil 0aOrganoleptic quality 0aNutraceutical quality 0aVolatile compounds 0aPhenolic compounds1 aDíez, Concepción M.1 aMorales-Sillero, Ana1 aMiho, Hristofor1 aPriego-Capote, Feliciano1 aRallo, Pilar0 tScientia horticulturae.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 233 p.491-509dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2017.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011300168300001600281520120100297592002801498650003401526650002601560650001701586650002101603650001401624650001401638650001301652650003201665650001601697650002101713650001301734650001301747653002001760653000801780700001301788700001501801700001601816700001501832773013501847856008701982852000902069655001202078IND60750860620221120154435.0211009e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075086062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.09.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaojun10aChemical elucidation of an arabinogalactan from rhizome of Polygonatum sibiricum with antioxidant activities  ap. 730-738.  aPolygonatum sibiricum is traditionally used as Chinese medicine for immunity enhancement. Exploration of polysaccharides from Polygonatum species would provide a wider insight into the studies on their chemical structures and function activities. In this study, the alkali-extracted polysaccharide from P. sibiricum (PSP) was isolated and examined. The polysaccharide was firstly isolated by ion-exchange chromatography equipped with DE52 column, followed by isolated through Superdex-200 column. The obtained PSPJWA fraction was a homogenous one with average molecular weight of 141 kDa. The monosaccharide composition was galactose, arabinose and rhamnose in a ratio of 14:4:1. The glycosidic linkages of PSPJWA fraction were indicated to be Araf-(1→, →5)-Araf-(1→, →3,5)-Araf-(1→, Galp-(1→, →4)-Galp-(1→, →4,6)-Galp-(1→ and →2,4)-Rhap-(1→ residue by methylation analysis. NMR and enzymatic studies showed that PSPJWA was a novel arabinogalactan-type structure. PSPJW polysaccharides with different molecular weight and similar chemical structure had different antioxidant activities. Together, P. sibiricum polysaccharide has the potential to be a natural antioxidant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPolygonatum sibiricum 3aantioxidants 3aarabinogalactans 3aarabinose 3agalactose 3aimmunity 3aion exchange chromatography 3amethylation 3amolecular weight 3arhamnose 3arhizomes 0aArabinogalactan 0aNMR1 aChen, Qi1 aLiu, Guoku1 aXu, Hairong1 aZhang, Xue0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 190 p.730-738dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.09.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245006100172300001600233500002000249520116900269592002801438650002101466650002201487650001401509650001501523650001401538650001301552650002601565650001601591650001901607650001201626650002501638650002101663650001901684650001201703650001801715700002301733773011801756852000901874856009101883655001201974IND2058330620221116233720.0210417e199604  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205833062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1996.tb01873.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHALL, LISA N.10aMolecular genetics of cellular differentiation in leaves  ap. 533-553.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLeaves of green plants vary widely in morphology. However, the underlying cell types and structures observed in leaves of different species are remarkably similar. Although we can adequately describe leaf development in morphological terms we cannot yet explain interactions at the cellular level. In recent years molecular genetics has been used extensively to address a variety of developmental questions. The isolation of a wide variety of mutants disrupted in numerous aspects of leaf ontogeny has led to the cloning of genes involved in various developmental processes. In this review we consider advances that have been made in understanding shoot apical meristem organization, leaf initiation and the development of leaf form. In particular we concentrate on progress, that has been made in understanding cellular differentiation in the epidermis, and within the interior of the leaf, namely the photosynthetic cells and the vasculature.

Soil pH has increased from tillage operations and vertical movement of carbonates from underlying limestone bedrock through evapotranspiration and seepage irrigation. This study was conducted to determine sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) yield response to banded elemental sulfur (S) (granular 90% S and granular 80% S with 5% manganese (Mn)) in soils with unamended pH ranging from 6.5 to 7.2. Four field experiments were established as small-plots on Histosols in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). Each experiment was a randomized complete block design with six replications and elemental S rates of 0, 90, 224, and 448 kg S ha⁻¹.

Our system uses electromagnetic energy from a modulated manmade source to interrogate the underlying resistivity structure of the seafloor. We used this system in the summers of 2014 and 2015 to map subsea ice‐bearing permafrost on the Beaufort shelf along 200 km of coastline, from Tigvariak Island to Harrison Bay. Permafrost is resistive and was found to be anisotropic, likely due to interbedded layers of frozen and unfrozen sediment. Maps of depth to permafrost and its thickness were produced from electrical resistivity inversions and results compared to borehole logs in the area. We observed elevated resistivity values offshore the Sagavanirktok River outflow, supporting the idea that fresh groundwater flow has a preserving effect on submerged permafrost. This system provides a cost effective method that could be used to further quantify permafrost extent, provide a baseline for measurements of future degradation, and provide observational constraints to aid in permafrost modeling studies.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE-FE0010144cU.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 3aanisotropy 3acoasts 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrical resistance 3aenergy 3ageophysics 3agroundwater flow 3apermafrost 3aresearch 3arivers 3asediments1 aConstable, S.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6324-34700 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Sept., v. 123, no. 9 p.7253-7265dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JB0158593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245013700173300001600310520150000326592002801826650001101854650001901865650002301884650001201907650002201919650002001941650001101961650001801972650002801990650001602018650001802034650001902052651001102071653001702082653002302099653001902122653001802141653001502159653001502174700002702189700001902216700002002235700002102255773011902276856008802395852000902483655001202492IND60644135420221121164554.0190801e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064413542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Paula10aCan forests buffer negative impacts of land-use and climate changes on water ecosystem services? The case of a Brazilian megalopolis  ap. 248-258.  aWhile the role of land-use conversion on water quality is reasonably understood, its role on water quantity is controversial. Climate change is also expected to impact water availability. Here we explore the interplay of hydrology, land-use change and climate change in one of the most populous urban areas in the world. We examined the potential of forests to buffer the negative impacts of land-use and climate changes on water-related ecosystem services in Tietê Basin, Brazil, which supplies water to the São Paulo megalopolis. We modelled six hydrological parameters using the WaterWorld Policy Support System, simulating the current baseline and six future scenarios (with different land-use and climate changes). Our results corroborate the general trend that increased forest cover improves water quality. Our modelling also predicts that increased forest cover increases water quantity in the southern part of the basin. The effects of climate change are observed mainly in urban areas, with a reduction in water quality. Because urban areas are not eligible for reforestation, they cannot benefit from its buffering effect on climate change. The increase in water availability is the greatest benefit of reforestation as a strategy to improve water-related ecosystem services in the region. Reforestation, however, will not suffice to restore all hydrological parameters in the basin, and additional sustainable agricultural practices are needed to mitigate impacts on water quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3amodels 3areforestation 3asustainable agriculture 3aurban areas 3awater quality 3awater quantity 3aBrazil 0aForest cover 0aScenario modelling 0aWater quantity 0aWater quality 0aLand cover 0aSão Paulo1 avan Soesbergen, Arnout1 aMulligan, Mark1 aFreitas, Marcos1 aVale, Mariana M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 685 p.248-258dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245012800209300001800337500001900355520184400374592002802218650002002246650002002266650002002286650000702306650002402313653001902337653002802356653005902384653003702443653003702480700002102517700002202538700001802560700002802578700002302606700002202629700006102651700006102712773014402773856008502917852000903002655001203011IND60736148720210903000000.0210503e20210422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073614872DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c073672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemaoui, Tarek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9634-713410aMolecular-Based Guide to Predict the pH of Eutectic Solvents: Promoting an Efficient Design Approach for New Green Solvents  ap. 5783-5808.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe case of sustainable solvents is of great interest both academically and industrially. With research communities becoming more aware of the negative impacts of conventional organic solvents, a range of greener and more sustainable solvents have been developed to counter the harmful drawbacks associated with conventional solvents. Among these, eutectic solvents (ESs) attracted considerable attention for their “green” properties and have proven their usefulness as environmentally benign alternatives to classical solvents. Among the various desirable characteristics of ESs, pH is a key property with significant implications for the design and control of industrial-scale applications. However, selecting an ES with the required pH for a particular application is a challenging task, especially with extensive experimentally determined data being time consuming and expensive. Therefore, in this work, the pH of various ESs have been predicted via novel quantitative structure–property relationships (QSPR) models using two machine learning algorithms, a multiple linear regression (MLR) and an artificial neural network (ANN), with a set of molecular descriptors generated by COSMO-RS. A total of 648 experimental points for 41 chemically unique ESs prepared from 9 HBAs and 21 HBDs at different temperatures were utilized for sufficient data set representation. On the basis of the statistical analysis of the models, it can be concluded that both approaches can be utilized as powerful predictive tools in estimating the pH of new ESs with the ANN model having better predictive capabilities and the MLR model being more interpretable. These models inspire and stimulate the development of robust models to predict the properties of designer solvents from the drawn molecular structures, which will save time and resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3agreen chemistry 3aneural networks 3apH 3aregression analysis 0aGreen solvents 0aEutectic solvents (ESs) 0aQuantitative structure−property relationships (QSPR) 0aMultiple linear regression (MLR) 0aArtificial neural networks (ANN)1 aAbu Hatab, Farah1 aDarwish, Ahmad S.1 aAttoui, Ayoub1 aHammoudi, Nour El Houda1 aAlmustafa, Ghaiath1 aBenaicha, Mohamed1 aBenguerba, Yacine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8251-97241 aAlnashef, Inas M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4654-29320 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Apr. 22, v. 9, no. 17 p.5783-5808dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c073673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012300169520216200292592002802454650002102482650001902503650001102522650001102533650001602544650002002560650001602580653003102596653002602627653003702653653003202690653002202722700001402744700001602758700001802774700002102792773009002813856008502903852000902988655001202997IND60776065620221116194805.0220606e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077606562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1241252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huidong10aInvestigation on the fluctuation characteristics and its influence on impact force of supercritical carbon dioxide jet  aSupercritical carbon dioxide (CO₂) jet-assisted drilling is considered a promising technology in unconventional natural gas drilling engineering. The flow field characteristics of the supercritical CO₂ jet are the critical factors that affect the erosion performance of the jet. The relation between the flow fluctuation characteristics and the jet is required further investigation to enhance its erosion performance. In this study, the fluctuation features of a supercritical CO₂ jet were simulated based on a modified real gas model. Subsequently, impact force tests were conducted using an I-Scan flexible array pressure sensor to obtain peak pressures at different standoff distances. The results indicated that the flow field structure of the supercritical CO₂ jet exhibits typical compressible wave-like features, which can be accurately determined by the expansion ratio. The expansion ratio was mainly affected by the inlet pressure, inlet temperature, and ambient pressure. The static pressure, temperature, and velocity distributions of a free jet could be significantly influenced by the fluctuation characteristics. Among them, the static pressure and temperature trend decrease in the expansion waves and increase in the compression waves, while the velocity shows a contrary variation trend. When the jet was under-expansion, the lengths of the wave node and jet potential core increased with increasing inlet pressure and decreased with increasing inlet temperature and ambient pressure. Moreover, the fluctuation characteristics of the flow field significantly affected the peak impact force of the supercritical CO₂ jet. The peak impact force at the compression wave positions tended to be higher than that at the adjacent expansion wave positions. The maximum pressure difference of jet impact was 7.39 MPa in this study, which occurred when the standoff distance was 23.0 and 17.3 mm and accounts for 18.6% of the impact pressure at 23.0 mm. A plate shock wave was observed ahead of the target when the standoff distance was larger than 23.0 mm, which accounted for the abrupt decrease in pressure at the stagnation region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient pressure 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3amodels 3anatural gas 3astatic pressure 3atemperature 0aUnconventional natural gas 0aJet-assisted drilling 0aSupercritical carbon dioxide jet 0aFluctuation characteristics 0aPeak impact force1 aLiu, Yong1 aTang, Jiren1 aLiu, Wenchuan1 aChen, Changjiang0 tEnergy.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 253 p.124125-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1241253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014600173520145300319536009901772592002801871596001301899650001501912650001701927650002901944650000901973650002101982650001402003650002302017650001502040650002002055653002902075653000902104653002502113653002002138653001902158700002202177700002702199773013302226856008602359852000902445655001202454IND60688583320221123020509.0220310e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068858332DNAL7 a10.1080/15230430.2018.14368152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFowler, Rachel A.10aShifting DOC concentration and quality in the freshwater lakes of the Kangerlussuaq region: An experimental assessment of possible mechanisms  aSince 2003, concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in lakes in the Kangerlussuaq region declined by 14–55 percent, with these decreasing DOC concentrations potentially altering lake ecology and reflecting changes in regional carbon (C) cycling. To evaluate possible mechanisms responsible for this shift, we performed experiments to test the effects of dust addition, bacterial activity, or photodegradation on DOC concentration and two DOC quality metrics: the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA₂₅₄) and the chromophoric DOC spectral slope coefficient (S₂₇₅–₂₉₅). Lake-water DOC concentrations did not decline in any treatments, but there were changes in DOC quality. Dust addition increased SUVA₂₅₄ and decreased the magnitude of S₂₇₅–₂₉₅ in one lake, the impacts of bacterial activity were variable, and sunlight exposure elicited a decline in SUVA₂₅₄ and an increase in the magnitude of S₂₇₅–₂₉₅ in all lakes. These results suggest that DOC pools in the study lakes are photoreactive, even though the lakes are characterized by long residence times, but that declining DOC concentration did not result from this mechanism. While the tested mechanisms did not explain the decline in DOC concentration observed in recent years, they did yield new information about how dust, bacterial activity, or light can influence DOC quality in the lakes of the Kangerlussuaq region.  aThis research was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation Grants #1144423 and #1203434.  aPublisher supplied data  a#1144423 3aabsorbance 3acarbon cycle 3adissolved organic carbon 3adust 3afreshwater lakes 3alimnology 3amicrobial activity 3aphotolysis 3asolar radiation 0aDissolved organic carbon 0adust 0abacterial processing 0aphotoreactivity 0alake C cycling1 aSaros, Jasmine E.1 aOsburn, Christopher L.0 tArctic, antarctic, and alpine research.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 50, no. 1 p.S100013-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12076x1938-42467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2018.14368153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03347naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245012500163300001500288500001500303520177100318592002802089650002202117650001802139650001802157650001502175650001402190650001302204650002102217650002602238650001302264650001202277650000702289650001902296650003102315650001602346650001502362650002102377650001602398650001502414650002102429651001302450653001402463653002602477653002002503653002602523700002002549700002202569773012702591856007802718852000902796655001202805IND60130788620221121031613.0151127s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013078862DNAL7 a10.1660/062.116.03012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowles, David E.10aAquatic Invertebrate Community Trends and Water Quality at Homestead National Monument of America, Nebraska, 1996–2012  ap. 97-112.  a2019-12-04  aTo address concerns about water quality in Cub Creek, Homestead National Monument of America (HOME), Nebraska, the National Park Service began monitoring aquatic invertebrates annually beginning in 1996. Invertebrates were collected using Hester-Dendy multiplate samplers placed at two sampling sites on Cub Creek. Water quality parameters measured in the creek included temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, pH, turbidity, nitrate-nitrogen, total phosphorus, and fecal coliform bacteria (Escherichia coli). Most water quality measurements met state standards and were generally consistent and typical for streams of this size in the region, but phosphorus concentrations, turbidity, and fecal coliform bacteria levels greatly exceeded acceptable levels. Similarly, summary data for invertebrate community metrics, including low taxa richness, diversity and evenness, low Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) richness, and high Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI) suggest that Cub Creek is not fully biologically supporting. However, invertebrate metrics generally did not exceed control chart limits based on historical data collected from 1996–2004, showing that since 2005 the metrics have not deviated significantly from their historical baseline. Additionally, Mann-Kendall trend test for each metric for the period 1996–2012 did not show significant trends (P ≥0.05) thus further indicating that stream integrity has not diminished beyond that when monitoring first began. Impacts to water quality in Cub Creek originate upstream of the monument boundaries, making mitigation difficult. Protecting and managing in-stream habitat and riparian zone integrity will aid in maintaining the integrity of Cub Creek flowing through the monument.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoliform bacteria 3aEphemeroptera 3awater quality 3amonitoring 3aturbidity 3asamplers 3anitrate nitrogen 3aaquatic invertebrates 3ahabitats 3astreams 3apH 3ariparian areas 3aU.S. National Park Service 3atemperature 3aphosphorus 3adissolved oxygen 3aTrichoptera 3aPlecoptera 3aEscherichia coli 3aNebraska 0aCub Creek 0aAquatic invertebrates 0aprairie streams 0aNational Park Service1 aBolli, Jesse M.1 aClark, Myranda K.0 tTransactions of the Kansas Academy of Science.g2013, v. 116, no. 3-4 p.97-112dKansas Academy of Sciencex0022-84437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1660%2F062.116.03013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03985naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245012800177300001600305520212700321592002802448650002102476650002502497650001502522650002502537650001702562650001502579650001302594650001502607650001402622650002002636650001502656650001802671650001302689650002302702650001202725650002402737650001502761650001902776650001902795650001402814650002502828650002202853650001502875650002602890651001002916653001502926653002102941653001702962653001702979653001902996700002903015700002203044700001903066700002103085700003703106773010903143856008603252852000903338655001203347IND60591016620221118154801.0190319e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059101662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2018.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHelaly, Mohamed Naser10aImpact of treated wastewater and salicylic acid on physiological performance, malformation and yield of two mango cultivars  ap. 159-177.  aLimitation of fresh water for agriculture irrigation is a worldwide problem, especially in countries located in the arid region like Egypt. This work demonstrates the impact of treated wastewater on two mango cultivars, cv. “Keitt” and cv. “Ewais”. Treated wastewater contains comparatively more contaminant than fresh water, therefore salicylic acid (SA) was added to the treated wastewater to study their combined impact on mango cultivars. Observation indicated that both cultivars positively responded to treated wastewater and/or SA in a similar manner regarding growth, yield and fruit quality parameters. Obtained data revealed that treated wastewater and/or SA promoted vegetative growth and exhibited inhibitory role on the occurrence of malformation and fruitlet abscission. Studied biochemical features related to lipid peroxidation and oxidative system were differently affected. Cultivar “Keitt” had higher activity of catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. as compared to cv. “Ewais”. In the resistant cv. “Keitt” the constitutive level of lipid peroxidation was lower, but the activity of enzymatic antioxidants and non-enzymatic antioxidants was higher than the susceptible cultivar “Ewais”. Similarly, Nitrogen metabolism enzymes and photosynthetic performance were inherently higher in cv. “Keitt”. The comparative analysis between the two mango cultivars, based on malformation percentage analysis, indicated that cv. “Keitt” can be categorized into the tolerant group (1–10%), whereas cv. “Ewais” into susceptible ones (20–40%). Our results suggested that cv. “Keitt” possess better protection mechanisms against oxidative damage as compared to the relatively susceptible cultivar “Ewais”. It is based on maintaining higher inherited and increased activity of the antioxidant system. Our work underlines the relation between malformation tolerance and antioxidant defence system. In this work, we suggest the performance of antioxidant defence system as a potential biochemical indicator for screening mango genotypes for malformation behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMangifera indica 3aabnormal development 3aabscission 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aarid zones 3acatalase 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3afreshwater 3afruit quality 3agenotype 3alipid peroxidation 3amangoes 3anitrogen metabolism 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3asalicylic acid 3ascreening 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avegetative growth 3awastewater 3awastewater irrigation 3aEgypt 0aWastewater 0aMangifera indica 0aMalformation 0aAntioxidants 0aSalicylic acid1 aEl-Sheery, Nabil Ibrahim1 aEl-Hoseiny, Hanan1 aRastogi, Anshu1 aKalaji, Hazem M.1 aZabochnicka-Świątek, Magdalena0 tScientia horticulturae.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 233 p.159-177dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012200166300001800288500001900306520124200325592002801567650002001595650001101615650001901626650001501645650002001660650001701680650001101697650001701708653002001725653002601745653002101771653001901792653003001811700005601841700001601897700001901913700001401932700005401946773014402000856008502144852000902229655001202238IND60736148920221120041516.0210503e20210409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073614892DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c082102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPu, Chenlu10aHierarchical Dendritic Mesoporous TiO₂ Nanocomposites for Highly Selective Enrichment of Endogenous Phosphopeptides  ap. 5818-5826.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe uniform growth of metal oxides into mesoporous nanostructures with controllable orientations is challenging but of significance. Here, a polydopamine (PDA)-induced oriented growth strategy is proposed to uniformly grow metal ions into mesoporous metal oxides with controllable orientation. Two mesoporous nanostructures (3D hierarchical dendritic nanostructures and 2D nanosheets) were constructed by this strategy. It is worth emphasizing that the 3D hierarchical mesoporous nanostructures (DMSNs@TiO₂) are formed by constructing single-layered porous TiO₂ in dendritic mesoporous tunnels, which is different from the previously reported generation of hierarchical pores inside frameworks or accumulation of various channels. In such a pore system, small pores are connected by large pores, thereby enhancing the accessibility of pores. DMSNs@TiO₂ with a large surface area and connected hierarchical pore structure exhibit highly improved phosphopeptide enrichment performance compared with commercial TiO₂ and single-pored TiO₂. Especially for real samples such as human saliva, DMSNs@TiO₂ captured 49 endogenous phosphopeptides from 1 μL of saliva, demonstrating their broad prospects in phosphopeptidomics analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreen chemistry 3ahumans 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3aphosphopeptides 3aporous media 3asaliva 3asurface area 0aoriented growth 0ahierarchically porous 0atitanium dioxide 0ananostructures 0aphosphopeptide enrichment1 aZhao, Hongli1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5935-84511 aHong, Yayun1 aWang, Zhenxing1 aZheng, Yu1 aLan, Minbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4247-00060 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Apr. 09, v. 9, no. 17 p.5818-5826dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c082103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013600170300001400306520154300320592002801863650002501891650002201916650002001938650001301958650002401971650002401995650002602019650001002045650004302055650003702098650005202135650001302187650001502200650002902215650002202244653002502266653001302291653004902304653001302353653003102366700006002397700001702457773011902474856008502593852000902678655001202687IND60597932620221119044012.0200117e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059793262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2018.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hang-Tang10aNicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit α6 associated with spinosad resistance in Rhyzopertha dominica (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae)  ap. 68-73.  aThe lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica, which is a primary pest of stored products, breaks up whole grains and makes them susceptible to secondary infestation by other pests. Insecticide application is the main control measure against this borer. A resistant strain of R. dominica against the insecticide, spinosad, was selected in the laboratory. The full-length cDNA of the target site of spinosad, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit α6, from R. dominica (Rdα6) was cloned and analyzed using reverse transcription PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The complete 2133-bp cDNA contains the open reading frame of 1497 bp encoding a 498-amino-acid protein. There are four predicted transmembrane (TM) regions, and six extracellular ligand-binding sites at the N-terminus, upstream from the first TM in Rdα6. Three mutations have been found in the resistant strain compared with the susceptible one: (1) a 181-bp fragment truncated at the N-terminus, resulting in the appearance of a premature stop codon, (2) one missing bp at the position 997, causing a frame-shift mutation, and (3) an 87-bp fragment truncated in the TM2 region. In addition, real-time quantitative PCR was applied to detect the transcriptional expression of Rdα6 in both the susceptible and resistant strains. The results indicated that the expression of Rdα6 was significantly lower in then resistant strain than in susceptible one. In conclusion, mutation of Rdα6 may cause R. dominica resistant to spinosad due to target site insensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3acomplementary DNA 3acontrol methods 3amutation 3anicotinic receptors 3aopen reading frames 3apesticide application 3apests 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspinosad 3astop codon 3atranscription (genetics) 3awhole grain foods 0aRhyzopertha dominica 0aSpinosad 0aNicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit α6 0aMutation 0aTranscriptional expression1 aTsai, Cheng-Lung1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4319-686X1 aChen, Mei-Er0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2018 June, v. 148 p.68-73dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2018.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008000161300001600241520148800257592002801745650001301773650001901786650000801805650002601813650001201839650001601851650001501867650001001882650001001892650001501902650001601917650001201933650002101945650001101966650001401977650002001991650002502011650001602036650002002052650002402072650001702096700002102113773011802134856007302252852000902325655001202334IND60435934120221118071030.0151020e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043593412DNAL7 a10.1111/afe.121162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraziosi, Ignazio12aA plant pathogen causes extensive mortality in an invasive insect herbivore  ap. 366-374.  aWe investigate a plant–microbe–insect interaction where a plant pathogenic microorganism is utilizing an invasive insect herbivore as an alternate resource, and test the hypothesis that the microorganism is affecting the population dynamics of the herbivore on its woody host plant. We investigated the presence of necrotic lesions formed by an unknown microbe on galls induced by the Asian chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae), a global pest on Castanea hosts. We hypothesize that colonization by this plant‐associated microbe impacts survival and invasiveness of the gallmaker and, using Koch's postulates, we evaluate its effects on the gallmaker and on the gallmaker's primary natural enemy. Morphologically identical colonies were isolated from galls and insects, and DNA sequences matched with the fungal genus Colletotrichum, a causal agent of plant‐pathogenic anthracnose. Inoculations generated comparable symptoms. After the formation of superficial lesions, the pathogen rapidly penetrates galls, colonizing insect tissue in gall chambers and causing extensive larval mortality. Minimal effects were evident on the associated parasitoid Torymus sinensis Kamijo (Hymenoptera: Torymidae). We report a plant pathogen utilizing a gall‐inducing arthropod at the same time as sparing its parasite and expand reports of Colletotrichum impacting insects. We shed light on a complex of interactions influencing an important invader.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea 3aColletotrichum 3aDNA 3aDryocosmus kuriphilus 3aTorymus 3aanthracnose 3aarthropods 3afungi 3agalls 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3ainsects 3ainvasive species 3alarvae 3amortality 3anatural enemies 3anucleotide sequences 3aparasitoids 3aplant pathogens 3apopulation dynamics 3awoody plants1 aRieske, Lynne K.0 tAgricultural and forest entomology.g2015 Nov., v. 17, no. 4 p.366-374dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-95557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/afe.121163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245010100177300001600278520202600294592002802320650001302348650001802361650001002379650001502389650002502404650002102429650002102450650002002471650002102491650001702512650002502529651001402554653002302568653002902591653001402620653002602634653001802660653001602678700002302694700006302717773012002780856008802900852000902988655001202997IND60644136020221121222930.0190628e20190910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064413602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomano-Armada, Neli10aConstruction of a combined soil quality indicator to assess the effect of glyphosate application  ap. 639-649.  aAlthough the use of agrochemicals allowed increasing the crops productivity, in many cases led to soil deterioration. In this study, eight composite samples from different soils of two locations (San Martín and Anta) in Salta, Argentina, were collected and analyzed. All the samples were from loamy Entisols (0–20 cm depth) under reduced tillage without and with direct spray application of glyphosate. Twenty six variables were determined (physical, chemical, and biological soil quality indicators). From them, those of higher specificity and sensitivity to changes following glyphosate application were identified by a stepwise reduction of variables aided by statistical analysis. Samples were grouped regarding location and application of glyphosate, to identify differential effects upon variables, and glyphosate sensitive variables were selected by discarding those influenced by other factors. Thence, they were used to compose a first approximation to a combined soil quality indicator (CSQI) to assess the effect of glyphosate use in agriculture upon the soil. Overall, the set of physical variables showed the same discriminating structure as the biological set. Finally, two biological, two chemical, and two physical indicators resulted as the most specific to quality variations by the application of the herbicide, being the most sensitive the microbial biomass carbon and the (Aminomethyl)phosphonic acid concentration in soil. When these two were considered into a CSQI, it was possible to discriminate samples with the application of glyphosate (lower quality) from those without application (higher quality). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose a CSQI that could play an important role to prevent degradation in soils subjected to glyphosate application, as it could aid in the early detection of soil quality loss. This would provide to land managers a decision tool to let the land rest from glyphosate application, to ensure sustainable practices in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEntisols 3aagrochemicals 3acrops 3aglyphosate 3aherbicide resistance 3amicrobial carbon 3aphosphorous acid 3areduced tillage 3asoil degradation 3asoil quality 3astatistical analysis 3aArgentina 0aAMPA concentration 0aMicrobial biomass carbon 0aHerbicide 0aMultivariate analysis 0aDecision tool 0aAgriculture1 aAmoroso, María J.1 aRajal, Verónica B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2290-89200 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Sept. 10, v. 682 p.639-649dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245007300172300001800245520122500263592002801488650001301516650001401529650001801543650001801561650001601579650000901595650001701604650001201621700002301633700002501656700002601681700002101707700002601728700001901754700002901773773010601802856008101908852000901989655001201998IND60121060620221120213614.0150214e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012106062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8145-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerthuy, Ophélie I.10aMaterial surface engineering for multiplex cell culture in microwell  ap. 4481-4489.  aIn this study, we develop a new concept for multiplexed and localized cell co-culture. This cell chip consists of a polystyrene spin-coated solid support bearing gold-bottomed microwells. The cell-chip support is fabricated as follows: (i) electrosputtering of a thin layer of gold (40 nm) onto a polycarbonate substrate, (ii) spin coating of a polystyrene thin film (500 ± 50 nm) over the gold layer, followed by (iii) polystyrene etching through the spotting of toluene nanovolume (300–900 pL). In each gold-bottomed microwell, a small population of adherent cells (approx. 100 cells) can be cultured. In this miniaturized system, different cell lines can be co-cultured on a 1-cm²surface, opening the way to multiplexed cell-chip development. In order to keep the cells in a properly hydrated environment and to physically retain them before they adhere, a biocompatible alginate polymer was used during the robotized micropipetting. This approach allows for the encapsulation of the cell in a very small volume (50 nL), directly in the microwells. After 24 h of culture, the cells adhered on the gold bottom of the microwells, and the alginate matrix was removed by addition of calcium-free culture medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acoculture 3aculture media 3aencapsulation 3aengineering 3agold 3apolystyrenes 3atoluene1 aMandon, Céline A.1 aCorgier, Benjamin P.1 aOctobre, Guillaume G.1 aCeccone, Giacomo1 aSpampinato, Valentina1 aBlum, Loïc J.1 aMarquette, Christophe A.0 tJournal of materials science.g2014 July, v. 49, no. 13 p.4481-4489dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-014-8145-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014200171300001600313520125100329592002801580650002501608650001201633650001001645650000901655650001901664650000701683650001801690650001301708650001101721650002501732650003401757650001601791653001701807653002101824653001501845653001901860653001601879700001901895700002101914773013501935856008702070852000902157655001202166IND60750861320221119052438.0211213e20211130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075086132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.09.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaghdi, Shahab12aA starch-based pH-sensing and ammonia detector film containing betacyanin of paperflower for application in intelligent packaging of fish  ap. 161-170.  aAn easy-to-use food packaging label with pH and ammonia sensitivity was developed by adding betacyanin (5, 10 and 15 mg per g of starch) from flowers of paperflower (Bougainvillea glabra) to potato starch film made using the solvent casting method. The betacyanin was well dispersed into the starch matrix and formed new interactions with it as revealed by FTIR. The film containing 15 mg/g of betacyanin showed a color change from light pink to yellow as a response to pH adjustment of between 2 to 13. It was also able to detect the presence of ammonia in a range of 0.1 and 0.01 mg of ammonia per ml of water. Surface hydrophobicity and water vapor barrier capacity of the starch film increased by addition of the betacyanin, yet their mechanical strength decreased in the presence of the betacyanin. The ability of the film in the real-time indication of fish quality as a label was also evaluated during the storage of Caspian sprat at 4 °C. A visual change in the color of the packaging label from pink to yellow in parallel with the increase in the total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), microbial count of the fish samples was detected. The starch/betacyanin film could be a novel intelligent label for application in food packaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBougainvillea glabra 3aammonia 3acolor 3afish 3ahydrophobicity 3apH 3apotato starch 3asolvents 3astarch 3astrength (mechanics) 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 3awater vapor 0apH indicator 0aAmmonia detector 0aBetacyanin 0aFish freshness 0aEdible film1 aRezaei, Masoud1 aAbdollahi, Mehdi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Nov. 30, v. 191 p.161-170dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.09.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012600168300001400294520177900308592002802087650002702115650001302142650001402155650001602169650001602185650001302201650001502214650001202229650001002241650001302251650001102264700001502275700001402290700001602304700001602320700001902336700001502355700001602370773008402386856008102470852000902551655001202560IND60121060820221120221922.0150214e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012106082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-002-0343-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitkänen, H.

The subjects performed a strength exercise session (SES; n = 16; 26 ± 4 years) or a maximal anaerobic running exercise session (MARE; n = 12; 27 ± 5 years) until exhaustion twice at a 7-day interval. The randomized subjects consumed drinks containing leucine (100 mg × kg/body weight before and during SES or 200 mg × kg/body weight before MARE) or placebo. Blood specimens taken 10 min before (B) and after (A) the sessions were analyzed for serum amino acids. In SES the concentration of leucine was distinctly higher in the leucine supplemented group than in the placebo group in both B (p < 0.001) and A (p < 0.001) samples. The leucine concentration decreased in placebo but not in the leucine supplemented group following the exercise session. Isoleucine (p = 0.017) and valine (p = 0.006) concentration decreased more in the leucine supplemented group than in placebo in A samples. In MARE the concentration of leucine was higher in the leucine supplemented group than in placebo in both B (p < 0.001) and A (p < 0.001) samples and increased (p < 0.001) in the supplemented group following the session. Isoleucine (p = 0.020) and valine (p = 0.006) concentration decreased in the supplemented group in A samples. There were no differences in a counter movement jump after SES or in the running performance in MARE between the leucine supplemented group and placebo. These findings indicate that consuming leucine before or before and during exercise sessions results in changes in blood amino acid concentration. However, the supplementation does not affect an acute physical performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid composition 3aathletes 3abeverages 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3aexercise 3aisoleucine 3aleucine 3amales 3aplacebos 3avaline1 aOja, S.

Structural analysis revealed that CLC increased the degree of conjugation of the polymers in the composites and also led to the formation of the fibrous and sheet structure of the composite. The results of the electrochemical performance measurements revealed that the electrode modified by PEDOT-MeNH₂/CLC and PEDOT-MeSH/CLC had detection limits (S/N = 3) of 0.38(0.1–380 μM) and 0.042(0.02–520 μM) for the detection of guanine (G), while for the detection of uric acid (UA), the corresponding detection limits (S/N = 3) were 0.255(5–400 μM) and 0.085(0.4–650 μM). The PEDOT-MeSH/CLC-based electrochemical sensor also possessed a wide linear response with the detection limits of 0.077(0.6–620 μM) and 0.144(0.2–460 μM) for the simultaneous detection of UA and G, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood 3acarboxylation 3acellulose 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agreen chemistry 3aguanine 3apolymerization 3auric acid 0acarboxylated cellulose 0aPEDOT-MeSH 0aPEDOT-MeNH2 0a[BMIM]Cl (ionic liquid)1 aJamal, Ruxangul1 aAbdiryim, Tursun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3828-79861 aSimayi, Rena1 aLiu, Lielie1 aLiu, Yajun0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Apr. 22, v. 9, no. 17 p.5860-5871dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c092593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245016500169300001400334520177900348592002802127650002302155650001502178650002402193650001102217650002902228650001702257650001002274650001102284650001502295650001902310650001302329650001702342650001802359650002202377650001502399651001202414700001902426700002402445773009302469856004802562852000902610655001202619IND4486065720221122041846.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448606572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10498-011-9147-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMueller, Kristin K.10aSpatial Variation in the Optical Properties of Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) in Lakes on the Canadian Precambrian Shield and Links to Watershed Characteristics  ap. 21-44.  aIn the present study, we explored the use of various optical parameters to detect differences in the composition of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a set of lakes that are all located on the Canadian Precambrian Shield, but within which Cu and Ni speciation predictions were previously shown to diverge from measured values in some lakes but not in others. Water samples were collected with in situ diffusion samplers in 2007 (NÂ =Â 18 lakes) and 2008 (NÂ =Â 8 lakes). Significant differences in DOM quality were identified between the sampling regions (Rouyn-Noranda, QuÃ©bec and Sudbury, Ontario) and among lakes, based on dissolved organic carbon concentrations ([DOC]), specific UV absorbance (SUVA254), fluorescence indices (FI), and excitationâemission matrix (EEM) fluorescence measurements. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of the EEM spectra revealed four components, two of which (C3, oxidized quinone fluorophore of allochthonous origin, and C4, tryptophan-like protein fluorescence of autochthonous origin) showed the greatest inter-regional variation. The inter-lake differences in DOM quality were consistent with the regional watershed characteristics as determined from satellite imagery (e.g., watershed-to-lake surface area ratios and relative percentages of surface water, rock outcrops vegetative cover and urban development). Source apportionment plots, built upon PARAFAC components ratios calculated for our lakes, were used to discriminate among DOM sources and to compare them to sources identified in the literature. These results have implications for other areas of research, such as quantifying lake-to-lake variations in the influence of organic matter on the speciation of trace elements in natural aquatic environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrecambrian shield 3aabsorbance 3aaquatic environment 3acopper 3adissolved organic carbon 3afluorescence 3alakes 3anickel 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asamplers 3asurface area 3asurface water 3aurban development 3awatersheds 3aOntario1 aFortin, Claude1 aCampbell, P.

Literature shows that most of the existing soil surface corrections are dependent on laboratory measurements. These measurements are time consuming and therefore unsuitable for large amounts of airborne or satellite spectroscopy data. Soil moisture and soil surface roughness present main challenges for in-field and remote sensing application of soil spectroscopy and soil moisture has substantial influence on surface reflectance. Here, we present a straightforward method for soil moisture reduction applicable to large amounts of airborne or satellite spectroscopy data.Multi-temporal airborne imaging spectrometer data was collected with the Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) in September 2013, May 2014 and May 2015 on the same pilot site. A new soil moisture index was developed to quantify the soil moisture of the airborne imaging spectroscopy data (R² of 0.59). The index appeared to be closely related to the existing NINSOL index. A, laboratory based, independent soil moisture spectral dataset was used to quantify the correction factor per wavelength based on the wavelength dependent relative differences.After minimizing the effect of soil moisture variability, the airborne spectrometer data better approximate the reference dry-soil spectra (up to 21.3%). Then, the corrected data were tested for soil properties prediction (soil organic matter (SOM), sand silt and clay). The soil moisture corrected spectra performed marginally better for SOM (RMSE from 3.13 to 3.10) and silt (RMSE from 5.74 to 5.72), although not for clay (RMSE from 9.14 to 9.33) and sand (RMSE from 5.98 to 6.31). The methodology shows that field spectra can be corrected to better match laboratory conditions, focusing on soil moisture as main varying factor. Next step should include the various types of soil surface variation and their interactions. A better understanding of these interactions is needed and can be achieved by field-scale experiments and by modelling the different processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3alaboratory experimentation 3aland management 3ameteorological parameters 3amodels 3aprediction 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asand 3asatellites 3asilt 3asoil organic matter 3asoil properties 3asoil surveys 3asoil water 3aspectrometers 3aspectroscopy 3asurface roughness 3awavelengths 0aSoil spectroscopy 0aSoil moisture 0aSoil surface variation 0aDigital soil mapping 0aAirborne spectroscopy1 aChabrillat, Sabine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8600-51681 aNocita, Marco1 aSchaepman, Michael E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9627-95651 ade Jong, Rogier0 tGeoderma.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 337 p.607-621dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.09.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009500165300001600260520136100276592002801637650002501665650001501690650001301705650002101718650002101739650001501760650001301775650001001788650004301798650001601841650001501857650001801872650001301890650002401903650001401927650001901941650001801960650003301978650001402011650001302025700002102038773011602059856008102175852000902256655001202265IND60468973120221119152151.0151217e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046897312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-015-0757-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaitera, Juha10aPhenolic profiles of two Melampyrum species differing in susceptibility to Cronartium rust  ap. 133-140.  aCronartium flaccidum is an important pathogen in boreal forestry where it causes pine stem rust. The hemiparasite Melampyrum sylvaticum serves as a telial host for this heteroecious fungus while the congeneric M. pratense is highly resistant. We hypothesized that the variation in susceptibility is due to differences in the composition of secondary phenolic compounds in host plant tissues. To test this hypothesis, phenolic compounds of leaf extracts taken from both species of Melampyrum were analyzed with HPLC. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used for data processing. PCA indicated difference between the species, with the first two components explaining more than 70 % of the total variance of data that was separated into two distinct groups in a scatter plot. Two clusters, formed by the two species, were also suggested by HCA. Phenolic acids (such as chlorogenic acid), flavanones and apigenin flavonoids dominated the profiles of rust-resistant M. pratense, while kaempferol and luteolin flavonoids occurred in high relative concentrations in rust-susceptible M. sylvaticum. Our results suggest that phenolics may contribute to resistance or susceptibility of Melampyrum to Cronartium rusts as one factor. Future studies on the mode of action of phenolics in this interaction are thus warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCronartium flaccidum 3aMelampyrum 3aapigenin 3achlorogenic acid 3acluster analysis 3aflavanones 3aforestry 3afungi 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahost plants 3akaempferol 3aleaf extracts 3aluteolin 3amechanism of action 3apathogens 3aphenolic acids 3aplant tissues 3aprincipal component analysis 3astem rust 3avariance1 aWitzell, Johanna0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2016 Jan., v. 144, no. 1 p.133-140dSpringer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-015-0757-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02105naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016200169300001400331520082900345592002801174650001501202650001701217650000901234650001201243650001301255650001401268653000901282653001601291653001201307653001401319653001501333653001601348700002001364700002901384700003401413700002101447700002401468773010101492856008101593852000901674655001201683IND60599583220221117201541.0180702e20140620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059958322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2014.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPáramo, Ricardo,10aThermodynamics of mixtures containing amines.

These values were determined from isobaric molar heat capacities obtained with a Setaram Micro DSC II microcalorimeter using a scanning method. The heptane solution shows a W-shaped CpmE concentration dependence, which reveals the existence of strong non-random effects. Systems including 1-alkanols are characterized by large and positive CpmE values. This remarks that self-association and/or solvation effects are predominant in such solutions. On the other hand, their CpmE curves are skewed towards higher mole fractions of the alcohol, which might be ascribed to the existence of more interactions between unlike molecules in that region.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3abenzylamines 3aheat 3aheptane 3amethanol 3apentanols 0aCpmE 0aBenzylamine 0aHeptane 0a1-Alkanol 0aNon-random 0aAssociation1 aAlonso, Victor,1 aGonzález, Juan Antonio,1 ade la Fuente, Isaías García1 aCasanova, Carlos1 aCobos, José Carlos0 tThermochimica acta.g2014 June 20, v. 586 p.75-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2014.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245013400165300001800299520137800317592002801695650001701723650001601740650001101756650001501767650001401782650001801796650002501814651002501839651002101864653002001885653002401905653002801929653002701957653001901984700002402003700001902027700001802046773012802064856007802192852000902270655001202279IND60643978620221122003106.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064397862DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2018-00922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKahriman, Aydın12aA novel approach to selecting a competition index: the effect of competition on individual-tree diameter growth of Calabrian pine  ap. 1217-1226.  aIn this study, we evaluated the performance of 18 competition indices composed of nine distance-dependent and nine distance-independent indices in explaining the variation in individual-tree diameter growth of Calabrian pine (Pinus brutia Ten.) in the central Mediterranean region of Turkey. The data were obtained from 432 sample plots with varying stand age, site index, and stand density. To evaluate the performance of each competition index, the mean square error reduction approach was used relative to the noncompetition. Also, this study compared fixed and mixed effects models to analyze diameter growth. Statistical analyses showed that the best distance-independent competition indices performed as well as the best distance-dependent competition indices. The distance-independent competition index of Schröder and Gadow (1999; Can. J. For. Res. 29(2): 280–283, doi:10.1139/x98-199) performed best and is recommended for use in future growth and yield models to be used in the central Mediterranean region of Turkey. Also, the best selection of competitive neighbors was achieved using the area of influence overlap method, whereas the fixed-radius and angle count sampling methods had no significant improvement in quantifying the competition effects. On the other hand, all mixed effects models provided much better fits than their fixed model counterparts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus brutia 3aangle count 3amodels 3asite index 3astand age 3astand density 3astatistical analysis 3aMediterranean region 3aTurkey (country) 0adiameter growth 0acompetition indices 0aselection of competitor 0afixed and mixed models 0aCalabrian pine1 aŞahin, Abdurrahman1 aSönmez, Turan1 aYavuz, Mehmet0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2018, v. 48, no. 10 p.1217-1226dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2018-00923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014500169300001600314520110800330592002801438650001901466650001601485650002601501650001401527650001001541650001501551650002001566650002101586650001001607650001401617650001401631650001301645650000901658650002801667653003301695653003101728653002701759653001501786653001401801700001401815700002501829700001501854700002201869700001601891773013101907856008702038852000902125655001202134IND60576463720221121081343.0170804e20170106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057646372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b000512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrassl, Julia10aInfections with the Sexually Transmitted Pathogen Nosema apis Trigger an Immune Response in the Seminal Fluid of Honey Bees (Apis mellifera)  ap. 319-334.  aHoney bee (Apis mellifera) males are highly susceptible to infections with the sexually transmitted fungal pathogen Nosema apis. However, they are able to suppress this parasite in the ejaculate using immune molecules in the seminal fluid. We predicted that males respond to infections by altering the seminal fluid proteome to minimize the risk to sexually transmit the parasite to the queen and her colony. We used iTRAQ isotopic labeling to compare seminal fluid proteins from infected and noninfected males and found that N. apis infections resulted in significant abundance changes in 111 of the 260 seminal fluid proteins quantitated. The largest group of proteins with significantly changed abundances consisted of 15 proteins with well-known immune-related functions, which included two significantly more abundant chitinases in the seminal fluid of infected males. Chitinases were previously hypothesized to be involved in honey bee antifungal activity against N. apis. Here we show that infection with N. apis triggers a highly specific immune response in the seminal fluid of honey bee males.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aNosema apis 3aantifungal properties 3achitinase 3afungi 3ahoney bees 3aimmune response 3aisotope labeling 3amales 3aparasites 3apathogens 3aproteome 3arisk 3aseminal plasma proteins 0asexually transmitted disease 0ahost parasite interactions 0aantimicrobial proteins 0aproteomics 0afertility1 aPeng, Yan1 aBaer-Imhoof, Barbara1 aWelch, Mat1 aMillar, A.

Present study was to prove MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) could alleviating inflammatory cardiomyopathy by improving the inflammatory microenvironment of myocardium, especially by regulating the activity of macrophages. Mice were intraperitoneal injected of doxorubicin (DOX) to establish a dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) model, and then received intravenous injection of either MSC-Exos or PBS as control. Mice receiving MSC-Exos showed improved cardiac function via echocardiography and attenuated cardiac dilation via HE staining, as well as reduced cardiomyocytes apoptosis. Expression levels of inflammatory factors were reduced. And there was a significant decrease of the inflammatory cells infiltration in the MSC-Exos treatment group comparing to the PBS group. Meanwhile, MSC-Exos could remarkably attenuate the pro-inflammatory macrophages amount in both blood and heart, which was proved that MSC-Exos relied on the JAK2-STAT6 pathway mediating macrophages activation. MSC-Exos improved the inflammatory microenvironment of dilated cardiomyopathy by regulating the polarization of the macrophage, which may hold promise for dilated cardiomyopathy clinical therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adoxorubicin 3acardiomyopathy 3aintravenous injection 3astaining 3aechocardiography 3amacrophages 3ainflammation 3amodels 3acardiomyocytes 3acardiac output 3aexosomes 3amice 3astem cells 3ablood 3aapoptosis 0aMacrophages 0atherapeutics 0aMesenchymal stem cell exosome 0aDilated cardiomyopathy 0aMyocardial inflammation1 aShan, Anqi1 aWei, Zilun1 aXu, Biao0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Sept. 18, v. 503, no. 4 p.2611-2618dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011700170300001800287520128800305592002801593650001601621650001401637650001401651650001901665650000901684650002101693650001601714650002001730653002801750653002401778653003001802653001801832700001701850700001901867700001901886773011301905856008302018852000902101655001202110IND60595454920221118230147.0190415e20161205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059545492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2016.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChŏng, Chae-hun,10aSPL3/4/5 Integrate Developmental Aging and Photoperiodic Signals into the FT-FD Module in Arabidopsis Flowering  ap. 1647-1659.  aEnvironmental sensitivity varies across developmental phases in flowering plants. In the juvenile phase, microRNA156 (miR156)-mediated repression of SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) transcription factors renders Arabidopsis plants incompetent to floral inductive signals, including long-day (LD) photoperiod. During the vegetative phase transition, which accompanies a reduction of miR156 and a concomitant elevation of its targets, plants acquire reproductive competence such that LD signals promote flowering. However, it remains largely unknown how developmental signals are associated with photoperiodic flowering. Here, we show that SPL3, SPL4, and SPL5 (SPL3/4/5) potentiate the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)-FD module in photoperiodic flowering. SPL3/4/5 function as transcriptional activators through the interaction with FD, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor which plays a critical role in photoperiodic flowering. SPL3/4/5 can directly bind to the promoters of APETALA1, LEAFY, and FRUITFULL, thus mediating their activation by the FT-FD complex. Our findings demonstrate that SPL3/4/5 act synergistically with the FT-FD module to induce flowering under LDs, providing a long-sought molecular knob that links developmental aging and photoperiodic flowering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aflowering 3ajuveniles 3aleucine zipper 3aloci 3aphase transition 3aphotoperiod 3atransactivators 0aphotoperiodic flowering 0adevelopmental aging 0aSPL transcription factors 0aFT-FD complex1 aLee, Hyo-Jun1 aRyu, Jae Yong1 aPark, Chung-Mo0 tMolecular plant.g2016 Dec. 05, v. 9, no. 12 p.1647-1659dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2016.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03747naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011300167300001400280520143100294592002801725650002301753650001601776650001301792650002001805650001101825650002001836650001101856650001201867650001701879650001001896650001801906650002501924650002301949650001501972650001301987650001502000650002302015651001202038653003602050653004102086653003402127653004202161653003502203653003702238653003002275653003902305653003102344653004102375653003302416653003802449653002902487653001202516653002002528653002002548653002102568653001902589653001802608653002302626653002602649653000802675700002102683700007102704700002502775773012202800856008202922852000903004655001203013IND60549650120221120205040.0190405e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054965012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2016.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBosanac, Vesna10aAssociation between dietary offerings and nutritional status of adolescents as a factor of geographic region  ap. 13-21.  aAn analysis was performed of 14-day menu rotations in nine student dormitories in two different regions in Croatia – Coastal and Continental – during two seasons. Subjects were adolescents aged 15–22 years (n=978); the anthropometric measured outcomes were body mass index, body fat and waist-hip ratio. In the Coastal region, vegetable and fruit groups were present in the menus in significantly greater proportions as characteristic elements of the Mediterranean diet. Since diet reflects nutritional status, significant differences were established depending on regional affiliation. In both regions, calories and the share of macronutrients in the menus exceeded international standards for a healthy diet. Almost 17% of male students and 13% of female students were overweight or obese. Body weight was significantly lower for female students in the Coastal region, though BMI was not significantly different between the genders in the two regions. However, the percentage of body fat and WHR revealed that the share of the overweight adolescent population is lower in the Coastal region in comparison to the Continental region (8.3% vs. 11.1%), which might be the result of higher energy and fat levels offered on the menu at dormitories. The data set of nutritional vs. anthropometric values confirmed that regional affiliation is an important factor in the diet quality and the nutritional status of adolescents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3aadolescents 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3acoasts 3adata collection 3aenergy 3afemales 3ahealthy diet 3amales 3amenu planning 3anutritional adequacy 3anutritional status 3aoverweight 3astudents 3avegetables 3awaist-to-hip ratio 3aCroatia 0aCholesterol (PubChem CID: 5997) 0aBeta-carotene (PubChem CID: 5280489) 0aRetinol (PubChem CID: 445354) 0aAlpha-Tocopherol (PubChem CID: 14985) 0aVitamin B1 (PubChem CID: 6042) 0aRiboflavin (PubChem CID: 493570) 0aNiacin (PubChem CID: 938) 0aVitamin B12 (PubChem CID: 5311498) 0aFolate (PubChem CID: 6037) 0aPantothenic acid (PubChem CID: 6613) 0aBiotin (PubChem CID: 171548) 0aVitamin C (PubChem CID: 54670067) 0aAdolescent eating habits 0aCroatia 0aDormitory meals 0aDietary pattern 0aFood composition 0aMenu offerings 0aFood analysis 0aNutritional status 0aMultivariate analysis 0aPCA1 aŠanko, Katarina1 aGajdoš Kljusurić, Jasenka1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6657-73371 aColić Barić, Irena0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2016 Oct., v. 53 p.13-21dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2016.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245008900166300001800255520143800273592002801711650001701739650002601756650001001782650001001792650001901802650001101821650002301832650001401855650001101869650002101880650002001901650001501921650001701936653001701953653002001970653001001990653001102000653002602011700002402037700002002061700002602081700001902107773012802126856007802254961001202332852000902344655001202353IND60643978920221122003124.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064397892DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2018-01322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillson, Kevin G.10aTemporal patterns of ground flora response to fire in thinned Pinus–Quercus stands  ap. 1171-1183.  aThe ground flora stratum affects stand structure, resource acquisition, nutrient cycling, and taxonomic richness in forest ecosystems. Disturbances such as thinning and prescribed fire alter forest understory growing conditions that generally increase ground flora cover and richness. We studied annual changes in ground flora assemblages over three growing seasons after fire in thinned and frequently burned (3-year rotation) Pinus–Quercus stands. Our results corroborated trends from other studies that indicated greater ground flora richness and cover after thinning and burning compared with thin-only treatments. We also found that the stratum experienced relatively rapid succession between growing seasons that complimented the tolerance succession model. Forbs had reduced cover and richness from increasingly difficult growing conditions over time and were replaced by woody plants, shrubs, and seedlings. This likely occurred from changing competition dynamics that favored quick growth in the first growing season and long-term investment in vertical growth in the third growing season. The successful regeneration pathways also fit ground flora regeneration models and added a unique pathway to strengthen the predictive power of these models. As many stand management goals are focused towards improving biodiversity, prescribed fire and thinning may be used to increase understory richness in Pinus–Quercus stands.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aflora 3aforbs 3agrowing season 3amodels 3aprescribed burning 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3astand management 3astand structure 3aunderstory 3awoody plants 0aground flora 0aprescribed fire 0aherbs 0alitter 0aadvanced reproduction1 aBarefoot, Carson R.1 aHart, Justin L.1 aSchweitzer, Callie Jo1 aDey, Daniel C.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2018, v. 48, no. 10 p.1171-1183dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2018-01323Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010700161300001100268520106700279592002801346650002101374650001301395650001401408650002101422650002201443650001401465650002001479650002701499650001201526651001001538700001301548700001601561700002001577700001401597700002001611700001501631773010401646856008101750852000901831655001201840IND60440259920221122023745.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044025992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-015-1088-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Qiao10aGenetic diversity of Chinese Wolfiporia cocos cultivars revealed by phenotypic traits and ISSR markers  ap. 61.  aWolfiporia cocos, a well-known medicinal fungus, has been widely used in China and other Asian countries due to its various therapeutic value. In this study, genetic diversity among 22 Chinese W. cocos cultivars were assessed using phenotypic traits and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR). The results demonstrated that a total of 686 bands were amplified by 17 selected primers, 81.9 % of which were found to be polymorphic. Genetic distance was from 1.05 to 7.62 (physiological characters), and the similarity coefficients were from 0.63 to 0.82 (ISSR). Both methods were effective in differentiating among strains. The unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA) dendrogram classified the 22 strains into six major groups. Comprehensive analysis indicated that the cultivated germplasm of W. cocos in China were rich in genetic diversity. The results of this study has contributed substantially to our knowledge of W. cocos genetic diversity and also provides a theoretical basis of use and conservation for W. cocos resource and breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWolfiporia cocos 3abreeding 3acultivars 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3amedicinal fungi 3amicrosatellite repeats 3astrains 3aChina1 aWei, Wei1 aZhu, Wenjun1 aZhang, Shaopeng1 aSong, Jia1 aZheng, Yonglian1 aChen, Ping0 tMycological progress.g2015 Aug., v. 14, no. 8 p.61-61dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1617-416X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-015-1088-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006200152245013100214520171100345592002802056650001602084650001902100650001702119650002302136650001702159650001102176650003102187650001202218650002902230651001202259651001102271651001102282653002502293653002602318653002202344653002502366653002702391700006202418700006102480773009802541856008702639852000902726655001202735IND60654432020221118092419.0190801e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065443202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1135932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvucci, Raffaele1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6594-582014aThe role of modal shift in decarbonising the Scandinavian transport sector: Applying substitution elasticities in TIMES-Nordic  aIn the Nordics, transportation accounts for almost 40% of energy-related CO2 emissions, a higher share than most European countries. The International Energy Agency identifies modal shift as pivotal for a sustainable transition of the transport sector. This study analyses the role of modal shift in the decarbonisation of the Scandinavian energy system with TIMES-Nordic, the TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) model depicting the national energy systems of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. For the first time, passenger and freight modal shift is modelled through substitution elasticities for a real case study. Transport elasticities from the literature are discussed in light of the modelling environment, and long-term direct elasticities are identified as suitable for the purpose. The results obtained with TIMES-Nordic and its version equipped with modal shift are compared under an increasing CO2 tax. For passenger, car is mainly substituted by rail and non-motorised modes, while for freight, rail replaces truck and ship. Modal shift results in a cost-effective mitigation measure, responsible for 26 PJ of lower fuel consumption in 2050, and 2.2% lower cumulative CO2 emissions from transport. A sensitivity analysis on the investment costs for electric cars reveals the ineffectiveness of the CO2 tax in stimulating car substitution in a future where electric cars are more competitive and the power sector almost decarbonised. Estimates of modal shift potentials from alternative methodologies are comparable to the results obtained, highlighting the methodology solidity. Lastly, a well-balanced technology characterization among modes is identified as crucial when enabling modal shift.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3acost effectiveness 3aelasticities 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3afreight 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aDenmark 3aNorway 3aSweden 0aEnergy system models 0aLow-carbon transition 0aScenario analysis 0aSustainable mobility 0aTransport elasticities1 aGargiulo, Maurizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7735-64411 aKarlsson, Kenneth1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7749-254X0 tApplied energy.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 253 p.113593-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1135933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013400166300001400300520156700314592002801881650001501909650002801924650001401952650001601966650001701982650001501999650002702014650000902041650001002050650001702060650001202077650003202089650002402121650002402145650001302169650003202182650002402214650002102238653002802259653001102287653001702298653001602315653001702331700002502348700002202373700002802395700003502423700002102458700002902479700001902508700001902527700001602546700002902562700001902591700002102610700002602631710003602657773010102693856008202794852000902876655001202885IND60629229920221121002714.0190529e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062922992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2019.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhor, Ban-Hock10aDietary fatty acid intake in hemodialysis patients and associations with circulating fatty acid profiles: A cross-sectional study  ap. 14-21.  aThe aims of this study were threefold:first, to assess the dietary fatty acid (FA) intake and blood FA status in Malaysian patients on hemodialysis (HD); second, to examine the association between dietary FA intakes and blood FA profiles in patients on HD; and third, to determine whether blood FAs could serve as a biomarker of dietary fat intake quality in these patients.Using 3 d of dietary records, FA intakes of 333 recruited patients were calculated using a food database built from laboratory analyses of commonly consumed Malaysian foods. Plasma triacylglycerol (TG) and erythrocyte FAs were determined by gas chromatography.High dietary saturated fatty acid (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) consumption trends were observed. Patients on HD also reported low dietary ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) consumptions and low levels of TG and erythrocyte FAs. TG and dietary FAs were significantly associated respective to total PUFA, total ω-6 PUFA, 18:2 ω-6, total ω-3 PUFA, 18:3 ω-3, 22:6 ω-3, and trans 18:2 isomers (P < 0.05). Contrarily, only dietary total ω-3 PUFA and 22:6 ω-3 were significantly associated with erythrocyte FAs (P < 0.01). The highest tertile of fish and shellfish consumption reflected a significantly higher proportion of TG 22:6 ω-3. Dietary SFAs were directly associated with TG and erythrocyte MUFA, whereas dietary PUFAs were not.TG and erythrocyte FAs serve as biomarkers of dietary PUFA intake in patients on HD. Elevation of circulating MUFA may be attributed to inadequate intake of PUFAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3across-sectional studies 3adatabases 3adietary fat 3aerythrocytes 3afat intake 3afatty acid composition 3afish 3afoods 3ahemodialysis 3aisomers 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3apatients 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aseafood consumption 3atriacylglycerols 0aCirculating fatty acids 0aPlasma 0aErythrocytes 0aDietary fat 0aHemodialysis1 aSahathevan, Sharmela1 aSualeheen, Ayesha1 aAli, Mohammad Syafiq Md1 aNarayanan, Sreelakshmi Sankara1 aChinna, Karuthan1 aGafor, Abdul Halim Abdul1 aGoh, Bak-Leong1 aAhmad, Ghazali1 aMorad, Zaki1 aDaud, Zulfitri Azuan Mat1 aKhosla, Pramod1 aSundram, Kalyana1 aKarupaiah, Tilakavati2 afor PaTCH Investigatorseauthor0 tNutrition.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 63-64 p.14-21dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2019.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245010100209300002000310520140000330592002801730653003901758653003001797653002301827653001401850653001301864700001801877700001401895700002401909700002901933700002101962700002301983700002502006700001902031700002302050700002802073700002202101700002002123700001902143700002402162773019402186856007902380852000902459655001202468IND60517937720221119214053.0160406e20150908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051793772DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15144851122doi7 aPMC45686622pmcid7 a262833862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGonigal, Paul R.10aElectrochemically addressable trisradical rotaxanes organized within a metal–organic framework  ap. 11161-11168.  aThe organization of trisradical rotaxanes within the channels of a Zr ₆-based metal–organic framework (NU-1000) has been achieved postsynthetically by solvent-assisted ligand incorporation. Robust Zr ᴵⱽ–carboxylate bonds are forged between the Zr clusters of NU-1000 and carboxylic acid groups of rotaxane precursors (semirotaxanes) as part of this building block replacement strategy. Ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared (UV-Vis-NIR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies all confirm the capture of redox-active rotaxanes within the mesoscale hexagonal channels of NU-1000. Cyclic voltammetry measurements performed on electroactive thin films of the resulting material indicate that redox-active viologen subunits located on the rotaxane components can be accessed electrochemically in the solid state. In contradistinction to previous methods, this strategy for the incorporation of mechanically interlocked molecules within porous materials circumvents the need for de novo synthesis of a metal–organic framework, making it a particularly convenient approach for the design and creation of solid-state molecular switches and machines. The results presented here provide proof-of-concept for the application of postsynthetic transformations in the integration of dynamic molecular machines with robust porous frameworks.  aPublisher supplied data 0amechanically interlocked molecules 0ametal–organic framework 0amolecular switches 0arotaxanes 0aradicals1 aDeria, Pravas1 aHod, Idan1 aMoghadam, Peyman Z.1 aAvestro, Alyssa-Jennifer1 aHorwitz, Noah E.1 aGibbs-Hall, Ian C.1 aBlackburn, Anthea K.1 aChen, Dongyang1 aBotros, Youssry Y.1 aWasielewski, Michael R.1 aSnurr, Randall Q.1 aHupp, Joseph T.1 aFarha, Omar K.1 aStoddart, J.

The numbers of introduced taxa were collated from ten editions of the Dictionary of the Fungi as well as from the Index of Fungi. In total, around 9100 genera and 108,000 species had been introduced by 2014. Between 1943 and 2008, the average numbers of introduced novel genera increased annually by 73 and species by 950. However, between 2008 and 2012, the average numbers of introduced novel genera increased annually by 110 and species by 1430. There were 1203 novel genera and 16,912 novel species described between 2001 and 2012, with an average of 100 new genera and 1397 new species published annually during the period. Advances in molecular techniques have accelerated the discovery of novel taxa; it therefore seems likely that many more novel taxa will be described in the future. Between 2001 and 2012, 1529 novel species were described from China, accounting for 9.2 % of all novel species descriptions worldwide. Around 17,000 fungal species had been recorded in China by 2014 with 5700 basidiomycete species, and 6700 species from important fungal groups being documented in Flora Fungorum Sinicorum with detailed descriptions, microscopic drawings and lists of voucher collections.

Although the global response was similar between cases and controls, we identified and then validated six specific novel T1D-associated autoantibodies (AAbs) with sensitivities that ranged from 16 to 27% at 95% specificity. These included AAbs against PTPRN2, MLH1, MTIF3, PPIL2, NUP50 (from NAPPA screening), and QRFPR (by targeted ELISA). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that NUP50 protein behaved differently in islet cells, where it stained both nucleus and cytoplasm, compared with only nuclear staining in exocrine pancreas. Conversely, PPIL2 staining was absent in islet cells, despite its presence in exocrine cells. The combination of anti-PTPRN2, -MLH1, -PPIL2, and -QRFPR had an AUC of 0.74 and 37.5% sensitivity at 95% specificity. These data indicate that these markers behave independently and support the use of unbiased screening to find biomarkers because the majority was not predicted based on predicted abundance. Our study enriches the knowledge of the “autoantibody-ome” in unprecedented breadth and width.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoantibodies 3aautoimmunity 3abiomarkers 3acytoplasm 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aislets of Langerhans 3anucleic acids 3apatients 3aproteins 3aproteome 3ascreening 3astaining 0atype 1 diabetes (T1D) 0aautoantibody (AAb) 0abiomarkers 0aprotein array 0anucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA)1 aWasserfall, Clive1 aWallstrom, Garrick1 aWang, Jie1 aWang, Haoyu1 aBarker, Kristi1 aSchatz, Desmond1 aAtkinson, Mark1 aQiu, Ji1 aLaBaer, Joshua0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2017 Jan. 06, v. 16, no. 1 p.195-203dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.6b003543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01370naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007400160300001800234520027000252592002800522650002600550650002700576650002300603650001300626650004400639650001400683650002000697700002400717700001900741700001900760700002300779773013400802856007500936852000901011655001201020IND60658659920221119152737.0190826e20100622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065865992DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc00534g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBotana, Enrique12aA deep tetranuclear metallo-cavitand with bis(aryl) palladium bridges  ap. 4752-4754.  aA neutral metallo-cavitand based on cis bis-perhaloaryl Pd(ii) bridges co-ordinated at the corners of a deep calix[4]arene.

Effluent samples were collected from four hospitals in Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. Pseudomonas were isolated on MacConkey agar plates and the identification was confirmed by 16S rRNA PCR and biochemical tests. Susceptibility testing was determined by disk-diffusion method using 11 different beta-lactams and MIC assays were performed on isolates resistant to imipenem and ceftazidime. The beta-lactamase genes bla IMP, bla VIM, bla SPM-1, bla OXA-23-like, bla OXA-24-like, bla OXA-51-like and the intl1 gene from class 1 integron were analysed by PCR. One hundred and twenty-four isolates were recovered and the most common species was Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes. The resistance found among the isolates was considered high, 62 (50%) isolates were multiresistant. No isolate carrying the beta-lactamase genes tested was found among the strains. Seven isolates showed reduction of MIC for imipenem and ceftazidime in the presence of cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, indicating the hyper expression of efflux pumps. From the 124 isolates, 52 (41.9%) were identified as carrying the class 1 integron gene, intI1. Untreated hospital effluents could be a source of environmental contamination due to discharge of antimicrobial resistant bacteria which can carry integron class 1 and act as a reservoir of resistance genes and have efflux pump systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes 3abeta-lactams 3acyanides 3aeffluents 3agenes 3ahospitals 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3atransporters 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aHospitals 2aHumans 2aIntegrons 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPseudomonasxclassificationxenzymologyxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2abeta-Lactam Resistance 2abeta-Lactamasesxgenetics 3aBrazil 0aBrazil1 aOtton, Letícia Müner1 aFuentefria, Daiane Bopp1 aCorção, Gertrudes0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2012 June, v. 102, no. 1 p.73-81dSpringer-Verlagx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-012-9714-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013600171300001600307520110100323592002801424650002101452650001801473650001501491650001601506650001701522650001001539650002801549650002001577650002101597650002601618650001501644650000901659650001001668650001301678650002401691650002001715653002101735653001701756653003601773653002801809700002901837700001801866700001601884700001601900700002701916773011601943856008702059852000902146655001202155IND60576464120180619000000.0170804e20170106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057646412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b003832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuertas, Blanca10aSerum Antibody Profile during Colonization of the Mouse Gut by Candida albicans: Relevance for Protection during Systemic Infection  ap. 335-345.  aCandida albicans is a commensal microorganism in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts of most individuals that acts as an opportunistic pathogen when the host immune response is reduced. Here, we established different immunocompetent murine models to analyze the antibody responses to the C. albicans proteome during commensalism, commensalism followed by infection, and infection (C, C+I, and I models, respectively). Serum anti-C. albicans IgG antibody levels were higher in colonized mice than in infected mice. The antibody responses during gut commensalism (up to 55 days of colonization) mainly focused on C. albicans proteins involved in stress response and metabolism and differed in both models of commensalism. Different serum IgG antibody-reactivity profiles were also found over time among the three murine models. C. albicans gut colonization protected mice from an intravenous lethal fungal challenge, emphasizing the benefits of fungal gut colonization. This work highlights the importance of fungal gut colonization for future immune prophylactic therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acommensalism 3afungi 3agastrointestinal system 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aintravenous injection 3ametabolism 3amice 3amouth 3aproteome 3asecondary infection 3astress response 0aCandida albicans 0acommensalism 0aIgG antibody-reactivity profile 0afungal gut colonization1 aPrieto Castillo, Daniel,1 aPitarch, Aida1 aGil, Concha1 aPla, Jesús1 aDíez-Orejas, Rosalía0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2017 Jan. 06, v. 16, no. 1 p.335-345dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.6b003833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005300152245011600205300001400321520191200335592002802247650000802275650001302283650001102296650001502307650001302322650001302335650001102348650001102359650001202370650001302382650002602395650002102421650001302442653001602455653001802471653003202489653001302521653003302534653001502567700001702582700002102599700002402620700001702644700001702661700001402678700001602692700001702708700001602725700001702741773010902758856008702867852000902954655001202963IND60564124620221119143655.0190318e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056412462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmbaw, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6949-032510aExperimental and numerical analysis of the spray application on apple fruit in a bin for postharvest treatments  ap. 34-45.  aPostharvest treatment of fruit inside a cool room is gaining more interest to replace spray applications in the orchard. The efficacy of the application depends on the quality of the spray liquid and its distribution inside fruit bin. This work investigated the effect of different modes and settings of airflow delivery on the deposition amount and uniformity of the cold fogging spray deposition in a single bin. Room air circulation by means of evaporator fans was compared to an air suction configuration using a tunnel and suction fan. Deposition tests were conducted using a mineral chelate tracer solution and filter paper collectors placed on fruit. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the spraying process was developed to simulate the airflow, droplet particle tracks and spray deposits on fruits. The model predicted well the position of maximum and minimum deposit and the relative differences between the different modes and settings of airflow delivery. Generally, deposition distributions were strongly non-uniform. Spray deposits on fruit using only room air circulation were very low. Using suction airflow that directs the spray through the bin improved spray deposition and uniformity. The effects of spraying under different suction pressures (50, 167, 314 and 500 Pa) across the bin using different droplet diameters (15, 100, 200 and 300 μm) was evaluated. Depending on the size, different effects were observed. Coarse droplets perform best in terms of uniformity of deposition with more lateral dispersion, whereas fine droplets have a very limited lateral dispersion, travels deep to the stack following the high-velocity air (better axial dispersion). By implementing multiple nozzles the poor lateral dispersion of fine droplets can be improved, hence, the desirable characteristics of fine droplets in penetrating into the stack (axial distribution) can be retained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3aapples 3acollectors 3adiameter 3adroplets 3afruits 3amodels 3anozzles 3aorchards 3apostharvest treatment 3aspray deposition 3aspraying 0aPostharvest 0aFruit disease 0aBiological Control Organism 0aSpraying 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aSimulation1 aDekeyser, D.1 aVanwalleghem, T.1 aHemelrijck, W. van,1 aNuyttens, D.1 aDelele, M.A.1 aRamon, H.1 aNicolai, B.1 aBylemans, D.1 aOpara, U.L.1 aVerboven, P.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2017 June, v. 202 p.34-45dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001300192245020100205300001600406506007600422520145500498592002801953506003701981650001802018650001802036650001702054650001302071650001102084650002002095650001302115650001302128650002102141650001302162650002502175650001902200650001202219653001102231653002002242653003702262653003902299653001902338653002502357653001702382700002102399700001902420700001802439700001402457700002102471700002102492700002702513773011602540856008702656852000902743655001202752IND60576464220221207093446.0170804e20170106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057646422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b003862doi7 aPMC57663222pmcid7 a277263762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qi10aImmunogenic HLA-DR-Presented Self-Peptides Identified Directly from Clinical Samples of Synovial Tissue, Synovial Fluid, or Peripheral Blood in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis or Lyme Arthritis  ap. 122-136.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman leukocyte antigen–antigen D related (HLA-DR) molecules are highly expressed in synovial tissue (ST), the target of the immune response in chronic inflammatory forms of arthritis. Here, we used LC-MS/MS to identify HLA-DR-presented self-peptides in cells taken directly from clinical samples: ST, synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC), or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from five patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and eight with Lyme arthritis (LA). We identified 1593 non-redundant HLA-DR-presented peptides, derived from 870 source proteins. A total of 67% of the peptides identified in SFMC and 55% of those found in PBMC were found in ST, but analysis of SFMC/PBMC also revealed new antigen-presented peptides. Peptides were synthesized and examined for reactivity with the patients’ PBMC. To date, three autoantigens in RA and four novel autoantigens in LA, presented in ST and/or PBMC, were shown to be targets of T- and B-cell responses in these diseases; ongoing analyses may add to this list. Thus, immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS can now identify hundreds of HLA-DR-presented self-peptides from individual patients’ tissues or fluids with mixed cell populations. Importantly, identification of HLA-DR-presented peptides from SFMC or PBMC allows testing of more patients, including those early in the disease. Direct analysis of clinical samples facilitates identification of novel immunogenic T-cell epitopes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aT-lymphocytes 3aautoantigens 3aepitopes 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3apatients 3apeptides 3aprecipitin tests 3aproteome 3arheumatoid arthritis 3asynovial fluid 3atissues 0aHLA-DR 0asynovial tissue 0asynovial fluid mononuclear cells 0aperipheral blood mononuclear cells 0aLyme arthritis 0arheumatoid arthritis 0aautoantigens1 aDrouin, Elise

The utilization of insoluble respiratory substrates by bacteria requires a strategy that is quite different from a traditional respiratory strategy because the cell cannot take up the substrate. Electrons generated by cellular metabolism instead must be transported outside the cell, and perhaps beyond, in order to reduce an insoluble substrate. The primary focus of research in model organisms such as Shewanella has been the mechanisms underlying respiration of insoluble substrates. Electrons travel from the menaquinone pool in the cytoplasmic membrane to the surface of the bacterial cell through a series of proteins collectively described as the Mtr pathway. This review will focus on respiratory electron transfer from the surface of the bacterial cell to extracellular substrates. Shewanella sp. secrete redox-active flavin compounds able to transfer electrons between the cell surface and substrate in a cyclic fashion—a process termed electron shuttling. The production and secretion of flavins as well as the mechanisms of cell-mediated reduction will be discussed with emphasis on the experimental evidence for a shuttle-based mechanism. The ability to reduce extracellular substrates has sparked interest in using Shewanella sp. for applications in bioremediation, bioenergy, and synthetic biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aShewanella 3abacteria 3abioenergy 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3acell membranes 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3aflavins 3ametabolism 3ametals 3aproteins 3asecretion 3asynthetic biology 2aElectrons 2aFlavinsxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aShewanellaxmetabolism 2aVitamin K 2xmetabolism1 aGralnick, Jeffrey A.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2012 Jan., v. 93, no. 1 p.41-48dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3653-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245013400214300001600348506007600364520099500440592002801435506003701463650003101500650001501531650001801546650001801564650003701582650001301619650002101632650001901653650001301672650001301685653001501698653002201713653002601735653001701761700002601778700002701804700002301831700002501854700001701879700002501896700002501921700002001946773011601966856008702082852000902169655001202178IND60576464320221207093452.0170804e20170106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057646432DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b004962doi7 aPMC52188902pmcid7 a275505232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalaker, Stacy

Several studies have shown that glycopeptides are necessary to modulate CD4+ T cell recognition, though glycopeptide structures in these cases are generally unknown. Here, we present a total of 93 glycopeptides from three melanoma cell lines and one matched EBV-transformed line with most found only in the melanoma cell lines. The glycosylation we detected was diverse and comprised 17 different glycoforms. We then used molecular modeling to demonstrate that complex glycopeptides are capable of binding the MHC and may interact with complementarity determining regions. Finally, we present the first evidence of disulfide-bonded peptides presented by MHCII. This is the first large scale study to sequence glyco- and disulfide bonded MHCII peptides from the surface of cancer cells and could represent a novel avenue of tumor activation and/or immunoevasion.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3acell lines 3aglycopeptides 3aglycosylation 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amelanoma 3amolecular models 3aneoplasm cells 3aproteins 3aproteome 0aimmunology 0amass spectrometry 0aglycopeptide analysis 0aMHC class II1 aFerracane, Michael J.1 aDepontieu, Florence

To further investigate potential alterations in muscle mitochondrial function associated with aging, we assessed basal and insulin-stimulated rates of muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase (V PDH) flux relative to citrate synthase flux (V CS) in healthy lean, elderly subjects and healthy young body mass index- and activity-matched subjects. V PDH/V CS flux was assessed from the ¹³C incorporation from of infused [1- ¹³C] glucose into glutamate [4- ¹³C] relative to alanine [3- ¹³C] assessed by LC-tandem MS in muscle biopsies. Insulin-stimulated rates of muscle glucose uptake were reduced by 25% ( P < 0.01) in the elderly subjects and were associated with ∼70% ( P < 0.04) increase in IMCL, assessed by ¹H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Basal V PDH/V CS fluxes were similar between the groups (young: 0.20 ± 0.03; elderly: 0.14 ± 0.03) and increased approximately threefold in the young subjects following insulin stimulation. However, this increase was severely blunted in the elderly subjects (young: 0.55 ± 0.04; elderly: 0.18 ± 0.02, P = 0.0002) and was associated with an ∼40% ( P = 0.004) reduction in insulin activation of Akt. These results provide new insights into acquired mitochondrial abnormalities associated with aging and demonstrate that age-associated reductions in muscle mitochondrial function and increased IMCL are associated with a marked inability of mitochondria to switch from lipid to glucose oxidation during insulin stimulation.  aPublisher supplied data 0aglucose oxidation 0afat oxidation 0aLC-tandem MS 0arespiratory quotient 0apyruvate dehydrogenase1 aMorino, Katsutaro1 aAlves, Tiago C.1 aKibbey, Richard G.1 aDufour, Sylvie1 aSono, Saki1 aYoo, Peter S.1 aCline, Gary W.1 aShulman, Gerald I.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Sept. 8, v. 112, no. 36 p.11330-11334dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15148441123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245008500184300001600269520145900285536054101744592002802285650001702313650000802330650001002338650002702348650001402375650001102389650001302400653001102413653001402424653001302438653001902451653001402470700002602484700003902510700003602549773010202585856008502687852000902772655001202781IND60595455820221118230131.0180605e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059545582DNAL7 a10.1080/00173134.2017.13109202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Valéria Leobina Dos10aPollen morphology of Alcantarea giant bromeliads (Bromeliaceae, Tillandsioideae)  ap. 117-136.  aHere we describe the pollen morphology of 19 species of Alcantarea, none of them fully described before, to contribute to the infra-generic delimitation of the genus. Pollen grains are heteropolar, amb ellipsoidal (although spheroidal pollen occurs in Alcantarea aurantiaca, A. burle-marxii, A. glaziouana, A. nahoumii, A. roberto-kauskyi and A. trepida), monosulcate, sulcus with margin, reticulate ornamentation of the exine on the central area of pollen grain (except in A. imperialis, which display foveolate ornamentation) and apex of equatorial axe with different ornamentation from the central area of pollen grain (microreticulate calota or psilate-perforate calota). The genus is considered stenopalynous due to the similarity in the pollen morphology. The new pollen characters obtained here are useful in understanding the infra-generic palynotaxonomy of the genus confirming the relationship between species that have been grouped together based on vegetative evidence and/or relationships suggested by analyses based on DNA sequences or microsatellite evidence, e.g. between A. aurantiaca, A. burle-marxii and A. nahoumii; between A. burle-marxii, A. glaziouana and A. trepida; between A. hatschbachii and A. duarteana, between A. roberto-kautsky and A. trepida. Our results improve the morphological characterisation of the genus and may contribute to phylogenetic analyses as well as the biosystematics approach to solve species complexes.  aThis work was supported by the Coordenadoria de Aperfeiçoamento em Pesquisa e Ensino Superior (CAPES) [grant number PNADB 17/2009].

For power systems, these models must capture (i) the future challenges introduced by the integration of large quantities of variable renewable energy sources and (ii) the role that energy storage technologies should play. In this paper, we explore several different approaches to selecting representative days for generation expansion planning models, focusing on capturing these dynamics. Further, we propose a new methodology for adjusting the outputs of clustering algorithms that provides three advantages: the targeted level of net demand is captured, the underlying net demand shapes that define ramping challenges are accurately represented, and the relationship between annual energy and peak demand is captured. This weighting methodology reduces the magnitude of the error in the representative day based generation expansion planning models estimation of costs by 61% on average. The results also demonstrate the importance of carefully performing the clustering of representative days for both system costs and technology mix. In most cases improvements to the total cost of different representative day based expansion plans are realised where conventional generation capacity is substituted for energy storage. Based on the energy storage technology selected we conclude this capacity is being used to address ramping challenges as opposed to shifting renewable generation from off to on peak periods, reinforcing the importance of capturing detailed intraday dynamics in the representative day selection process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acluster analysis 3adecision making 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3amethodology 3aplanning 3apower generation 3arenewable energy sources 3astorage technology 0aGeneration expansion planning 0aelectricity system modelling 0aoptimization 0aclustering 0arepresentative input selection1 aCarvalho, Pedro M.S.1 aBotterud, Audun1 aSilva, Carlos A.0 tApplied energy.g2019 July 20,  p.113603-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1136033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04325naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245024100181300001400422520199300436592002802429650002302457650004302480650001102523650001302534650002502547650002502572650001002597650001802607650001702625650001902642650002802661650002102689650001502710650001302725650002902738650003402767650001202801650001002813650001502823650004102838650001702879650004002896650001002936650001402946650002602960650002502986650001303011650003003024650001503054650002803069650004503097650001203142650002803154650003203182650001803214651000903232653001303241653001403254653000903268653000803277653000803285653001003293700001903303700002003322700003303342773010103375856008203476852000903558655001203567IND60629230320221118033017.0190404e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062923032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2019.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarhangi, Mahdieh Abbasalizad10a10-y survival in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery in Tehran Heart Center-Coronary Outcome Measurement Study: The powerful predicting ability of the dietary inflammatory index and dietary antioxidant quality  ap. 22-28.  aThere is a higher rate of mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Iran and the mortality rate increases even after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between mortality and survival in patients 10 y after CABG, using the dietary inflammatory index (DII) and dietary antioxidant indices.In the current prospective cohort study, 450 patients with CVD who were referred to the Tehran Heart Center and who underwent an isolated CABG during the 6-mo period between April and September 2006 were enrolled. Anthropometric measurements and clinical assessments were performed. Biochemical assay, including hemoglobin A1c, serum lipids, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, lipoprotein(a), albumin, and C-reactive protein, were also measured. DII, dietary antioxidant quality (DAQ) scores, and dietary Mediterranean quality index (MEDQI) were measured using the data obtained from a semi- quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan–Meir method followed by log-rank test. The association between all-cause mortality and study parameters was performed with Cox proportional hazard model.According to the present results, older ages, male sex, lower educational attainment, opium use, previous history of diabetes and myocardial infarction, and higher hematocrit and creatinine concentrations were associated with higher mortality rates. Among nutritional indices, a high inflammatory diet was a positive predictor of mortality, whereas a higher DAQ score was a negative predictor (P < 0.05). No association was found between the MEDQI score and mortality rate among patients.According to the present findings, a diet high in inflammatory foods and low in antioxidant content is a potent predictor of mortality 10 y post-CABG. Therefore, reducing the inflammatory potential of the diet and improving its antioxidant content will be a preventive strategy for reducing mortality after CABG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aNational Cholesterol Education Program 3aadults 3aalbumins 3aanalysis of variance 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3ablood lipids 3acohort studies 3acoronary artery disease 3acoronary vessels 3acreatinine 3adiabetes 3adiastolic blood pressure 3afood frequency questionnaires 3aglucose 3aheart 3ahematocrit 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ainterleukins 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amales 3amortality 3amyocardial infarction 3anutrition assessment 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprediction 3areactive oxygen species 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asurgery 3asystolic blood pressure 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aurea nitrogen 3aIran 0aSurvival 0aMortality 0aCABG 0aDII 0aDAQ 0aMEDQI1 aMoradi, Fardin1 aNadjafi, Mehdi,1 aJafarabadi, Mohammad Asghari0 tNutrition.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 63-64 p.22-28dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2019.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003100144245013200175300001600307520145100323592002801774650001901802650003301821650002101854650002201875650002101897650001801918650001101936650001901947650001901966650002601985650001702011650001402028650001602042650001702058650002602075650001502101650001002116650001302126650001202139651001202151651001202163651002902175653001902204653002102223653002202244653002102266653002602287700001802313700002002331700002102351700002002372700002002392773012502412856007802537852000902615655001202624IND60643980420221123035520.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064398042DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2016-04812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFält-Nardmann, Julia J.J.10aLocal adaptations and phenotypic plasticity may render gypsy moth and nun moth future pests in northern European boreal forests  ap. 265-276.  aPhenotypic plasticity and local adaptations are important factors in predicting range expansions and shifts of pest insects in a changing climate. We reared two lepidopteran forest pests, Lymantria monacha (Linnaeus) and Lymantria dispar (Linnaeus), at three climatically different field sites from central Germany to northern Finland to investigate differences among populations in plasticity in the timing of pupation and adult emergence (measured as cumulative temperature sums, degree-days >5 °C), pupal mass, and duration of the pupal period. We also compared the phenologies of continental and boreal L. monacha populations feeding on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) to reveal possible local adaptations. Lymantria dispar was reared on different host plants, Quercus robur L., Betula pendula Roth, and Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii (Orl.) Hämet-Ahti, to evaluate the possibilities of a range expansion northwards. There was stronger indication of adaptive phenotypic plasticity, which enables species to cope with changing environmental conditions, in continental L. dispar and boreal L. monacha populations than in the continental L. monacha population. Differences between boreal and continental L. monacha populations may denote adaptation to local conditions. All three host plants used for L. dispar proved suitable for the species, revealing that host plant availability would not limit its range expansion in northern Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula 3aBetula pubescens var. pumila 3aLymantria dispar 3aLymantria monacha 3aPinus sylvestris 3aQuercus robur 3aadults 3aboreal forests 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest pests 3aheat sums 3ahost plants 3ainsect pests 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aprediction 3apupae 3apupation 3arearing 3aFinland 3aGermany 3aNorthern European region 0aclimate change 0alocal adaptation 0aLymantria monacha 0aLymantria dispar 0aphenotypic plasticity1 aKlemola, Tero1 aRuohomäki, Kai1 aNiemelä, Pekka,1 aRoth, Mechthild1 aSaikkonen, Kari0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2018, v. 48, no. 3 p.265-276dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2016-04813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245013800172300001400310520101700324592002801341650002601369650001201395650001301407650001601420650001601436653001201452653002101464653002201485653002901507653001201536653002601548700002601574700002001600700002101620700002101641773010101662856008101763852000901844655001201853IND60599584320221117201507.0180702e20140620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059958432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2014.03.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, Puneet Kumar10aStudy of intermolecular interactions in binary mixtures of 2-(dimethylamino)ethanol with methanol and ethanol at various temperatures  ap. 58-65.  aThe densities, ρ and ultrasonic speeds, u of the binary mixtures of 2-(dimethylamino)ethanol (DMAE) with methanol/ethanol, including those of pure liquids, over the entire composition range were measured at 298.15, 308.15 and 318.15K.

For vector-transmitted parasites, in particular, distributions might be influenced by host-switching and by parasite dispersal with primary hosts and vectors. We surveyed haemosporidian blood parasites ( Plasmodium and Haemoproteus ) of small land birds in eastern North America to characterize a regional parasite community. Distributions of parasite populations generally reflected distributions of their hosts across the region. However, when the interdependence between hosts and parasites was controlled statistically, local host assemblages were related to regional climatic gradients, but parasite assemblages were not. Moreover, because parasite assemblage similarity does not decrease with distance when controlling for host assemblages and climate, parasites evidently disperse readily within the distributions of their hosts. The degree of specialization on hosts varied in some parasite lineages over short periods and small geographic distances independently of the diversity of available hosts and potentially competing parasite lineages. Nonrandom spatial turnover was apparent in parasite lineages infecting one host species that was well-sampled within a single year across its range, plausibly reflecting localized adaptations of hosts and parasites. Overall, populations of avian hosts generally determine the geographic distributions of haemosporidian parasites. However, parasites are not dispersal-limited within their host distributions, and they may switch hosts readily.  aPublisher supplied data 0aavian malaria 0acommunity assembly 0aemerging infectious disease 0aHaemosporida 0aparasite communities1 aCollins, Michael D.1 aMedeiros, Matthew C.

The present study is about diversity of B. bassiana isolated from the silkworm in southwest China. Five strains of B. bassiana were isolated from infected silkworm. Two isolates, GXtr1009 and GXtr1010, were isolated from infected silkworms treated with two kinds of biological pesticides applied in Guangxi province, and three isolates, SCsk1006, YNsk1106 and GXsk1011, were collected from naturally infected silkworms from different geographical locations in Yunnan and Sichuan. All of the isolates showed highly similar conidia and conidial fructification, but the colony characteristics demonstrated great differences among the isolates. The ITS and 18S rDNA sequence analysis was sufficient to identify all five isolates as B. bassiana. However, the dendrogram, based on the ISSR data, produced two large genetic groups. GXtr1009 and GXtr1010 comprised one group, and SCsk1006, YNsk1106 and GXsk1011 converged in a different large group. The results suggested that, although all of these five B. bassiana strains were pathogenic to silkworms, strains of biological pesticides could be differentiated from strains of naturally infected silkworm via ISSR analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aBombyx mori 3abiopesticides 3aconidia 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apathogenicity 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3asilkworms 2aAnimals 2aBeauveriaxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aBombyxxmicrobiology 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenes, rRNA 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aChina 0aChina1 aYang, Li1 aQiu, Xin1 aLiu, Yong-gui1 aZhou, Wei1 aWan, Yong-Ji0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2013 July, v. 29, no. 7 p.1263-1269dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-013-1289-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010400163300001800267520098900285592002801274650001601302650001501318650001601333650001501349650001901364650001301383650001201396650003101408653001901439653001201458653000901470653002001479700001401499700001701513700001801530773014901548856008301697852000901780655001201789IND60611376620221119113524.0181010e20180918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061137662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.08.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ping10aLong non-coding RNA TTN-AS1 promotes cell growth and metastasis in cervical cancer via miR-573/E2F3  ap. 2956-2962.  aLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a crucial member of non-coding RNA family, and increasing evidence demonstrates that lncRNAs participate in the initiation and progression of cancers. Our study aimed to explore the role of lncRNA TTN-AS1 in cervical cancer (CC) development. In the present study, our results showed that TTN-AS1 was substantially increased in CC tissues and cell lines, high expression of TTN-AS1 was correlated with advanced FIGO stage, poor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and poor overall survival of CC patients. Function assays showed that TTN-AS1 inhibition decreased the proliferation and invasion of CC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we revealed that TTN-AS1 could positively modulate E2F3 expression via sponging miR-573 in CC cells. Together, our study revealed that lncRNA TTN-AS1 was involved in the progression of CC cells by regulation of miR-573-E2F3 axis, which offered a new insight into the treatment strategies of CC.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell growth 3acell lines 3alymph nodes 3ametastasis 3anon-coding RNA 3apatients 3atissues 3auterine cervical neoplasms 0alncRNA TTN-AS1 0amiR-573 0aE2F3 0aCervical cancer1 aWang, Rui1 aYue, Qingfen1 aHao, Mengmeng0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Sept. 18, v. 503, no. 4 p.2956-2962dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.08.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245014500180300001400325520169000339592002802029650002802057650003402085650001902119650002302138650001602161650002002177650002302197650001902220650002002239650001102259650005002270650001402320650004002334650002002374650001802394650001102412650001902423650001502442650002002457651001302477651002602490653002302516653001602539653001702555653002602572653001602598653001002614700002902624773012102653856008702774852000902861655001202870IND60535397320221119230153.0190318e20150115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053539732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanderhoof, Melanie K.10aPersistence of MODIS evapotranspiration impacts from mountain pine beetle outbreaks in lodgepole pine forests, south-central Rocky Mountains  ap. 78-91.  aThe current extent and high severity (percent tree mortality) of mountain pine beetle outbreaks across western North America has been attributed to regional climate change, specifically warmer summer and winter temperatures and drier summers. This study paired multiple mountain pine beetle outbreak location datasets, both current and historical, with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) products in order to quantify the full seasonal evapotranspiration impact of outbreak events for decades after outbreak (0 to 60 years). Following mountain pine beetle outbreaks in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands in the Colorado Rockies we observed an 18.7±1.4% (p<0.01) reduction in the rate of summer evapotranspiration at 14 to 20 years since outbreak. We also observed a 21.6±2.2% (p<0.01) increase in the rate of summer evapotranspiration, relative to non-attacked stands, in intermediate-aged stands 30 to 40 years since outbreak. Changes to growing season evapotranspiration correlated positively with changes in stand density, stand leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), while high incoming solar radiation during the summer months acted to amplify changes to evapotranspiration even given relatively minor changes to summer fPAR and LAI due to the rapid regeneration of understory vegetation. Lodgepole pine mortality from mountain pine beetle outbreaks showed lasting effects on stand-scale evapotranspiration which could have important implications for regional water resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendroctonus ponderosae 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3aclimate change 3aconiferous forests 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3aevapotranspiration 3agrowing season 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amortality 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3asolar radiation 3astand density 3asummer 3atree mortality 3aunderstory 3awater resources 3aColorado 3aRocky Mountain region 0aEvapotranspiration 0aWater cycle 0aBark beetles 0aMountain pine beetles 0aDisturbance 0aMODIS1 aWilliams, Christopher A.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2015 Jan. 15, v. 200 p.78-91dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008100169300001400250520089700264592002801161650001801189650002301207650002201230650001301252650001901265650002401284650001001308650001601318653001801334653001201352653001201364653001301376653001301389653001301402700002401415700002501439700002601464700002301490773010901513856008701622852000901709655001201718IND60564125020221119143915.0190318e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056412502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukted, Nion10aInactivation of Campylobacter during immersion chilling of chicken carcasses  ap. 25-33.  aImmersion chilling of chicken carcasses is used in many locations to reduce temperature. In some cases chemicals are added to the water to reduce the numbers of Campylobacter and other microbial populations. The addition of chlorine to the chilling water has the potential to reduce Campylobacter numbers significantly. Because of the interest in reducing campylobacteriosis, the chilling process is reviewed with emphasis on successful methods for the reduction of viable Campylobacter populations. A mathematical model of the fate of Campylobacter during the chilling process is presented. Some parameters in the model are estimated based on experimental data from several sources. Experimental results and simulation results show that Campylobacter numbers can be reduced significantly in chillers with three tanks in series and a measurable concentration of free chlorine in the chillers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3acampylobacteriosis 3achicken carcasses 3achlorine 3acold treatment 3amathematical models 3atanks 3atemperature 0aCampylobacter 0aBroiler 0aCarcass 0aChlorine 0aChilling 0aModeling1 aTuitemwong, Pravate1 aTuitemwong, Kooranee1 aPoonlapdecha, Wanwisa1 aErickson, Larry E.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2017 June, v. 202 p.25-33dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245011800182300001600300520149700316536020901813592002802022596007702050596006302127596006102190650000902251650001302260650001202273650001002285650001402295650002502309650001402334650003002348650001502378650001102393650001302404650001602417653001602433653002802449653001602477653001302493653001502506653001602521700003602537700003202573700002802605700003202633773010202665856008502767852000902852655001202861IND60595456020221118230130.0180605e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059545602DNAL7 a10.1080/00173134.2017.13199732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaya-Manzano, José María10aComparison between two adhesives (silicone and petroleum jelly) in Hirst pollen traps in a controlled environment  ap. 137-143.  aAerobiological sampling through volumetric pollen traps requires the use of an appropriate adhesive, whose selection is a critical factor in these studies. This study compares the differences between two adhesives that have been widely used in aerobiological studies with the aim of providing a persuasive argument for using petroleum jelly as a viable alternative to silicone diluted with the banned substance carbon tetrachloride. The study was performed using Hirst-type pollen traps in an indoor controlled environment to avoid interference attributed to outdoor meteorological parameters. Furthermore, a gravimetric study was conducted simultaneously as a control. Four different pollen types with different pollen sizes and similar flowering seasons were studied (Acer, Platanus, Quercus and Rumex). Differences between pollen traps were minimised by interchanging the drums in each pollen trap every 24 hours. Gravimetric results showed homogeneous airborne pollen distribution in the study. No statistically significant differences were found between the results for the sample adhesives for Quercus and Platanus, whereas significant differences were observed for Rumex and Acer. In the case of Acer, more pollen grains were recorded using the petroleum jelly, while for Rumex, more pollen grains were recorded with silicone. After this experiment we consider that petroleum jelly can be used as a viable alternative adhesive to the banned silicone diluted with carbon tetrachloride.  aThis work was conducted thanks to the Extremadura Regional Government (Junta de Extremadura), Spain (Project Number PRI06A190 and GR15060 funds), and the European Social Fund (Project number PRI BS10008);  aPublisher supplied data  aPRI BS10008cEuropean Social Funddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004895  aPRI06A190cRegional Government of the Junta de Extremadura  aGR15060cRegional Government of the Junta de Extremadura 3aAcer 3aPlatanus 3aQuercus 3aRumex 3aadhesives 3acarbon tetrachloride 3aflowering 3ameteorological parameters 3apetrolatum 3apollen 3asilicone 3aspore traps 0aaerobiology 0aaerobiological sampling 0amethodology 0aadhesive 0aevaluation 0aclosed room1 aFernÁndez-RodrÍguez, Santiago1 aSilva Palacios, Inmaculada,1 aGonzalo-Garijo, Ángela1 aTormo Molina, R.q(Rafael),0 tGrana.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 57, no. 1-2 p.137-143dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl2395x1651-20497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00173134.2017.13199733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04918naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009400163300001600257520289500273592002803168650002303196650002503219650001703244650001403261650001803275650002303293650003603316650001903352650000903371650004303380650004303423650001203466650003103478650001803509650001403527650001303541650001103554650001703565650001503582650002003597650004303617650001003660650001703670650002503687650005003712650004003762653002303802653002403825653002203849653001203871653000903883700001703892700001703909700001403926700001703940700001303957700001603970700001503986700001804001773012304019856008104142852000904223655001204232IND60604583120221120114520.0180717e20150313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060458312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2014.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurrini, E.10aIn vitro anti-angiogenic effects of Hemidesmus indicus in hypoxic and normoxic conditions  ap. 261-269.  aThe decoction of the roots of Hemidesmus indicus is widely used in the Indian traditional medicine for many purposes and poly-herbal preparations containing Hemidesmus are often used by traditional medical practitioners for the treatment of cancer. In the context of anticancer pharmacology, anti-angiogenic therapy has become an effective strategy for inhibiting new vessel formation and contrast tumor growth. These considerations are supported by the evidence that most tumors originate in hypoxic conditions and limitation of oxygen diffusion stimulates the formation of tumor abnormal microvasculature. Aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro anti-angiogenic potential of Hemidesmus indicus (0.31–0.93mg/mL) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells and delineate the main molecular mechanisms involved in its anti-angiogenic activity both in normoxia and hypoxia.The decoction of Hemidesmus indicus was subjected to an extensive HPLC phytochemical characterization. Its in vitro anti-angiogenic potential was investigated in normoxia and hypoxia. Cell proliferation, apoptosis induction, and inhibition of endothelial cell migration and invasion were analyzed by flow cytometry. The endothelial tube formation assay was evaluated in matrix gel. The capillary tube branch points formed were counted using a Motic AE21 microscope and a VisiCam videocamera. The regulation of key factors of the neovascularization process such as VEGF, HIF-1α and VEGFR-2 was explored at mRNA and protein level by real time PCR and flow cytometry, respectively.Treatment with Hemidesmus resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and tube formation in both normoxia and hypoxia. Hemidesmus differently regulated multiple molecular targets related to angiogenesis according to oxygen availability. In normoxia, the inhibition of VEGF was the main responsible for its anti-angiogenic effect; the angiogenesis inhibition induced in hypoxia was regulated by a more complex mechanism involving firstly HIF-1α inhibition, and then VEGF and VEGFR-2 down-regulation. Additionally, the inhibition of endothelial cell migration and invasion by Hemidesmus was more pronounced in normoxia than in hypoxia, possibly due to the physiological enhanced induction of invasion characteristic of hypoxia.Our results indicate that Hemidesmus might represent a promising therapeutic strategy for diseases in which the inhibition of angiogenesis could be beneficial, such as cancer. The antiangiogenic activity of Hemidesmus is based on multiple interactions with critical steps in the angiogenic cascade. VEGF expression stimulated by HIF-1α as well as endothelial cell migration and differentiation represent important targets of Hemidesmus action and might contribute to its cancer therapeutic efficacy that is presently emerging and offer a scientific basis for its use in traditional medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHemidesmus indicus 3aanaerobic conditions 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3achemical constituents of plants 3aflow cytometry 3agels 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahypoxia 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasms 3anormoxia 3aoxygen 3apharmacology 3aphysicians 3aprotein content 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aHemidesmus indicus 0aAnticancer activity 0aAnti-angiogenesis 0aHIF-1α 0aVEGF1 aFerruzzi, L.1 aGuerrini, A.1 aGotti, R.1 aTacchini, M.1 aTeti, G.1 aFalconi, M.1 aHrelia, P.1 aFimognari, C.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2015 Mar. 13, v. 162 p.261-269dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2014.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245018000167300001100347520185700358592002802215650001602243650002202259650001402281650001102295650001002306650001602316650001802332650001102350650002002361650001302381700002102394700002302415700001802438773010502456856008102561852000902642655001202651IND60440261020221121122706.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044026102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-015-1086-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Bagdevi10aModelling of structures of ATR1-homologs from sister species of Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis suggests different patterns for target-mediated and R-protein-mediated selection  ap. 71.  aThe basal immune system of plants fights pathogens by recognising conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns. To bypass this, pathogens secrete effectors into the host plant, of which some are sensed by resistance genes, triggering host defence reactions. Plant pathogens diversify by host jumping and co-speciation. Little is known about the functional adaptations of effectors to new targets after host jumping, and how R-protein and target-mediated adaptations might differ. In this study, 40 coding sequences of the ATR1 effector from 3 different oomycete species, Hyaloperonospora thlaspeos-perfoliati, H. crispula and H. arabidopsidis have been analysed. Forty-six positively selected sites were identified, when sequences from all the organisms were analysed together. In H. arabidopsidis, more sites are under positive selection in comparison to the other species, owing to an evolutionary arms race of ATR1 with RPP1 resistance proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana.The availability of crystal structure of ATR1 of H. arabidopsidis facilitated homology modelling of the ATR1 of H. thlaspeos-perfoliati and H. crispula. It was found that in all species, more than 90 % of the positively selected residues are on the protein surface. Interestingly, variability of ATR1 was low in H. thlaspeos-perfoliati and H. crispula paralogs, suggesting the absence of a corresponding R-protein in their hosts. The distribution pattern of selected and altered residues differed for the changes incited by the evolutionary arms race and those changes that occurred after adaptation to a new target following a host jump. While in the first case, they were evenly distributed, they were more concentrated around specific domains in the latter case, highlighting that different forces have been shaping ATR1 evolution during arms races and after host jumps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3acrystal structure 3aevolution 3aforces 3agenes 3ahost plants 3aimmune system 3amodels 3aplant pathogens 3aproteins1 aSolovyeva, Irina1 aSchmuker, Angelika1 aThines, Marco0 tMycological progress.g2015 Sept., v. 14, no. 9 p.71-71dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1617-416X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-015-1086-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002900171245012600200300001400326520093000340592002801270650002701298650002301325650002201348650002401370650002201394650002001416650001001436650001301446650001301459650001301472650001201485650003601497650001201533650002701545650002701572650001701599650001301616650003801629650003601667650002201703650003301725650003301758651002501791653001401816653001901830653002401849653002901873653003601902653002101938700002801959700001701987700002102004700002102025773009802046856008702144852000902231655001202240IND50070836820221119200607.0190402e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007083682DNAL7 a242625252pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlberio, Giuseppina R.A.10aEffect of freezing/thawing process in different sizes of blue fish in the Mediterranean through lysosomal enzymatic tests  ap. 47-53.  aThe assessment of freshness of different sizes of blue fish (Engraulis encrasicolus 12cm, Sardina pilchardus 15cm, Trachurus trachurus 40cm, Scomber japonicus colias 60cm) was carried out using non-conventional enzymatic methods.

A significant increase (p<0.05) of AG activity was observed in all species, with a large increase seen after only one day of storage. B-NA activity increased slightly in sardines, horse mackerels and chub mackerel during frozen/thawed storage. Finally, the increase of B-GAL activity was significant (p<0.05) only in the samples of larger blue fish as horse mackerel and chub mackerel.

While studies have shown that the effect can affect development and growth in organisms with complex life cycles, we have limited knowledge on the effect in the egg and early larval stage. Here, we used a laboratory experiment to examine how the presence of chemical cues, a non‐consumptive predator effect, from an aquatic predator, perch, affected hatching success of larvae in three species of damselfly, Ischnura elegans, Coenagrion pulchellum, and Enallagma cyathigerum. In addition, we examined how exposure to predation risk in the early larval stages affected growth in the late larval stages of I. elegans. We found that the presence of chemical predator cues (1) increased egg mortality in all three species, (2) caused earlier hatching of eggs in one species, no change in a second species and a delay in egg hatching in a third species. We also found that predator cues have the potential to cause a carryover effect from early larval stages to late larval stages in terms of larval growth rate. The addition of non‐consumptive predator cues in the form of fish water caused higher algal growth than in the control experimental containers, and we suggest that this algal growth has the potential to confound predator stress cues. Our results show that the non‐consumptive predator effects affect survival and growth, and hence they have the potential to affect predator–prey dynamics in natural systems. Future studies on such effects in aquatic systems should consider confounding stressors, such as algae, fungi, oxygen, and nutrients levels, that might come with the addition of predation cues in water and thus add additional stress.  aPublisher supplied data  cUppsala Universitet  cInstytut Ochrony Przyrody Polskiej Akademii Nauk 3aCoenagrion 3aIschnura 3aalgae 3acontainers 3aeggs 3afungi 3ahatching 3alaboratory experimentation 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amortality 3aoxygen 3aperch 3apredation 3arisk1 aNsanzimana, Jean d'Amour1 aJohansson, Frank0 tFreshwater biology.g2019 Apr., v. 64, no. 4 p.778-786dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1839x0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.132613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011200170520141400282592002801696650001601724650001101740650003401751650002701785650002101812650002201833650001601855650001001871650002501881650001401906650002201920650001601942653003001958653002401988653001802012653003602030653001602066700001602082700001702098700001602115700001502131700001502146773012002161856008802281852000902369655001202378IND60778006120221123002859.0220726e20220910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077800612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1561612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Zhuoyi10aCarbamazepine degradation and genome sequencing of a novel exoelectrogen isolated from microbial fuel cells  aExtracellular electron transfer and pharmaceutical products degradation mechanisms of electrochemical active microbial are helpful in optimizing electricity generation and biotoxic contaminants removal for microbial fuel cells (MFCs). An exoelectrogenic bacterial strain (designated as LYK-6) capable of degrading carbamazepine was first isolated from MFCs operated with carbamazepine as unique fuel. The strain LYK-6 was identified as the member of Pseudomonas genus according to morphological characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Carbamazepine degradation rate of the strain LYK-6 was determined as 56.28% in inorganic salt medium using carbamazepine as sole carbon source. There were two oxidation peaks located at −0.044 V and 0.288 V revealed with differential pulse voltammetry analysis of the strain LQK-6. The maximum voltage of MFCs inoculated the strain LYK-6 reached to 187 mV when the MFCs fed with carbamazepine. The complete genome of the strain LYK-6 was of 4,454,672 bp in length and encoding 4209 protein genes. Genome annotation and functional gene analysis showed that the strain LYK-6 had significant genes encoding proteins responsible for the degradation of carbamazepine. The results demonstrated that the strain LYK-6 was promising application for the treatment of carbamazepine contaminant water by MFCs. This finding increases the known diversity of exoelectrogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas 3acarbon 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectricity generation 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aenvironment 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aoxidation 3asequence analysis 3avoltammetry 0aCarbamazepine degradation 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aExoelectrogen 0aExtracellular electron transfer 0aPseudomonas1 aWu, Yicheng1 aXu, Yangyong1 aWang, Zejie1 aFu, Haiyan1 aZheng, Yue0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Sept. 10, v. 838 p.156161-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1561613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012200171300001800293520123300311592002801544650002501572650001201597650001901609650001801628700001901646700002001665700002001685700001901705773010501724856008401829852000901913655001201922IND60112886920221121222130.0141111e20111007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011288692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2011.07.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvobodová, Jana10aMethods for determination of all binding parameters in systems with simultaneous borate and cyclodextrin complexation  ap. 7211-7218.  aTwo novel methods for determination of binding constants in the systems with borate and cyclodextrin complexation were developed. The methods enable to determine all binding parameters in these systems and even the binding constants of interaction of a neutral analyte with a neutral cyclodextrin. The first method is based on nonlinear fitting of experimental data and further evaluation of fitting parameters. The second method requires a multiple regression. The methods provide identical results with low experimental error. Only one set of measurements is required for both methods. Thus the binding parameters can be mutually compared. The binding parameters for neutral analytes ((R,R)-(+)-hydrobenzoin and (S,S)-(−)-hydrobenzoin) and neutral cyclodextrin (heptakis(2,6-di-O-methyl)-β-cyclodextrin) were evaluated and the effect of individual types of interaction was revealed. The interaction of the analytes with cyclodextrin governs the chiral recognition, while the complexation of analyte with borate is responsible for electromigration. Very low values of the binding constants of mixed analyte–cyclodextrin–borate complexes indicate that this type of complexation has negligible effect on enantioseparation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aborates 3achromatography 3acyclodextrins1 aDubský, Pavel1 aTesařová, Eva1 aBeneš, Martin,1 aGaš, Bohuslav0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Oct. 7, v. 1218, no. 40 p.7211-7218dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.07.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245007300165300001600238500001900254520180100273592002802074650001102102650002602113650002302139650002002162650002002182650002202202650001402224650001902238650002102257650001502278650001502293651001102308653002302319653001402342653002602356653001202382653001702394773009902411856008402510852000902594655001202603IND60722157320221119123709.0201230e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072215732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2020.09.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsu, Esher10aCost-benefit analysis for recycling of agricultural wastes in Taiwan  ap. 424-432.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAgricultural waste can be recycled in different ways. Cost-effectiveness is important information for investment decision-making of enterprises and policy-making of government to choose a profitable way to recycle agricultural waste. Therefore, this paper aims to present a cost-benefit analysis to assess and compare the cost-effectiveness between feasible recycling methods, and further propose cost-effective ways for recycling agricultural waste in Taiwan. Three recycling types of agricultural wastes, namely, composting, biogas power generation and biomass fuel are selected for cost-benefit analysis based on related regulations and policy supports of agricultural waste management in Taiwan. Primary data collected by sampling surveys conducted in 2018 supplemented by secondary data from national statistics are used for this study. Study results show that all three recycling types of agricultural wastes discussed in this study are profitable under corresponding economic conditions in 2018 with benefit/cost ratio greater than 1 and positive net present value; as expected, the cost-effectiveness of agricultural waste recycling varies depending on the recycling types, composition of input materials, and economic scales. Mixing chicken manure with other agricultural wastes for composting and using rice straw to make biomass fuel rods are estimated to have higher cost-effectiveness; livestock farms with small farming scale have relatively low biogas energy recovery efficiency; the cost-effectiveness of biogas power generation highly depends on fixed-in tariffs (FITs). Results imply that policy support for establishing co-processing centers of agricultural waste and differentiated FITs would be good measures to stimulate recycling efficiency of agricultural waste in Taiwan.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3acost benefit analysis 3acost effectiveness 3adecision making 3aenergy recovery 3aissues and policy 3alivestock 3apoultry manure 3apower generation 3arice straw 3astatistics 3aTaiwan 0aAgricultural waste 0aRecycling 0aCost-benefit analysis 0aCompost 0aBiomass fuel0 tWaste management.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 120 p.424-432dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2020.09.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011500170300001600285520087000301592002801171653001201199653003501211653002201246653001101268653001101279653001401290653001001304700002001314773011301334856008301447852000901530655001201539IND60128669020221120204833.0151116e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012866902DNAL7 a10.1644/05-MAMM-A-265R4.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrait, Suzanne G.10aElemental analysis of soricine enamel: pigmentation variation and distribution in molars of blarina brevicauda  ap. 700-705.  aSoricine shrews are typified by the presence of reddish pigment in their tooth enamel. This coloration is caused by iron and is thought to make the enamel more resistant to wear. Ten specimens of Blarina brevicauda were examined for percentage iron concentration using a scanning electron microscope in conjunction with an energy-dispersive spectrometer. Substantial iron variation was found between individual molar cusps and between different tooth positions. Specifically, the cusps associated with crushing and grinding, as opposed to shearing, had more iron incorporated into their enamel. In addition, the enlarged m1 exhibits higher iron density than the more-posterior teeth. These results suggest that increased iron density is expressed on teeth, and parts of teeth, that are subject to greatest stresses and are most prone to fracture and excessive wear.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBlarina 0aenergy-dispersive spectrometer 0airon pigmentation 0amolars 0ashrews 0aSoricinae 0ateeth1 aSmith, Staci C.0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2006 Aug., v. 87, no. 4 p.700-705dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F05-MAMM-A-265R4.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245016100209300001800370520148600388592002801874650002201902650001601924650001101940650001901951650002001970700006101990700005902051773012102110856008202231852000902313655001202322IND60675953920221119120700.0191112e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067595392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-019-03994-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeaver, Jordan S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4857-516412aA comparison of adiabatic shear bands in wrought and additively manufactured 316L stainless steel using nanoindentation and electron backscatter diffraction  ap. 1738-1752.  aThe resistance of stainless steels to shear localization is dependent on processing and microstructure. The amount of research evaluating the shear response of additively manufactured (AM) stainless steels compared to traditionally manufactured ones is limited. To address this gap, experiments were performed on directed energy deposition AM as-built and wrought 316L stainless steel using a forced shear technique with a hat-shaped specimen and a Split-Hopkinson pressure bar. The resulting adiabatic shear bands were characterized with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and nanoindentation to quantify the changes in microstructure and deformation hardening across shear band regions and between the wrought and AM materials. Despite significant differences between the wrought and AM materials including the forced shear response, the postmortem states of work hardening due to the shear band deformation are nearly the same. The maximum nanoindentation stresses occurred in the shear band center with similar magnitudes and only minor differences away from the shear band. Although EBSD data cannot be resolved in the shear band center, misorientation trends, particularly grain reference orientation deviation, were found to closely resemble nanoindentation trends. The combination of EBSD misorientation and nanoindentation, which are linked through changes in dislocation density, is a viable protocol to quantify local changes to macroscopically applied deformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3adeformation 3aenergy 3amicrostructure 3astainless steel1 aLivescu, Veronica1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1623-92701 aMara, Nathan A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9135-46930 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Feb., v. 55, no. 4 p.1738-1752dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-019-03994-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006200167520187200229592002802101650002002129650000802149650001802157650002602175650001202201650001102213650001602224653002602240653003102266653002102297653002602318653002702344700002302371700001902394700002102413773012202434856008302556852000902639655001202648IND60732791820221119232513.0210603e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073279182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2021.1072282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Matthew10aBayes linear analysis for ordinary differential equations  aDifferential equation models are used in a wide variety of scientific fields to describe the behaviour of physical systems. Commonly, solutions to given systems of differential equations are not available in closed-form; in such situations, the solution to the system is generally approximated numerically. The numerical solution obtained will be systematically different from the (unknown) true solution implicitly defined by the differential equations. Even if it were known, this true solution would be an imperfect representation of the behaviour of the real physical system that it was designed to represent. A Bayesian framework is proposed which handles all sources of numerical and structural uncertainty encountered when using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models to represent real-world processes. The model is represented graphically, and the graph proves to be useful tool, both for deriving a full prior belief specification and for inferring model components given observations of the real system. A general strategy for modelling the numerical discrepancy induced through choice of a particular solver is outlined, in which the variability of the numerical discrepancy is fixed to be proportional to the length of the solver time-step and a grid-refinement strategy is used to study its structure in detail. A Bayes linear adjustment procedure is presented, which uses a junction tree derived from the originally specified directed graphical model to propagate information efficiently between model components, lessening the computational demands associated with the inference. The proposed framework is illustrated through application to two examples: a model for the trajectory of an airborne projectile moving subject to gravity and air resistance, and a model for the coupled motion of a set of ringing bells and the tower which houses them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aair 3adata analysis 3adifferential equation 3agravity 3amodels 3auncertainty 0aBayes linear analysis 0aUncertainty quantification 0aGraphical models 0aNumerical discrepancy 0aStructural discrepancy1 aOmbrinho, Michael,1 aRandell, David1 aJonathan, Philip0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2021 Sept., v. 161 p.107228-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2021.1072283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010000172500001900272520117800291592002801469650001601497650001401513650001401527650001301541650001801554700002001572700002101592773013201613856008301745852000901828655001201837IND60738637820221121221755.0210524e20210512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073863782DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture110504382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorsi, Alessandro 10aWhat Drives Farm Structural Change? An Analysis of Economic, Demographic and Succession Factors  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe evolution of farm size and land use are important determinants of the efficiency and profitability of agriculture and the configuration of the territory. In this paper, a conceptual framework of the evolution of the number of farms and land use is presented, arguing that a major determinant of the change in the number of farms is the presence or absence of successors to ageing farmers and that these socio-demographic variables shape the evolution of the sector in terms of farm size, while they do not significantly affect the changes in the farmed area. This hypothesis was empirically tested with data drawn from individual farm records of the Italian Agricultural Censuses of 2000 and 2010—aggregated at the municipality level for an Italian region—by estimating regressions on the decrease rates of the number of farms, the utilised agricultural area and the total agricultural area. The results support the conclusion that the change in the number of farms was largely determined by the absence of successors in family farms and by the average operators’ age, unlike the change in the farmed area, for which natural land conditions were the main drivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aevolution 3afarm size 3aland use 3aprofitability1 aFrontuto, Vito 1 aNovelli, Silvia 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 May 12, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture110504383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03605naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005900149245015800208300001500366520170700381592002802088650001102116650001802127650002702145650002402172650002102196650002302217650000902240650000902249650001402258650002002272650001002292650001802302650001902320650001802339650001102357650002002368650001202388650001402400650002402414650002002438650001602458650002402474651002202498653002702520653002602547653001402573653001702587653002102604700001802625700002002643700002202663700002902685700006102714773012302775856008402898852000902982655001202991IND60526925420221119045740.0190411e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052692542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2016.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiccoli, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4545-722910aClupeiformes’ Egg Envelope Proteins characterization: The case of Engraulis encrasicolus as a proxy for stock assessment through a novel molecular tool  ap. 95-108.  aZona radiata proteins are essential for ensuring bactericidal resistance, oocyte nutrients uptake and functional buoyancy, sperm binding and guidance to the micropyle, and protection to the growing oocyte or embryo from the physical environment.Such glycoproteins have been characterized in terms of molecular structure, protein composition and phylogenetics in several chordate models. Nevertheless, research on teleost has not been extensive. In Clupeiformes, one of the most biologically relevant and commercially important order which accounts for over 400 species and totally contributes to more than a quarter of the world fish catch, Egg Envelope Protein (EEP) information exist only for the Clupea pallasii and Engraulis japonicus species. The European anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus, the target of a well-consolidated fishery in the Mediterranean Sea, has been ignored until now and the interest on the Otocephala superorder has been fragmentally limited to some Cypriniformes and Gonorynchiformes, as well.The aim of the present study was to fill the ZP protein-wise gap of knowledge afflicting the understanding of the European anchovy’s reproductive process and to expand the background on Clupeiformes. We cloned the five Engraulis encrasicolus’ zp genes and deduced their products, determined their tissue distribution, quantified their mRNA expression throughout the reproductive cycle and provided an insight into their evolution through phylogenetic tools. Furthermore, we proposed a multivariate statistics-based method to objectively infer and/or confirm the classification of Engraulis encrasicolus’ sexual maturity stages by analyzing data of zp mRNAs’ relative abundance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClupea 3aCypriniformes 3aEngraulis encrasicolus 3aEngraulis japonicus 3aGonorynchiformes 3achemical structure 3aeggs 3afish 3afisheries 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3amaturity stage 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3anutrient uptake 3aoocytes 3aphylogeny 3aprotein composition 3asexual maturity 3aspermatozoa 3atissue distribution 3aMediterranean Sea 0aEngraulis encrasicolus 0aZona radiata proteins 0aZP domain 0aClupeiformes 0aStock management1 aLeonori, Iole1 aEstonba, Andone1 aDe Felice, Andrea1 aPiccinetti, Chiara Carla1 aCarnevali, Oliana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5994-05720 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2016 July, v. 100 p.95-108dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2016.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245008200169500001900251520177900270592002802049650001502077650002202092650002302114650001102137650001502148650001102163650001302174650001702187650001802204650001402222650001602236650001602252651001102268651001002279653002602289653001902315653001202334653001402346653001302360700001402373700001302387700001902400700002602419700002202445700002002467773010202487856008902589852000902678655001202687IND60701538720221119013405.0200804e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070153872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2020.1040812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Sian10aC41 methyl and C42 ethyl alkenones are biomarkers for Group II Isochrysidales  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlkenones are polyunsaturated long-chain methyl or ethyl ketones produced by species in the Isochrysidales, an order of haptophyte algae. Based on phylogenetic data, members of the Isochrysidales have been classified into three groups with each group showing significant differences in alkenone profiles and preferred growth environments. Common carbon chain lengths of alkenones range from 37 to 40. Extended C₄₁ methyl (C₄₁Me) and C₄₂ ethyl (C₄₂Et) alkenones have been reported in hypersaline lakes in China (Lake Alahake and Lake Balikun), Canada (Lake Snakehole) and marine sediments (e.g., ∼95 Ma in Blake-Bahama Basin). It is unclear, however, if these extended alkenones are produced by one or more groups of Isochrysidales. Here, we systematically examined alkenones from cultures of Group II (Isochrysis nuda, Isochrysis litoralis, Ruttnera lamellosa, Isochrysis galbana and Tisochrysis lutea) and Group III (Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica) Isochrysidales and environmental samples of Group I Isochysidales. C₄₁Me and C₄₂Et alkenones were found in all Group II species with Isochrysis nuda producing the highest percentages, but not in alkenones produced by Group I nor Group III Isochrysidales. Our results indicate that extended C₄₁Me and C₄₂Et alkenones are specific biomarkers for Group II Isochrysidales. We also report the first temperature calibrations of alkenones for Isochrysis nuda and Isochrysis litoralis using culture experiments, and find temperatures inferred from extended alkenones in Balikun and Alahake surface sediments match warm-season temperatures based on Isochrysis nuda calibrations, which is further corroborated by genomic data indicating the dominance of Isochrysis nuda Isochrysidales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysotila 3aEmiliania huxleyi 3aIsochrysis galbana 3abasins 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3agenomics 3ageochemistry 3ahypersalinity 3aphylogeny 3atemperature 3awarm season 3aCanada 3aChina 0aC41 and C42 alkenones 0aIsochrysidales 0aCulture 0aEvolution 0a18S rDNA1 aYao, Yuan1 aWang, Li1 aWang, Karen J.1 aAmaral-Zettler, Linda1 aLongo, William M.1 aHuang, Yongsong0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2020 Sept., v. 147 p.104081-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11790x0146-63807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2020.1040813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245011800164500001900282520159400301592002801895650002501923650001601948650001301964650001301977650001801990650001402008650001602022650001102038650002102049650002602070650001702096650002302113650001602136650002202152650001802174651001002192700001802202700001502220773013202235856008302367852000902450655001202459IND60738637920221121221727.0210524e20210512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073863792DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture110504392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hao 10aEffect of Hydrogen Cyanamide on Bud Break, Fruit Yield and Quality of Highbush Blueberry in Greenhouse Production  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHighbush blueberries need sufficient chilling exposure to induce bud break and flowering, which limits their cultivation in warm areas as well as the profitability of protected cultivation in greenhouses. Hydrogen cyanamide (H₂CN₂, HC), gibberellic acid (GA₃), ethephon (CE), mineral oil (MO), and potassium nitrate (KNO₃) are often applied to deciduous fruit trees to advance bud break and fruit set. In this study, experiments were conducted in northeast China to determine the effects of different concentrations of HC or HC in combination with GA₃, CE, MO, and KNO₃ on bud break, fruit quality, and fruit yield in greenhouse-grown highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.). The results showed that all of the treatment agents could advance bud break by at least 15 days and fruit ripening by 16 days compared to the control. In addition, all treatments could promote the development of flowers and fruits and shorten the flowering and harvest periods. Compared with the control, 0.5% HC or 0.67% HC treatment increased the fruit yield of 5-year-old and 7-year-old bushes, especially early yield. Experiments carried out over two consecutive years in two different varieties, namely ‘M7’ and ‘Brigitta’, further confirmed the positive effect of 0.67% HC application on fruit yield. The results also showed that 0.67% HC had no negative effects on fruit quality. These findings may encourage growers to consider spraying HC in greenhouses to increase fruit yield, especially early yield, in order to schedule the harvest time for a more lucrative marketing period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3aagriculture 3abudbreak 3aethephon 3afruit quality 3afruit set 3afruit yield 3afruits 3agibberellic acid 3agreenhouse production 3aharvest date 3ahydrogen cyanamide 3amineral oil 3apotassium nitrate 3aprofitability 3aChina1 aXia, Xiuying 1 aAn, Lijia 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 May 12, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture110504393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01878naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245015900165300001600324520078800340592002801128650001501156650002201171650001101193650001401204650001001218650001701228650003001245700001801275700002301293773015001316856007701466852000901543655001201552IND60521499020221119114346.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052149902DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1976-06282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShalaby, A.

The experiments were done in microcosms using Ultisol soil. Remediation effectiveness was assessed based on pollutants content, soil characteristics, and ecotoxicological tests. Biostimulation and mycoaugmentation demonstrated the highest PCBs-removal (approx. 90%) with a significant toxicity reduction at 90 d. The studied strains were able to survive during the incubation period in non-sterilized soil. Laccase, manganese-peroxidase and endoxylanase activities increased significantly in co-cultures after 60 d. Sugarcane bagasse demonstrated to be not only a suitable support for fungal immobilization but also an efficient substrate for fungal colonization of PCBs-contaminated soils. Mycoaugmentation and biostimulation with sugarcane bagasse improved oxidable organic matter and phosphorous contents as well as dehydrogenase activity in soil. Therefore, biostimulation with sugarcane bagasse and mycoaugmentation applying dual white-rot fungal cultures constitute two efficient bioremediation alternatives to restore PCBs-contaminated soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurotus sajor-caju 3aTrametes 3aUltisols 3abioremediation 3acoculture 3aecotoxicology 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3afungi 3alaccase 3amanganese peroxidase 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3asugarcane bagasse 3atoxicity 0aTrametes sanguinea 0aMycoremediation 0aBiostimulation1 aTatarin, Ana Silvia1 aBarchuk, Mónica Lucrecia1 aGonzález, Mariana,1 aPegoraro, César Nicolás1 aFonseca, María Isabel1 aLevin, Laura Noemí1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2792-26171 aVillalba, Laura Lidia0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 202 p.110929-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.1109293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013400171300001600305520163900321592002801960650002201988650001402010650001202024650001302036650001902049650001102068650001402079650001702093650001502110650001102125650002402136650001502160650002602175650001702201650001402218650001502232650001002247650001302257650000902270650001802279650001102297653001402308653002402322653002602346653001602372653001402388653001202402700002502414773011602439856008702555852000902642655001202651IND60625133420221119123516.0190202e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062513342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.04.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajak, Upendra10aEffect of emission from ethylic biodiesel of edible and non-edible vegetable oil, animal fats, waste oil and alcohol in CI engine  ap. 704-718.  aIn previous years, unconventional fuel studies have been conducted by many researchers through their experimental work and numerical simulation. Running down of fossil fuel raised crisis of full fill demand of energy consumption in the world. The attention of researchers to investigate renewable energy sources such as biodiesel are suggested, which are less destructive for environmental. The paper is aimed to mitigate emissions parameter like NOX, smoke, particulate matter (PM) and summary of emissions (SE) from five different categories such as, edible and non-edible vegetable oils, waste animal fats, waste oil and alcohol biodiesel. Two experimental validations were conducted on a single cylinder, direct injection diesel engine at constant advanced injection timing and speed with diesel, for a Diesel-RK model. Numerical analysis shows that most effected NOX pollutant emission for soybean (edible) by 21.79%, jojoba curcas (non-edible) by 23.0%, chicken fats (animal fats) by31.2%, grease oil (waste oil) by 15.8% and butanol (alcohol) by 94.56%. The PM emission are reduced by 45.59%, 84.97%, 93.78%, 23.83%, 48.18% for soybean, microalgae, poultry fats, frying oil and pentanol respectively and also reductions in smoke emission by 93.8%, 93.43%, 92.26%, 89.14% and 79.14% for sunflower, karanja oil, fish oil, frying oil and pentanol respectively. The most effected summary of emissions (SE) are reduced by 3.91%, 15.66%, 43.37%, 3.01% and 37.65% for soybean, jojoba curcas, veal oil, grease oil and pentanol respectively; at full load and engine speed, injection timing and compression ratio were remained unchanged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3abiodiesel 3abutanol 3achickens 3adiesel engines 3aenergy 3afish oils 3afossil fuels 3afrying oil 3ajojoba 3amathematical models 3amicroalgae 3aparticulate emissions 3aparticulates 3apentanols 3apollutants 3asmoke 3asoybeans 3aveal 3avegetable oil 3awastes 0aBiodiesel 0aEmission parameters 0aEdible and non-edible 0aAnimal fats 0aWaste oil 0aAlcohol1 aVerma, Tikendra Nath0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 June 15, v. 166 p.704-718dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.04.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245013800153300001800291520128500309592002801594596005601622650002401678650002001702650001901722650002001741650001601761650000901777650001401786650001601800650004201816650003001858650000901888650001501897650001801912650002201930653002101952653003501973653001402008653001602022700001602038700001502054700001402069700001402083700001502097700001502112773011102127856007402238852000902312655001202321IND60673786520221117233733.0210209e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067378652DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pey0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, S.J.10aEffect of Dietary Non-phytate Phosphorus Levels on the Diversity and Structure of Cecal Microbiota in Meat Duck from 1 to 21 d of age  ap. 2441-2450.  aThe study was conducted to distinguish the effect of dietary non-phytate phosphorus (NPP) levels on the community diversity and structure of the cecal microbiota in meat duck based on 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing. In total, 525 1-d-old ducklings were fed diets (105 ducklings, 7 pens of 15 ducklings, on each diet) containing five levels of NPP (0.22, 0.34, 0.40, 0.46, and 0.58%) for 21 days. The results showed that dietary NPP levels linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.05) 21 d body weight, 1 to 21 d feed intake and NPP intake, and contrarily, linearly decreased (P < 0.05) β-diversity of cecal microbial population in ducks. ß-diversity analyses showed that microbiota clustering based on dietary NPP levels occured, with 0.22% NPP groups distinctly different from the 0.46% and 0.58% NPP group samples. Moreover, dietary NPP levels could change the relative abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria (linear, P < 0.05), genera Eubacterium coprostanoligenes (quadratic, P < 0.05), Ruminococcaceae UCG-014 (quadratic, P < 0.05) and Subdoligrannulum (linear, P <0.05), and Lachnospiraceae family (quadratic, P < 0.05) in cecal microbiota of ducks. Increasing the dietary NPP level influenced the cecal microbiota and positively affected the growth of meat ducks.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0502004cNational Key R & D Program of China 3aEubacterium (genus) 3aLachnospiraceae 3aProteobacteria 3aRuminococcaceae 3abody weight 3adiet 3aducklings 3afeed intake 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ameat 3aphosphorus 3aribosomal DNA 3aspecies diversity 0acecal microbiota 0adietary non-phytate phosphorus 0ameat duck 0aperformance1 aZhang, K.Y.1 aDing, X.M.1 aBai, S.P.1 aLuo, Y.H.1 aWang, J.P.1 aZeng, Q.F.0 tPoultry science.g2018 July 01, v. 97, no. 7 p.2441-2450dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pey0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01873naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008200165300001800247520072100265592002800986650001901014650002001033650002901053650001101082650001601093650001501109650001101124651001001135653001701145653001101162653002001173700001601193700001401209773018201223856008501405852000901490655001201499IND60087324820221123041547.0160903e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008732482DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60336-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Tao10aEstimation of carbon dioxide flux and source partitioning over Beijing, China  ap. 2429-2434.  aThe magnitude and partitioning of carbon dioxide emission from the urban area in Beijing, China was estimated based on a statistical approach. Results showed that the urban surface is a net source of CO2 to atmosphere. The main sources of CO2 are vehicles, which accounted for 75.5% and 38.9% of CO2 emission in summer and winter, respectively. At midday in summer, the CO2 uptake of −0.034 mg/(m2·sec) indicated that vegetation is an important sink of CO2 in summer. Comparison between the annual emission rates of CO2 from the statistical approach and that directly measured by the eddy covariance technique implies that a bottom-up emission approach is a viable means to estimate CO2 emission in an urban area.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aeddy covariance 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3asummer 3aurban areas 3avegetation 3awinter 3aChina 0aCO2 emission 0asource 0aeddy covariance1 aWang, Yuesi1 aSun, Yang0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2013 Dec., v. 25 p.2429-2434dElsevier B.V.aThe Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60336-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03785naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245015900182500001900341520177100360592002802131650001302159650001802172650002402190650001902214650001802233650004602251650002902297650002502326650002502351650001402376650001502390650002502405650001602430650001702446650001802463650001302481653001802494653001302512653002502525653002202550653001602572653001502588653000902603653000902612653000802621653000802629653000802637653001702645653001702662653000802679653001002687700003402697700002102731700004102752700007202793700001802865700002402883773012202907856008503029852000903114655001203123IND60701538920221119013742.0201223e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070153892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.1109372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoas, Layne do Amaral Vilas10aIn vitro toxicity of isolated strains and cyanobacterial bloom biomasses over Paramecium caudatum (ciliophora): Lessons from a non-metazoan model organism  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCyanobacteria have been considered a major global threat because of their widespread ability to proliferate and contaminate inland and marine waters with toxic metabolites. For this reason, to avoid risks to humans and environmental health, regulatory legislation and guidelines have been established based on extensive toxicological data. However, most of what is known in this field come from works on microcystin (MC) variants, which effects were almost exclusively tested in metazoan models. In this work, we used acute end-point toxicological assays and high-resolution hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled with electrospray ionization source (ESI-Q-TOF-MS) analyses to evaluate the deleterious impact of aqueous extracts prepared from cultures of cyanobacteria and environmental bloom biomasses over a non-metazoan model organism, the cosmopolitan fresh/brackish water unicellular microeukaryote, Paramecium caudatum (Ciliophora). Our data suggest that all extracts produced time-dependent effects on P. caudatum survival, irrespective of their metabolite profile; and that this ciliate is more sensitive to extracts containing microginins than to extracts with only MCs, stressing that more toxicological investigations should be performed on the environmental impact of neglected cyanotoxins. Further, our data provide evidence that P. caudatum may be more sensitive to cyanotoxins than vertebrates, indicating that guidelines values, set on metazoans are likely to be inaccurate to protect organisms from basal food web positions. Thus, we highly recommend the widespread use of microeukaryotes, such as ciliates in environmental risk assessment frameworks for the establishment of more reliable cyanotoxin monitoring guideline values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3aCyanobacteria 3aParamecium caudatum 3abrackish water 3aecotoxicology 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental impact 3afood webs 3aguidelines 3alaws and regulations 3ametabolites 3amicrocystins 3aspectrometers 3atoxicity 0aCyanopeptides 0aCiliates 0aLethal concentration 0aMass spectrometry 0aMicrocystin 0aMicroginin 0aAdda 0aAhda 0aAhp 0aDha 0aDhb 0aESI-Q-TOF-MS 0aLC-QqQ-MS/MS 0am/z 0aMC-LR1 aSenra, Marcus Vinicius Xavier1 aFernandes, Kelly1 aGomes, Andreia Maria da Anunciação1 aPedroso Dias, Roberto Júnio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2404-43371 aPinto, Ernani1 aFonseca, Ana Lúcia0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 202 p.110937-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.1109373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009100155520093900246592002801185650002301213650001101236650001701247650001401264650001401278650002301292650001001315650001801325650001901343650002001362650001401382651001101396700001701407700001901424700001501443773012101458856007301579852000901652655001201661IND60742758120221120092519.0210624e20210604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074275812DNAL7 a10.3390/v130610702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavid, Dan 10aCharacterization of Winter Dysentery Bovine Coronavirus Isolated from Cattle in Israel  aBovine coronavirus (BCoV) is the causative agent of winter dysentery (WD). In adult dairy cattle, WD is characterized by hemorrhagic diarrhea and a reduction in milk production. Therefore, WD leads to significant economic losses in dairy farms. In this study, we aimed to isolate and characterize local BCoV strains. BCoV positive samples, collected during 2017–2021, were used to amplify and sequence the S1 domain of S glycoprotein and the full hemagglutinin esterase gene. Based on our molecular analysis, local strains belong to different genetic variants circulating in dairy farms in Israel. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all local strains clustered together and in proximity to other BCoV circulating in the area. Additionally, we found that local strains are genetically distant from the reference enteric strain Mebus. To our knowledge, this is the first report providing molecular data on BCoV circulating in Israel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBovine coronavirus 3aadults 3adairy cattle 3adysentery 3aesterases 3aetiological agents 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3ahemagglutinins 3amilk production 3aphylogeny 3aIsrael1 aStorm, Nick 1 aIlan, Waksman 1 aSol, Asaf 0 tViruses.g2021 June 04, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130610703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011400165300001800279520134300297592002801640650002201668650001201690650001201702650001301714650001101727650001601738650001701754650001001771650001901781650001001800650001701810650000901827650001201836650001501848650001201863650001901875650001301894650000901907650001001916650000901926651001001935653001901945653001601964653001101980700001801991700001602009700002002025700001702045773018202062856008502244852000902329655001202338IND60087324920221123024351.0160903e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008732492DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(13)60473-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hui10aChanges in heavy metal contents in animal feeds and manures in an intensive animal production region of China  ap. 2435-2442.  aThe 360 feed and manure samples were collected from 150 animal farms in Jiangsu Province, China and analyzed for heavy metals. Concentrations of Zn and Cu in animal feeds were 15.9–2041.8 and undetected–392.1 mg/kg respectively, while Hg, As, Pb, Cd, and Cr in all feeds were below 10 mg/kg. Concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Cr in animal manures were 8.4–1726, 39.5–11379, and 1.0–1602 mg/kg respectively, while As, Cd, Hg, and Pb were < 10 mg/kg. The concentration of Cu, Zn, As and Cr in animal feed and manure were positively correlated (p < 0.001), but the Cd, Hg, and Pb were not statistically correlated between the feed and the manure. Concentrations of Cu and Zn were highest in pig feed and manure, followed by poultry and dairy feeds and manures. During 1990–2008, Cu, Zn, As, Cr, Cd contents increased by 771%, 410%, 420%, 220%, and 63% in pig manure, 212%, 95%, 200%, 791%, and −63% in dairy manure, and 181%, 197%, 1500%, 261, and 196% in poultry manure. Most of the increases occurred from 2002 to 2008, which reflects the extensive use of feed additives after 2002. In contrast, Pb and Hg in manures continuously decreased from 1990 to 2008. The results suggest that the heavy metal contents in animal manure have been greatly increased over 18 years and the contribution of manures to soil should be considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal production 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3acorrelation 3adairy manure 3afarms 3afeed additives 3afeeds 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amercury 3apig manure 3apoultry 3apoultry manure 3asampling 3asoil 3aswine 3azinc 3aChina 0aanimal manures 0aheavy metal 0achange1 aDong, Yuanhua1 aYang, Yunya1 aToor, Gurpal S.1 aZhang, Xumei0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2013 Dec., v. 25 p.2435-2442dElsevier B.V.aThe Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(13)60473-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03557naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014600168300001600314520202300330592002802353650001302381650001602394650001402410650001802424650001802442650001402460650001102474650000902485650001002494650002102504650001702525650001102542650001902553651001002572651002502582651001102607653002202618653003002640653003002670653002902700653003602729700001402765700001502779700001602794700001702810773011602827856008702943852000903030655001203039IND60625133620221119123411.0190202e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062513362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.04.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuscemi, A.10aConcrete thermal energy storage for linear Fresnel collectors: Exploiting the South Mediterranean’s solar potential for agri-food processes  ap. 719-734.  aItaly is celebrated in the world for its agri-food industries while the process of production of pasta is highly energy demanding and requires both electrical and thermal energy simultaneously. Because most of the Italian factories producing pasta are located in the Southern part of the country, the direct use of thermal energy generated from the sun would be particularly profitable. In this study, the authors examine the possibility of generating by a Solar Industrial Process Heating plant the thermal energy required annually by an existing factory that produces durum wheat pasta located in Sicily (Italy). The hypothesized plant scheme consists of an array of Fresnel linear solar collectors and a concrete thermal energy storage system in which a heat transfer diathermal fluid circulates. This particular combination, although not the most efficient from the thermodynamic point of view, determines a lower visual impact and easier maintenance during the life span of the system. The use of food graded thermal oil ensures a high level of safety. A TRNSYS model has been developed in order to simulate the energy performance of the above described plant with the aim of optimizing the design of the solar heat for industrial process systems in terms of solar collectors and thermal energy storage dimensions taking into account the available space in the specific location. The obtained results show that the direct use of the thermal energy generated with the Fresnel solar collectors can significantly contribute to increase the sustainability of the most thermal energy-demanding factories working in the food industry, a strategic sector in the Mediterranean Area. The average annual solar contribution can reach about 40% of the total thermal energy requirement, maximizing the solar energy production during the summer season. Moreover, the proposed study allowed the determination of the maximum investment cost of the plant linked to a simple payback time, without external incentives, of 8 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconcrete 3adurum wheat 3afactories 3afood industry 3aheat transfer 3alongevity 3amodels 3aoils 3apasta 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asummer 3athermal energy 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region 3aSicily 0aAgri-food factory 0aConcentrating solar power 0aDirect normal irradiation 0aLinear fresnel collector 0aConcrete thermal energy storage1 aPanno, D.1 aCiulla, G.1 aBeccali, M.1 aLo Brano, V.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 June 15, v. 166 p.719-734dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.04.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245006800173300001600241520145700257592002801714650001201742650002701754650002701781650001101808650002101819650001501840650001701855650001701872650001201889650001301901650001101914650001601925650001901941650001501960650001601975650001101991650001902002650001302021650001902034650003102053650001402084650001102098650001302109651001002122653001502132653001102147653001002158700002202168700001702190700001802207700002102225700001702246700001702263700002002280773015702300856008602457852000902543655001202552IND60721285720221117195406.0201224e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072128572DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-970X.2017.00035.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDharanesha, N.K.10aPulmonary paragonimiasis in a royal Bengal tiger- A case report  ap. 143-145.  aThe pulmonary paragonimiasis is a zoonotic disease, which affects humans, many wild felids and canids including domestic dogs and cats. In this study necropsy was conducted on a wild female royal Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) aged about 8 years from Kakanakote beat and section, Rajiv Gandhi National Park, Nagarahole, Mysore district, Karnataka, India. The post –mortem examination revealed that lungs were severely congested with numerous encysted lesions in all the lobes. The cysts had coffee bean shaped flukes in pairs, along with brownish necrotic exudates. The pulmonary complications like pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, congestion andoedema were seen. The lungs were grossly emphysematous with areas of pulmonary collapse. The flukes were identified as Paragonimus westermani based on the micrometry and morphology. On histopathological examination yellowish, ovoid, distorted eggs of P. westermani were seen in the ruptured alveoli with infiltration of inflammatory cells and surrounded by hemosiderin laden macrophages in the lung parenchyma. The cross sections of adult P. westermani in thickened bronchioles with loss of cilia and had infiltration of inflammatory cells in the sub mucosa. The cross section of fluke had tegument with tegumental spines, vitellaria, intestine, testes, ovaries and uterus. The extensive fibrosis, thickening of alveolar epithelium and emphysematous changes in lung parenchyma were observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanidae 3aPanthera tigris tigris 3aParagonimus westermani 3aadults 3aanimal pathology 3abronchitis 3acase studies 3acoffee beans 3afemales 3afibrosis 3aflukes 3ahemosiderin 3ahistopathology 3aintestines 3amacrophages 3amucosa 3anational parks 3anecropsy 3aparagonimiasis 3aparenchyma (animal tissue) 3apneumonia 3auterus 3azoonoses 3aIndia 0aLung fluke 0aMysore 0atiger1 aShivshankar, B.P.1 aRamesh, K.R.1 aKshamaa, L.M.1 aUmashankar, K.S.1 aAnanda, K.J.1 aGiridhar, P.1 aByregowda, S.M.0 tIndian journal of veterinary pathology.g2017 June, v. 41, no. 2 p.143-145dIndian Association of Veterinary PathologistswJournal:1998x0973-970X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0973-970X.2017.00035.93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011900164300001200283520139600295592002801691650001501719650002401734650002901758650001701787650003901804650002101843650001001864650001301874650003301887650001101920650002301931650001301954650001501967651001101982700002201993700002502015700002502040773013302065856008102198852000902279655001202288IND60123674720221117234025.0170724e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012367472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4422-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssaad, Aziz10aSpectrophotometric characterization of dissolved organic matter in a rural watershed: the Madon River (N-E France)  ap. 188.  aIn the last 20 years, increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations have been observed in several rivers and lakes in Europe. This increase has reduced the quality of the aquatic environment. In this study, UV–vis spectroscopy and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy with a difference of 50 nm between the excitation and emission (SF50) were used to characterize the DOC in a rural river (Madon River). The specific absorbance index at 254 nm (SUVA₂₅₄) which is related to the aromaticity of DOC was extracted from UV–vis spectra, whose maximum of the second derivative (occurring near 225 nm) is related to nitrates. SF50 spectra which are characterized by well-defined peaks indicated large spatial and temporal variations. Two methods were used to analyze and compare these spectra. The first method was based on the decomposition of the SF50 spectra into four Gauss functions: B1 (related to tryptophan-like fluorescence), B2 and B3 (related to humic substances), and B4 (related to chlorophyll-like substances). The second method was principal components analysis (PCA), which results yielded three principal components that accounted for 95 % of the variance. Although PCA enables the consideration of the spectra without making assumptions regarding the number of fluorophores, the results from the decomposition in Gauss function were easier to interpret.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aaquatic environment 3adissolved organic carbon 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahumic substances 3alakes 3anitrates 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3atemporal variation 3avariance 3awatersheds 3aFrance1 aPontvianne, Steve1 aCorriou, Jean-Pierre1 aPons, Marie-Noëlle,0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Apr., v. 187, no. 4 p.188-188dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4422-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245015400174300001600328520180900344592002802153650001902181650002602200650001002226650001002236650001202246650000902258650002202267650001502289650001402304650001902318650001402337651001702351653001902368653000902387653000902396653001902405653001702424653001402441700002402455700002502479700001902504700002502523700002502548700002302573773012402596856008402720852000902804655001202813IND60526925820221119045816.0190411e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052692582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2016.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeukes, Chrizelle W.10aCrotalarieae and Genisteae of the South African Great Escarpment are nodulated by novel Bradyrhizobium species with unique and diverse symbiotic loci  ap. 206-218.  aThe genus Bradyrhizobium contains predominantly nitrogen-fixing legume symbionts. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes responsible for their symbiotic abilities (i.e., those encoded on the nodulation [nod] and nitrogen-fixation [nif] loci) has facilitated the development of an extensive phylogeographic framework for the genus. This framework however contains only a few nodulating isolates from Africa. Here we focused on nodulating Bradyrhizobium isolates associated with native southern African legumes in the tribes Genisteae and Crotalarieae found along the Great Escarpment in the Mpumalanga Province of South Africa. The aims of this study were to: (1) obtain rhizobial isolates from legumes in the Genisteae and Crotalarieae; (2) verify their nodulation ability; (3) characterize them to species level based on phylogenetic analyses of several protein coding gene regions (atpD, dnaK, glnII, recA, rpoB and gyrB) and (4) determine their placement in the phylogeographic framework inferred from the sequences of the symbiotic loci nodA and nifD. Twenty of the 21 Bradyrhizobium isolates belonged to six novel species, while one was conspecific with the recently described B. arachidis. Among these isolates, the nodA phylogeny revealed several new clades, with 18 of our isolates found in Clades XIV and XV, and only three forming part of the cosmopolitan Clade III. These strains formed predominantly the same groups in the nifD phylogeny although with slight differences; indicating that both vertical and horizontal inheritance of the symbiotic loci occurred. These findings suggest that the largely unexplored diversity of indigenous African rhizobia are characterized by unique ancestries that might mirror the distribution of their hosts and the environmental factors driving their evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradyrhizobium 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3ahosts 3alegumes 3aloci 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3asymbionts 3aSouth Africa 0aBradyrhizobium 0anodA 0anifD 0aPhylogeography 0aCrotalarieae 0aGenisteae1 aStępkowski, Tomasz1 aVenter, Stephanus N.1 aCłapa, Tomasz1 aPhalane, Francina L.1 ale Roux, Marianne M.1 aSteenkamp, Emma T.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2016 July, v. 100 p.206-218dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2016.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011400158520126300272592002801535650002001563650002601583650001101609650001901620700001701639700001401656773012801670856007501798852000901873655001201882IND60703983920221122060548.0200722e20200428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070398392DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120913952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Linlin 12aA Lightweight Spectral–Spatial Feature Extraction and Fusion Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification  aHyperspectral image (HSI) classification accuracy has been greatly improved by employing deep learning. The current research mainly focuses on how to build a deep network to improve the accuracy. However, these networks tend to be more complex and have more parameters, which makes the model difficult to train and easy to overfit. Therefore, we present a lightweight deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model called S2FEF-CNN. In this model, three S2FEF blocks are used for the joint spectral–spatial features extraction. Each S2FEF block uses 1D spectral convolution to extract spectral features and 2D spatial convolution to extract spatial features, respectively, and then fuses spectral and spatial features by multiplication. Instead of using the full connected layer, two pooling layers follow three blocks for dimension reduction, which further reduces the training parameters. We compared our method with some state-of-the-art HSI classification methods based on deep network on three commonly used hyperspectral datasets. The results show that our network can achieve a comparable classification accuracy with significantly reduced parameters compared to the above deep networks, which reflects its potential advantages in HSI classification.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ahyperspectral imagery 3amodels 3aremote sensing1 aWei, Zhihui 1 aXu, Yang 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Apr. 28, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120913953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007600169300001600245520165300261592002801914650002201942650002101964650001001985650001001995650001302005650001002018650001502028650001702043650000902060650001602069650001902085650001402104650001402118650001102132650001302143650003102156650000902187650001202196650001902208650001102227650001102238650001202249650001502261650001902276650001102295651001002306653001202316653001502328653001402343700001902357700001702376700001502393700002102408700002002429700001602449773015702465856008602622852000902708655001202717IND60721285920221117195400.0201224e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072128592DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-970X.2017.00037.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhutia, L.D.10aOccurrence of Newcastle disease in poultry population of Mizoram, India  ap. 151-154.  aA study was undertaken to survey the prevalence of viral diseases of poultry in Mizoram during March, 2013 to February, 2014. Out of 476 poultry carcasses examined, 208(43.69%) cases were diagnosed as viral diseases. Forty cases of Newcastle disease (8.40%) could be diagnosed based on the clinical history, signs, gross and histopathology, and confirmed by HA and HI tests with detection of the viral antigen. All age groups of birds were affected with morbidity and mortality rates of 35–50% and 25–35%, respectively and the highest incidence during the winter season followed by rainy and summer seasons. Most common signs were depression, emaciation, greenish or white diarrhea and edema of the head, face and wattles, while some birds developed respiratory signs like sneezing, gasping, nasal discharge and coughing. Post-mortem findings included pin-point haemorrhages at the tips of the proventriculus glands, hemorrhagic ulcers in intestinal wall and caecal tonsils, hemorrhagic tracheitis with congestion and catarrhal exudates. The spleen was enlarged, friable and appeared dark red or mottled, while the kidneys were enlarged, congested and swollen with urate deposition. Significant microscopic changes were haemorrhages and necrosis of the proventriculus mucosa with mononuclear cell infiltration. Caecal tonsil revealed haemorrhages, infiltration of heterophils in the lamina propria, lymphoid depletion and formation of germinal centres. There were sloughing of tracheal mucosa with loss of cilia and congestion, while brain sections revealed non-suppurative encephalitis, neuronal degeneration, gliosis and perivascular cuffing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNewcastle disease 3aanimal pathology 3abrain 3acecum 3adiarrhea 3aedema 3aemaciation 3aencephalitis 3aface 3aheterophils 3ahistopathology 3amorbidity 3amortality 3amucosa 3anecrosis 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3anose 3apoultry 3aproventriculus 3aspleen 3asummer 3atonsils 3atracheitis 3aviral antigens 3awinter 3aIndia 0aMizoram 0aoccurrence 0apathology1 aRajkhowa, T.K.1 aRavindran, R1 aArya, R.S.1 aRoychoudhury, P.1 aMandakini, R.K.1 aSingh, Y.D.0 tIndian journal of veterinary pathology.g2017 June, v. 41, no. 2 p.151-154dIndian Association of Veterinary PathologistswJournal:1998x0973-970X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0973-970X.2017.00037.23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245009300214506007600307520094100383536004601324592002801370596008401398506003701482650001901519650002701538650001801565650001201583650001201595650001801607650001701625650002501642650002801667650002201695650001401717653004101731653002501772653002201797653001701819700001901836773011901855856008501974852000902059655001202068IND60691027920221207072459.0200427e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069102792DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2018.14322292doi7 aPMC61032772pmcid7 a293705732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTripathi, Diwaker12aA crosstalk between extracellular ATP and jasmonate signaling pathways for plant defense  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDamage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as extracellular ATP, act as danger signals in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Extracellular ATP is perceived by a plant purinoceptor, P2 receptor kinase 1 (P2K1), inducing downstream signaling for defense responses. How ATP induces these defense responses has not been well studied. A recent study by Tripathi et al. (Plant Physiology, 176: 511–523, 2018) revealed a synergistic interaction between extracellular ATP and jasmonate (JA) signaling during plant defense responses. This signaling crosstalk requires the formation of secondary messengers, i.e., cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. This finding has given a new direction towards understanding the defense signals activated by DAMPs. In this addendum, we discuss possible insights into how extracellular ATP signaling interacts with the JA signaling pathway for plant defense responses.  aNational Science Foundation, IOS-1557813.  aPublisher supplied data  aIOS-1557813cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/5011000089820 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabiotic stress 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiotic stress 3acalcium 3aenzymes 3ajasmonic acid 3anitric oxide 3apurinergic receptors 3areactive oxygen species 3asecond messengers 3asynergism 0aDamage-associated molecular patterns 0apurinergic signaling 0aextracellular ATP 0aJAZ proteins1 aTanaka, Kiwamu0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2018 May 4, v. 13, no. 5 p.e1432229-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2018.14322293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010600166300002000272520160400292592002801896596006901924650001401993650001402007650001602021650001602037650001702053650001302070650002402083650002302107650002702130650002102157650001502178650001402193650001302207650002002220650001002240650001102250650001402261650001302275700001802288700001902306700001502325700002602340700001302366700001602379700001802395700001702413700001802430700001302448773015502461856008302616852000902699655001202708IND60752867920221123030919.0220411e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075286792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14853-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuanliang10aLong-term copper exposure promotes apoptosis and autophagy by inducing oxidative stress in pig testis  ap. 55140-55153.  aCopper (Cu) is a heavy metal which is being used widely in the industry and agriculture. However, the overuse of Cu makes it a common environmental pollutant. In order to investigate the testicular toxicity of Cu, the pigs were divided into three groups and were given Cu at 10 (control), 125, and 250 mg/kg body weight, respectively. The feeding period was 80 days. Serum hormone results showed that Cu exposure decreased the concentrations of follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and increased the concentration of thyroxine (T4). Meanwhile, Cu exposure upregulated the expression of Cu transporter mRNA (Slc31a1, ATP7A, and ATP7B) in the testis, leading to increase in testicular Cu and led to spermatogenesis disorder. The Cu exposure led to an increased expression of antioxidant-related mRNA (Gpx4, TRX, HO-1, SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, CAT), along with increase in the MDA concentration in the testis. In LG group, the ROS in the testis was significantly increased. Furthermore, the apoptotic-related mRNA (Caspase3, Caspase8, Caspase9, Bax, Cytc, Bak1, APAF1, p53) and protein (Active Caspase3) and the autophagy-related mRNA (Beclin1, ATG5, LC3, and LC3B) expression increased after Cu exposure. The mitochondrial membrane potential in the testicular tissue decreased, while the number of apoptotic cells increased, as a result of oxidative stress. Overall, our study indicated that the Cu exposure promotes testicular apoptosis and autophagy by mediating oxidative stress, which is considered as the key mechanism causing testicular degeneration as well as dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data  a2021A151501047cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3aheavy metals 3aindustry 3aluteinizing hormone 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoxidative stress 3apollutants 3apollution 3aresearch 3aspermatogenesis 3aswine 3atestes 3athyroxine 3atoxicity1 aChen, Hanming1 aLiao, Jianzhao1 aChen, Keli1 aJaved, Muhammad Tariq1 aQiao, Na1 aZeng, Qiwen1 aLiu, Bingxian1 aYi, Jiangnan1 aTang, Zhaoxin1 aLi, Ying0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 39 p.55140-55153dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14853-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245005900169300001600228520108600244592002801330650002201358650002101380650001601401650001201417650001101429650002201440650001601462650001001478650000901488650000901497650001401506650001401520650001301534650001601547650001201563651001501575653000901590653002501599653001401624653002101638700002001659700001901679700002001698773015701718856008601875852000901961655001201970IND60721286220221117195357.0201224e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072128622DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-970X.2017.00040.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, M.H.10aOutbreak of an unknown epidemic in ducks in Bangladesh  ap. 160-162.  aIn Bangladesh, in 2016 a disease outbreak was recorded in an epidemic form involving young, pullets and egg laying duck flocks. Clinical features were very distinct in the affected birds with a morbidity level <90% with circling gait and torticollis in the young, cessation of egglaying for three to five weeks. On post-mortem examination, haemorrhagic ovaritis was the main alteration recorded in the laying ducks with prolapse of cloaca in the dead female. Histo-pathologically, changes were mainly haemorrhages which was characterized by homogenous eosinophilic content in the Graafian follicles with no infiltration of reactive cells outside the follicular tissues. Examination of cloacal swabs and or blood serum were found to be negative for Avain influenza and Newcastle disease. These ducks received all available routine vaccines against duck cholera and duck plague and drugs, but most of the affected flocks were destroyed due to the outbreaks. It was not possible to isolate any virus, however, these findings demonstrate emergence of a new virus in exotic duck breeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNewcastle disease 3aanimal pathology 3ablood serum 3acholera 3acloaca 3adisease outbreaks 3aduck plague 3aducks 3aeggs 3agait 3ainfluenza 3amorbidity 3anecropsy 3atorticollis 3aviruses 3aBangladesh 0aduck 0ahemorrhagic ovaritis 0apathology 0aunknown etiology1 aHossain, Mokbul1 aHossain, Iqbal1 aChowdhury, E.H.0 tIndian journal of veterinary pathology.g2017 June, v. 41, no. 2 p.160-162dIndian Association of Veterinary PathologistswJournal:1998x0973-970X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0973-970X.2017.00040.23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008800159520206000247592002802307650001502335650002802350650001602378650002302394650001902417650002602436650005002462650001902512650001102531650002402542651001602566700001602582700001802598700001902616700001702635700002302652773012802675856007502803852000902878655001202887IND60703984220221122060309.0200722e20200428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070398422DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120913982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoo, Cheolhee 10aEstimation of All-Weather 1 km MODIS Land Surface Temperature for Humid Summer Days  aLand surface temperature (LST) is used as a critical indicator for various environmental issues because it links land surface fluxes with the surface atmosphere. Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometers (MODIS) 1 km LSTs have been widely utilized but have the serious limitation of not being provided under cloudy weather conditions. In this study, we propose two schemes to estimate all-weather 1 km Aqua MODIS daytime (1:30 p.m.) and nighttime (1:30 a.m.) LSTs in South Korea for humid summer days. Scheme 1 (S1) is a two-step approach that first estimates 10 km LSTs and then conducts the spatial downscaling of LSTs from 10 km to 1 km. Scheme 2 (S2), a one-step algorithm, directly estimates the 1 km all-weather LSTs. Eight advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR2) brightness temperatures, three MODIS-based annual cycle parameters, and six auxiliary variables were used for the LST estimation based on random forest machine learning. To confirm the effectiveness of each scheme, we have performed different validation experiments using clear-sky MODIS LSTs. Moreover, we have validated all-weather LSTs using bias-corrected LSTs from 10 in situ stations. In clear-sky daytime, the performance of S2 was better than S1. However, in cloudy sky daytime, S1 simulated low LSTs better than S2, with an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.6 °C compared to an average RMSE of 3.8 °C over 10 stations. At nighttime, S1 and S2 demonstrated no significant difference in performance both under clear and cloudy sky conditions. When the two schemes were combined, the proposed all-weather LSTs resulted in an average R² of 0.82 and 0.74 and with RMSE of 2.5 °C and 1.4 °C for daytime and nighttime, respectively, compared to the in situ data. This paper demonstrates the ability of the two different schemes to produce all-weather dynamic LSTs. The strategy proposed in this study can improve the applicability of LSTs in a variety of research and practical fields, particularly for areas that are very frequently covered with clouds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3acloud cover 3aforestry equipment 3aimage analysis 3amicrowave radiometers 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aremote sensing 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3aSouth Korea1 aIm, Jungho 1 aCho, Dongjin 1 aYokoya, Naoto 1 aXia, Junshi 1 aBechtel, Benjamin 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Apr. 28, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120913983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013100167300002000298520182300318592002802141650001302169650002002182650001202202650001702214650001702231650002002248650001102268650001002279650001402289650001302303650001502316650002302331651001002354700005602364700001302420700001902433700001802452700002002470773015502490856008302645852000902728655001202737IND60752868020221117181820.0220411e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075286802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14719-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yongjia10aAnalysis of spatiotemporal variation of formaldehyde column concentration in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and its influencing factors  ap. 55233-55251.  aBased on the formaldehyde (HCHO) inversion data of OMI satellite sensor from 2009 to 2019, this paper discusses the spatial and temporal distribution of HCHO column concentration over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the past 11 years and explores the factors affecting the dynamic distribution of atmospheric HCHO column concentration over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in combination with meteorological, aerosol, ozone, and other data. The results show that the average concentration of HCHO column in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is 8.84 × 10¹⁵ molec/cm² in the past 11 years, which is relatively low, and the annual variation rate of HCHO column is 7.79%, showing a slight upward trend. The seasonal changes show a trend of Autumn < Winter < Spring < Summer. The monthly variation is more obvious than the seasonal variation. The spatial distribution showed a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest. Residual analysis showed that 83.77% of the area was frequently affected by natural factors. Correlation analysis found that the natural factors including precipitation, air temperature, and atmospheric activities for a greater influence on the column experiment the distribution of the concentration of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and human factors, such as biomass, the distribution of fossil fuel combustion, and emissions to HCHO, play a promoting role. Through the backward trajectory analysis, it can be seen that the transboundary atmospheric transport activity has a prominent contribution to the distribution of HCHO in the southern region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Hurst index study found that in the future, the concentration of HCHO column in 53.03% of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau will decrease, but in some areas, such as the eastern and northern parts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, it will increase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair temperature 3abiomass 3aformaldehyde 3afossil fuels 3afuel combustion 3ahumans 3aozone 3apollution 3aresearch 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3aChina1 aJu, Tianzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2332-57001 aShi, Yao1 aWang, QingQing1 aLi, FengShuai1 aZhang, Guoqiang0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 39 p.55233-55251dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14719-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001900192245008300211506007600294520081000370536033101180592002801511596006001539596010101599596011101700506003701811650001601848650001201864650001201876650002801888650001301916653001001929653000801939653000801947653002501955653002001980653002602000700002102026700001902047700001602066700001902082773012002101856008502221852000902306655001202315IND60691028220221207141614.0200427e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069102822DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2018.14352282doi7 aPMC58465612pmcid7 a293888782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Maruya10aAutophosphorylation site Y428 is essential for the in vivo activation of CERK1  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAutophosphorylation of PRR is a critical event for the activation of immune signaling in plant. However, the detailed function of these phosphorylation sites is still not well understood. We analyzed the function of an autophosphorylation site of Arabidopsis CERK1, Y428, in immune signaling. Biochemical characterization of CERK1 mutants transiently expressed in N. benthamiana indicated that Y428 plays a crucial role for the in vivo activation of CERK1, differently from the previous observation by the in vitro kinase assay with its cytoplasmic domain. Similar discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo kinase assay was also reported for the corresponding phosphorylation site of EFR, suggesting that these conserved tyrosine residues play important roles for the activation of both RD and non-RD RLKs.  aThis work was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (26650104 to N.S.) and Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (25114516 to N.S. and15H01240 to H.K.), MEXT-Supported Program for the Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities 2014–2018 (S1411023) from MEXT, Japan to H.K.  aPublisher supplied data  a26650104 to N.S.cGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research  a25114516 to N.S. and 15H01240 to H.K.cGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas  aS1411023cMEXT-Supported Program for the Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities 2014–20180 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aenzymes 3amutants 3aprotein phosphorylation 3atyrosine 0aCERK1 0aPRR 0aRLK 0aphosphorylation site 0aphosphotyrosine 0aNicotiana benthamiana1 aWatanabe, Takumi1 aYoshida, Issei1 aKaku, Hanae1 aShibuya, Naoto0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2018 Feb. 1, v. 13, no. 2 p.e1435228-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2018.14352283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245020300168300001600371520151900387592002801906650001601934650002001950650001701970650001201987650002101999650002102020650001602041650002802057650001602085650001302101650001702114650004302131650001202174650001502186650002102201650001902222650002202241650002402263650002002287650001302307650001302320653002702333653003002360653002102390653001902411700002002430700002102450700002902471700002002500773011402520856008402634852000902718655001202727IND60602326420221119190507.0180711e20150828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060232642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.07.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDago, Àngela10aCarbon nanotubes and graphene modified screen-printed carbon electrodes as sensitive sensors for the determination of phytochelatins in plants using liquid chromatography with amperometric detection  ap. 210-217.  aNanomaterials are of great interest for the development of electrochemical sensors. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene were used to modify the working electrode surface of different screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) with the aim of improving the sensitivity of the SPCE and comparing it with the conventional glassy carbon electrode. To assay the usability of these sensors, a HPLC methodology with amperometric detection was developed to analyze several phytochelatins in plants of Hordeum vulgare and Glycine max treated with Hg(II) or Cd(II) giving detection limits in the low μmolL⁻¹ range.Phytochelatins are low molecular weight peptides with the general structure γ-(Glu-Cys)n-Gly (n=2–5) which are synthesized in plants in the presence of heavy metal ions. These compounds can chelate heavy metal ions by the formation of complexes which, are transported to the vacuoles, where the toxicity is not threatening. For this reason phytochelatins are essential in the detoxification of heavy metal ions in plants.The developed HPLC method uses a mobile phase of 1% of formic acid in water with KNO3 or NaCl (pH=2.00) and 1% of formic acid in acetonitrile. Electrochemical detection at different carbon-based electrodes was used. Among the sensors tested, the conventional glassy carbon electrode offers the best sensitivity although modification improves the sensitivity of the SPCE. Glutathione and several isoforms of phytochelatin two were found in plant extracts of both studied species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aHordeum vulgare 3aacetonitrile 3acadmium 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrochemistry 3aformic acid 3aglassy carbon electrode 3aglutathione 3agraphene 3aheavy metals 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amercury 3ametal ions 3amolecular weight 3aphytochelatins 3apotassium nitrate 3asensors (equipment) 3asodium chloride 3atoxicity 3avacuoles 0aAmperometric detection 0aScreen-printed electrodes 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aPhytochelatins1 aNavarro, Javier1 aAriño, Cristina1 aDíaz-Cruz, José Manuel1 aEsteban, Miquel0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 Aug. 28, v. 1409 p.210-217dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.07.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013300169300001600302520107800318592002801396650001701424650002201441650001201463650001101475650001601486650001401502650001401516653001701530653001501547653001501562653002101577653003001598653002801628700002201656700001901678700003101697700002301728700002101751700002001772773012401792856008401916852000902000655001202009IND60526926120221122103244.0190411e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052692612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2016.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHope, Andrew G.10aRevision of widespread red squirrels (genus: Tamiasciurus) highlights the complexity of speciation within North American forests  ap. 170-182.  aIntegration of molecular methods, ecological modeling, and statistical hypothesis testing are increasing our understanding of differentiation within species and phylogenetic relationships among species by revealing environmental connections to evolutionary processes. Within mammals, novel diversity is being discovered and characterized as more complete geographic sampling is coupled with newer multi-disciplinary approaches. North American red squirrels exemplify a forest obligate genus whose species are monitored as indicators of forest ecosystem condition, yet phylogenetic relationships reflecting evolutionary history within this genus remain tentative. Through testing of competing systematic and niche-based divergence hypotheses, we recognize three species, Tamiasciurus douglasii, T. hudsonicus, and T. fremonti. Our data provide evidence of regional differences in evolutionary dynamics and continental gradients of complexity that are important both for future management and for investigating multiple pathways that can lead to the formation of new species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTamiasciurus 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3amodels 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3asquirrels 0aBoreal biome 0aQuaternary 0aSky island 0aSoutheast Alaska 0aSpeciation with gene flow 0aSpecies tree estimation1 aMalaney, Jason L.1 aBell, Kayce C.1 aSalazar-Miralles, Fernando1 aChavez, Andreas S.1 aBarber, Brian R.1 aCook, Joseph A.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2016 July, v. 100 p.170-182dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2016.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014000168300001600308520134400324592002801668650001501696650002401711650001301735650002001748650002001768650001001788650001501798650001201813650002001825650002301845651001601868700002401884773011501908856008102023852000902104655001202113IND60439380820221121214744.0151024e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043938082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-005-1536-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJonsson, Mattias10aInsect Colonisation of Fruiting Bodies of the Wood-decaying Fungus Fomitopsis pinicola at Different Distances from an Old-growth Forest  ap. 295-309.  aWe studied the colonisation rate of insects inhabiting fruiting bodies of the wood-decaying fungus Fomitopsis pinicola both within and at different distances (up to 1610 m) from an old-growth forest reserve. The colonisation rate of most species was not affected by the distance from the reserve, and none of the species were affected by the size of local sources of fruiting bodies in the managed forest. We suggest that many insect species inhabiting fruiting bodies of wood-decaying fungi can colonise fruiting bodies at a high enough rate to persist in managed forests of Fennoscandia. However, the colonisation rates of the fungivorous beetle Cis quadridens and the predatory fly Medetera apicalis were negatively affected by distance from the reserve. Cis quadridens is rare in many managed forests, but often quite common at sites with high substrate densities. The rarity of this species may therefore be due to weak ability to colonize distant patches. The same may also be true for M. apicalis, but less is known about the biology of this species. Medetera apicalis was the most common insect predator in the old-growth forest, but it was rare at the largest distances from it in the managed forest. Therefore, it seems likely that the overall pressure from natural enemies significantly declined with distance from the reserve.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aFomitopsis pinicola 3aMedetera 3aforest reserves 3afruiting bodies 3afungi 3afungivores 3ainsects 3anatural enemies 3aold-growth forests 3aScandinavia1 aNordlander, Göran,0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2006 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.295-309dKluwer Academic Publishersx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-005-1536-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04151naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245021800167300001600385520271200401592002803113650002003141650000803161650001503169650002003184650001003204650001203214650001703226650002503243650001403268650002503282653002403307653001803331653001703349653001803366653001603384653002503400700002103425700002303446700001903469773012403488856008403612852000903696655001203705IND60526926320221122103312.0190411e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052692632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2016.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendes, Joana10aEvaluating the phylogenetic signal limit from mitogenomes, slow evolving nuclear genes, and the concatenation approach. New insights into the Lacertini radiation using fast evolving nuclear genes and species trees  ap. 254-267.  aEstimating the phylogeny of lacertid lizards, and particularly the tribe Lacertini has been challenging, possibly due to the fast radiation of this group resulting in a hard polytomy. However this is still an open question, as concatenated data primarily from mitochondrial markers have been used so far whereas in a recent phylogeny based on a compilation of these data within a squamate supermatrix the basal polytomy seems to be resolved.In this study, we estimate phylogenetic relationships between all Lacertini genera using for the first time DNA sequences from five fast evolving nuclear genes (acm4, mc1r, pdc, βfib and reln) and two mitochondrial genes (nd4 and 12S). We generated a total of 529 sequences from 88 species and used Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference methods based on concatenated multilocus dataset as well as a coalescent-based species tree approach with the aim of (i) shedding light on the basal relationships of Lacertini (ii) assessing the monophyly of genera which were previously questioned, and (iii) discussing differences between estimates from this and previous studies based on different markers, and phylogenetic methods.Results uncovered (i) a new phylogenetic clade formed by the monotypic genera Archaeolacerta, Zootoca, Teira and Scelarcis; and (ii) support for the monophyly of the Algyroides clade, with two sister species pairs represented by western (A. marchi and A. fitzingeri) and eastern (A. nigropunctatus and A. moreoticus) lineages. In both cases the members of these groups show peculiar morphology and very different geographical distributions, suggesting that they are relictual groups that were once diverse and widespread. They probably originated about 11–13 million years ago during early events of speciation in the tribe, and the split between their members is estimated to be only slightly older. This scenario may explain why mitochondrial markers (possibly saturated at higher divergence levels) or slower nuclear markers used in previous studies (likely lacking enough phylogenetic signal) failed to recover these relationships.Finally, the phylogenetic position of most remaining genera was unresolved, corroborating the hypothesis of a hard polytomy in the Lacertini phylogeny due to a fast radiation. This is in agreement with all previous studies but in sharp contrast with a recent squamate megaphylogeny. We show that the supermatrix approach may provide high support for incorrect nodes that are not supported either by original sequence data or by new data from this study. This finding suggests caution when using megaphylogenies to integrate inter-generic relationships in comparative ecological and evolutionary studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aDNA 3aLacertidae 3adata collection 3agenes 3alizards 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3amonophyly 3anucleotide sequences 0aLacertini radiation 0aHard polytomy 0aSpecies tree 0aConcatenation 0anuclear DNA 0aMultilocus phylogeny1 aHarris, D.

Bismuth-based compounds are used extensively as medicines for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders including dyspepsia, gastric ulcers and H. pylori infections. Recently, its medicinal application was further extended to potential treatments of viral infection, multidrug resistant microbial infections, cancer and also imaging, drug delivery and biosensing. In this review we have highlighted the unique chemistry and biological chemistry of bismuth-209 as a prelude to sections covering the unique antibacterial activity of bismuth including a description of research undertaken to date to elucidate key molecular mechanisms of action against H. pylori, the development of novel compounds to treat infection from microbes beyond H. pylori and the significant role bismuth compounds can play as resistance breakers. Furthermore we have provided an account of the potential therapeutic application of bismuth-213 in targeted alpha therapy as well as a summary of the biomedical applications of bismuth-based nanoparticles and composites. Ultimately this review aims to provide the state of the art, highlight the untapped biomedical potential of bismuth and encourage original contributions to this exciting and important field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aantibacterial properties 3abismuth 3adrugs 3agastrointestinal system 3aindigestion 3amedicinal properties 3amultiple drug resistance 3atherapeutics1 aLi, Hongyan1 aWerrett, Melissa V.1 aAndrews, Philip C.1 aSun, Hongzhe0 tChemical Society reviews.g2021 Nov. 1, v. 50, no. 21 p.12037-12069dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cs00031k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010900172300001600281520176400297592002802061650001202089650002302101650002002124650002002144650002002164650001802184650001202202650003302214650000902247650001902256650001402275650001502289651002002304653002702324653002802351653002402379653001902403653002502422653002202447700001802469700001902487700001902506700003202525773012402557856008402681852000902765655001202774IND60526926420221122103250.0190411e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052692642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2016.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZáveská, Eliška10aHybridization among distantly related species: Examples from the polyploid genus Curcuma (Zingiberaceae)  ap. 303-321.  aDiscerning relationships among species evolved by reticulate and/or polyploid evolution is not an easy task, although it is widely discussed. The economically important genus Curcuma (ca. 120 spp.; Zingiberaceae), broadly distributed in tropical SE Asia, is a particularly interesting example of a group of palaeopolyploid origin whose evolution is driven mainly by hybridization and polyploidization. Although a phylogeny and a new infrageneric classification of Curcuma, based on commonly used molecular markers (ITS and cpDNA), have recently been proposed, significant evolutionary questions remain unresolved. We applied a multilocus approach and a combination of modern analytical methods to this genus to distinguish causes of gene tree incongruence and to identify hybrids and their parental species. Five independent regions of nuclear DNA (DCS, GAPDH, GLOBOSA3, LEAFY, ITS) and four non-coding cpDNA regions (trnL-trnF, trnT-trnL, psbA-trnH and matK), analysed as a single locus, were employed to construct a species tree and hybrid species trees using *BEAST and STEM-hy. Detection of hybridogenous species in the dataset was also conducted using the posterior predictive checking approach as implemented in JML. The resulting species tree outlines the relationships among major evolutionary lineages within Curcuma, which were previously unresolved or which conflicted depending upon whether they were based on ITS or cpDNA markers. Moreover, by using the additional markers in tests of plausible topologies of hybrid species trees for C. vamana, C. candida, C. roscoeana and C. myanmarensis suggested by previous molecular and morphological evidence, we found strong evidence that all the species except C. candida are of subgeneric hybrid origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurcuma 3aanalytical methods 3achloroplast DNA 3adata collection 3agenetic markers 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aloci 3anuclear genome 3aphylogeny 3apolyploidy 3aSouth East Asia 0aNuclear low-copy genes 0aMultilocus species tree 0aHybrid species tree 0aCurcuma vamana 0aCurcuma myanmarensis 0aCurcuma roscoeana1 aFér, Tomáš1 aŠída, Otakar1 aMarhold, Karol1 aLeong-Škorničková, Jana,0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2016 July, v. 100 p.303-321dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2016.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03628naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245015000162300002000312520224600332592002802578650001202606650001202618650001302630650001802643650002702661650002102688650002402709650002502733650001302758650001102771650001102782651001802793651001002811651002402821651002002845651002002865700001402885700001602899700002002915773015502935856008303090852000903173655001203182IND60752868520221121201024.0220411e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075286852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14703-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, K.10aDecadal variations in natural and anthropogenic aerosol optical depth over the Bay of Bengal: the influence of pollutants from Indo-GangeticPlain  ap. 55202-55219.  aPerennial increase in atmospheric pollution over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and South China Sea is reported due to increase in human population and industrial activity in South and Southeast Asia. Based on total aerosol optical depth (AOD) derived from MODIS (moderate resolution imaging resolution imaging spectroradiometer), natural and anthropogenic fractions were derived. The seasonality and spatial variability in rate of increase in total, natural, and anthropogenic AOD fractions were examined over the BoB using data collected between 2001 and 2019. Both total and anthropogenic AOD displayed statistically significant rate of increase in the northwest BoB (NWB) and western coastal BoB (WCB) regions during 2001 to 2019 whereas the long-term changes are insignificant in the other regions of BoB. Significant increase in AOD in the NWB and WCB regions is mainly contributed by dominant outflow of anthropogenic emissions from Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) area of Indian subcontinent. The magnitude of AOD decreased by half from northern BoB to equatorial region due to increase in distance from the source region. The contribution of anthropogenic AOD was >70% to total AOD with higher contribution during winter and lower during summer. The rate of increase in both total and anthropogenic AOD was close to 0.104 and 0.099 per decade in the NWB and 0.069 and 0.059 per decade in the WCB region between 2001 and 2019. The rate of increase in total and anthropogenic AOD decreased from 2001–2009 (0.164 and 0.115 per decade respectively) to 2010–2019 (0.068 and 0.076 per decade respectively) in the NWB region. Significant increase in anthropogenic AOD by 50 and 30% was observed during El Niño and La Niña periods respectively than normal year in both northwest BoB (NWB) and western coastal (WCB) regions due to change in strength and direction of winds. Although some fraction of anthropogenic AOD is found over the entire BoB, significant rate of increase in anthropogenic AOD is found only about 23% of the area of BoB than hitherto reported as entire BoB. The impact of atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic aerosols on biogeochemical processes, such as primary production and ocean acidification, needs further evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aaerosols 3aair pollution 3aatmospheric deposition 3ahuman population 3aocean acidification 3aprimary productivity 3aresearch 3asummer 3awinter 3aBay of Bengal 3aIndia 3aIndo-Gangetic Plain 3aSouth China Sea 3aSouth East Asia1 aRao, V.D.1 aSridevi, B.1 aSarma, V.V.S.S.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 39 p.55202-55219dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14703-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245019300165300001600358520151600374592002801890650002801918650002501946650001601971650001001987650001201997650002202009650001002031650001002041650001102051650001202062650001002074650001802084650002202102650001202124650001402136650003002150650002302180650002202203650001202225650001602237650001402253650002402267700001802291700002502309773010702334856008102441852000902522655001202531IND60123675520221117233958.0150329e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012367552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10695-015-0026-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRawat, Arpana10aMolecular cloning, sequencing and phylogeny of vasotocin receptor genes in the air-breathing catfish Heteropneustes fossilis with sex dimorphic and seasonal variations in tissue expression  ap. 509-532.  aVasotocin (VT) is the ortholog of vasopressin (VP) in non-mammalian vertebrates and is known for multiple functions. Teleost fishes have a complete repertoire of known VP/VT receptor subtypes (vasopressin type, VR): two V1A subtypes (V1Aa and V1Ab or V1a1 and V1a2) and five V2 subtypes (V2A1, V1A2, V2B1, V2B2 and V2C). Full-length cDNAs of v1a1, v1a2 and v2 (v2a1) with ORFs of 1,308, 1,137 and 1,527 bp, respectively, were cloned and characterized in the catfish Heteropneustes fossilis (Siluriformes, Ostariophysi). BLAST analysis revealed that the genes encoded three VT receptors, V1a1, V1a2 and V2 of 436, 379 and 509 amino acid residues, respectively. The predicted proteins showed typical features of the seven-transmembrane domain receptor core structure with hallmark triplets Asp-Arg-Tyr/Asp-Arg-His (DRY/DRH) and the variable intracellular loop III of vertebrate neurohypophysial hormone receptors. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced protein sequences revealed that they clustered with the V1Aa, V1Ab and V2A1, respectively, of other teleosts. The V2R has a sequence identity of 70–76 % with V2A1 than with the V2B type (sequence identity 43–49 %). Semiquantitative PCR analysis showed that the receptor gene transcripts were expressed ubiquitously in the tissues examined (brain, pituitary, gonads, liver, muscle, kidney and gills) and displayed sex and seasonal fluctuations in a tissue-specific manner. The results form a basis for functional studies on the VT receptors in the catfish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeteropneustes fossilis 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abrain 3acatfish 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3agills 3agonads 3akidneys 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3amuscles 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseasonal variation 3asequence analysis 3atissues 3avasopressin 3avasotocin 3avasotocin receptors1 aChaube, Radha1 aJoy, Keerikkattil P.0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2015 Apr., v. 41, no. 2 p.509-532dSpringer-Verlagx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-015-0026-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001900192245005000211506007600261520115200337536022201489592002801711596006401739596008601803596007401889506003701963650001602000650001502016650001102031650001002042650002702052650001102079650001202090650001402102650001802116650002302134650001402157650001602171650002002187650001102207653002402218653002102242653001002263700002402273773012002297856008502417852000902502655001202511IND60691028820221207065634.0200427e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069102882DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2018.14429752doi7 aPMC59277102pmcid7 a294653182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaekawa, Shugo10aNucleolar stress and sugar response in plants  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe processes involved in ribosome biogenesis, including synthesis of ribosomal proteins, ribosome biogenesis-related factors, and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), must be coordinately orchestrated in response to changes in energy supply. In animal cells, defects in ribosome biogenesis induce a nucleolar stress response through the p53-mediated pathway. Our recent finding that an essential, sugar-inducible Arabidopsis gene, APUM24, encoded a pre-rRNA processing factor allowed the relationships between rRNA biogenesis, nucleolar stress, sugar response, and growth regulation to be understood in plants. A knockdown mutant of APUM24 developed sugar-dependent phenotypes including pre-rRNA processing defects, reductions in nucleolar size, and limited promotion of leaf and root growth. Alongside the absence of plant p53 homologs and the synchronous sugar-induced expression of ribosome biogenesis-related genes, these findings suggest the following hypothesis. Sugar supply may enhance ribosome biogenesis defects, leading to p53-independent induction of nucleolar stress responses that include negative regulation of growth and development in plants.  aThis work was supported in part by JST (Japan Science and Technology Agency) CREST Grant Number JPMJCR15O5 and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP25252014, JP26221103 to SY and by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP15J08368 to SM.  aPublisher supplied data  aJPMJCR15O5cJST (Japan Science and Technology Agency) CREST  aJP25252014aJP26221103 to SYcJSPS KAKENHIdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  aJP15J08368 to SMcJSPS KAKENHIdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/5011000016910 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3abiogenesis 3aenergy 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3aleaves 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes 3aroot growth 3astress response 3asugars 0aRibosome biogenesis 0anucleolar stress 0asugar1 aYanagisawa, Shuichi0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 13, no. 3 p.e1442975-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2018.14429753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245018100165300002000346520117500366592002801541596007001569650002301639650002201662650003001684650001401714650002701728650002101755651001001776700001601786700002001802700001401822700001701836700001701853700001901870700001401889773015501903856008302058852000902141655001202150IND60752868720221117181847.0220411e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075286872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14648-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Shi-Chun10aDo foreign direct investment and environmental regulation improve green technology innovation? An empirical analysis based on panel data from the Chinese manufacturing industry  ap. 55302-55314.  aThe environmental regulation and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow have an important impact on the progress of green technology. This study analyzes the impacts of environmental regulation and FDI on green technology innovation (GTI) based on the panel data of 13 Chinese manufacturing sectors. The results of static panel regression show that the environmental regulation has a positive impact on GTI, while the FDI has a negative impact. The results of the panel threshold model reveal that the effect of environmental regulation on GTI presents a nonlinear shape. The negative effect of FDI on GTI is strengthened when the environmental regulation exceeds its threshold. Increasing FDI inflow can inhibit the effect of environmental regulation. Meanwhile, a strict environmental regulation can enhance the inhibiting effect of FDI on GTI. The FDI inflow into high-tech manufacturing sectors has a less negative impact on GTI than the FDI inflow into low-tech sectors in the case of the enhancement of environmental regulation. This study provides some implications for the formulation of environmental regulation and the FDI inflow into China to improve the GTI.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020ZDPYMS44cFundamental Research Funds for Central Universities 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental law 3aforeign direct investment 3apollution 3asustainable technology 3athreshold models 3aChina1 aLi, Yun-Fan1 aZhang, Jing-Nan1 aWang, Yan1 aMa, Xiao-Xue1 aLiu, Hong-Yu1 aWang, Hai-Ning1 aTao, Yuan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 39 p.55302-55314dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14648-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245023000159300001600389520121500405592002801620650001201648650001101660650002001671650001301691650001201704650001201716650004401728650001701772650001201789650001301801650001801814650001601832700001801848700001501866700001601881700001801897773015001915856007702065852000902142655001202151IND60521500320221120162043.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052150032DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1976-07052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumann, D.10aAssoziationsreaktionen von Tetrakis(arylisonitril)kobalt(II), -Rhodium(I) und Rhodium(III)-Komplexen in Lösung.bAssociation Reactions of Tetrakis(arylisonitrile)-cobalt(II), Rhodium(I) and Rhodium(III) Complexes in Solution  ap. 912-921.  aInvestigations on several tetrakis(arylisonitrile)-metal complexes of general stoichiometry M(CNR)₄ⁿ⁺Xₙ⁻ with M = Rh(I), Rh(III), [n =1], [n = 3] or Co(II), [n = 2], R = p-tolyl, p-N,N-dimethylaminophenyl, p-nitrophenyl, e. g. and X⁻ = iodide, ClO₄⁻, [B(C₆H₅)₄]⁻ e. g. are described. The paramagnetic complexes of stoichiometry Co(CNR)₄I₂ dimerize in organic solvents to yield dinuclear diamagnetic cations with linear iodide bridges. The amount of association depends on the iodide content and on experimental parameters like temperature and/or concentration and can be followed by IR, ESR and/or NMR techniques.

Lon expression is induced by various stimuli, including hypoxia and reactive oxygen species, and provides protection against cell stress. Lon down-regulation is associated with ageing and with cell senescence, while up-regulation is observed in tumour cells, and is correlated with a more aggressive phenotype of cancer. Lon up-regulation contributes to metabolic reprogramming observed in cancer, favours the switch from a respiratory to a glycolytic metabolism, helping cancer cell survival in the tumour microenvironment, and contributes to epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Silencing of Lon, or pharmacological inhibition of its activity, causes cell death in various cancer cells. Thus, Lon can be included in the growing class of proteins that are not responsible for oncogenic transformation, but that are essential for survival and proliferation of cancer cells, and that can be considered as a new target for development of anticancer drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3acell death 3acell senescence 3acell viability 3aevolution 3agene expression regulation 3aglycolysis 3ahypoxia 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species1 aGibellini, Lara1 aLiu, Yongzhang1 aXu, Shan1 aLü, Bin,1 aCossarizza, Andrea0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2015 Dec., v. 72, no. 24 p.4807-4824dSpringer International Publishingx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-015-2039-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011400162300001800276520111600294592002801410650002101438650002301459650001501482650002101497650001201518650001401530650001301544650004401557650002201601650001401623650001401637700002001651700002101671773012001692856007501812852000901887655001201896IND60549906220221119223452.0160909e20120907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054990622DNAL7 a10.1021/jo301341c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancesconi, Oscar10aSynthetic Tripodal Receptors for Carbohydrates. Pyrrole, a Hydrogen Bonding Partner for Saccharidic Hydroxyls  ap. 7548-7554.  aThe carbohydrate recognition properties of synthetic tripodal receptors relying on H-bonding interactions have highlighted the crucial role played by the functional groups matching saccharidic hydroxyls. Herein, pyrrole and pyridine, which emerged as two of the most effective H-bonding groups, were quantitatively compared through their isostructural substitution within the architecture of a shape-persistent bicyclic cage receptor. NMR and ITC binding studies gave for the pyrrolic receptor a 20-fold larger affinity toward octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside in CDCl₃, demonstrating the superior recognition properties of pyrrole under conditions in which differences would depend on the intrinsic binding ability of the two groups. The three-dimensional structures of the two glucoside complexes in solution were elucidated by combined NMR and molecular mechanics computational techniques, showing that the origin of the stability difference between the two closely similar complex structures resides in the ability of pyrrole to establish shorter/stronger H-bonds with the glucosidic ligand compared to pyridine.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3achemical reactions 3aglucosides 3ahydrogen bonding 3aligands 3amechanics 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic chemistry 3apyridines 3areceptors1 aGentili, Matteo1 aRoelens, Stefano0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2012 Sept. 07, v. 77, no. 17 p.7548-7554dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo301341c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013800164300001800302520156100320592002801881650001001909650001301919650001901932650001901951650001101970650001101981650000901992650001502001650001102016650001102027651001102038700001802049700001302067700001802080773012602098856008202224852000902306655001202315IND60592086220221117210207.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059208622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-015-2792-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Zhenming10aPotential climate effect of mineral aerosols over West Africa: Part II—contribution of dust and land cover to future climate change  ap. 2335-2353.  aMineral dust aerosols are an essential component of climate over West Africa, however, little work has been performed to investigate their contributions to potential climate change. A set of regional climate model experiments with and without mineral dust processes and land cover changes is performed to evaluate their climatic effects under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 for two global climate models. Results suggest surface warming to be in the range of 4–8 °C by the end of the century (2081–2100) over West Africa with respect to the present day (1981–2000). The presence of mineral dusts dampens the warming by 0.1–1 °C in all seasons. Accounting for changes in land cover enhances the warming over the north of Sahel and dampens it to the south in spring and summer; however, the magnitudes are smaller than those resulting from dusts. Overall dust loadings are projected to increase, with the greatest increase occurring over the Sahara and Sahel in summer. Accounting for land cover changes tends to reduce dust loadings over the southern Sahel. Future precipitation is projected to decrease by 5–40 % in the western Sahara and Sahel and increase by 10–150 % over the eastern Sahel and Guinea Coast in JJA. A dipole pattern of future precipitation changes is attributed to dust effects, with decrease in the north by 5–20 % and increase by 5–20 % in the south. Future changes in land cover result in a noisy non-significant response with a tendency for slight wetting in MAM, JJA, and SON and drying in DJF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSahel 3aaerosols 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acoasts 3adrying 3adust 3aland cover 3aspring 3asummer 3aGuinea1 aWang, Guiling1 aYu, Miao1 aPal, JeremyS.0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 Apr., v. 50, no. 7-8 p.2335-2353dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-015-2792-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01880naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245016800164300001800332520086000350592002801210650001101238650001801249650002201267650001401289700002001303700002601323700002501349773012001374856007501494852000901569655001201578IND60549906320221119223450.0160909e20120907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054990632DNAL7 a10.1021/jo30134352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Tong-jun,d1967-10aSynthesis of Multivalent Neoglyconjugates of MUC1 by the Conjugation of Carbohydrate-Centered, Triazole-Linked Glycoclusters to MUC1 Peptides Using Click Chemistry  ap. 7564-7571.  aThe efficient synthesis of multivalent neoglycoconjugates of MUC1 is reported, which utilizes Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuACC) of azide-functionalized GlcNAc-centered neoglycotetrasaccharide clusters to the MUC1 peptide sequence that was equipped with a propargylglycine residue for “click chemistry”. In turn the azido-GlcNAc-centered neoglycoclusters were assembled by reaction of a GlcNAc core containing peripheral propargyl functionalities with an appropriate azido-functionalized monosaccharide. The resulting suitably substituted tetrasaccharyl triazole cluster can be easily appended to a range of acetylene-functionalized peptides to produce neoglycoconjugates of biologically important glycopeptides. As proof of principle, the click neoglycoclusters prepared herein were ligated to the MUC1 peptide sequence.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3aglycopeptides 3aorganic chemistry 3atriazoles1 aYang, Sung-Hyun1 aWilliams, Geoffrey M.1 aBrimble, Margaret A.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2012 Sept. 07, v. 77, no. 17 p.7564-7571dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo30134353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013700162300001800299520119500317592002801512650002101540650001201561650001401573650002101587650002001608650002501628650001801653650001201671650002201683650001601705650001101721650001901732650001301751650001001764700001701774700001601791773011201807856008201919852000902001655001202010IND60675950120221119122339.0191112e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067595012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02759-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhu10aEffects of alkaline hydrogen peroxide treatment on cellulose accessibility of switchgrass pretreated by acidic deep eutectic solvent  ap. 9439-9446.  aCholine chloride: lactic acid (ChCl:LA) is a promising green acidic deep eutectic solvent for biomass fractionation and lignin extraction. This study reported an efficient ChCl:LA pretreatment for delignification and xylan solubilization from biomass. Under a mild condition (30 min, 130 °C), 83.4% lignin and 80.4% xylan were selectively removed from switchgrass. The pretreated switchgrass was highly enriched with cellulose (71.4%), but showed slow release of sugar. Its enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency was much improved by alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) post-treatment. Synergistic effects of AHP suggested that additional physical barrier to cellulose accessibility could be created through side reactions between LA and cellulose. After AHP post-treatment, cellulose became highly accessible and digestible, with 94.1% glucose yield even at a high solid loading (20%). ChCl:LA can be recycled and reused without conditioning although pretreatment effectiveness diminished gradually. Overall, an efficient ChCl:LA pretreatment was developed for biomass pretreatment, and possible interaction between LA and cellulose during the pretreatment can be decoupled by AHP post-treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3abiomass 3acellulose 3acholine chloride 3adelignification 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afractionation 3aglucose 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alactic acid 3alignin 3asolubilization 3asolvents 3axylan1 aSun, Yisheng1 aWan, Caixia0 tCellulose.g2019 Dec., v. 26, no. 18 p.9439-9446dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02759-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012000206520178800326592002802114650001502142650001502157650001402172650001502186650001302201650001202214650001702226650001102243650002502254650001502279650001402294650001902308650001302327650001802340650002202358650001902380650001102399650000702410650001702417650001302434650001402447650002002461650001102481650001302492650001402505650001602519651001102535653001702546653001702563653002302580653002202603700002002625700001602645773011402661856008302775852000902858655001202867IND60770912420221119002114.0220719e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077091242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2022.1022942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, F.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3374-418310aEcological assessment of recent anthropogenic impacts on an estuarine ecosystem based on benthic diatom assemblages  aUntil recently, Camamu Bay (CB), a tropical estuarine ecosystem of the northeast coast of Brazil, state of Bahia, was considered pristine. However, an explosive regional economic growth is increasingly pressuring CB. We used the structure of diatom assemblages to determine whether this economic growth has impacted this habitat. We sampled water and sediment to determine the structure of diatom assemblages and measure physicochemical variables, including nutrients concentrations, salinity, pH, conductivity, temperature, redox potential, suspended particulate matter, dissolved oxygen, and granulometry at each of 30 sampling stations. We produced the percentage of the 11 eutrophication or organic pollution indicator taxa identified (namely Achnanthes fogedii, Bacillaria paxillifera, Cocconeis placentula, Cyclotella striata, Cyclotella stylorum, Halamphora coffeaeformis, Opephora marina, Paralia sulcata var. coronata, Paralia sulcata var. radiata, Planothidium delicatulum, and Tabullaria waernii) for each sample and we also determined the potential correlations of diatom taxa with the physicochemical variables. Our results revealed five distinct diatom groups determined by different combinations of variables reflecting the influence of natural and anthropic factors along the salinity gradient and that salinity exerted the strongest structuring effect on the assemblages. Higher presences of eutrophication indicator species were found near the central areas of the bay and in intermediate areas of Serinhaém and Maraú rivers. Planktonic taxa (e.g., Paralia sulcata) of occurring in the Marau River’s indicated high nutrients loading and uncommon hydrodynamic conditions. Our results suggest CB is undergoing a degradation process due to the economic activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchnanthes 3aBacillaria 3aCocconeis 3aCyclotella 3aOpephora 3aParalia 3aPlanothidium 3acoasts 3aeconomic development 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3ahabitats 3ahydrodynamics 3aindicator species 3amarine science 3aoxygen 3apH 3aparticulates 3aplankton 3apollution 3aredox potential 3arivers 3asalinity 3asediments 3atemperature 3aBrazil 0aBioindicator 0aPhytobenthos 0aTropical limnology 0aAquatic ecosystem1 aCardozo, A.Y.V.1 aGomes, D.F.0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2022 May, v. 52 p.102294-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2022.1022943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011400170500001900284520128200303592002801585650001101613650002801624650002301652650001301675650001401688650001401702650001101716650001301727650003301740650001301773650001601786650001601802653002401818653002401842653003901866653002701905653002301932653002801955700005601983700001802039700002002057700005702077700005602134700001602190700001802206773010602224856008702330852000902417655001202426IND60722154220221119123436.0210603e20210320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072215422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1260902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomchuk, O.V.10aTemperature-dependent fractal structure of particle clusters in aqueous ferrofluids by small-angle scattering  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe heating effect in the temperature interval of 20―70 °C on the aggregate structure in aqueous ferrofluids is analyzed basing on the data of small-angle X-ray (SAXS) and neutron (SANS) scattering. Samples prepared according to the same stabilization procedure (double-layer surfactant coating) but with different dispersed magnetic materials (magnetite and cobalt ferrite) show different temperature sensitivity. A temperature-induced reorganization from developed aggregates to elongated chain-like aggregates is revealed by observing changes in the scattering curves, which are considered in the frame of the fractal concept. In addition to the determination of fractal dimension, the accent is also given to the cut-off effect in the scattering curves induced by the finite aggregate size. The scattering model is chosen from the available approaches basing on the analysis of the dimension-dependent universal parameter of the average aggregate form-factor, which continuously changes with varying temperature. The particle polydispersity is taken into account. The contrast variation based on isotope (H/D) substitution in solvent is done in SANS experiments to conclude about the structural organization of magnetic particles and surfactant component in the systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acobalt 3aferrimagnetic materials 3afractal dimensions 3aisotopes 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3amodels 3aneutrons 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asolvents 3asurfactants 3atemperature 0aAqueous ferrofluids 0aFractal aggregation 0aTemperature-induced reorganization 0aSmall-angle scattering 0aContrast variation 0aPolydispersity analysis1 aAvdeev, M.V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0721-46531 aAksenov, V.L.1 aShulenina, A.V.1 aIvankov, O.I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7775-00081 aRyukhtin, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0535-57191 aVékás, L.1 aBulavin, L.A.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Mar. 20, v. 613 p.126090-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1260903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245017900173300001600352500001400368520050000382592002800882596009500910596006501005650002001070650001301090650001801103650001301121650001501134650002001149650001501169650001301184650000901197650003701206653003001243653004901273653006401322700002301386700002001409700001801429700002401447773013601471856008501607852000901692655001201701IND60692790220221118223639.0200503e20170304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069279022DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2016.12545382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Hmidene, Asma10aEffect of O-methylated and glucuronosylated flavonoids from Tamarix gallica on α-glucosidase inhibitory activity: structure–activity relationship and synergistic potential  ap. 445-448.  aNAL-light  aO-Methylated and glucuronosylated flavonoids were isolated from Tamarix gallica as α-glucosidase inhibitors.

Such changes may affect properties of the drug substance, additives and formulation, thereby ultimately affecting product performance. An in-depth knowledge of water-solid interactions as well as their underlying mechanism is therefore integral to formulation development to avoid such adverse reactions. This review focuses on the various water-solid interactions encountered during different stages of product development and discusses analytical methodologies to characterize such interactions. General guidelines on how to develop small molecule pharmaceuticals in light of water-mediated changes (physical and chemical) is also provided with recommendations for form screening, manufacturing, packaging and storage conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3adrug development 3adrugs 3aproduct development 3asolvents 3avapors 0aWater-solid interactions 0aWater sorption 0aDehydration 0aDeliquescence 0aHydrates 0aSalt disproportionation 0aMobility 0aPhysico-chemical stability 0aWater activity 0aFree water 0aRH 0aaw 0aDCPD 0aASAP 0aTg1 aNagapudi, Karthik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4635-51090 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2021 July, v. 140 p.116276-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2021.1162763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245015100208506011700359506007600476520137500552592002801927506003701955650002201992650001102014650001202025650001202037650001902049650002302068650001402091650001102105650001202116650001102128650002302139651001402162653002602176653002502202653002802227700002302255700002002278700005902298773011402357856008302471852000902554655001202563IND60770912620221207113348.0220719e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077091262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2022.1022982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTserkova, Feriha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9364-594510aSize and sex structure variations of picked dogfish (Squalus acanthias, Linnaeus, 1758) (Chondrichthyes - Elasmobranchii) in the Western Black Sea  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOver the last few years, data on seasonal and interannual variations in the biological parameters of picked dogfish in the Black Sea have been limited, which hampers the understanding of the current status of this vulnerable species and management options. We studied the size and sex structure, as well as the link between the length and weight of picked dogfish by sex in the Western Black Sea to distinguish the variability of biological parameters. For this purpose, picked dogfish specimens were collected by a bottom trawl research survey for turbot during the autumn and spring seasons of 2014–2019. The number of picked dogfish specimens collected from 385 trawls, was 178. The most abundant bycatch of picked dogfish was recorded in late autumn, with a maximum in 2018. Although spring samples were scarce, seasonality in the sex ratio was observed and the percentage of females tended to increase in the spring bycatch. The factor “sex” determined the differences in weight and the female specimens were heavier than the males during the two seasons. Seasonal changes in the growth patterns of both sexes were observed. Statistically significant interannual variability in size was established in autumn when the most abundant samples were collected. Fluctuations in size and sex structure reflect the complex behavior of this migratory predator species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSqualus acanthias 3aautumn 3abycatch 3afemales 3amarine science 3amigratory behavior 3asex ratio 3aspring 3asurveys 3aturbot 3avulnerable species 3aBlack Sea 0aBiological parameters 0aSeasonal variability 0aInterannual variability1 aMihneva, Vesselina1 aPavlova, Elitsa1 aPenchev, Philip1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3167-77650 tRegional studies in marine science.g2022 May, v. 52 p.102298-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2022.1022983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011300170520165300283592002801936650001101964650002401975650001601999650002502015650000902040650001702049650002402066650001402090650004302104650002202147650000902169650001602178650002502194651001002219653001602229653001502245653001702260653001902277653000902296653001402305700001102319700001302330700001902343700001702362700001502379700001602394700001402410773012002424856008802544852000902632655001202641IND60778003520221120211123.0220726e20220910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077800352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1561272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jinglu10aEffect modifications of green space and blue space on heat–mortality association in Hong Kong, 2008–2017  aDespite emerging recognition of the benefits of green and blue spaces on human health, evidence for their effect modifications on heat–mortality associations is limited. We aimed to investigate the effect modifications of green and blue spaces on heat–mortality associations among different age and sex groups and at different heat levels. Daily mortality and meteorological data from 2008 to 2017 in Hong Kong, China were collected. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and distance to coast were used as proxies for green and blue space exposure, respectively. Time-series analyses was performed using fitting generalized linear mixed models with an interaction term between heat and levels of exposure to either green or blue space. Age-, sex-, and heat level-stratified analyses were also conducted. With a 1 °C increase in temperature above the 90th percentile (29.61 °C), mortality increased by 5.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6, 10.1%), 5.4% (1.4, 9.5%), and 4.6% (0.8, 8.9%) for low, medium and high levels of green space exposure, respectively, and by 7.5% (3.9, 11.2%) and 3.5% (0.3, 6.8%) for low and high levels of blue space exposure, respectively. Significant effect modifications of green and blue spaces were not observed for the whole population or any specific age and sex group, either at a moderate heat level or a heat level (Ps > 0.05). No significant effect modifications of green and blue spaces on heat-related mortality risk were observed in Hong Kong. These findings challenge the existing evidence on the prominent protective role of green and blue spaces in mitigating heat-related mortality risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aconfidence interval 3aenvironment 3agreen infrastructure 3aheat 3ahuman health 3ameteorological data 3amortality 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aprotective effect 3arisk 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aGreen space 0aBlue space 0aExtreme heat 0aHeat mortality 0aDLNM 0aHong Kong1 aLu, Yi1 aZhao, Qi1 aZhang, Yunquan1 aYang, Xuchao1 aChen, Qian1 aGuo, Yuming1 aHu, Kejia0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Sept. 10, v. 838 p.156127-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1561273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245016400171500001900335520176300354592002802117650002002145650001402165650002802179650001402207650001002221650001402231650001902245650001402264650001702278650001402295650001202309650002002321650000902341650001602350650001202366653002302378653002702401653001602428700002002444700001902464700002602483700001702509700001902526700001802545700005402563773010302617856008702720852000902807655001202816IND60722154520221119123240.0210506e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072215452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1115322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xuan-Qi10aControlled release of baricitinib from a thermos-responsive hydrogel system inhibits inflammation by suppressing JAK2/STAT3 pathway in acute spinal cord injury  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAggressive inflammation is an important pathological process of secondary injury in acute spinal cord injury (SCI). However, traditional treatments of secondary injury in acute SCI have achieved little success. Novel biomaterials combined with small molecule drugs are considered as a potential treatment for SCI. Baricitinib, a highly selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, can effectively inhibit the JAK2/STAT3 pathway involved in the modulation of inflammation. However, to evaluate Baricitinib’s therapeutic effect on SCI remains to be confirmed. In this study, we designed an injectable PLGA-PEG-PLGA thermos-sensitive hydrogel with baricitinib (Bari-P hydrogel) and measured its efficacy, physical and biological properties in vitro. In the SCI rat, Bari-P hydrogel was injected into the injured spinal cord. Neuronal regeneration was evaluated at 3 days and 4 weeks after surgery by determining the inflammatory cytokine levels, behavioral tests, and histological analysis. The hydrogel can gel in the body, disintegrate almost within 72 h and achieve drug release. Baricitinib can effectively inhibit the JAK2/STAT3 pathway of microglia in vitro; while in vivo experiments show that Bari-P hydrogel treatment can inhibit the phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3 and suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines, and reduces neuronal apoptosis. Histopathological analysis and behavioral tests showed that Bari-P hydrogel reduced neuronal apoptosis in the early stage of injury and later promoted functional recovery. In summary, Bari-P hydrogel reduced neuronal apoptosis and promoted functional recovery in spinal cord injured rats by inhibiting the JAK2-STAT3 pathway and controlling the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the early stages of injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal injuries 3aapoptosis 3abiocompatible materials 3acytokines 3adrugs 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ahydrogels 3ainflammation 3aneuroglia 3aneurons 3aphosphorylation 3arats 3aspinal cord 3asurgery 0aSpinal cord injury 0aMicroglia polarization 0aBaricitinib1 aHuang, Jin-Feng1 aLin, Jia-Liang1 aTsu, Frances Ya-sing,1 aWang, Min-Qi1 aGuo, Mei-Liang1 aZan, Xing-Jie1 aWu, Ai-Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8582-45990 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Mar., v. 199 p.111532-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1115323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01497naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009300157300001800250520035700268592002800625650002600653650002700679650002700706650002300733650002300756650002400779650001700803650001500820650002400835700002100859700001600880700002200896773013400918856007401052852000901126655001201135IND60629630920221121092205.0190202e20190131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062963092DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc09934k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakano, Shun10aHighly selective dual sensing of ATP and ADP using fluorescent ribonucleopeptide sensors  ap. 1611-1614.  aHighly selective fluorescent sensors for ATP and ADP were constructed from RNA aptamers by applying a modular design of a ribonucleopeptide scaffold.

Interactions between temporal––spatial distributions of bison and prescribed burning protocols are important in current restoration of tallgrass prairies. We examined dynamics of bison distribution in a patch-burned tallgrass prairie in the south-central United States relative to bison group size and composition, and burn age and temporal distribution. Bison formed larger mixed groups during summer and smaller sexually segregated groups the rest of the year, and bison selected dormant-season burn patches in the 1st postfire growing season most often during spring and summer. Large bison herds selecting recently burned areas resulted in seasonally variable and concentrated grazing pressure that may substantially alter site-specific vegetation. These dynamics must be considered when reintroducing bison and fire into tallgrass prairie because variable outcomes of floral richness and structural complexity are likely depending on temporal––spatial distribution of bison.  aPublisher supplied data 0abison 0aBison bison 0adistribution 0afire 0aOklahoma 0apatch-burn mosaic 0aseason 0atallgrass prairie1 aLeslie, D.

Nitrification inhibition by plant-released root exudates is referred to as biological nitrification inhibition (BNI). This study aimed to detect the BNI capacity of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) root exudates and determine the influence of BNI compounds (BNIs) on the net nitrification rate in rhizosphere soil during sugarcane growth. Three sugarcane varieties were considered in this study, i.e., wild cane, UT13 and KK3. This study included 3 experiments, namely, Experiment I, determination of the potential nitrification rate (PNR) via a soil bioassay and assessment of the effect of dicyandiamide (DCD) on the PNR via a microcosm incubation study; Experiment II, assessment of the effect of sugarcane cultivation on soil N dynamics and the net nitrification rate in rhizosphere soil (in situ); and Experiment III, assessment of the PNR and immobilization in soil via microcosm incubation (ex situ). Sugarcane root exudates were collected under hydroponics, and the BNI capacity was obtained through a soil bioassay. Pot experiments were conducted to determine the influence of sugarcane growth on the net nitrification rate relative to unplanted soil. The results of Experiment I indicated that sugarcane root exudates significantly inhibited the nitrification rate via a soil bioassay (p < 0.05), with a high variation in the BNI capacity according to the sequence of Spone (84.29% inhibition) > UT13 (80.94% inhibition) > KK3 (45.4% inhibition). In addition, Experiment II confirmed a reduced net nitrification rate (p < 0.05) among all three sugarcane varieties. However, net nitrification rate reduction was more notably the result of heterotrophic N immobilization and plant N uptake than the result of BNIs. Evidence of BNI-induced reduction in gross nitrification among all sugarcane varieties was confirmed via soil incubation (Experiment III), and a notable difference in the BNI capacity was found among all sugarcane varieties. Based on the difference in plant mechanisms controlling the net nitrification rate, our study demonstrates that the dominant mechanisms are determined by the soil N availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum 3abioassays 3adicyandiamide 3ahydroponics 3aimmobilization in soil 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3arhizosphere 3aroot exudates 3asoil 3asugarcane 0aBiological nitrification inhibition (BNI) 0aDicyandiamide 0aN immobilization 0aPlant and soil interactions1 aKaewpradit, Wanwipa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9036-81720 tRhizosphere.g2022 Sept., v. 23 p.100551-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23357x2452-21987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2022.1005513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245015000170300001800320520124400338592002801582596006901610650001101679650001401690650002701704650002301731650003901754650001901793650001301812650002201825650002601847650001701873650001201890650001901902700002101921700002001942700002401962700003501986773011202021856008202133852000902215655001202224IND60675950720221119122108.0191112e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067595072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02756-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalange, Caterina14aThe effect of the dispersion of microfibrillated cellulose on the mechanical properties of melt-compounded polypropylene–polyethylene copolymer  ap. 9645-9659.  aMicrofibrillated cellulose (MFC) is a highly expanded, high surface area networked form of cellulose-based reinforcement. Due to the poor compatibility of cellulose with most common apolar thermoplastic matrices, the production of cellulose-reinforced composites in industry is currently limited to polar materials. In this study, a facile water-based chemistry, based on the reaction of MFC with tannic acid and subsequent functionalisation with an alkyl amine, is used to render the surface of the MFC fibrils hydrophobic and enhance the dispersion of the cellulose-based filler into an apolar thermoplastic matrix. The level of dispersion of the compatibilized MFC reinforced composites was evaluated using Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry and multi-channel Spectral Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy. The agglomeration of cellulosic filler within the composites was reduced by functionalising the surface of the MFC fibrils with tannic acid and octadecylamine. The resulting composites exhibited an increase in modulus at a high cellulose content. Despite the dispersion of a large portion of the functionalised filler, the presence of some remaining aggregates affected the impact properties of the composites produced.  aPublisher supplied data  aEP/L015102/1cEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council 3aamines 3acellulose 3acellulose microfibrils 3acomposite polymers 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustry 3amass spectrometry 3amechanical properties 3asurface area 3atannins 3athermoplastics1 aJohns, Marcus A.1 aScurr, David J.1 aPhipps, Jonathan S.1 aEichhorn, S.

In addition to the formation of the aforementioned mononuclear compounds, the reaction of W(PMe₃)₄(η²-CH₂PMe₂)H with PhSiH₃ also yields a novel dinuclear compound, [W(PMe₃)₂(SiHPh₂)H₂](μ-Si,P-SiHPhCH₂PMe₂)(μ-SiH₂)[W(PMe₃)₃H₂], which features a bridging silylene ligand that participates in 3-center-2-electron interactions with both tungsten centers. The bonding within the [W(μ-H)Si(μ-H)W] core can be described by a variety of resonance structures, some of which possess multiple bond character between tungsten and silicon. In this regard, [W(PMe₃)₂(SiHPh₂)H₂](μ-Si,P-SiHPhCH₂PMe₂)(μ-SiH₂)[W(PMe₃)₃H₂] possesses the shortest W–Si bond length reported. The corresponding reaction of W(PMe₃)₄(η²-CH₂PMe₂)H with Ph₂SiH₂ yields the σ-silane compound, W(PMe₃)₃(σ-HSiHPh₂)H₄.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogen 3aligands 3asilicon 3atungsten1 aNeary, Michelle C.1 aParkin, Gerard0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Dec. 31, v. 136, no. 52 p.17934-17937dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja510703s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012600168500001900294520099000313592002801303650001001331650001201341650001001353650001101363650002001374650001001394650001401404650001901418650001301437653002501450653001901475653002701494653002801521700001501549700001301564700001501577700001901592700001601611773010301627856008701730852000901817655001201826IND60722154820221119123443.0210506e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072215482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1115422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xinmiao10aEvaluation of a new magnetic bead as an integrated platform for systematic CTC recognition, capture and clinical analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel form of magnetic bead, namely antibody-coated magnetic lipid nano-vehicle (AMLV), was synthesized by embedding Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles into an amphiphilic antibody-modified liposome as a high-performance circulating tumor cell (CTC) hunter.

The results of the compatibility studies revealed that the two rhizobacterial cultures were compatible with each other and that they did not affect the germination of AMF spores. Further, both rhizobacterial cultures were found to be effective against M. incognita under in-vitro conditions. Results from the green house experiment showed that a significant reduction in nematode population and root gall index was recorded in the combined inoculation of all the microbial inoculants. Besides, defense genes such as Phenyl Alanine Ammonia Lyase and lipoxygenase were expressed at a greater level in microbial inoculated tomato roots. Furthermore, rhizobacterial metabolites revealed that among the 67 compounds, only four metabolites such as., p-Methylbenzeneboronic acid, Octadecanoic acid, 2-Hydroxychalcone, and Octadecanoic acid 2-hydroxy-1,3-propanediyl ester were reported in both bacterial cultures. Moreover, nematicidal group of compounds such as fatty acyls, fatty acids, carboxolic acids, benzoic acid and their derivatives were predominantly observed in both the cultures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzotobacter chroococcum 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3abenzoic acid 3agermination 3alipoxygenases 3ametabolites 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3arhizosphere 3arhizosphere bacteria 3aroot galls 3aroot-knot nematodes 3astearic acid 3asynergism 3atomatoes 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aMicrobial inoculants 0aDefense genes 0aMetabolites 0aM. incognita1 aHadil Mon, V.1 aBalachandar, D.1 aGomathi, V.1 aSharmila, R.0 tRhizosphere.g2022 Sept., v. 23 p.100552-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23357x2452-21987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2022.1005523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03408naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245015100163500001900314520173900333592002802072650001502100650002102115650001402136650001502150650001902165650001902184650002002203650003102223650001002254650001902264650001002283650000902293650001102302650001102313650001402324650002202338650002802360650002002388650001102408650001302419653002402432653002602456653001002482653003402492653002202526700001502548700001802563700001302581700001602594700001602610773011002626856008502736852000902821655001202830IND60725952720221116231143.0210305e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072595272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1165562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Lu10aMechanisms underlying reproductive toxicity induced by nickel nanoparticles identified by comprehensive gene expression analysis in GC-1 spg cells  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe public around the world is increasingly concerned about male reproductive health. The impact of nickel nanoparticles (Ni NPs) on male reproductive toxicity including sperm production, motility and fertilizing capacity has been confirmed by our previous researches. In the current study of Ni NPs-inducing toxicity, the expression profiles of piRNAs and their predicted target genes associated with male infertility, were obtained. The results showed that piR-mmu-32362259 was the highest differential expression multiples in both the testis tissues of male mice and GC-1 cells similarly. Notably, piR-mmu-32362259 target gene was significantly enriched in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. All these results suggest that piR-mmu-32362259 may affect the occurrence and development of injury in the mouse spermatogenesis process by regulating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. In order to verify the result, piR-mmu-32362259 low-expression lentivirus was used to transfect GC-1 cells to establish a stable transfected cell model. The effects of piR-mmu-32362259 on the viability, cycle and apoptosis as well as related protein expression levels of GC-1 cells induced by Ni NPs were detected using CCK8, flow cytometry and western blot assay, respectively. The results showed that low expression of piR-mmu-32362259 could not only alleviate the decrease of GC-1 cell viability, affect the cell cycle and reduce the apoptosis rate, but also significantly affect the expression levels of key proteins and their downstream molecules of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Collectively, our current results provide a theoretical basis for further exploring the molecular regulatory mechanism of male reproductive toxicity induced by Ni NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLentivirus 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3acell viability 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amale sterility 3amales 3amice 3amodels 3anickel 3apollution 3aprotein synthesis 3areproductive toxicology 3aspermatogenesis 3atestes 3atoxicity 0aNickel nanoparticle 0aReproductive toxicity 0apiRNA 0aDifferentially expressed gene 0aCell transfection1 aWu, Yongya1 aHu, Wangcheng1 aLiu, Lin1 aXue, Yuying1 aLiang, Geyu0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 275 p.116556-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1165563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012100170300001800291520123300309592002801542650001201570650001701582650001901599650001901618650002001637650001801657650001601675650001101691650001201702650001501714650002201729650001301751650001201764650001401776700002201790700002201812700002201834773010701856856008401963852000902047655001202056IND60112884820221122205504.0141111e20110928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011288482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2011.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPons, Alexandre10aDetermination of 3-methyl-2,4-nonanedione in red wines using methanol chemical ionization ion trap mass spectrometry  ap. 7023-7030.  aA compound associated with oxidized flavor in red wines was recently-identified as 3-methyl-2,4-nonanedione (MND). In order to quantify it, positive chemical ionization (PCI) in an ion trap was studied using conventional liquid reagents such as methanol, acetonitrile, and acetone, as well as non-conventional liquid reagents such as ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, pentane, isohexane, and heptane. Under laboratory conditions, very different response factors were obtained with MND depending on the gas. We also compared the detection limit of conventional CI with hybrid chemical ionization (HCI). Finally, this compound was quantified in red wines by liquid/liquid extraction without any derivatization steps, followed by GC/MS-CI analysis, using methanol as the reagent gas. Coelutions of compounds with the same m/z were checked using methanol-d₄. The method we developed was linear in the 10–300ng/L range of MND concentrations, with satisfactory repeatability. The detection limit was 4.3ng/L, over 3 times lower than the olfactory perception threshold of this compound (16ng/L). The suitability of this method for assaying this diketone in red wine was demonstrated by the analyzing many wines from different vintages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aacetonitrile 3achromatography 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3aethyl acetate 3aethyl ether 3aflavor 3aheptane 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3apentane 3ared wines1 aLavigne, Valérie1 aDarriet, Philippe1 aDubourdieu, Denis0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Sept. 28, v. 1218, no. 39 p.7023-7030dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01414naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009300156300001800249520036200267592002800629650001400657650002100671650001300692650002700705650002300732650001700755650002200772650001300794650000900807700001700816700001400833773013400847856007400981852000901055655001201064IND60629631220221120034032.0190202e20190131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062963122DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc10060h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Xiujun10aPolymer grafted on carbon nanotubes as a flexible cathode for aqueous zinc ion batteries  ap. 1647-1650.  aWe have developed a free-standing, flexible cathode for an aqueous zinc ion battery by grafting cross-linked polydopamine on carbon nanotubes.

We assessed the clinical accuracy of the CLART4S assays under the fourth installment of the VALGENT framework. The VALGENT cohort comprised 998 consecutive cervical samples from women participating in the Danish screening programme enriched with 297 samples with abnormal cytology (100 ASCUS, 100 LSIL, 97 HSIL). The CLART4S assay detects 16 HPV genotypes individually: 14 oncogenic and two non-oncogenic HPV types. The GP5+/6+ PCR Enzyme-Immuno-Assay (GP-EIA) and GP5+/6+ PCR with Luminex genotyping (GP-LMNX) were used as comparator tests for clinical accuracy and HPV genotype concordance, respectively. The sensitivity for ≥ CIN2 for the CLART4S assay was 96.7 % (GP-EIA: 92.6 %) with a relative sensitivity of 1.04 (1.00−1.09). The sensitivity for ≥ CIN3 was 98.8 % (GP-EIA: 94.0 %), with relative sensitivity of 1.05 (1.00−1.10). The specificity for <CIN2 was 88.6 % (GP-EIA: 89.2 %) with a relative specificity of 0.99 (0.98−1.01). The CLART 4S was found to be non-inferior to that of GP-EIA for both sensitivity (p < 0.0001) and specificity (p = 0.0452). The overall oncogenic HPV concordance between CLART4S and GP-LMNX was high, however when looking at individual genotype agreement the concordance was more diverse, with the highest agreement found in the Screening population.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell biology 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3amicroarray technology 3auterine cervical neoplasms 0aVALGENT 0aCLART HPV 4S assay 0aHPV genotyping 0aValidation of assays 0aCervical cancer screening1 aPedersen, Helle1 aQuint, Wim1 aXu, Lan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8654-679X1 aArbyn, M.q(Marc),1 aBonde, Jesper Hansen0 tJournal of virological methods.g2021 June, v. 292 p.114118-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.1141183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245010300207300001600310520133500326592002801661650001601689650001401705650002001719650001601739650001401755650001401769650003101783650000901814650002201823653002701845653002401872653001001896700002501906700002401931700002101955700001701976700001901993700001502012700001702027700006402044700002502108700001602133700005502149700002102204700006402225773013402289856008102423852000902504655001202513IND60684797120221118130750.0200221e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068479712DNAL7 a10.1017/S14662523190001852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSargeant, Jan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2420-176612aA systematic review of the efficacy of antibiotics for the prevention of swine respiratory disease  ap. 291-304.  aPrevention and control of respiratory disease is a major contributor to antibiotic use in swine. A systematic review was conducted to address the question, ‘What is the comparative efficacy of antimicrobials for the prevention of swine respiratory disease?’ Eligible studies were controlled trials published in English evaluating prophylactic antibiotics in swine, where clinical morbidity, mortality, or total antibiotic use was assessed. Four databases and the gray literature were searched for relevant articles. Two reviewers working independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility followed by full-text articles, and then extracted data and evaluated risk of bias for eligible trials. There were 44 eligible trials from 36 publications. Clinical morbidity was evaluated in eight trials where antibiotics were used in nursery pigs and 10 trials where antibiotics were used in grower pigs. Mortality was measured in 22 trials in nursery pigs and 12 trials in grower pigs. There was heterogeneity in the antibiotic interventions and comparisons published in the literature; thus, there was insufficient evidence to allow quantification of the efficacy, or relative efficacy, of antibiotic interventions. Concerns related to statistical non-independence and quality of reporting were noted in the included trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3adatabases 3adisease control 3afeeder pigs 3amorbidity 3amortality 3arespiratory tract diseases 3arisk 3asystematic review 0aPreventive antibiotics 0arespiratory disease 0aswine1 aBergevin, Michele D.1 aChurchill, Katheryn1 aDawkins, Kaitlyn1 aDeb, Bhumika1 aDunn, Jennifer1 aHu, Dapeng1 aMoody, Carly1 aO'Connor, Annette M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0604-78221 aO'Sullivan, Terri L.1 aReist, Mark1 aWang, Chong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4489-43441 aWilhelm, Barbara1 aWinder, Charlotte B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7314-36570 tAnimal health research reviews.g2019 Dec., v. 20, no. 2 p.291-304dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl69684x1475-26547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14662523190001853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013500168520137300303592002801676650001601704650001601720650002301736650002401759650002101783650002401804650001101828650001601839650001601855650000701871650001701878650001401895653001501909653002501924653002601949653002301975653002101998653002102019700001702040700001702057700001802074700001102092700001902103700005302122700001602175773011002191856008502301852000902386655001202395IND60725952820221116230919.0220103e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072595282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1165572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yonggui10aEffects of norfloxacin on decomposition and nutrient release in leaves of the submerged macrophyte Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara  aIt is well known that antibiotic residuals affect the composition and structure of microbial communities. However, the consequences of these biological changes in terms of ecosystem function remain poorly understood, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. Here, we investigated the impacts of norfloxacin (NOR, 0, 0.5, and 8 mg L⁻¹), a widely used antibiotic, on the microbial community structure on leaf surfaces of the submerged macrophyte Vallisneria natans, and the corresponding variations in litter decomposition, litter nutrient release, and water properties. Results showed that after 40 days of exposure, bacterial richness consistently decreased with increasing NOR concentration, and that richness of fungi was significantly lower in treatments adding NOR than in the control treatment. Moreover, NOR shifted the community toward NOR resistant phyla and genera, especially in the bacteria community. These community shifts resulted in the inhibition of litter decomposition and nutrient release from leaf litter to system water, accompanied by increases in dissolved oxygen concentration and pH of system water. Our results indicate that, by affecting microbial communities, NOR had significant effects on litter decomposition, litter nutrient release, and water properties, highlighting the potential harmful effects of NOR on aquatic ecosystem function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVallisneria 3aantibiotics 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acommunity structure 3adissolved oxygen 3aecological function 3aleaves 3amacrophytes 3anorfloxacin 3apH 3aplant litter 3apollution 0aAntibiotic 0aFreshwater ecosystem 0aMicrobial communities 0aLeaf decomposition 0aNutrient release 0aWater properties1 aZhang, Shiqi1 aShu, Xiangdi1 aYang, Yuejiao1 aLi, Ya1 aChen, Jinquan,1 aPan, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1081-15741 aSun, Shucun0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 274 p.116557-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1165573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03661naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245012400172506010400296506007600400520180000476592002802276506003702304650002602341650002402367650001602391650002502407650001802432650001402450650001202464650001002476650001502486650001702501650000902518650001702527650001502544650001902559650001602578650001402594650001502608650001302623650001102636650002302647650002202670653001602692653002102708653001902729653002002748653001702768700001902785700002402804700002002828700001802848773010002866856008402966852000903050655001203059IND60770913120221207112915.0220606e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077091312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1010892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, SM Majharul10aAlterations of oxygen consumption and gills morphology of Nile tilapia acclimatized to extreme warm ambient temperature  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aElevation of water temperature due to global warming influences the physiological properties of fish by increasing their rate of metabolic function and demand for oxygen. It is important to know how fish respond to changing environments for indicating and predicting the impacts of climate change on fish populations, communities and for their sustainable management. Hence, the present study was aimed to investigate the effects of high water temperature on juvenile Nile tilapia, based on the oxygen consumption rate, blood physiology and gill morphology in different temperature (31 °C, 34 °C and 37 °C) in triplicates for a period of 28 days. Results showed that the oxygen consumption rate increased significantly at 37 °C, whereas no significant difference was observed at 31 °C and 34 °C. Hemoglobin (Hb) and red blood cell (RBC) were decreased significantly at 37 °C after 14 and 28 days of exposure, whereas blood glucose levels showed the opposite scenario. On the other hand, no significant changes were observed for white blood cell (WBC) on day 14, but a significant increase was observed on day 28 at 37 °C. Being the site of main gaseous exchange moderate to severe histopathological changes (epithelial lifting, epithelial necrosis, hypertrophy of chloride cell, lamella fusion, telangiectasia, vacuolation of epithelium and epithelial edema) were observed in the gill especially in the gill lamellae of the experimental fish at 37 °C. The findings of the study indicate the adaptive physiological strategy in changing climate despite being a thermal tolerant species, and the alteration in oxygen consumption rate, gill morphology and blood parameters could be used as an assessment strategy to know the condition of the fish and their surrounding environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aambient temperature 3aaquaculture 3abiochemical pathways 3ablood glucose 3achlorides 3aclimate 3aedema 3aepithelium 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3agas exchange 3ahemoglobin 3ahistopathology 3ahypertrophy 3ajuveniles 3aleukocytes 3anecrosis 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3awater temperature 0aAquaculture 0aBlood physiology 0aClimate change 0aGill morphology 0aNile tilapia1 aAkhter, Fatema1 aʻIṣmat Jahān̲,1 aRashid, Harunur1 aShahjahan, Md0 tAquaculture reports.g2022 Apr., v. 23 p.101089-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1010893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245014000198300001600338506007600354520141300430592002801843506003701871650001001908650001401918650001201932650002201944650001701966650001101983650001901994650003102013650001502044700001802059773013102077856007302208852000902281655001202290IND60649884120221207104251.0190707e20140110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064988412DNAL7 a10.3390/nu60103192doi7 aPMC39168642pmcid7 a244347472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsmaro, Deyar10aHigh-Caloric and Chocolate Stimuli Processing in Healthy Humans: An Integration of Functional Imaging and Electrophysiological Findings  ap. 319-341.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere has been a great deal of interest in understanding how the human brain processes appetitive food cues, and knowing how such cues elicit craving responses is particularly relevant when current eating behavior trends within Westernized societies are considered. One substance that holds a special place with regard to food preference is chocolate, and studies that used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERPs) have identified neural regions and electrical signatures that are elicited by chocolate cue presentations. This review will examine fMRI and ERP findings from studies that used high-caloric food and chocolate cues as stimuli, with a focus on responses observed in samples of healthy participants, as opposed to those with eating-related pathology. The utility of using high-caloric and chocolate stimuli as a means of understanding the human reward system will also be highlighted, as these findings may be particularly important for understanding processes related to pathological overeating and addiction to illicit substances. Finally, research from our own lab that focused on chocolate stimulus processing in chocolate cravers and non-cravers will be discussed, as the approach used may help bridge fMRI and ERP findings so that a more complete understanding of appetitive stimulus processing in the temporal and spatial domains may be established.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3achocolate 3acraving 3aelectrophysiology 3afood choices 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3aovereating1 aLiotti, Mario0 tNutrients.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 6, no. 1 p.319-341dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu60103193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01630naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011800159300001800277520047900295592002800774650002700802650002600829650002200855650001100877700001700888700001700905700001500922700001700937700001900954700001900973700001400992700001501006700001801021773013401039856007401173852000901247655001201256IND60629631420221117173218.0190202e20190131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062963142DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc10269d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuang, Xiaofei10aSupramolecular aggregation of a redox-active copper-naphthalenediimide network with intrinsic electron conduction  ap. 1643-1646.  aA sextuple ordered interpenetrated copper-naphthalenediimide network has been constructed by combining the features of porous metal–organic frameworks and π-conjugated supramolecular aggregation.

Here, the potential effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) inoculation and loess layer treatment on water and salt distribution in sand and water uptake by maize (Zea mays L.) were studied in indoor growth chamber tests combined with stable isotope methods. AMF inoculation and a loess layer both promoted the biomass and root characteristics of maize. There were good correlations between root density and soil water and salt distribution. The contribution of soil water at different depths to maize water uptake was studied using a graphical method and the MixSIAR model. AMF inoculation with a loess layer increased the percentage of water taken up by maize from depths 20–40 cm and >40 cm by 28.9% and 15.3% compared with uninoculated maize with no loess layer. AMF inoculation with a loess layer is a method suitable for revegetation of arid and semi-arid mining areas with the soil water deficit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3abiomass 3acorn 3agrowth chambers 3aland restoration 3aloess 3amodels 3amycorrhizal fungi 3arhizosphere 3asand 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoil water deficit 3astable isotopes 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awater uptake 0aStable isotopes 0aRoot density 0aSalinity 0aWater uptake 0aZea mays1 aWu, Chao1 aWang, Shuangming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5258-93341 aGao, Xuejing1 aXue, Chao1 aYang, Wei1 aLi, Mingchao1 aXiao, Li1 aChristie, Peter0 tRhizosphere.g2022 Sept., v. 23 p.100560-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23357x2452-21987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2022.1005603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013900169520165200308592002801960650001201988650002302000650002702023650001202050650002402062650001402086650001502100650001802115650001402133650002802147650001902175650001402194650001602208650001802224653001602242653003702258653001402295653002702309653002402336653002002360700002702380700002802407700002402435700002602459700005902485700002002544700002702564773011002591856008502701852000902786655001202795IND60725953020221116231022.0220103e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072595302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1165592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRostami, Saeid14aThe effects of exogenous application of melatonin on the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the rhizosphere of Festuca  aThe study aimed to assess the effects of melatonin, a plant growth regulator, on the degradation of phenanthrene (Phe) and pyrene (Py), in the rhizosphere of the Festuca grass. The experiments were divided into the following groups: 1) soil contaminated with Phe and Py, without the Festuca, 2) contaminated soil + Festuca, 3–5), contaminated soil + Festuca + the application of melatonin in three separate doses: 10, 50, or 100 μM. After 90 days, the effects of melatonin supplementation on the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed by evaluating the rate of PAHs degradation, the expression of genes encoding salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase (SDH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) enzymes in Pseudomonas putida, as well as by measuring the total activity of dehydrogenase and peroxidase enzymes. Our results have shown that in soil contaminated by 300 mg kg⁻¹ PAHs, application of melatonin (10, 50, 100 μM), resulted in the following increase in the dehydrogenase and peroxidase activity in all three applied doses (19% and 5.7%), (45.3% and 34.3%), (40.9% and 14.3%), respectively in comparison to the control group. The experiment showed that soil supplementation with melatonin at 50 μM, resulted in the highest removal rate of PAHs.According to our results, melatonin demonstrated a potentially favorable role in enhancing plant biomass, as well as an increase in soil bacterial population, and the activity of antioxidative enzymes in P. putida, causing all tested parameters of the soil and the expression of desired genes to be advantageously altered for the degradation of the chosen PAHs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca 3aPseudomonas putida 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrasses 3ahydroxybenzaldehyde 3amelatonin 3aperoxidase 3aphenanthrenes 3aphytomass 3aplant growth substances 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3arhizosphere 3asoil bacteria 0aRhizosphere 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aMelatonin 0aDehydrogenase activity 0aPeroxidase activity 0aGene expression1 aAzhdarpoor, Abooalfazl1 aBaghapour, Mohammad Ali1 aDehghani, Mansooreh1 aSamaei, Mohammad Reza1 aJaskulak, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7611-76171 aJafarpour, Sima1 aSamare-Najaf, Mohammad0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 274 p.116559-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1165593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03682naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002600180245017700206300001600383506007600399520149800475592002801973506003702001650002202038650003102060650001802091650001902109650001602128650001602144650000902160650001902169650003802188650001202226650001302238650002202251650001502273650003602288650001702324650001202341650002302353650002302376650002202399650001002421650002002431650002302451650001302474650001302487650002002500650002102520650000902541650002102550650002102571650001802592650003202610700002302642700002502665700002402690700002702714700003002741773013102771856007302902852000902975655001202984IND60649884320221207095546.0190707e20140116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064988432DNAL7 a10.3390/nu60103552doi7 aPMC39168662pmcid7 a244417172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPakdeechote, Poungrat10aAsiatic Acid Alleviates Hemodynamic and Metabolic Alterations via Restoring eNOS/iNOS Expression, Oxidative Stress, and Inflammation in Diet-Induced Metabolic Syndrome Rats  ap. 355-370.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAsiatic acid is a triterpenoid isolated from Centella asiatica. The present study aimed to investigate whether asiatic acid could lessen the metabolic, cardiovascular complications in rats with metabolic syndrome (MS) induced by a high-carbohydrate, high-fat (HCHF) diet. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with HCHF diet with 15% fructose in drinking water for 12 weeks to induce MS. MS rats were treated with asiatic acid (10 or 20 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for a further three weeks. MS rats had an impairment of oral glucose tolerance, increases in fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and hindlimb vascular resistance; these were related to the augmentation of vascular superoxide anion production, plasma malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels (p < 0.05). Plasma nitrate and nitrite (NOx) were markedly high with upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, but dowregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression (p < 0.05). Asiatic acid significantly improved insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, hemodynamic parameters, oxidative stress markers, plasma TNF-α, NOx, and recovered abnormality of eNOS/iNOS expressions in MS rats (p < 0.05). In conclusion, asiatic acid improved metabolic, hemodynamic abnormalities in MS rats that could be associated with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects and recovering regulation of eNOS/iNOS expression.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCentella asiatica 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablood glucose 3ablood pressure 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3adiet 3adrinking water 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3afasting 3afructose 3aglucose tolerance 3aheart rate 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alaboratory animals 3alipid composition 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolic syndrome 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3asuperoxide anion 3atriacylglycerols 3atriterpenoids 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aBunbupha, Sarawoot1 aKukongviriyapan, Upa1 aPrachaney, Parichat1 aKhrisanapant, Wilaiwan1 aKukongviriyapan, Veerapol0 tNutrients.g2014 Jan. 16, v. 6, no. 1 p.355-370dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu60103553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01077naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245007500168300001300243520016400256592002800420650002700448650002300475650001700498650000800515700001900523700002800542773013400570856007400704852000900778655001200787IND60629631620221117173145.0190202e20190131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062963162DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc90037c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTallapally, Venkatesham10aCorrection: Facile synthesis of size-tunable tin arsenide nanocrystals  ap. 1668.  aCorrection for ‘Facile synthesis of size-tunable tin arsenide nanocrystals’ by Venkatesham Tallapally et al., Chem.

To investigate the proteins expressed in the gonads, a quantitative proteomics approach has been utilized to analyze differentially expressed proteins between the spermary and ovary. In this study, we identified and quantified 2416 proteins in the gonads of Hyriopsis schlegelii. Of these, 559 proteins showed significantly different expression between the spermary and ovary. Some specific proteins expressed in either the spermary or ovary were identified in Hyriopsis schlegelii. In addition, a series of proteins related to gametogenesis were also identified. Compared with previous reports, many proteins in Hyriopsis schlegelii identified here have different expression patterns between the spermary and ovary. The special hermaphroditism in Hyriopsis schlegelii may contribute to these inconsistent results. The provided proteomics data could be considered as a starting point for subsequent studies focusing on the proteins involved in sexual gland development and maturity.  aPublisher supplied data  a31660337cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a[ JXARS-10]a[JXARS-02];cthe earmarked fund for Jiangxi Agriculture Research System  a20161BAB204169cthe Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province, China  a150164cthe science and technology project of Jiangxi Province, China  a[KJLD12001]a[20132BBF60053]cthe Key Scientific and Technological Program of Jiangxi Province, China 3aHyriopsis 3abiotechnology 3agametogenesis 3agene expression regulation 3ahermaphroditism 3aproteomics 0aHyriopsis schlegelii 0aiTRAQ 0aspermary 0aovary1 aWang, Dexia1 aZhou, Yan1 aGu, Yiran1 aWu, Di1 aWang, Junhua1 aHong, Yijiang0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2017 Mar. 4, v. 81, no. 3 p.491-499dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2016.12595533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03645naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245013700202520197000339592002802309650002202337650001902359650002502378650001402403650001402417650001402431650003502445650001302480650003302493650001002526650000902536650002002545650001602565650001802581650001302599650001702612650001402629650001302643650000902656650001902665653001802684653002002702653002302722653002302745653002702768700005702795700005902852773011002911856008503021852000903106655001203115IND60725953120221116231708.0220103e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072595312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1165602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5682-370910a4-Octylphenol induces developmental abnormalities and interferes the differentiation of neural crest cells in Xenopus laevis embryos  aDevelopmental toxicity of 4-octylphenol (OP), an estrogenic endocrine disruptor was verified using frog embryo teratogenesis assay Xenopus. LC₅₀, EC₅₀Mₐₗfₒᵣₘₜᵢₒₙ and EC₅₀Mₑₗₐₙₒcyₜₑ₋dyₛgₑₙₑₛᵢₛ of OP were 9.9, 10.5, and 2.4 μM, respectively. In tadpoles, despite the low teratogenic index, 2 μM OP significantly inhibited head cartilage development and tail malformation. The total length of tadpole was significantly increased at 5 μM and decreased at 10 μM OP. In OP-treated tadpoles, head cartilages were frequently missed and col2a1 mRNA was decreased at 2 μM, indicating a chondrogenic defect in developing head. In the head skin of 1 μM OP-treated tadpoles, number of melanocytes and melanogenic pathway genes expression were significantly decreased. In the head-neck junction of stage 22 embryos, OP increased foxd3 and sox10 mRNA and SOX10(+) neural crest cells (NCCs) in somite mesoderm and endoderm, indicating the inhibition of chondrogenic differentiation, ectopic migration to endoderm, and undifferentiation of NCCs by OP. Together, OP-induced head dysplasia and inhibition of melanogenesis may be attributable to deregulation of neural crest cells in embryos. In tadpoles, OP at 1 μM significantly increased lipid hydroperoxide and induced spliced xbp1 mRNA, an IRE1 pathway endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) marker and p-eIF2α protein, a PERK pathway ERS marker. OP at 10 μM induced CHOP mRNA, pro-apoptotic genes expression, DNA fragmentation, and cleaved caspase-3, suggesting that OP differentially induced ERS and apoptosis according to the concentration in embryos. In 5–10 μM OP-treated stage 22 embryos and stage 45 tadpole heads, Ki67 was significantly increased, suggesting the apoptosis-induced proliferation of embryonic cells in the OP-treated embryos. Together, OP should be managed as a developmental toxicant altering the behavior of NCCs in vertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aXenopus laevis 3aabnormal development 3aapoptosis 3acartilage 3acaspase-3 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aendoderm 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3afrogs 3ahead 3alipid peroxides 3amelanocytes 3amelanogenesis 3amesoderm 3aneural crest 3apollution 3atadpoles 3atail 3ateratogenicity 0a4-Octylphenol 0aHead dysgenesis 0aMelanogenic defect 0aNeural crest cells 0aXenopus laevis embryos1 aJang, Ji Hyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8274-41151 aGye, Myung Chan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5682-37090 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 274 p.116560-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1165603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03817naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245006100170300001800231520214100249592002802390596003202418596009802450596008802548596007002636650002602706650003002732650002202762650002002784650001402804650002002818650001002838650001202848650002502860650001502885650001402900650001502914650002002929650001902949650000902968650002002977651001102997651002303008700002103031700005803052773011003110856008203220852000903302655001203311IND60672018620221122213227.0191008e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067201862DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-01-19-0010-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSherman, Jennifer10aCooperation and Coordination in Plant Disease Management  ap. 1720-1731.  aScaling of management efforts beyond the boundaries of individual farms may require that individuals act collectively. Such approaches have been suggested several times in plant pathology contexts but rarely have been implemented, in part because the institutional structures that enable successful collective action are poorly understood. In this research, we conducted in-depth interviews with hop producers in Oregon and Washington State to identify their motivations for and barriers to collective action regarding communication of disease levels, coordination of management practices, and sharing of best management practices and other data for powdery mildew (caused by Podosphaera macularis). Growers were generally open to and engaged in communication with neighbors and others on disease status in their hop yards and some evidence of higher levels of information sharing on management practices was found. However, growers who had developed extensive knowledge and databases were reluctant to share information viewed as proprietary. Relationships, trust, and reciprocity were facilitating factors for communication and information sharing, whereas lack of these factors and social norms of independence and pride in portions of the grower community were identified as impediments. Given the heterogeneity of trust, lack of confidence in reciprocity, and weak shared norms, communication of disease risk and coordinated management may be most successful if directed at a smaller scale as a series of neighborhood-based partnerships of growers and their immediate neighbors. Developing a disease reporting system and coordinated disease management efforts with more producers and at larger spatial extents would require formalized structures and rules that would provide assurance that there is consistency in disease data collection and reporting, reciprocation, and sanctions for those who use the information for marketing purposes against other growers. Given the analyses presented here, we believe there is potential for collective action in disease management but with limitations on the scope and nature of the actions.  aPublisher supplied data  cWashington State University  aCRIS 2072-21000-051-00-DcU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service  aOR042cWestern Integrated Pest Management Center at University of California, Davis  a2014-51181-22381cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aPodosphaera macularis 3abest management practices 3acollective action 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adisease control 3afarms 3agrowers 3ainformation exchange 3ainterviews 3amarketing 3amotivation 3aplant pathology 3apowdery mildew 3arisk 3asocial behavior 3aOregon 3aWashington (state)1 aBurke, Jordan M.1 aGent, David H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9529-98310 tPhytopathology.g2019 Oct., v. 109, no. 10 p.1720-1731dPhytopathologywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-01-19-0010-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009300167520150900260592002801769650001401797650001201811650002001823650002901843650000901872650002001881650001801901650002101919650002601940650001401966650001201980650001501992650001402007650001202021653002002033653002202053653001502075653001802090653002102108700001702129700001802146700002002164700005902184773011002243856008502353852000902438655001202447IND60725953220221116231716.0220103e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072595322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1165612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZang, Xiayun10aAging of exogenous arsenic in flooded paddy soils: Characteristics and predictive models  aUnderstanding the arsenic (As) aging process is important for predicting the environmental behavior of exogenous As in paddy soils.

Soil available As extracted by 0.05 M NH₄H₂PO₄ was monitored through the aging process. Results showed that the available As%, the percentage of remaining available As in aged soils to added total As, fell from 44.2% to 41.9% on the 1st day to 22.0% and 23.0% on the 115th day for the low and high As spiked soils, respectively, then it remained basically unchanged after the 115th day. The pseudo-second order equation could adequately describe the aging kinetics of exogenous As in paddy soils. There was no significant difference in As aging parameters between the two spiked concentrations. Contents of soil free Al and Mn oxides, clay and cation exchange capacity strongly affected the aging rate of exogenous As. An empirical model, incorporating soil pH, cation exchange capacity, Olsen-P and flooding time, was developed to predict well the change of soil available As% during aging process (R² = 0.711). The model could be potentially utilized to manage As-contaminated paddy fields and normalize ecotoxicity and bioaccumulation datasets in attempt to derive more widely applicable soil environmental quality criteria for As.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay 3adata collection 3aecotoxicology 3aempirical models 3aenvironmental quality 3aequations 3apaddies 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3asoil pH 0aAs availability 0aKinetic equations 0aAging rate 0aFlooding time 0aEmpirical models1 aZhou, Zhigao1 aZhang, Taolin1 aWang, Xingxiang1 aDing, Changfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6730-93820 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 274 p.116561-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1165613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011800164300001800282520068900300592002800989596008801017650002101105650001201126650001001138650001501148650001701163650001201180650001301192650003001205650002101235650001101256650002501267650001301292650002201305650001601327650002001343650001401363653001801377700001601395700002401411700002101435773011001456856008201566852000901648655001201657IND60672018720221122213234.0191008e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067201872DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-01-19-0012-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Zesong10aAlternative Oxidase Is Involved in the Pathogenicity, Development, and Oxygen Stress Response of Botrytis cinerea  ap. 1679-1688.  aAlternative oxidase (AOX) is a ubiquinol terminal oxidase that is involved in fungal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

The dye-labelled CNCs have lots of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface, which make them disperse well in water. There is little fluorescence discrimination for 1,8-naphthalimide dye in the presence of different metal ions, while the fluorescent CNCs exhibit selective and sensitive response to Pb(II) with remarkably enhanced emission intensity. The limit of detection of the fluorescent CNCs is as low as 1.5 × 10⁻⁷ mol/L, and there is good linear relationship between the fluorescence maxima and the Pb(II) concentration in a wide range of 2.5 × 10⁻⁷–5.0 × 10⁻⁵ mol/L. The sensing ability of the dye-labeled CNCs to Pb(II) is ascribed to the synergistic complexation of Pb(II) with both the grafted dye groups and the adjacent carboxyl groups on the surface of the CNCs. The combination ratio of Pb(II) to the fluorophore on CNCs is determined to be 1.2:1 via Job’s plot experiment, which is basically consistent with the theoretical value of 1:1. The offered fluorescent CNCs can be employed as a nanosensor for the detection of metal ions and can be further promoted for many applications in chemical, environmental, and biological systems. Water-dispersible fluorescent probe via covalent immobilization of 1,8-naphthalimide on cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) exhibits selective and sensitive detection of lead ions in complete aqueous solution. The inhibited intramolecular charge transfer process (ICT) of the fluorophores loaded on CNCs contributes to the remarkably enhanced fluorescence emission in the presence of lead ions.  aPublisher supplied data  aBK20171450cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province  a61571239cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aKF201804cFoundation of State Key Laboratory of Biobased Material and Green Papermaking (QiluUniversity of Technology, Shangdong Academy of Sciences 3aaqueous solutions 3acellulose 3achemical bonding 3adetection limit 3aemissions factor 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3alead 3ametal ions 3amoieties 3ananocrystals 3asensors (equipment)1 aZhang, Qing1 aChu, Youlu1 aZhang, Lei1 aDai, Hongqi1 aWu, Weibing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2786-95850 tCellulose.g2019 Dec., v. 26, no. 18 p.9553-9565dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02760-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011200171520114800283592002801431650002301459650000801482650005201490650002001542650002401562650001501586653001501601653003001616653002701646653002301673653001901696700002201715700001501737700001701752700001901769773011201788856008701900852000901987655001201996IND60732789720221119160346.0220606e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073278972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.1141442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xueliang10aAnalytical sensitivity comparison of 14 conventional and three rapid RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection  aRecent reports have compared the analytical sensitivities of some SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays, but differences in the viral materials used for these evaluations made comprehensive conclusions difficult. We carried out a direct comparison of the analytical sensitivities of 14 conventional and three rapid RT-PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The comparison was performed utilizing a certified reference material for SARS-CoV-2 RNA that was serially two-fold diluted in RNA storage solution. Our results show that the analytical sensitivities of the 17 assays varied within an 8-fold range (100–800 copies/mL). Moreover, a trend with some rapid assays yielding slightly higher analytical sensitivities (2- to 4-fold) compared with conventional assays was observed. We conclude that most of the RT-PCR assays can be used for routine COVID-19 diagnosis, but some assays with the poorest analytical sensitivities may lead to false-negative results when used to identify asymptomatic individuals who can carry a low viral load but still be infectious. These findings should be kept in mind when selecting high-sensitivity and rapid assays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3adetection limit 3areference standards 3aviral load 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aReverse transcription PCR 0aAnalytical sensitivity 0aLimit of detection 0aFalse-negative1 aHuang, Zhongqiang1 aSong, Jian1 aXiao, Yanqun1 aWang, Hualiang0 tJournal of virological methods.g2021 July, v. 293 p.114144-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.1141443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01549naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245006300210300001100273520069800284592002800982650001901010650001101029650002101040773014201061856008301203852000901286655001201295IND60733021120221116160925.0210612e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073302112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10806-021-09848-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobertson, Cassidy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5823-174X10aReducing Personal Emissions in Response to Collective Harm  ap. 14.  aAnthropogenic climate change threatens humanity as a whole, making its mitigation a matter of pressing concern. Mitigation efforts at the institutional level are necessary to successfully change the course of climate change, but thus far governments and industries have been ineffective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A point of philosophical contention is whether individuals have a moral responsibility to reduce their own emissions given the lack of institutional action. I argue that they do by redefining climate change as a collective impact. Individual emitters share collective responsibility for that impact, which translates to an individual duty to reduce their contribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aethics 3agreenhouse gases0 tJournal of agricultural & environmental ethics.g2021 Apr., v. 34, no. 2 p.14-14dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49530x1187-78637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-021-09848-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008600167300001600253520180400269592002802073653001302101653002002114653000902134653002302143653001502166653002202181653003302203653001602236653001302252653001602265700002102281773011302302856008302415852000902498655001202507IND60128667020221120204938.0151116e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012866702DNAL7 a10.1644/05-MAMM-A-205R1.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrait, Jamie R.10aRiver otters in yellowstone lake depend on a declining cutthroat trout population  ap. 485-494.  aIntroduced lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) threaten the native cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri) population in Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. A reduction in availability of cutthroat trout may affect fish predators negatively, especially during spawning season. In this study we examined the importance of spawning cutthroat trout to a fish specialist——the North American river otter (Lontra canadensis). We measured scent-marking rates at 87 otter latrine sites on Yellowstone Lake and its tributary streams throughout the cutthroat trout spawning period and identified prey in scats collected at these sites. Based on fecal deposition rates, otters were more active on spawning streams and less active on Yellowstone Lake during the height of cutthroat trout spawning, with a return to elevated activity on the lake after spawning had ended. Cutthroat trout appeared to be the most common prey item in otter scats throughout the study, based on 515 samples identified to the family level and 110 samples analyzed to the species level. Overall, trout occurred in 72%% and longnose suckers (Catostomus catostomus) in 43%% of otter feces. Suckers were more prevalent than trout in otter scats only on tributary streams, toward the end of cutthroat trout spawning. Introduced lake trout, which inhabit deep water and are largely inaccessible to otters, occurred in less than 5%% of otter scats. River otters in the Yellowstone Lake ecosystem appear to be relatively restricted in their diet and are heavily dependent on cutthroat trout. Our findings suggest that continued declines in the cutthroat trout population could negatively impact otters, potentially disrupting their role in linking aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in and around Yellowstone Lake.  aPublisher supplied data 0aactivity 0acutthroat trout 0adiet 0aintroduced species 0alake trout 0aLontra canadensis 0aOncorhynchus clarki bouvieri 0ariver otter 0aspawning 0aYellowstone1 aBen-David, Merav0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2006 June, v. 87, no. 3 p.485-494dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F05-MAMM-A-205R1.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003400139245009900173300002000272520083200292592002801124650002201152650002001174650001701194650002201211650001201233650004401245700002601289700002201315700001901337700001901356700001701375700002101392700002801413700002801441773013401469856007501603961001201678852000901690655001201699IND60540446420170628000000.0160819e20141231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054044642DNAL7 a10.1021/ja511331n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Rodríguez, Aurora10aLanthanide(III) Complexes with a Reinforced Cyclam Ligand Show Unprecedented Kinetic Inertness  ap. 17954-17957.  aLanthanide(III) complexes of a cross-bridged cyclam derivative containing two picolinate pendant arms are kinetically inert in very harsh conditions such as 2 M HCl, with no dissociation being observed for at least 5 months.

The interconversion between these two structures is concentration-dependent: at a concentration higher than 12 mg mL–¹, only a bis-rhombus, composed of eight ligands and 12 Cd²⁺ ions, is formed; whereas a self-assembled tetrahedron, composed of four ligands and six Cd²⁺ ions, appears upon sufficient dilution of the tris-terpyridine-metal solution. At concentrations less than 0.5 mg mL–¹, only the tetrahedron possessing an S₄ symmetry axis is detected; upon attempted isolation, it quantitatively reverts to the bis-rhombus. This observation opens an unexpected door to unusual chemical pathways under high dilution conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3achemical interactions 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aions 3aligands 3areaction mechanisms 3asolutions1 aLi, Xiaopeng1 aGuo, Kai1 aXie, Ting-Zheng1 aMoorefield, C.

An in situ litter decomposition experiment was conducted to examine the effect of 1) a mixture from coniferous litter (Pinus massoniana) with different individual broadleaved litter (Bretschneidera sinensis, Manglietia chingii, Cercidiphyllum japonicum, Michelia maudiae, Camellia oleifera) and 2) their mixing ratio (mass ratios of coniferous and broadleaf litter of 5:5, 6:4 and 7:3) on the release of metallic elements [calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)] during litter decomposition. We found that the identity of the broadleaf tree species in the mixed litter and the mixing ratio affected the release rates of metallic elements (p < 0.05). After one year of decomposition, K, Mg, Mn and Zn were released, while Na, Ca, Fe and Cu accumulated in the mixed litter. Mixing increased the release of K, Ca, Na, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn in more than one-third of the samples, but inhibited the release of K, Fe and Mn in less than 14% of the samples. Increasing the mixing ratio of coniferous to broadleaf litter enhanced the release of Na, Fe, Mn and Zn but decreased the release of Ca and Mg. Overall, these results highlight that mixed litter, particularly tree species identity and mixing ratio, can alter the release and enrichment of metallic elements during litter decomposition, thereby affecting the cycling of metallic elements in plantations with different species compositions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBretschneidera 3aCamellia oleifera 3aCercidiphyllum japonicum 3aMagnolia maudiae 3aManglietia 3aPinus massoniana 3abiogeochemistry 3abroadleaved trees 3aenvironment 3airon 3aplanting 3apotassium 3azinc 0aMixed litter decomposition 0aMetallic elements 0aLitter quality 0aMixing ratio1 aZhou, Yunchao1 aAn, Zhengfeng1 aDu, Jiaojiao1 aZhang, Xunyuan1 aChang, Scott X.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Sept. 10, v. 838 p.156143-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1561433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011900171300001600290500001900306520110900325592002801434596010601462650001801568650001001586650001801596650000901614650002301623650001201646650001801658653002801676653003201704653002301736653003201759653001301791773013601804856008501940852000902025655001202034IND60692792120221120154932.0200503e20170304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069279212DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2016.12631482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamemura, Kazuo10aO-GlcNAc glycosylation stoichiometry of the FET protein family: only EWS is glycosylated with a high stoichiometry  ap. 541-546.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOf the FET (fused in sarcoma [FUS]/Ewing sarcoma protein [EWS]/TATA binding protein-associated factor 15 [TAF15]) family of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle proteins, FUS and TAF15 are consistently and EWS variably found in inclusion bodies in neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with FUS. It is speculated that dysregulation of FET proteins at the post-translational level is involved in their cytoplasmic deposition. Here, the O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) glycosylation stoichiometry of the FET proteins was chemoenzymatically analyzed, and it was found that only EWS is dynamically glycosylated with a high stoichiometry in the neural cell lines tested and in mouse brain. It was also confirmed that EWS, but not FUS and TAF15, is glycosylated with a high stoichiometry not only in the neural cells but also in the non-neural cell lines tested. These results indicate that O-GlcNAc glycosylation imparts a physicochemical property on EWS that is distinct from that of the other FET proteins in most of cell lineages or tissues.  aPublisher supplied data  a15K00412a16K07700cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691 3abiotechnology 3abrain 3aglycosylation 3amice 3aribonucleoproteins 3asarcoma 3astoichiometry 0achemoenzymatic labeling 0aEwing sarcoma protein (EWS) 0aFET protein family 0aglycosylation stoichiometry 0aO-GlcNAc0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2017 Mar. 4, v. 81, no. 3 p.541-546dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2016.12631483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245007900209300001800288520179800306592002802104596003102132596003102163650001502194650002202209650001502231650001202246650001102258650001402269650001902283650001502302650001502317650001302332650001502345651001202360700002302372700002202395700002002417700002002437773011902457856008302576852000902659655001202668IND60733021420221116160908.0211002e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073302142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-021-01194-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRäsänen, Aleksi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3629-183710aPredicting catchment-scale methane fluxes with multi-source remote sensing  ap. 1177-1195.  aCONTEXT: Spatial patterns of CH₄ fluxes can be modeled with remotely sensed data representing land cover, soil moisture and topography. Spatially extensive CH₄ flux measurements conducted with portable analyzers have not been previously upscaled with remote sensing. OBJECTIVES: How well can the CH₄ fluxes be predicted with plot-based vegetation measures and remote sensing? How does the predictive skill of the model change when using different combinations of predictor variables? METHODS: We measured CH₄ fluxes in 279 plots in a 12.4 km² peatland-forest-mosaic landscape in Pallas area, northern Finland in July 2019. We compared 20 different CH₄ flux maps produced with vegetation field data and remote sensing data including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and digital terrain model (DTM). RESULTS: The landscape acted as a net source of CH₄ (253–502 µg m⁻² h⁻¹) and the proportion of source areas varied considerably between maps (12–50%). The amount of explained variance was high in CH₄ regressions (59–76%, nRMSE 8–10%). Regressions including remote sensing predictors had better performance than regressions with plot-based vegetation predictors. The most important remote sensing predictors included VH-polarized Sentinel-1 features together with topographic wetness index and other DTM features. Spatial patterns were most accurately predicted when the landscape was divided into sinks and sources with remote sensing-based classifications, and the fluxes were modeled for sinks and sources separately. CONCLUSIONS: CH₄ fluxes can be predicted accurately with multi-source remote sensing in northern boreal peatland landscapes. High spatial resolution remote sensing-based maps constrain uncertainties related to CH₄ fluxes and their spatial patterns.  aPublisher supplied data  a308513cAcademy of Finland  a308511cAcademy of Finland 3aland cover 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3amethane 3amodels 3apeatlands 3aremote sensing 3asoil water 3atopography 3avariance 3avegetation 3aFinland1 aManninen, Terhikki1 aKorkiakoski, Mika1 aLohila, Annalea1 aVirtanen, Tarmo0 tLandscape ecology.g2021 Apr., v. 36, no. 4 p.1177-1195dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870067x0921-29737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-021-01194-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011500173300001600288520093500304592002801239650001801267650002401285650001501309650001201324650002601336650002301362650002301385650001601408650001901424650001401443650001001457650001001467651001001477700002501487773010501512856008101617852000901698655001201707IND60439378420221121030559.0151024e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043937842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-004-0740-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBustamante, Ramiro O.10aIs Pinus radiata invading the native vegetation in central Chile? Demographic responses in a fragmented forest  ap. 243-249.  aForest fragmentation facilitates the invasion of exotic species. This threat may be especially severe if forest fragments are surrounded by plantations of exotic species like Pinus radiata, an aggressive colonizer and shade-intolerant tree that has invaded successfully several native ecosystems of the southern hemisphere. In this study, we experimentally tested if the conditions of a successful seedling establishment P. radiata are fulfilled at the Coastal Maulino forest, an endemic fragmented forest of central Chile. Results demonstrated that seeds are dispersed into the native forests, however seedling establishment occurs only at the edges. We conclude that this exotic species is not invading native forests up to date. However, we suggest to conduct evaluations of seed rain and seedling establishment in the long term, in order to monitor the fate of this exotic species in fragmented native forest of Central Chile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus radiata 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3aforests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aplantations 3aseed dispersal 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3atrees 3aChile1 aSimonetti, Javier A.0 tBiological invasions.g2005 Mar., v. 7, no. 2 p.243-249dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-004-0740-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03598naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001900192245007800211506007600289520148400365536013601849592002801985596001402013596005902027506003702086650002602123650001302149650001802162650001102180650001102191650000902202650001502211650001202226650002202238650001502260650001002275650001802285650001002303650002102313650001402334650001702348650001702365650002402382650001002406650001902416650001402435650002002449650001102469650001402480650001802494650001702512653001002529653002902539700001402568700001102582700001502593700001502608700001402623700001602637700002102653773012002674856008502794852000902879655001202888IND60691025620221207073252.0200427e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069102562DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2017.14141212doi7 aPMC57904122pmcid7 a292197292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wenying10aDrought stress responses in maize are diminished by Piriformospora indica  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs an endophytic fungus of Sebacinales, Piriformospora indica promotes plant growth and resistance to abiotic stress, including drought. Colonization of maize roots promoted the leaf size, root length and number of tap roots. Under drought stress, the maize seedlings profited from the presence of the fungus and performed visibly better than the uncolonized controls. To identify genes and biological processes involved in growth promotion and drought tolerance conferred by P. indica, the root transcriptome of colonized and uncolonized seedlings was analyzed 0, 6 and 12 h after drought stress (20% polyethylene glycol 6000). The number of P. indica-responsive genes increased from 464 (no stress at 0 h) to 1337 (6 h drought) and 2037 (12 h drought). Gene Ontology analyses showed that the carbon and sulfur metabolisms are major targets of the fungus. Furthermore, the growth promoting effect of P. indica is reflected by higher transcript levels for microtubule associated processes. Under drought stress, the fungus improved the oxidative potential of the roots, and stimulated genes for hormone functions, including those which respond to abscisic acid, auxin, salicylic acid and cytokinins. The comparative analyses of our study provides systematic insight into the molecular mechanism how P. indica promotes plant performance under drought stress, and presents a collection of genes which are specifically targeted by the fungus under drought stress in maize roots.  aThis work was supported by funds from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31471496).

The cartographic materials used have the Map of Southern Romania from 1864, the Firing Master Plans and the Corine Land Cover dataset (1990, 2000, 2018) as reference. For the case studies, these sources are supplemented by the orthophotoplan from 2012 and the remotely-sensed image acquired by Corona satellites in 1974. The results highlight the fact that between 1864 and 2018, the Central Bărăgan Plain recorded important changes in land resources. The most significant transformations took place in the period between 1864 and 1959, when 58% of the plain area was purposed for another use in that large areas of land were introduced in the agricultural use. If in 1864 the agricultural lands represented less than half (196.896 ha) of the Central Bărăgan area, the natural areas being dominant (201.473 ha), in the first half of the 20th century, they increased exponentially (361.674 ha), the natural vegetation occupying much smaller areas (28.481 ha) mainly along the Ialomița and Călmățui rivers and near lakes. This trend is also expressed by the values of the index of naturalness which shows a drastic decrease, from 51.7% in 1864, to 10.6% in 1916–1959. There is also an increase of the area cover by settlements which should be explained by the occurrence of new villages and the increase in size of the existing villages. Another result of the approach concerns the changes that occurred in the agricultural landscape in the middle, respectively at the end of the 20th century, which is a fact quantified by computing the index of land fragmentation. The dynamics of land use and the changes in the features of the agricultural landscape, as far as the analyzed area is concerned, are due to the agrarian reforms pertaining to different historical periods, as well as to the forced relocations during the communist regime. Therefore, the study aims to highlight changes during historical, socio-economic and political time in land use and to reduce the degree of naturalness of the territory at the same time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural landscapes 3aagriculture 3adata collection 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aland cover 3aland use 3apolitics 3aremote sensing 3asocioeconomics 3avegetation 3aRomania1 aBărsoianu, Iulian  Andrei1 aNistor, Constantin 1 aNedelea, Alexandru 1 aComănescu, Laura 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 May 07, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture110504233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009000168300001800258520106800276592002801344650002701372650001801399650001601417650001601433650002101449650001901470650001001489650001101499650001001510653002701520653001801547653001901565653002301584700002001607700001801627700001301645700001601658773018501674856008501859852000901944655001201953IND60087316820221118195259.0160903e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008731682DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60232-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kejia10aCharacterization of typical taste and odor compounds formed by Microcystis aeruginosa  ap. 1539-1548.  aProduction and characteristics of typical taste and odor (T&O) compounds by Microcystis aeruginosa were investigated. A few terpenoid chemicals, including 2-MIB, β-cyclocitral, and β-ionone, and a few sulfur compounds, such as dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl trisulfide, were detected. β-Cyclocitral and β-carotene concentrations were observed to be relevant to the growth phases of Microcystis. During the stable growth phase, 41–865 fg/cell of β-cyclocitral were found in the laboratory culture. β-Cyclocitral concentrations correlated closely with β-carotene concentrations, with the correlation coefficient R2 = 0.96, as it is formed from the cleavage reaction of β-carotene. For dead cell cases, a high concentration of dimethyl trisulfide was detected at 3.48–6.37 fg/cell. Four T&O compounds, including β-cyclocitral, β-ionone, heptanal and dimethyl trisulfide, were tested and found to be able to inhibit and damage Microcystis cells to varying degrees. Among these chemicals, β-cyclocitral has the strongest ability to quickly rupture cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3abeta-carotene 3abeta-ionone 3acorrelation 3adimethyl sulfide 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3asulfur 3ataste 0aMicrocystis aeruginosa 0aT&O compounds 0aβ-cyclocitral 0aalgae-lytic effect1 aLin, Tsair-Fuh,1 aZhang, Tuqiao1 aLi, Cong1 aGao, Naiyun0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2013 Aug. 01, v. 25 p.1539-1548dElsevier B.V.aThe Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60232-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245010900154300001800263500002000281520136500301592002801666650001301694650002001707650001801727650001801745650001101763650002001774650001301794650001301807650001501820700002401835700002301859700002301882773012201905856007202027852000902099655001202108IND60571877520221118065041.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057187752DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.37002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBooij, Kees12aA method to account for the effect of hydrodynamics on polar organic compound uptake by passive samplers  ap. 1517-1524.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMass transfer coefficients of the water boundary layer (kw) were measured using alabaster dissolution kinetics in a diffusion cell that was operated at stirring rates between 90 min⁻¹ and 600 min⁻¹, aiming to provide a more robust characterization of the effect of hydrodynamics on the uptake of polar compounds by passive samplers, as compared with characterizations in terms of stirring rates and water flow velocities. The measured kw helped to quantitatively understand calcium sulfate transport through a poly(ethersulfone) membrane and 2 water boundary layers (at both sides of the membrane). Alabaster‐based kw value were used to understand atrazine transport in the diffusion cell, allowing the conclusion that atrazine transport in the membrane is via the pore space, rather than via the polymer matrix. The merits of measuring alabaster dissolution rates for passive sampler calibration and application in the field are discussed. The authors propose that passive sampler calibrations be carried out under controlled kw conditions, rather than under controlled stirring rates or flow velocities. This would facilitate the interpretation of passive sampler calibration studies and the translation of laboratory‐based water sampling rates to flow conditions that apply in the field.

Both species were variably assigned to either Hydrolithon or Porolithon during the last two centuries, with L. coarctatum, from the tropical eastern Indian Ocean currently considered a synonym of L. gardineri from the tropical western Indian Ocean. Phylogenetic analyses show that both belong in Porolithon and that they are distinct species despite their morpho-anatomical similarities, including a columnar morphology. Porolithon epiphyticum sp. nov., from the same locality as P. coarctatum, Cocos-Keeling Islands, is the first reported epiphytic species in the genus. Eight of the currently recognized 15 species of Porolithon have had their type specimens sequenced to correctly apply names, including the generitype specimen. DNA sequencing provides independent confirmation that the morpho-anatomical character of the presence of horizontal fields of trichocytes without intervening vegetative cells is diagnostic for Porolithon. The generitypes of the four genera classified in the subfamily Metagoniolithoideae, Dawsoniolithon, Floiophycus, Harveylithon, and Metagoniolithon as well as Hydrolithon in the subfamily Hydrolithoideae, have not been sequenced. The taxonomic and nomenclatural uncertainties in each of these genera are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB-1754504 3aDNA 3aHydrolithon 3aLithophyllum 3aPorolithon 3aepiphytes 3aphylogeny 3aIndian Ocean 0apsbA 0arbcL 0atrichocyte arrangement 0atype sequences1 aSaunders, Gary W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4813-68311 aHughey, Jeffery R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4053-91501 aGabrielson, Paul W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9416-11870 tBotanica marina.g2021 Oct. 26, v. 64, no. 5 p.363-377dDe GruyterwJournal:1930x1437-43237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/bot-2021-00413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245010700180300001600287520207600303592002802379650002102407650000902428650001002437650001602447650002702463650002402490650002102514650001402535650001402549650001602563650001402579650002302593650002202616650002402638650002402662650001402686700002502700773010502725856008102830852000902911655001202920IND60439378620221121020631.0151024e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043937862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-004-0870-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambrecht-McDowell, Susan C.10aPopulation demographics and trade-offs to reproduction of an invasive and noninvasive species of Rubus  ap. 281-295.  aDo trade-offs between growth and reproduction differ between an invasive and noninvasive plant species and how do such trade-offs relate to population demographics? To help address these questions, we compared demographics for an invasive plant species, Rubus discolor, with a noninvasive congener, R. ursinus, in several populations of varying density. Removal of floral buds from reproductive canes increased the size of juvenile canes that arose from clonal sprouting in R. ursinus, suggesting a trade-off between current reproduction and growth. Removal of floral buds had no effect on growth of R. discolor. R. ursinus displayed trade-offs between reproduction (sexual and vegetative) and future growth based on negative correlations between leaf area production and both clonal sprouting and seedling production during the previous year. R. discolor did not exhibit these trade-offs. Both species had high population growth rates in low-density populations, but exhibited little or no growth in high-density populations. A life table response experiment was used to determine the underlying cause for the effect of density on population growth. For R. ursinus, lack of population growth in high-density populations was due primarily to increased mortality of clonally sprouting canes, while for R. discolor, it was due to decreased clonal cane production. Elasticity analysis revealed that clonal growth was more important than sexual reproduction for population growth of both species. However, elasticity values for sexual reproduction in R. discolor were greater in high- than low-density populations. This suggests an increased reliance on sexual reproduction in populations that had reached stable sizes, which could increase the capacity of R. discolor to disperse to new sites. Elasticity analyses were also used to simulate the efficacy of various control strategies for R. discolor. Control of this species could be attained by reducing clonal production within existing populations while reducing seed production to limit establishment of new populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRubus armeniacus 3abuds 3acanes 3acorrelation 3ademographic statistics 3aecological invasion 3ainvasive species 3ajuveniles 3aleaf area 3alife tables 3amortality 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3aseedling production 3asexual reproduction 3asprouting1 aRadosevich, Steve R.0 tBiological invasions.g2005 Mar., v. 7, no. 2 p.281-295dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-004-0870-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04639naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245012400163520295900287592002803246650001203274650001703286650002103303650002003324650002903344650002503373650001903398650003503417650003103452650001903483650001603502650002203518650001503540650001303555650001903568650000903587650001703596650002203613650002603635650002603661650001703687650002803704650001603732650001703748650001703765651001703782651001003799651001403809651001503823700002303838773012803861856007503989852000904064655001204073IND60703981920221122111451.0200722e20200427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070398192DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120913762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagabhatla, Nidhi 10aGeospatial Assessment of Water-Migration Scenarios in the Context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6, 11, and 16  aCommunities and countries around the world are gearing up efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda goals and targets. In this paper, the water and migration scenarios are explained with a focus on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6 (water-related), 11 (urbanization), and 16 (peace and political stability). The study has two phases. The first phase illustrates the application of geospatial data and tools to assess the water-migration interlinkages (nexus) by employing a case study approach. Three case studies, Lake Chad, the Aral Sea region, and the Nile Delta, representing various geographic and socio-political settings, were selected to perform the multitemporal analysis. For this analysis, a mixed toolset framework that combined algorithmic functions of digital image processing, the Landsat sensor data, and applied a geographic information system (GIS) platform was adopted. How water-related events directly or indirectly trigger human migration is described using spatial indicators such as water spread and the extent of urban sprawl. Additionally, the geospatial outputs were analyzed in tandem with the climate variables such as temperature, precipitation data, and socio-economic variables such as population trends and migration patterns. Overall, the three case studies examined how water and climate crisis scenarios influence migration at a local and regional scale. The second phase showcases global-scale analysis based on the Global Conflict Risk Index (GCRI). This indicator reflects on the risks and conflicts with environmental, social, and political aspects and comments on the connection of these dimensions with migration. Together, the two phases of this paper provide an understanding ofthe interplay of water-related events on migration by applying the geospatial assessment and a proxy global index. Additionally, the paper reiterates that such an understanding can serve to establish facts and create evidence to inform sustainable development planning and decision making, particularly with regard to SDGs 6, 11, and 16. Targets such as 6.4 (managing water stress), 6.5 (transboundary challenges) and, 11.B (adaptation and resilience planning) can benefit from the knowledge generated by this geospatial exercise. For example, the high GCRI values for the African region speak to SDG targets 11.B (integrated policies/plans) and 16.7 (decision support systems for peaceful societies). Two key highlights from the synthesis: (a) migration and urbanization are closely interconnected, and (b) the impact of water and climate crisis is comparatively high for rural-urban migration due to the considerable dependence of rural communities on nature-based livelihoods. In conclusion, geospatial analysis is an important tool to study the interlinkages between water and migration. The paper presents a novel perspective toward widening the scope of remote sensing data and GIS toward the implementation of the SDG Agenda.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acase studies 3aclimatic factors 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3adevelopment planning 3adigital images 3ageographic information systems 3ageospatial data processing 3aimage analysis 3aimmigration 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3apolitics 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3ariver deltas 3arural communities 3arural urban migration 3asocioeconomic factors 3aspatial data 3asustainable development 3atemperature 3aurbanization 3awater stress 3aCentral Asia 3aEgypt 3aLake Chad 3aNile River1 aBrahmbhatt, Rupal 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Apr. 27, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120913763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013200161300001600293520164700309592002801956650002901984650001302013650002602026650001702052650001202069650001502081650001402096650001702110650002002127650001402147650002102161650002102182650001002203650001802213650001502231650001102246650002102257650001602278650001302294650001502307650000902322650002202331650001402353650002202367650002102389650001402410700002102424700001702445773010702462856008102569852000902650655001202659IND60466276920221116191139.0151123e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046627692DNAL7 a10.1007/s12602-015-9199-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenan, S.10aFeasibility of Genome-Wide Screening for Biosafety Assessment of Probiotics: A Case Study of Lactobacillus helveticus MTCC 5463  ap. 249-258.  aRecent years have witnessed an explosion in genome sequencing of probiotic strains for accurate identification and characterization. Regulatory bodies are emphasizing on the need for performing phase I safety studies for probiotics. The main hypothesis of this study was to explore the feasibility of using genome databases for safety screening of strains. In this study, we attempted to develop a framework for the safety assessment of a potential probiotic strain, Lactobacillus helveticus MTCC 5463 based on genome mining for genes associated with antibiotic resistance, production of harmful metabolites, and virulence. The sequencing of MTCC 5463 was performed using GS-FLX Titanium reagents. Genes coding for antibiotic resistance and virulence were identified using Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database and Virulence Factors Database. Results indicated that MTCC 5463 carried antibiotic resistance genes associated with beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone. There is no threat of transfer of these genes to host gut commensals because the genes are not plasmid encoded. The presence of genes for adhesion, biofilm, surface proteins, and stress-related proteins provides robustness to the strain. The presence of hemolysin gene in the genome revealed a theoretical risk of virulence. The results of in silico analysis complemented the in vitro studies and human clinical trials, confirming the safety of the probiotic strain. We propose that the safety assessment of probiotic strains administered live at high doses using a genome-wide screening could be an effective and time-saving tool for identifying prognostic biomarkers of biosafety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3aadhesion 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeta-lactams 3abiofilm 3abiomarkers 3abiosafety 3acase studies 3aclinical trials 3adatabases 3adigestive system 3afluoroquinolones 3agenes 3agenome mining 3ahemolysins 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3ametabolites 3aplasmids 3aprobiotics 3arisk 3asafety assessment 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3asurface proteins 3avirulence1 aPrajapati, J.

This phenomenon is characterized by a host species, which firstly can successfully establish in a non-native habitat, but then spontaneously disappears again. This study proposes a reaction-diffusion model consisting of a simple SI disease with vital dynamics of Allee effect type. By way of travelling wave analysis, conditions are derived under which the invasion of the host population is slowed down, stopped or reversed as a consequence of a subsequently introduced disease. Hence, pathogens can dramatically control the rate of spread of invasive species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological invasion 3ahabitats 3ahosts 3ainfectious diseases 3ainvasive species 3amodels 3apathogens1 aLewis, Mark A.1 aSeno, Hiromi1 aLanglais, Michel1 aMalchow, Horst0 tBiological invasions.g2005 Sept., v. 7, no. 5 p.817-832dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-005-5215-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002300144245009300167300001600260520069100276650000900967650001300976650001200989650001301001650002301014650002201037650002301059650001901082650001301101650001201114650002001126650002201146650003101168650001701199650001701216650003401233700002401267700002501291700002301316700002401339773008501363852000901448930003301457945002501490946001101515655001201526IND4364722720221119203258.0040930e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436472272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

One lot of aflatoxin-free grain served as the control Lot 1 (L1). Lot 2 (L2) and Lot 3 (L3) had aflatoxin concentrations of 120.7 and 575.0 microgram kg-1. In the case of contaminated pinole-powder, the aflatoxin content was 22.9 for L2 and 171.0 microgram kg-1 for L3 and, after atole preparation (a Mexican porridge-like drink), the aflatoxin content was 9.7 and 68.2 microgram kg-1 for L2 and L3, respectively. According to these results, higher reductions in mycotoxin levels were achieved during the toasting process and only a moderate extra-reduction occurred during the boiling process. 3acorn 3aZea mays 3ahybrids 3ainoculum 3aAspergillus flavus 3atoxigenic strains 3afood contamination 3afood pathogens 3atoasting 3aboiling 3adecontamination 3apathogen survival 3aphysicochemical properties 3aaflatoxin B1 3aaflatoxin B2 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography1 aJesus-Flores, F. de1 aCastaneda-Roldan, E.1 aArambula-Villa, G.1 aMoreno-Martinez, E.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2004 Dec., v. 65, no. 4 p.585-589x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20041203b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/12/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02979naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175100002800184245009200212300001400304500002400318500001500342520126400357650001201621650002801633650001901661650001601680650001801696650001301714650001001727650002501737650001501762650002601777650002201803650001501825650001001840650004801850650003001898650002301928650001801951650003401969650001102003650001102014650001602025653001502041700003002056700002302086700002302109773008002132852000902212856008702221930003302308945002502341946001102366655001202377IND4413373720221119203140.0081205e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441337372DNAL7 a187787422pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT0001 aDingemans, Alexandra E.14aThe effect of suppressing negative emotions on eating behavior in binge eating disorder  ap. 51-57.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOvereating may be a consequence of the suppression of negative emotions, by depleting self-control resources. This experiment investigated whether (a) there is a causal relationship between the suppression of negative emotions, negative mood, and overeating in people with binge eating disorder (BED) and whether (b) this relationship is increased in depressed people with BED. Sixty-six women with (full and sub-threshold) BED were shown an upsetting movie and then asked either to suppress their emotions or to react naturally. Subsequently, everyone participated in a taste task. After a decline, initial mood before watching the movie was restored after eating. Depressive symptomatology was positively correlated with caloric intake. Within the clinically depressed (Beck Depression Inventory-score>19) BED group, those who were most affected by the negative mood induction consumed the most calories. No differences were found between the two conditions with regard to caloric intake. No interaction effect was found between depressive symptoms and mood suppression. The hypothesis that suppression of negative emotion leads to overeating in (depressed) binge eaters was not born out. Overeating may serve as a means to (temporary) repair negative mood. 3abinging 3aepidemiological studies 3ahuman diseases 3afood intake 3aenergy intake 3aemotions 3awomen 3apsychological stress 3aovereating 3abinge eating disorder 3acoping strategies 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBulimia Nervosaxcomplicationsxpsychology. 2aDepressionxcomplications 2aEatingxpsychology 2aEnergy Intake 2aExpressed Emotionxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 0adepression1 aMartijn, Alida Catharina.1 aJansen, Anita T.M.1 avan Furth, Eric F.0 tAppetite.g2009 Feb., v. 52, no. 1 p.51-57dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2008.08.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090218b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/01/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03291naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166100001900175245008500194300001400279500002400293500001500317520162600332650001101958650001601969650001801985650001002003650001502013650001102028650001602039650001702055650001002072650001702082650001402099650002802113650001602141650001202157650001502169650001002184650001102194650002502205650002302230650001102253650000902264650002202273650001102295650001102306650001502317653001802332653002302350653001402373700002102387773008002408852000902488856008702497930003302584945002502617946001102642655001202653IND4413373520221119203239.0081205e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441337352DNAL7 a186921032pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aHiggs, Suzanne10aTelevision watching during lunch increases afternoon snack intake of young women  ap. 39-43.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEating while watching television has been shown to increase food intake in part due to the distracting effects of television viewing. It is also known that enhancing memory for the specific attributes of foods eaten in the recent past decreases subsequent food intake. Because distraction at the time of encoding interferes with memory formation, we predicted that television watching during lunch would increase afternoon snack intake due to impaired memory for recent eating. Using a repeated-measures design, 16 young women undergraduate students visited the laboratory to eat a fixed lunch either while watching television or in the absence of television. Intake of cookies at a tasting session later that afternoon was measured and participants recalled eating the lunch and rated the memory for vividness. All participants ate all of the lunch and rated appetite during lunch did not differ according to condition. Participants ate significantly more cookies after they had eaten their lunch while watching television than when they had eaten their lunch while not watching television and this effect could not be attributed to an effect of television watching on rated mood or appetite before the snack session. Watching television while eating lunch was also associated with reduced vividness ratings of the memory of the lunch. These results suggest that the effects of television watching on food intake extend beyond the time of television watching to affect subsequent consumption. They further suggest that this effect may be related to an effect of television watching on encoding of the memory of the meal. 3amemory 3afood intake 3aconsciousness 3awomen 3arecreation 3asnacks 3asnack foods 3ayoung adults 3alunch 3afood choices 3alifestyle 3aperceptions (cognitive) 3adiet recall 3acookies 3atelevision 2aAdult 2aAffect 2aAppetitexphysiology 2aEatingxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFood 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aMemory 2aTelevision 0aeating habits 0atelevision viewing 0acognition1 aWoodward, Morgan0 tAppetite.g2009 Feb., v. 52, no. 1 p.39-43dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2008.07.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090218b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/01/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02191naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245008500187300001600272520078700288650003001075650002001105650001501125650001001140650001501150650002201165650002001187650001901207650001501226650002901241650003801270650001801308650002801326650002001354651000901374653001601383653001101399700002101410700001801431773013401449852000901583856008501592930003301677946001101710655001201721IND4436740820221119203220.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443674082DNAL7 a194248172pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-0944-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosseinibalam, F. 10aAnalysis and assessment of ground-level ozone measured at two stations in Tehran  ap. 275-281.  aIn this study, variations of ambient ozone level are thoroughly analysed according to the monitored data in a mixed residential, commercial and industrial city, Tehran, based on considering the meteorological factors. Ozone as a pollutant shows typical annual, weekly and diurnal cycles. This analysis has shown that the ozone level concentrations were below the WHO guidelines in Tehran during 2000-2003. The relation between ozone level at two different stations (Aghdasieh and Fatemi) is found (r = 0.51). The ozone level response to meteorological parameters is investigated. The results suggest that the ozone level is affected (positively or negatively) by meteorological conditions, e.g. relative humidity, solar radiation, air temperature, wind speed and wind direction. 3aWorld Health Organization 3aair temperature 3aguidelines 3aozone 3apollutants 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation 3awind direction 3awind speed 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aHealth Status 2aMeteorological Concepts 2aOzonexanalysis 0aIran 0aOzone level 0aTehran1 aHassanzadeh, S. 1 aAlizadeh, R. 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 June, v. 165, no. 1-4 p.275-281dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0944-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01597naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007600127300001400203520088900217650001801106650000901124650001101133650001901144653001901163700001901182773006501201852000901266939003301275946001101308655001201319IND9204528720221119203307.0920718s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920452872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGordon, M.H.10aSteryl ester analysis as an aid to the identification of oils in blends  ap. 71-78.  aSixty steryl esters have been synthesised in simple mixtures and used to optimise conditions for the separation of steryl esters by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC). Both techniques give good separations of many steryl esters, but the techniques complement each other since the elution sequence differs. A steryl ester-rich fraction has been isolated from 14 oil samples by thin-layer chromatography and analysed by GC and HPLC. GC analysis is more sensitive and faster than HPLC, and also has the advantage that residual triacylglycerols are separated from the steryl esters. The pattern of chromatographic peaks is similar for different samples of the same oil, but varies widely for different oils. It is therefore concluded that GC analysis of the intact steryl ester fraction may be useful as a technique for identifying mixtures of oils. 3ablended foods 3aoils 3aesters 3achromatography 0aidentification1 aGriffith, R.E.0 tFood chemistry.g1992, v. 43, no. 1 p.71-78x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02685naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001800178245014600196300001600342500001500358520104300373650001901416650001801435650001201453650001901465650002301484650001601507650001101523650002401534650001001558650001201568650001401580650001601594650001901610650001101629650002001640650002501660650001001685650001801695650001301713650001301726650001801739650001901757653006301776653000901839653001101848653001901859700001301878700001701891773008501908852000901993930003302002945002502035946001102060655001202071IND4364721620221119203239.0040930e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436472162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Crumb temperature profiles simulated by the CFD model were utilized to estimate the degree of starch gelatinisation at different positions within a loaf baked in a travelling-tray oven. The gelatinisation profiles were predicted to be asymmetrical both horizontally and vertically across the loaf. In addition, variations in gelatinisation rate were found among the four tins within a single tray. Due to the fact that starch gelatinisation was claimed to be an indicator of baking progression, it was utilised to check the completeness of baking under various oven operating conditions. The results in this paper also assured the completion of baking under a particularly modified operating condition that could provide the nearly optimum tin temperature profile for baking white sandwich bread with a baking time of 25 min. 3adynamic models 3amass transfer 3atexture 3awater activity 3acontinuous systems 3aamylopectin 3abreads 3amathematical models 3aovens 3aamylose 3aequations 3abreadmaking 3abaking quality 3abaking 3astarch granules 3atemperature profiles 3adough 3aparticle size 3akinetics 3aair flow 3aheat transfer 3agelatinization 0athree-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model 0aflow 0astarch 0athermodynamics1 aZhou, W.1 aAdamczak, T.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2004 Dec., v. 65, no. 4 p.543-550x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20041203b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/12/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02464naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001300178245009200191300001600283520102000299650000801319650001601327650001401343650001201357650001701369650001701386650002401403650001701427650001701444650001301461650001901474650002001493650001801513650002301531650001001554650001201564650001301576650001501589650003301604653002701637653002701664653002501691653001701716700001401733773008501747852000901832930003301841945002501874946001101899655001201910IND4364721720221119203056.0040930e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436472172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The effects of locations, cooking methods (wet air cooking, dry air cooking and water cooking) and storage on the ham quality were elaborated by the score plot of PCA, which indicated 68% of the total variance of the quality attributes of pork ham. The result showed that the ham quality after four weeks storage was clearly lower compared with that without storage, especially in the attributes of hardness, Warner¡Bratzler shear (WBS), a* and b*. The location effect on the quality attributes for dry air cooking and wet air cooking without storage was distinctly displayed, however this effect was not obvious after storage. The location effect could not be observed for water cooking with and without storage. Although there are some differences in quality attributes among these three cooking methods, the ham quality could not be clearly discriminated by PCA. 3aham 3acured meats 3ameat cuts 3acooking 3acooked foods 3afood storage 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3ameat quality 3ahardness 3ashear strength 3acooking quality 3awater content 3asensory evaluation 3acolor 3atexture 3acohesion 3ashelf life 3aprincipal component analysis 0awet air cooking method 0adry air cooking method 0awater cooking method 0acooking loss1 aSun, D.W.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2004 Dec., v. 65, no. 4 p.551-556x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20041203b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/12/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02021naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245010100130300001400231520088600245650003001131650001901161650001901180650002001199650002501219650002201244650002501266650002501291650002101316650001601337650000901353651001501362653002201377653003001399700001801429700001601447773010501463852000901568939003301577946001301610655001201623IND9204529020221119203138.0920718e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920452902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLichtenberg, E.10aRegulating environmental health risks under uncertainty: groundwater contamination in California  ap. 22-34.  aOur method for incorporating uncertainty into environmental health risk policy determination corresponds closely to the legal and political strictures governing these policies. An application to a case of groundwater contamination demonstrates that (1) the desirability of developing new water supplies versus cleaning up existing ones varies across locations; (2) the stringency of any given policy varies inversely with the margin of safety required; (3) the cost premiums imposed by greater aversion to uncertainty may be quite large; and (4) the marginal cost of risk reduction decreases significantly as aversion to uncertainty grows, implying that assessments of policies based on average risk will tend to overestimate allowable risk. Comparing an efficient program to the current inefficient approach to risk management indicates that the cost of inefficiency is not great. 3agroundwater contamination 3adrinking water 3ahealth hazards 3adecision making 3aprobabilistic models 3acosts and returns 3aenvironmental policy 3alaws and regulations 3aDBCP (pesticide) 3auncertainty 3arisk 3aCalifornia 0amarginal analysis 0afresno county, california1 aZilberman, D.1 aBogen, K.T.0 tJournal of environmental economics and management.g1989 July, v. 17, no. 1 p.22-34x0095-06967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01387naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009400125300001400219520065700233650002100890650001500911650001700926650001400943650001200957700002200969773006500991852000901056939003301065946001101098655001201109IND9204528620221119203136.0920718s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920452862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoli, D.M.10aInvestigation of the conjugase treatment procedure in the microbiological assay of folate  ap. 57-64.  aMicrobiological assays have been conducted to determine the growth responses of Lactobacillus casei to pteroyl di-, tri-, tetra-, hexa- and hepta- glutamates relative to the monoglutamate (folic acid).

Target sites in D. melanogaster populations are occupied at low frequencies, suggesting that there is some form of selection acting against transposable elements. Three main theories have been proposed to explain how selection acts against transposable elements: insertions of a copy of a transposable element are selected against; chromosomal rearrangements caused by ectopic exchange between element copies are selected against; or the process of transposition itself is selected against. The three theories give different predictions for the pattern of transposable element insertions in the chromosomes of D. melanogaster. We analysed the abundance of six LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons on the X and fourth chromosomes of multiple strains of D. melanogaster, which we compare with the predictions of each theory. The data suggest that no one theory can account for the insertion patterns of all six retrotransposons. Comparing our results with earlier work using these transposable element families, we find a significant correlation between studies in the particular model of copy number regulation supported by the proportion of elements on the X for the different transposable element families. This suggests that different retrotransposon families are regulated by different mechanisms. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3achromosome aberrations 3achromosomes 3agenome 3amodels 3aprediction 3aretrotransposons 3aterminal repeat sequences 3atransposons 2aAnimals 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aGene Dosage 2aGenome 2aRetroelements 2aSelection, Genetic 2aTerminal Repeat Sequences 2aX Chromosome1 aSoloway, J.R.1 aRobinson, T.E.1 aBrookfield, J.F.Y.0 tChromosoma.g2002 Feb., v. 110, no. 8 p.511-518x0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-001-0174-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02768naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245013800192300001800330520107500348650001101423650001201434650001101446650001401457650001401471650002401485650001201509650001701521650002501538650001401563650004601577650001501623650001401638650002301652650002401675650003501699650002101734651001401755653002401769653002001793653002301813653002301836653003101859653001801890653001901908653002701927773011501954852000902069856009202078930003302170946001102203655001202214IND4395844420221119203047.0071007e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439584442DNAL7 a176920982pmid7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01098.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, J. Wilson10aSpatially correlated recruitment of a marine predator and its prey shapes the large-scale pattern of density-dependent prey mortality  ap. 1054-1065.  aPatterns of predator dispersal can be critical to the dynamics of prey metapopulations. In marine systems, oceanic currents may shape the dispersal of planktonic larvae of both predators and prey, producing spatial correlations in the recruitment of both species and distinctive geographic patterns of prey mortality. I examined the potential for this phenomenon in two fishes, a wrasse and its grouper predator, at a Caribbean island where the near-shore oceanographic regime produces a temporally consistent spatial pattern of fish recruitment. I found that recruitment and adult abundance of groupers were spatially correlated with recruitment of wrasse prey. Furthermore, the local abundance of predators strongly affected the nature of density-dependent prey mortality. At sites with few predators, wrasse mortality was inversely density-dependent, while mortality was positively density-dependent at sites with higher predator densities. This phenomenon could be important to the dynamics of any metacommunity in which physical forces produce correlated dispersal. 3aadults 3agrouper 3alarvae 3amortality 3apredators 3aspecies recruitment 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aCompetitive Behavior 2aEcosystem 2aFishesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aFood Chain 2aMortality 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aPredatory Behaviorxphysiology 2aSpatial Behavior 3aCaribbean 0aCephalopholis fulva 0acoral reef fish 0adensity dependence 0ahabitat complexity 0ainverse density dependence 0ametacommunity 0ametapopulation 0aThalassoma bifasciatum0 tEcology letters.g2007 Nov., v. 10, no. 11 p.1054-1065dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01098.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071007b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03096naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245007900181300001600260520166800276650002001944650001701964650001401981650001301995650002202008650002602030650000702056650002002063650000902083650001102092650003802103650002802141650002002169650003002189650004102219651001002260653002002270653001602290653001702306700001902323773013402342852000902476856008502485930003302570946001102603655001202614IND4436741520221119202933.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443674152DNAL7 a194665732pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-0951-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hui-Hu 10aStudy on the law of heavy metal leaching in municipal solid waste landfill  ap. 349-363.  aComparative leaching experiments were carried out using leaching medium with different pH to municipal solid waste in the landfill columns in order to investigate the mobility of heavy metals. The leachate pH and oxidation-reduction potential were measured by oxidation-reduction potential analyzer; the contents of heavy metals were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. It is very different in leaching concentrations of heavy metals; the dynamic leaching of heavy metals decreased with the rise of the leaching amount on the whole. Acid leaching medium had definite influence on the leaching of heavy metals in the early landfill, but it had the obvious inhibition effect on the leaching in the middle and late period of landfill; the neutral and alkaline leaching medium are more beneficial to the leaching of heavy metals. Due to the influence of the environment of landfill, the differences of the results in cumulative leaching amount, leaching rate, and leaching intensity of heavy metals are very big. The calculation results of the release rates of heavy metals prove that the orders of the release rates are not identical under different leaching conditions. Acid rain made heavy metals migrate from municipal solid waste to soil and detain in soil more easily; approached neutral and alkaline leaching mediums are more beneficial to leaching of heavy metals in the municipal solid waste and soil with leachate. The field verification of experimental data showed that the law of heavy metal leaching in municipal solid waste revealed by the experiment has a good consistency with the data obtained by municipal solid waste landfill. 3aacid deposition 3aheavy metals 3alandfills 3aleaching 3amass spectrometry 3amunicipal solid waste 3apH 3aredox potential 3asoil 2aCities 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aRefuse Disposal 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 0aChina 0aLeaching medium 0aHeavy metal 0aRelease rate1 aSang, Shu-Xun 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 June, v. 165, no. 1-4 p.349-363dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0951-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02438naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003000145245009600175300001600271520115000287650001501437650000901452650002101461650001701482650001301499650001201512650001601524653001501540653002501555653003701580653001901617700004101636700003201677700002801709700003301737773012001770852000901890856008501899930003301984946001102017655001202028IND4414213120221119203234.0081226e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441421312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-007-9258-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArvizu-Higuera, Dora Luz 10aEffect of alkali treatment time and extraction time on agar from Gracilaria vermiculophylla  ap. 515-519.  aThe effects of alkali treatment time and extraction time of native agar and alkali treated agar obtained from Gracilaria vermiculophylla were studied. The response characteristics were mainly agar yield and gel strength. Alkali treatment was carried out at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 h. Agar yield and gel strength decreased with the increase in the time of the alkali treatment. The highest yield (15.3%) and highest gel strength (1,064 g cm⁻²) were obtained at 0.5 h, and therefore this time was used for the next experiment. The extraction of both native and alkali treated agars was carried out at 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 h. The best extraction time for alkali treated agar was 1.5 h, and for native agar 2.5 h. The alkali treated agar obtained with the different alkali treatment and extraction times showed higher melting (92.4-99.7°C) and gelling (35.7-39.6°C) temperatures. Native agar was lower in melting (60.2-64.1°C) and gelling (20.4-23.4°C) temperatures. The 3,6-anhydrogalactose content decreased with increasing alkali treatment time, with the opposite effect during the extraction of native and alkali treated agars. 3aGracilaria 3aagar 3aalkali treatment 3agel strength 3agelation 3amelting 3atemperature 0aAgar yield 0a3,6-anhydrogalactose 0aMelting and gelling temperatures 0aPolysaccharide1 aRodríguez-Montesinos, Y.

This review provides an assessment of biological control agents (BCA's) currently used with vegetable crop species, and key limitations to expanded use of BCA's as seed treatments. Research areas for improved biological efficacy and reliability in field and greenhouse settings are also discussed. The ability of BCA's to effectively colonize and grow with the seedling root system may be particularly useful when crops experience environmental stress. Improved application methods to optimize the density and uniformity of biologicals on seeds are increasing the reliability of BCA technology. Early results also suggest variable levels of BCA compatibility with chemical seed treatments and other microbial applications. Progress in storability, ease of application and economy of BCA production will be needed to move biologicals beyond their niche position in the seed treatment market. 3afungal antagonists 3ahorticultural crops 3aroot systems 3aseedlings 3aapplication methods 3aplant pathogens 3aseed dressings 3aseed quality 3abiological control 3avegetables 3abacteria 3afungi 0acolonization 0acompatibility 0abiological control agents 0aliterature reviews 0aefficacy 0astress 0agrowth0 tSeed technology.g1998, v. 20, no. 2 p.198-208x1096-07247nnas  aDNAL  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02733naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092024002200129024001900151040001800170072000900188072000900197100002300206245009600229300001600325500002400341500001500365506007600380520090500456506003701361650001501398650001901413650001601432650001101448650001801459650001001477650001301487650001901500650001701519650002301536650002001559650001201579650001701591650002001608650003401628651001801662653000901680653001801689653001501707700002301722700002201745700002201767700001601789700002301805700002001828773008201848852000901930856008701939930003302026945002502059946001102084655001202095IND4413372820221207090254.0081205e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441337282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.08.0082doi7 aPMC25999462pmcid7 a188013972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT0001 aJeffery, Robert W.10aReported food choices in older women in relation to body mass index and depressive symptoms  ap. 238-240.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper examines the relationships among reports of depressive symptoms, BMI and frequency of consumption of 30 foods in 4655 middle-aged women. Food was grouped into three categories: high-calorie sweet, high-calorie nonsweet, and low-calorie. Controlling for total energy intake, BMI and depressive symptoms were both inversely associated with a higher frequency of consumption of low-calorie foods. BMI was positively associated with consumption of high-calorie nonsweet foods and negatively related to consumption of high-calorie sweet foods. Depressive symptoms were positively associated with sweet foods consumption and negatively associated with nonsweet foods consumption. These findings suggest that the positive association between BMI and depression in women may be mediated by sweets consumption. This is consistent with the hypothesis that eating sweet foods reduces negative affect.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amotivation 3ahuman diseases 3afood intake 3asweets 3aenergy intake 3awomen 3aemotions 3aenergy density 3arisk factors 3amiddle-aged adults 3arisk assessment 3aobesity 3afood choices 3abody mass index 3afood frequency questionnaires 3aUnited States 0adiet 0aeating habits 0adepression1 aLinde, Jennifer A.1 aSimon, Gregory E.1 aLudman, Evette J.1 aRohde, Paul1 aIchikawa, Laura E.1 aFinch, Emily A.0 tAppetite.g2009 Feb., v. 52, no. 1 p.238-240dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2008.08.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090218b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/01/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02560naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245015600147300001600303520111300319650001401432650003101446650001801477650006001495650005101555650002101606650002801627650003901655650004601694650003201740650002301772653003001795700001301825700001601838700001401854700001401868700001901882700001701901700001701918773010101935852000902036930003302045945001302078946001102091655001202102IND2333738020221119203259.0030724e20021115ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233373802DNAL7 a124237762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSprague, L.D.12aA possible pitfall in the identification of Burkholderia mallei using molecular identification systems based on the sequence of the flagellin fliC gene  ap. 231-236.  aAmotile Burkholderia mallei and motile Burkholderia pseudomallei display a high similarity with regard to phenotype and clinical syndromes, glanders and melioidosis. The aim of this study was to establish a fast and reliable molecular method for identification and differentiation. Despite amotility, the gene of the filament forming flagellin (fliC) could be completely sequenced in two B. mallei strains. Only one mutation was identified discriminating between B. mallei and B. pseudomallei. A polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was designed making use of the absence of an AvaII recognition site in B. mallei. All seven B. mallei, 12 out of 15 B. pseudomallei and 36 closely related apathogenic Burkholderia thailandensis strains were identified correctly. However, in three B. pseudomallei strains a point mutation at gene position 798 (G to C) disrupted the AvaII site. Therefore, molecular systems based on the fliC sequence can be used for a reliable proof of strains of the three species but not for the differentiation of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei isolates. 3apathogens 3aBurkholderia thailandensis 2aBase Sequence 2aBurkholderiaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aFlagellinxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSequence Alignment 0aburkholderia pseudonellei1 aZysk, G.1 aHagen, R.M.1 aMeyer, H.1 aEllis, J.1 aAnuntagool, N.1 aGauthier, Y.1 aNeubauer, H.0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2002 Nov. 15, v. 34, no. 3 p.231-236x0928-82447nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01849naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014300127300001600270520091100286650001901197650001401216650002701230650002601257650001701283650001601300650002001316650002301336653003101359700001701390773006301407852000901470939003301479946001101512655001201523IND9204525120221119203113.0920718s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920452512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTimmer, V.R.10aEffects of contrasting fertilization and moisture regimes on biomass, nutrients, and water relations of container grown red pine seedlings  ap. 335-348.  aRed pine seedlings were grown for 16 weeks under contrasting fertilization (conventional, exponential) and moisture (wet, moist, dry) regimes to assess preconditioning effects of treatments on biomass production, nutrient uptake and allocation, and water relations. Growth, nutrient status, and water relations were affected more by moisture availability than by fertilization regime. Exponential fertilization under limited irrigation lowered shoot/root mass ratio, increased root nutrient reserves, and enhanced drought avoidance compared to conventional fertilization regimes. Drought treatments decreased nutrient uptake in the shoots of both fertilization regimes by 24%, but increased nutrient accumulation in the roots by 39% in the exponential regime compared to 17% in the conventional.

In this report we have determined critical structural features of the ABA molecule, particularly the methyl and ketone groups of the ABA ring, required for inhibitory activity. To examine the ring residues a series of new optically active ABA analogs have been synthesized in which the 4'-keto, 7'-, 8'-, or 8'- and 9'-carbons have been replaced with hydrogen atoms. Each of the analogs was tested over a range of concentrations as a germination inhibitor. Enantiomers of the analogs altered at the 4'-keto or 8'- and 9'-methyl groups were active, but less so than ABA. Both enantiomers of 7'-demethyl ABA were inactive as germination inhibitors. The results show that the 7'-methyl group is absolutely required for activity, but that the other residues are less critical for hormone recognition. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aembryo (plant) 3agermination 3aabscisic acid 3amolecular conformation 3achemical reactions 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 0agermination inhibitors 0aregulation1 aRose, P.A.1 aShaw, A.C.1 aAbrams, S.R.0 tPlant physiology.g1994 Dec., v. 106, no. 4 p.1279-1284aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03188naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002600171245010400197300001600301500001500317520135800332650002701690650001401717650004301731650001201774650004601786650004501832650004501877650002801922650001101950650001801961650003001979650000902009650002402018650004802042650005002090650002502140650002202165650004302187653003402230653001102264653002702275700001902302700002302321700002002344773013702364852000902501856009202510930003302602946001102635655001202646IND4395837520221119203242.0071007e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439583752DNAL7 a178777332pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-695X.2007.00323.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatil, Veerupaxagouda10aPeptidase N encoded by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium modulates systemic infection in mice  ap. 431-442.  a2019-12-05  aThe cytosolic protein degradation pathway, involving ATP-dependent proteases and ATP-independent peptidases, is important for modulating several cellular responses. The involvement of pathogen-encoded ATP-dependent proteases is well established during infection. However, the roles of ATP-independent peptidases in this process are not well studied. The functional role of Peptidase N (PepN), an ATP-independent enzyme belonging to the M1 family, during systemic infection of mice by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella typhimurium) was investigated. In a systemic model of infection, the number of CFU of S. typhimurium containing a targeted deletion in peptidase N (ΔpepN), compared with wild type, was significantly higher in the lymph node and spleen. In addition, S. typhimurium replicated in the thymus and greatly reduced the number of immature CD4⁺CD8⁺ thymocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Strains lacking or overexpressing pepN were used to show that the reduction in the number of thymocytes, but not lymph node cells, depends on a critical number of CFU. These findings establish a role for PepN in reducing the in vivo CFU of S. typhimurium during systemic infection. The implications of these results, in the context of the roles of proteases and peptidases, during host-pathogen interactions are discussed. 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3ainfection 2aAminopeptidasesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesxmicrobiology 2aCD8-Positive T-Lymphocytesxmicrobiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aFemale 2aGene Deletion 2aLymph Nodesxmicrobiology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalxmicrobiology 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSpleenxmicrobiology 2aSurvival Analysis 2aThymus Glandxmicrobiologyxpathology. 0acytosolic protein degradation 0aenzyme 0aSalmonella typhimurium1 aKumar, Anujith1 aKuruppath, Sanjana1 aNandi, Dipankar0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2007 Nov., v. 51, no. 2 p.431-442dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0928-82447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-695X.2007.00323.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071007b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03222naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245010800163300001800271520115300289650001301442650001501455650002201470650001101492650001401503650002401517650002701541650002501568650001501593650002001608650002401628650002201652650004101674650001501715650004001730650002501770650001201795650002801807650002101835650003201856650001701888650001901905650002201924650003001946650002401976650008002000650003402080650002402114650003402138650002902172650002502201653002802226700001802254700001702272700001202289700001502301700001302316700001502329773011202344852000902456930003302465945001302498946001302511655001202524IND2045433020221119203158.0950406e199412  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204543302DNAL7 a78461612pmid7 aPMC1596902pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarra, M.14aThe 30-kilodalton protein present in purified fusicoccin receptor preparations is a 14-3-3-like protein  ap. 1497-1501.  aWe have recently reported on the purification of the fusicoccin (FC) receptor from corn (Zea mays L.) and its identification by photoaffinity labeling (P. Aducci, A. Ballio, V. Fogliano, M.R. Fullone, M. Marra, N. Proietti [1993] Eur J Biochem 214: 339-345). Pure preparations of FC receptors, obtained under nondenaturing conditions, showed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis two doublets of proteins with apparent molecular masses of 30 and 90 kD. In the present paper we describe the isolation and identification of the primary structure of the 30-kD doublet proteins. Sequencing studies of peptides resulting from the digestion of the 30-kD protein showed a full identity with a 14-3-3-like protein from corn, named GF14. The 14-3-3 family is a class of proteins that is widely distributed in eukaryotes and is known to play various regulatory roles. The 30-kD protein has been immunologically identified by specific antibodies prepared against a synthetic peptide based on the determined amino acid sequence. A similar protein is recognized in partially purified FC receptor preparations from bean and spinach leaves. 3aZea mays 3aVicia faba 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aleaves 3aseedlings 3aprotein composition 3amolecular conformation 3aamino acid sequences 3afusicoccin 2a14-3-3 Proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBlotting, Western 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDNA Probes 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFabaceaexmetabolism 2aHordeum 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aPhospholipases Axchemistry 2aPlant Leaves 2aPlant Proteins 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProteinsxchemistry 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexbiosynthesisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpinacia oleraceaxmetabolism 2aTyrosine 3-Monooxygenase 2aZea maysxmetabolism 0amolecular sequence data1 aFullone, M.R.1 aFogliano, V.1 aPen, J.1 aMattei, M.1 aMasi, S.1 aAducci, P.0 tPlant physiology.g1994 Dec., v. 106, no. 4 p.1497-1501aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02430naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245020300127300001400330500001500344520114500359650001901504650002001523650002401543650002701567650002201594650002401616653003101640653001601671653002301687700001701710700002001727700001901747700002501766700001901791700001501810700001701825773010001842852000901942930003301951945001301984946001101997655001202008IND2332526420221119203205.0030513e20030515ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233252642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMieszala, M.14aThe identity of the O-specific polysaccharide structure of Citrobacter strains from serogroups O2, O20 and O25 and immunochemical characterisation of C. youngae PCM 1507 (O2a,1b) and related strains  ap. 71-76.  a2019-12-05  aSerological studies using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting revealed that from five strains that are ascribed to Citrobacter serogroup O2, four strains, PCM 1494, PCM 1495, PCM 1496 and PCM 1507, are reactive with specific anti-Citrobacter O2 serum.

Methods and Results: Three diets, varying in maize silage to grass silage ratio and FPS, were incubated in a rumen simulation system. Microbial samples were taken from the liquid fermenter effluents. Microbial community analysis was performed by 16S rRNA‐based techniques. Clostridia‐specific single‐strand conformation polymorphism profiles revealed changes of the community structure in dependence on both factors tested. The coarse grass silage-containing diets seemed to enhance the occurrence of different Roseburia species. As detected by real‐time quantitative PCR, Ruminococcus albus showed a higher abundance with decreasing FPS. A slightly lower proportion of Bacilli was found with increasing grass silage to maize silage ratio by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In contrast, a slightly higher proportion of bacterial species belonging to the Clostridium‐clusters XIV a and b was detected by FISH with increasing grass silage contents in the diet. Conclusions: The ruminal Firmicutes community is affected by the choice of the forage source and FPS. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study supplies fundamental knowledge about the response of ruminal microbial communities to changing diets. Moreover, the data suggest a standardization of grinding of feeds for in vitro studies to facilitate the comparison of results of different laboratories. 3aRoseburia 3aRuminococcus albus 3acommunity structure 3acorn silage 3adiet 3aeffluents 3afermenters 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3aforage 3agrass silage 3agrasses 3agrinding 3ain vitro studies 3amicrobial communities 3aparticle size 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arumen 3aruminants 3asingle-stranded conformational polymorphism1 aBoguhn, J.1 aKleinsteuber, S.1 aFetzer, I.1 aRodehutscord, M.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2010 Dec., v. 109, no. 6 p.1998-2010dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2010.04829.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01582naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245008200133300001400215500001500229520077000244650002001014650002401034650002601058650001701084650001601101653001401117773008801131852000901219939003301228945000801261946001101269655001201280991571900020742620221119203103.0840213s1982    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840041312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParnham, May.14aThe 1980 Education Act and its effect on nutrition in school meals in the U.K  ap. 53-55.  a2019-12-04  aTo balance expenditures against income certain recommendations were made to eliminate components of school meals (1980-81) in the U.K. (principally Devon).

To increase income a cash-cafeteria system which attempted to recover 100% of food costs and 90% of labor costs was introduced during the summer term.

No reactivation of both LOX and POD enzyme was observed during storage. The losses of ascorbic acid and chlorophylls during storage followed first order kinetics. Half-life of ascorbic acid in unblanched green beans was determined to be 1.89 months. It increased to 2.15 and 3.48 months by blanching at 70 °C for 2 min (for >90% LOX inactivation) and 90 °C for 3 min (for >90% POD inactivation), respectively. Half-lifes of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and chlorophyll b (Chl b) were determined to be 7.32 and 13.11 months in unblanched green beans. Blanching green beans at 70 °C for 2 min decreased the half-lifes of Chl a and Chl b to 5.05 and 10.09 months while blanching at 90 °C for 3 min increased to 8.26 and 16.70 months, respectively. The results clearly showed that a blanching treatment to inactivate POD retains the quality attributes of green bean better during frozen storage. 3afrozen storage 3afood nutrient losses 3aprocess monitoring 3afreezing quality 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3afood storage 3astorage time 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3agreen beans 3ablanching 3aenzyme activity 3achlorophyll 3aperoxidase 3aascorbic acid 0aprocess control 0alipoxygenase1 aSerpen, A.1 aGokmen, V.1 aAcar, J.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2005 Jan., v. 66, no. 2 p.187-192x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20041209b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/12/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02601naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245012700188300001400315520123500329650002001564650004301584650003001627650004701657650002001704650002901724650004601753653002001799653002801819700001701847700001901864700001701883700002301900773013501923852000902058856009202067930003302159946001102192655001202203IND4399955820221119203107.0080113e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439995582DNAL7 a180700762pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-695X.2007.00346.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhie, Gi-Eun10aConstruction of cholera toxin B subunit-producing Vibrio cholerae strains using the Mariner-FRT transposon delivery system  ap. 23-28.  aThe most widely used oral whole-cell-recombinant B subunit cholera vaccine contains the nontoxic cholera toxin B subunit (CTXB) and either heat- or formalin-killed Vibrio cholerae O1 strains. Vibrio cholerae O1 strains in the vaccine provide antibacterial immunity, and CTXB contributes to the vaccine's efficacy by stimulating production of anti-CTXB antibody. Various attempts have been made to increase CTXB production. In this study, the mariner-FRT transposon delivery system developed by Chiang and Mekalanos was used to place the ctxB gene under the control of a strong chromosomal promoter in a nontoxigenic V. cholerae El Tor strain, M7922. The expression level of CTXB in transposon insertion mutant clones was screened by ganglioside-dependent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Among CTXB-producing V. cholerae clones that were isolated, M7922-C1 produced the highest amount of CTXB (3.17±1.69 μg mL⁻¹). M7922-C1 harbors a single insertion of ctxB into VC0972, which encodes a putative porin protein. Although the level of CTXB expression in this strain was not exceptionally high, this study indicates the possibility of using this delivery system to construct vaccine strains that overexpress specific antigens. 3aVibrio cholerae 2aCholera Toxinxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aGenetic Vectors 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aVibrio cholerae O1xgeneticsxmetabolism. 0acholera vaccine 0acholera toxin B subunit1 aJung, Hae-Mi1 aPark, Jungchan1 aKim, Bong-Su1 aMekalanos, John J.0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2008 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.23-28dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0928-82447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-695X.2007.00346.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02761naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001200128245009700140300001600237520130600253650002701559650001301586650001601599650001001615650002501625650002501650650002401675650001201699650001801711650002301729650006401752650005101816650000801867650003301875650004401908650002801952650003101980650003002011650002302041653002802064653001902092700001902111773009602130852000902226939003302235946001102268655001202279IND9204524220221119203023.0920718e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920452422DNAL7 a15740822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRay, C.10aGut-specific and developmental expression of a Caenorhabditis elegans cysteine protease gene  ap. 239-250.  aA Caenorhabditis elegans cysteine protease gene fragment, amplified by PCR using conserved eukaryotic protease gene sequences as primers, was used as a probe to isolate cDNA and genomic clones. The genomic clone, which had a coding sequence of 987 bp interrupted by 2 small introns, was physically mapped to the middle of linkage group V. The predicted amino acid sequence of the mature C. elegans cysteine protease was homologous to those of other eukaryotic cysteine proteases, particularly to that of the nematode parasite Haemonchus contortus (50%) and to the cathepsin B-like hemoglobinase of the trematode parasite Schistosoma mansoni (54%). The pro region of the C. elegans protease was homologous only to that of the H. contortus enzyme, implying a similar mechanism of protease activation. The C. elegans cysteine protease gene was temporally regulated: abundant 1.1-kb transcripts were detected in larvae and adults, but not in embryos. Transcription also was spatially regulated, occurring only in the intestine. Like the vitellogenin genes, which also are transcribed exclusively in the intestine, the 5' end of the C. elegans cysteine protease gene had at least one copy of each of 2 heptameric sequences which may be transcriptional regulatory elements governing gut-specific expression. 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3acysteine 3aproteinases 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCaenorhabditisxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA 2aDigestive Systemxenzymology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Alignment 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/m747971 aMcKerrow, J.H.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g1992 Apr., v. 51, no. 2 p.239-250x0166-68517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02946naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166100002100175245011500196300001600311500002400327500001500351520103800366650001501404650002801419650001501447650002701462650001001489650002401499650001201523650001701535650001901552650001801571650001701589650001501606650002001621650001601641650001201657650001601669650001001685650001501695650002001710650003101730650001401761650000901775650001101784650001101795650004701806650002501853650001601878653001601894653001801910653002501928653001501953653002801968700001701996773008202013852000902095856008702104930003302191945002502224946001102249655001202260IND4413372320221119203204.0081205e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441337232DNAL7 a189402132pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aDalley, Simon E.10a“Thinspiration” vs. “fear of fat”. Using prototypes to predict frequent weight-loss dieting in females  ap. 217-221.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study examined whether frequent weight-loss dieting in females is predominantly a manifestation of being inspired to approach the cultural aesthetic thinness standard, or predominantly of a fear to avoid becoming over-fat. Female volunteers completed questionnaires concerning their perceptions of the prototypical over-fat and thin female, their dieting status and demographic data. Logistic regression analysis indicated that with increasing perceived similarity to the over-fat prototype, the more unfavourable this prototype was perceived to be, the greater the likelihood of engaging in frequent weight-loss dieting. However, similarity to, and the favourability of, the thin prototype did not predict frequent weight-loss dieting. These results suggest that frequent weight-loss dieting is primarily motivated by a desire to avoid an unfavourable over-fat identity, rather than by a desire to acquire the favourable thin identity. The potential consequences for future research and therapeutic interventions are discussed. 3abody image 3aweight control programs 3amotivation 3aattitudes and opinions 3awomen 3adietary restriction 3adieting 3ayoung adults 3ahuman behavior 3aself-efficacy 3afood choices 3aprototypes 3abody mass index 3afood intake 3asurveys 3afearfulness 2aAdult 2aBody Image 2aBody Mass Index 2aDiet, Reducingxpsychology 2aEsthetics 2aFear 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aObesityxprevention & controlxpsychology. 2aThinnessxpsychology 2aWeight Loss 0aself-esteem 0aeating habits 0apsychosocial factors 0apsychology 0aperceptions (cognitive)1 aBuunk, Bram.0 tAppetite.g2009 Feb., v. 52, no. 1 p.217-221dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2008.09.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20090218b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/01/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03416naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100002000193245008500213300001400298500002400312500001500336520133200351650002801683650001701711650002001728650001101748650001801759650001801777650001701795650001401812650001001826650001201836650003401848650001401882650002001896650001101916650001001927650000901937650002001946650000901966650001801975650001101993650000902004650002202013650001102035650000902046650001602055650002602071650001502097650003202112650001702144651001102161651002602172653001602198653002102214700002102235700001702256700002702273700001902300700002202319700001602341700002002357773008002377852000902457856008702466930003302553945002502586946001102611655001202622IND4413372220221119203319.0081205e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441337222DNAL7 a186947912pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT300 0aU6001 aBerg, Christina10aEating patterns and portion size associated with obesity in a Swedish population  ap. 21-26.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to describe the association between meal pattern and obesity. The study is based on data from the INTERGENE research programme, and the study population consists of randomly selected women and men, aged 25-74, living in the Västra Götaland Region in Sweden. A total of 3610 were examined. Participants with measured BMI>=30 were compared with others (BMI<30) with respect to questionnaire data on habitual meal patterns and intake of energy estimated from food frequencies and standard portions. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals were adjusted for age, sex, smoking and physical activity in logistic regression models. Being obese was significantly associated with omitting breakfast, OR 1.41 (1.05-1.90), omitting lunch OR 1.31 (1.04-1.66) and eating at night OR 1.62 (1.10-2.39). Obesity was also related to significantly larger self-reported portion sizes of main meals. No statistically significant relationship with intake of total energy was revealed. Thus, the results indicate that examination of meal patterns and portion sizes might tell us more about obesogenic food patterns than traditional nutrient analyses of food frequencies. Being obese was associated with a meal pattern shifted to later in the day and significantly larger self-reported portions of main meals. 3aepidemiological studies 3aportion size 3abody mass index 3adinner 3aeating habits 3aenergy intake 3arisk factors 3afrequency 3alunch 3aobesity 3afood frequency questionnaires 3abreakfast 3adietary surveys 3aadults 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBody Mass Index 2aDiet 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFood 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxepidemiology 2aOdds Ratio 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aTime Factors 3aSweden 0aSwedenxepidemiology. 0afood intake 0afood preparation1 aLappas, Georgios1 aWolk, Alicja1 aStrandhagen, Elisabeth1 aTorén, Kjell.1 aRosengren, Annika1 aThelle, Dag1 aLissner, Lauren0 tAppetite.g2009 Feb., v. 52, no. 1 p.21-26dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2008.07.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090218b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/01/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02639naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245012500194300001400319520114900333650002901482650001301511650004601524650002401570650006301594650002801657650004601685650005401731650008801785653001901873653000901892700002201901700002401923700001801947773013501965852000902100856007602109930003302185946001102218655001202229IND4387249220221119203305.0070128e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438724922DNAL7 a172667152pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-695X.2006.00202.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllaker, Robert P.10aInteraction of adrenomedullin and calcitonin gene-related peptide with the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis  ap. 91-97.  aThe nature of the interaction between Porphyromonas gingivalis and the multifunctional peptides adrenomedullin and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was investigated. Growth of P. gingivalis was not inhibited in the presence of either of these peptides [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)>250 μg mL⁻¹]. The ability of the arginine- and lysine-specific proteases from P. gingivalis to breakdown these peptides was investigated. Adrenomedullin and CGRP were incubated with culture supernatants from wild-type and protease gene knockout strains. No significant effect on antimicrobial activity against the indicator organism Escherichia coli BUE55 was found (MIC=6.25 μg mL⁻¹ in all cases). The role of anionic components on the surface of P. gingivalis, which may alter binding of these cationic peptides, was also investigated in relation to adrenomedullin. Growth of gene knockout strains lacking surface polysaccharide and capsule components was not inhibited (MIC>250 μg mL⁻¹). It is suggested that a lack of sensitivity to adrenomedullin and CGRP may enable P. gingivalis to persist in the oral cavity and cause disease. 3aPorphyromonas gingivalis 3aimmunity 2aAdrenomedullinxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCalcitonin Gene-Related Peptidexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolysaccharides, Bacterialxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPorphyromonas gingivalisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aadrenomedullin 0aCGRP1 aSheehan, Barry E.1 aMcAnerney, David C.1 aMcKay, Ian J.0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2007 Feb., v. 49, no. 1 p.91-97dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0928-82447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-695X.2006.00202.x3electronic resource  a20070128b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02323naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245008700189300001600276520095600292650002101248650001501269650001401284650001101298650001301309650003001322650001201352650002101364650001301385650002401398650003901422650002501461653002901486653001501515653001401530653001401544700001901558700001901577700001601596773011201612852000901724856007601733930003301809946001101842655001201853IND4388090520221119202944.0070221e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438809052DNAL7 a173058012pmid7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.01012.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoege, Karina10aOntogenetic switches from plant resistance to tolerance: minimizing costs with age  ap. 177-187.  aChanges in herbivory and resource availability during a plant's development should promote ontogenetic shifts in resistance and tolerance, if the costs and benefits of these basic strategies also change as plants develop. We proposed and tested a general model to detect the expression of ontogenetic tradeoffs for these two alternative anti-herbivory strategies in Raphanus sativus. We found that ontogenetic trajectories occur in both resistance and tolerance but in opposite directions. The juvenile stage was more resistant but less tolerant than the reproductive stage. The ontogenetic switch from resistance to tolerance was consistent with the greater vulnerability of young plants to leaf damage and with the costs of resistance and tolerance found at each stage. We posit that the ontogenetic perspective presented here will be helpful in resolving the current debate on the existence and detection of a general resistance-tolerance tradeoff. 3aRaphanus sativus 3aherbivores 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3aontogeny 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aFeeding Behavior 2aInsecta. 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & development 2aRaphanusxphysiology 0aontogenetic trajectories 0aresistance 0atolerance 0atradeoffs1 aDirzo, Rodolfo1 aSiemens, David1 aBrown, Paul0 tEcology letters.g2007 Mar., v. 10, no. 3 p.177-187dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.01012.x3electronic resource  a20070221b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02917naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245007600182300001600258500002400274520095600298650001401254650001401268650001001282650001001292650002201302650001301324650001101337650001401348650001001362650001201372650005201384650002101436650002001457650002201477650001301499650002801512650006701540650001401607650002501621650006101646650006701707650002701774650002201801650001001823650002901833651001101862651001101873700002501884700002901909700002701938700002401965700002101989700002402010700002402034700001902058773009602077852000902173856008502182655001202267IND4418712220221119202933.0090403s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441871222DNAL7 a192833382pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-009-0344-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aL'Homme, Yvan10aGenetic diversity of porcine Norovirus and Sapovirus: Canada, 2005-2007  ap. 581-593.  aIncludes references  aNoroviruses and sapoviruses are members of the family Caliciviridae and emerging enteric pathogens of humans and animals. Since their discovery and characterization in swine, relatively few strains have been described in detail. In order to investigate their genetic diversity, a total of 266 fecal samples collected in the province of Quebec, Canada, between 2005 and 2007 were screened for the presence of caliciviruses by RT-PCR using broadly reactive primers. Genetically heterogeneous caliciviruses were detected on the majority of farms. Typical noroviruses related to known swine genotypes were present on 20% of the farms. Sapoviruses were detected on 75% of the farms and were the most heterogeneous group. Further characterization of selected strains in their 3' end parts was carried out for their classification and unveiled possibly new clusters of sapoviruses. No human-like noroviruses or sapoviruses were detected in the present study. 3aNorovirus 3aSapovirus 3afarms 3afeces 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahumans 3apathogens 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aCaliciviridae Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 2aCluster Analysis 2aFecesxvirology 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNorovirusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSapovirusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxvirology 3aQuebec 0aQuebec1 aSansregret, Raphaël1 aPlante-Fortier, Étienne1 aLamontagne, Anne-Marie1 aLacroix, Geneviève1 aOuardani, Mourad1 aDeschamps, Jonathan1 aSimard, Geneviève.1 aSimard, Carole0 tArchives of virology.g2009 Apr., v. 154, no. 4 p.581-593dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-009-0344-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01843naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001700178245006600195300001400261500011000275500001500385520059000400650000900990650001900999650001301018650001401031650002701045650000901072650001401081650001701095650002101112653000901133653004001142700001701182700002101199773009901220852000901319930003301328945002501361946001101386655001201397IND4364519520221119203016.0040917e20040901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436451952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

As an extension of our work on the infectious aetiology of SIDS, we have explored the prediction that infectious agents might reach susceptible infants and babies, via particular sources of food. In this ecological study, we demonstrated significant correlations between SIDS rates and exposure to meat from some sources, and we propose that more detailed studies be carried out. 3apork 3ahuman diseases 3aetiology 3alamb meat 3agross domestic product 3abeef 3agoat meat 3apoultry meat 3afood consumption 0ameat 0asudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)1 aLuke, R.K.J.1 aBettelheim, K.A.0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2004 Sept. 1, v. 42, no. 1 p.66-75x0928-82447nnas  aDNAL  a20040922b20041003c00000000  aINDdGHKe2004/09/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02946naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245009000180300001400270520117200284650000801456650001501464650001701479650001501496650001401511650002401525650001401549650001801563650001601581650001901597650001001616650001201626650001201638650002801650650003701678650003801715650003601753650001101789650004601800650001901846650000901865650002501874650002001899650003001919650002901949700001501978700001901993700001302012700001602025700001802041700001802059700001302077773006702090852000902157856008502166930003302251945001302284946001102297655001202308IND2328984720221119202940.0020919e200203  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232898472DNAL7 a120689192pmid7 a10.1007/s00412-002-0188-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarhold, J.10aStage-specific chromosomal association of Drosophila dMBD2/3 during genome activation  ap. 13-21.  aThe Drosophila gene dMBD2/3 encodes a protein with significant homologies to the mammalian methyl-DNA binding proteins MBD2 and MBD3. These proteins are essential components of chromatin complexes involved in epigenetic gene regulation. Because the available in vitro data on dMBD2/3 are conflicting we have started an in vivo characterization of dMBD2/3. We detected expression of two isoforms specifically during embryonic development. Staining of whole embryos combined with high-resolution confocal microscopy revealed a highly regulated spatial distribution. During the syncytial blastoderm stage, dMBD2/3 formed speckles that localized to the cytoplasm. Shortly after, during the cellular blastoderm stage, the protein entered the nucleus and formed bright foci that associated with DNA. This rapid transition coincided with the activation of the embryonic genome. A similar observation was made during activation of the spermatocyte genome as dMBD2/3 formed distinct foci associated with the activated Y chromosome. Our results indicate that dMBD2/3 forms specialized nuclear compartments to keep certain genes epigenetically silenced during genome activation. 3aDNA 3aDrosophila 3aY chromosome 3ablastoderm 3achromatin 3aconfocal microscopy 3acytoplasm 3aembryogenesis 3aepigenetics 3agene silencing 3agenes 3amammals 2aAnimals 2aChromosomesxmetabolism 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aDrosophilaxembryologyxgenetics. 2aDrosophila Proteinsxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aImmunoblotting 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aProtein Binding 2aSpermatocytesxmetabolism 2aY Chromosomexmetabolism1 aZbylut, M.1 aLankenau, D.H.1 aLi, M.F.1 aGerlich, D.1 aBallestar, E.1 aMechler, B.M.1 aLyko, F.0 tChromosoma.g2002 Mar., v. 111, no. 1 p.13-21x0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-002-0188-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20021201b20021209c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02639naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245010600187300001600293520099700309650001601306650002901322650002501351650001201376650001101388650001401399650001901413650001001432650001901442650001801461650002701479650001201506650002601518650003801544650001901582650001301601650003601614650002001650651001001670653003501680653002401715653002101739700002101760700002201781700002201803773013401825852000901959856008501968930003302053946001102086655001202097IND4436742420221119202904.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443674242DNAL7 a194345052pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-0959-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitazawa, Daisuke 10aAssessment of environmental variations caused by a very large floating structure in a semi-closed bay  ap. 461-474.  aTo assess the environmental impacts of large floating structures, various physical, chemical, and biological parameters were measured. The current and water quality were monitored around a prototype floating structure called the Phase-II Mega-Float model (MF-II model), which was moored off Yokosuka in Tokyo Bay during the period 1999-2000. The effects of the MF-II model on the condition of the physical environment, e.g., the direction and flow rate of water currents and the stratification structure, were negligible. Analysis of water quality showed that the concentrations of chlorophyll a and nutrients only varied just below the MF-II model. However, such variations were localized to within 5 m below the MF-II model since the waters were exchanged because of the tidal current. The minor changes in water quality are attributable to the impedance of photosynthesis due to the sea-covering effect and the activities of sessile organisms fouling the bottom surface of the MF-II model. 3achlorophyll 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3afouling 3amodels 3anutrients 3aphotosynthesis 3atides 3awater currents 3awater quality 3awater quality analysis 2aAnimals 2aChlorophyllxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aPhotosynthesis 2aSunlight 2aThoracicaxgrowth & development 2aWater Movements 0aJapan 0aVery large floating structures 0aSea-covering effect 0aSessile organism1 aTabeta, Shigeru 1 aFujino, Masataka 1 aKatō, Takayoshi.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 June, v. 165, no. 1-4 p.461-474dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0959-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03827naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245011900178300001800297500002400315520221800339650002402557650002002581650001602601650001902617650002502636650001802661650001202679650001302691650001602704650003102720650001102751650002202762650002302784650002402807650001402831650001102845650001302856650001402869650001302883650001402896650001102910700001602921700001402937700002502951700001702976700001802993700001503011700002803026773011803054852000903172856009203181655001203273IND4445809720221119202923.0101126s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444580972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2010.04837.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeljak‐Levanić, D.10aBiochemical and epigenetic changes in phytoplasma‐recovered periwinkle after indole‐3‐butyric acid treatment  ap. 2069-2078.  aIncludes references  aAim: To elucidate the possible mechanism of phytoplasma elimination from periwinkle shoots caused by indole‐3‐butyric acid (IBA) treatment. Methods and Results: It has been shown that a transfer of in vitro‐grown phytoplasma‐infected Catharanthus roseus (periwinkle) plantlets from medium supplemented with 6‐benzylaminopurine (BA) to one supplemented with IBA can induce remission of symptoms and even permanent elimination of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris' reference strain HYDB. Endogenous auxin levels and general methylation levels in noninfected periwinkles, periwinkles infected with two ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma' species and phytoplasma‐recovered periwinkles were measured and compared. After the transfer from cytokinin‐ to auxin‐containing media, healthy shoots maintained their phenotype, methylation levels and hormone concentrations. Phytoplasma infection caused a change in the endogenous indole‐3‐acetic acid to IBA ratio in periwinkle shoots infected with two ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma' species, but general methylation was significantly changed only in shoots infected with ‘Ca. P. asteris', which resulted in the only phytoplasma species eliminated from shoots after transfer to IBA‐containing medium. Both phytoplasma infection and treatment with plant growth regulators influenced callose deposition in phloem tissue, concentrations of photosynthetic pigments and soluble proteins, H₂O₂ levels and activities of catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Conclusion: Lower level of host genome methylation in ‘Ca. P. asteris'‐infected periwinkles on medium supplemented with BA was significantly elevated after IBA treatment, while IBA treatment had no effect on cytosine methylation in periwinkles infected with ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma ulmi' strain EY‐C. Significance and Impact of the Study: Hormone‐dependent recovery is a distinct phenomenon from natural recovery. As opposed to spontaneously recovered plants in which elevated peroxide levels and differential expression of peroxide‐related enzymes were observed, in hormone‐dependent recovery changes in global host genome, methylation coincide with the presence/absence of phytoplasma. 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aDNA methylation 3aPhytoplasma 3aacid treatment 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abenzyladenine 3acallose 3acatalase 3aepigenetics 3agene expression regulation 3agenome 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindole acetic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3aphenotype 3aphloem 3apigments 3aplantlets 3aproteins 3aremission 3ashoots1 aJežić, M.1 aCesar, V.1 aLudwig‐Müller, J.1 aLepeduš, H.1 aMladinić, M.1 aKatić, M.1 aĆurković‐Perica, M.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2010 Dec., v. 109, no. 6 p.2069-2078dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2010.04837.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02111naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245008600158300001400244520093300258650001801191650001301209650001101222650001301233650002201246650001901268650002301287650001201310650002301322650001801345650001401363650002501377650001401402650001801416653003001434653002501464700001501489773008301504852000901587930003301596945002501629946001101654655001201665IND4364854120221119203221.0041007e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436485412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Groups of three sheets were immersed into an osmotic solution of a given concentration and temperature. Initial and final weight and moisture content were measured in each sheet. Each treatment condition was performed according to a 5 x 5 x 7 factorial design where the temperature, concentration and dehydration time were 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38 °C, 15%, 18%, 21%, 24% and 27% NaCl, and 20, 40, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min, respectively. Linear simple regression was used to fit database to Zugarramurdi and Lupn̕ model. The models as fitted explained the 97.88-99.93% of the water concentration variation kinetics, and the 97.12-99.85% of the salt concentration variation kinetics at 95% confidence level. 3awater content 3asardines 3adrying 3akinetics 3aosmotic treatment 3awater activity 3asorption isotherms 3asalting 3asalt concentration 3alinear models 3aequations 3achemical equilibrium 3amass flow 3amass transfer 0aequilibrium concentration 0aequilibrium constant1 aBracho, N.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2005 Jan., v. 66, no. 1 p.51-56x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20041209b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/12/08  aNon-US 7aarticle01768naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245009100162300001600253500009900269500001500368520063000383650002101013650001301034650001101047650001401058650002301072650001001095650002601105651000901131651001201140651001001152653002201162700001301184700001501197773010101212852000901313945002501322946001101347655001201358IND4361273320221119203223.0040211e20031128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436127332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The first full-length sequence of an African strain (Chad) is presented and compared to 31 complete HEV genomes available, including the fulminant hepatitis strain from India, swine strains and a strain from Morocco. The two African strains are more closely related to genotype 1 than to any other genotypes and together they possibly form a sub-genotype or sixth genotype. The first evidence for recombination between divergent HEV strains is presented. 3aOrthohepevirus A 3azoonoses 3ahumans 3aphylogeny 3astrain differences 3aswine 3agenetic recombination 3aChad 3aMorocco 3aIndia 0aHepatitis E virus1 aJuge, F.1 aRoques, P.0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2003 Nov. 28, v. 39, no. 2 p.133-139x0928-82447nnas  aDNAL  aINDdPNNe2004/02/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02967naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245008100179300001600260520129700276650001601573650002201589650001601611650001501627650002601642650002501668650001801693650003901711650001601750650002501766650001301791650001801804650001301822650002001835650004001855650001601895650001401911650002801925650002701953650002601980650003902006650002702045650002302072653002602095700001502121700001602136700001702152773006902169852000902238856008502247930003302332945001302365946001102378655001202389IND2328132420221119203031.0020720e200112  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232813242DNAL7 a118624522pmid7 a10.1007/s00412-001-0173-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHouben, A.14aThe genomic complexity of micro B chromosomes of Brachycome dichromosomatica  ap. 451-459.  aA major sequence component of the micro B chromosome of Brachycome dichromosomatica (2n=4) is the tandem repeat Bdm29, which was found by in situ hybridisation to be distributed along the entire length of the chromosome. A high copy number of this sequence does not occur as a regular feature of the A chromosomes in this species but it was found in infrequent individuals in two wild populations that were analysed. In these instances Bdm29 is localised within heterochromatic, polymorphic segments on the long arm of chromosome 1. The origin of the micro B chromosomes was investigated by determining whether they are related to this A chromosome polymorphism by simple excision and/or integration. Results obtained by using Bdm29, together with a newly isolated repeat sequence, Bdm54, and a number of other sequences known to occur on the micro B chromosome, as probes in in situ hybridisation and Southern analysis demonstrated that the formation of micro B chromosomes is a complex multistep process. The observation that the genomic organisation of the micro B chromosome is unlike anything found on the A chromosomes precludes their origin by simple excision and also indicates that micro Bs do not integrate directly into the A complement to form polymorphic heterochomatic segments. 3aBrachyscome 3aSouthern blotting 3achromosomes 3acomplement 3ain situ hybridization 2aAsteraceaexgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Nucleusxchemistryxgenetics. 2aChromosomes 2aDNA, Plantxanalysis 2aDiploidy 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenotype 2aHeterochromatin 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aKaryotyping 2aMetaphase 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Leavesxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTelomerexgenetics 0aaccessory chromosomes1 aVerlin, D.1 aLeach, C.R.1 aTimmis, J.N.0 tChromosoma.g2001 Dec., v. 110, no. 7 p.451-459x0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-001-0173-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02937naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245012400183300001400307520121400321650002201535650001201557650001501569650001801584650002101602650002601623650001201649650001501661650001501676650001301691650002201704650001201726650003401738650004101772650001101813650002601824650004401850650003301894650002201927650002201949650005001971650003102021650003902052650001202091653003702103700001302140773006702153852000902220856008502229930003302314945001302347946001102360655001202371IND2328984820221119203001.0020919e200203  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232898482DNAL7 a120689242pmid7 a10.1007/s00412-002-0186-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBilinski, S.M.10aAccessory nuclei revisited: the translocation of snRNPs from the germinal vesicle to the periphery of the future embryo  ap. 62-68.  aOocytes of certain insects contain peculiar organelles termed accessory nuclei (AN). These organelles originate by budding off from the envelope of the oocyte nucleus and contain 1-2 dense inclusions immersed in a translucent ground substance. We have demonstrated that in the wasp Vespula germanica each inclusion consists of two elements: a spherical body, and a hemispherical structure composed of numerous 20-30 nm particles. Immunoelectron microscopy and whole-mount in situ hybridization have shown that the inclusions contain AgNOR-staining proteins, p80-coilin, Sm proteins, and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). These results indicate that the inclusions and hemispherical structures are homologous to Cajal bodies and B-snurposomes of Xenopus germinal vesicles, respectively. During previtellogenesis, AN (together with their Cajal bodies) migrate to the cortical ooplasm of the oocyte where they reside at least until the onset of embryogenesis. We suggest that AN are vehicles for the transport and localization of snRNPs to the periphery of the oocyte, i.e., to the region where the blastoderm of the embryo develops and where there is a requirement for a high concentration of RNA-processing factors. 3aVespula germanica 3aXenopus 3ablastoderm 3aembryogenesis 3agerminal vesicle 3ain situ hybridization 3ainsects 3amicroscopy 3aorganelles 3aproteins 3asmall nuclear RNA 2aAnimals 2aCoiled Bodiesxultrastructure 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aOogenesisxphysiology 2aOrganellesxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aOvarian Folliclexmetabolism 2aOvaryxmetabolism 2aProtein Transport 2aRibonucleoproteins, Small Nuclearxmetabolism 2aVitellogenesisxphysiology 2aWaspsxembryologyxultrastructure. 2aXenopus 0asmall nuclear ribonucleoproteins1 aKloc, M.0 tChromosoma.g2002 Mar., v. 111, no. 1 p.62-68x0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-002-0186-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20021201b20021209c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02739naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245007400143300001600217500008600233520110100319650002701420650001601447650001401463650000901477650001901486650001901505650003501524650001201559650003301571650001101604650002601615650002901641650003901670650005501709650000901764650001901773650001301792650003201805650001401837650006701851650002201918700001701940700001701957700001501974700001401989700001602003773010002019852000902119930003302128945001302161946001102174655001202185IND2332359720221119203342.0030502e20030401ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233235972DNAL7 a126488342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbram, M.10aMurine model of pregnancy-associated Listeria monocytogenes infection  ap. 177-182.  aIn the thematic issue: The versatility of Listeria species / edited by E. Tumbay.  aListeria monocytogenes has been recognized as a significant pathogen, occurring worldwide, capable of causing animal and human infections. In its most severe form, listeriosis is an invasive disease that affects immunocompromised patients. Additionally, pregnant women represent a high-risk group for L. monocytogenes infection. Abortion, stillbirth or severe neonatal infection can be the serious outcome of such an infection. In an experimental murine model of pregnancy-associated listeriosis we studied the impact of L. monocytogenes on the maternal immune response and pregnancy outcome. In comparison to virgin animals, pregnant mice mounted lower levels of protective cytokines and were inable to eliminate the pathogen. The impaired maternal immune response that has been found both on the systemic and local level, faciliated bacterial multiplication in the liver, placenta and ultimately in the fetal tissues. This resulted in severe necrotizing hemorrhagic hepatitis and Listeria-induced placental necrosis, increasing the incidence of postimplantation loss and poor pregnancy outcome. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3alisteriosis 3apregnancy 3amice 3adisease models 3afood pathogens 2aAbortion, Veterinaryxetiology 2aAnimals 2aCytokinesxbloodxsecretion. 2aFemale 2aFetal Deathxetiology 2aFetal Diseasesxetiology 2aHepatitisxetiologyxmicrobiology. 2aListeriosisximmunologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMice 2aModels, Animal 2aNecrosis 2aPlacenta Diseasesxetiology 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complications, Infectiousximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPregnancy Outcome1 aSchluter, D.1 aVuckovic, D.1 aWraber, B.1 aDoric, M.1 aDeckert, M.0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2003 Apr. 1, v. 35, no. 3 p.177-182x0928-82447nnas  aDNAL  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02837naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245010200133300001600235500001500251520164400266650001701910650002301927650002501950650002601975650001902001650000702020650001402027650001102041650002802052653001502080653001602095653001602111700001702127700001502144700002602159700001602185700002402201773011002225852000902335930003302344945001302377946001302390655001202403IND2045113820221119203338.0950317e199410  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204511382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagendoorn, M.J.M.10aCytoplasmic acidification and secondary metabolite production in different plant cell suspensions  ap. 723-730.  a2019-12-05  aIn this study, a correlation is described between low cytoplasmic pH, measured with the fluorescent probes 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (acetoxymethyl ester) and bis[3-propyl-5-oxoisoxazol-4-yl]pentamethine oxonol, and the production of secondary metabolites for several plant cell-suspension systems. Anthraquinone production in Morinda citrifolia suspensions is negligible in the presence of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), whereas with naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) a significant accumulation is realized. NAA-grown cells showed a lower cytoplasmic pH than did 2,4-D-grown cells. Addition of 2,4-D or parachlorophenoxy acetic acid to NM-grown cells resulted in an inhibition of anthraquinone production and an increase of the cytoplasmic pH, whereas addition of parachlorophenyl acetic acid had no effect on either parameter. Lignin production in Petunia hybrida cells could be induced by subculturing them in a medium without iron. These cells showed a lower cytoplasmic pH than control cells. Addition of Fe3+ led to a decreased lignin content and an increased cytoplasmic pH. Two cell lines of Linum flavum showed a different level of coniferin and lignin concentration in their cells. Cells that accumulated coniferin and lignin had a lower cytoplasmic pH than cells that did not accumulate these secondary metabolites. Apparently, in different species and after different kinds of treatment there is a correlation between acidification of the cytoplasm and the production of different secondary metabolites. The possible role of this acidification in secondary metabolite production is discussed. 3abiosynthesis 3aMorinda citrifolia 3abiochemical pathways 3asecondary metabolites 3apropionic acid 3apH 3acytoplasm 3alignin 3acell suspension culture 0ametabolism 0agrowth rate 0aderivatives1 aWagner, A.M.1 aSegers, G.1 aPlas, L.H.W. van der.1 aOostdam, A.1 aWalraven, H.S. van.0 tPlant physiology.g1994 Oct., v. 106, no. 2 p.723-730aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02559naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168100002300177245008500200300001400285500002400299500001500323520094600338650001701284650001601301650001201317650001201329650001301341650002301354650001901377650001601396650003401412650003201446650001401478650002001492650000901512650002401521650002101545650002001566650005301586651001201639651001201651653002801663653001301691700001801704773011601722852000901838856008901847930003301936945002501969946001101994655001202005IND4413370420221119203213.0081205e20090107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441337042DNAL7 a189966142pmid7 a10.1016/j.jconhyd.2008.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP2001 aNguyen, Kim Phuong10aSource and release mechanism of arsenic in aquifers of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam  ap. 58-69.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn order to elucidate the arsenic source and its release mechanism into groundwater in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, groundwater samples were collected from wells at different depths (20 to 440 m) and core samples (from 20 to 265 m depth) were analyzed. Based on the analytical results for groundwater and core samples, the As source in groundwater is considered to be pyrite (FeS₂) in acid sulfate soil (ASS) under oxidizing conditions and hydrous ferric oxide (Fe(OH)₃) under reducing conditions. Geochemical modeling demonstrated that As(III) is the dominant species and the presence of As-bearing sulfides, Fe-bearing sulfides and oxides phases may locally act as potential sinks for As. From variation between Fe and As concentrations in groundwater samples, the release mechanism of As is: dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ containing As under reducing conditions and oxidative decomposition of FeS₂ containing As under oxidizing conditions. 3ageochemistry 3airon oxides 3aarsenic 3apyrites 3aaquifers 3aacid sulfate soils 3ahydrochemistry 3agroundwater 2aArsenicxanalysisxchemistry. 2aFerric Compoundsxchemistry 2aGeography 2aIronxchemistry 2aSoil 2aSulfidesxchemistry 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 3aVietnam 0aVietnam 0ahydrous ferroxide oxide 0asulfides1 aItoi, Ryuichi0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2009 Jan. 7, v. 103, no. 1-2 p.58-69dElsevier Science B.V.x0169-77227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2008.09.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20081215b20090206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/12/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03867naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245010400183300001600287520191300303650001702216650001402233650001002247650000902257650002202266650006302288650006202351650006102413650002402474650002602498650001102524650001102535650003402546650005402580650000902634650002802643650001602671650003102687650006402718650001402782650001802796653002902814653002202843700001802865700002502883700002102908700002102929700002502950700002502975700001703000773011003017852000903127856008503136930003303221946001103254655001203265IND4414223420221119203148.0081226e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441422342DNAL7 a191073402pmid7 a10.1007/s00535-008-2255-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThelen, Armin 10aMicrovessel density correlates with lymph node metastases and prognosis in hilar cholangiocarcinoma  ap. 959-966.  aBackground Neovascularization was shown to be critically involved in the progression of multiple cancers, and treatment approaches targeting tumor-associated neovascularization provide convincing results in recent years in some tumor entities. However, little is known about the tumor-associated neovascularization in hilar cholangiocarcinoma. The present study was conducted to analyze tumor-associated neovascularization in hilar cholangiocarcinoma and to determine its influence on tumor growth, metastasis, recurrence, and prognosis. Methods We analyzed tissue specimens of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (n = 60) by immunohistochemistry using the endothelial-specific antibody CD31 and subsequently quantified the microvessel density (MVD). The MVD was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and recurrence pattern of the tumors as well as survival of patients. Results Hilar cholangiocarcinoma revealed a high degree of vascularization, with a calculated mean MVD of 28.1 ± 14.5 vessels. Tumors with a high MVD had a significant higher incidence of lymph node involvement (P = 0.009) and local recurrence (P < 0.001). Furthermore, a high MVD was identified to be a significant overall survival disadvantage (3-year, 28% vs. 93%; 5-year, 8% vs. 78%; P < 0.001) as well as disease-free survival disadvantage (3-year, 7% vs. 88%, 5-year, 7% vs. 72%; P < 0.001), with MVD representing an independent prognostic factor for survival. Conclusions Neovascularization is associated with nodal spread as well as local recurrence and serves as an independent prognostic factor for survival after curative resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Therefore, tumor-associated neovascularization seems to be critically involved in the progression of this tumor entity. In addition, neovascularization may represent a potential target in he development of new therapeutic approaches in hilar cholangiocarcinoma. 3aangiogenesis 3aprognosis 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aPlatelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1ximmunology. 2aBile Duct Neoplasmsxdiagnosisxphysiopathologyxsurgery. 2aCholangiocarcinomaxdiagnosisxphysiopathologyxsurgery. 2aDisease Progression 2aDisease-Free Survival 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistryxmethods 2aLymphatic Metastasisxdiagnosisxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aMicrovesselsxpathology 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasm Recurrence, Local 2aNeovascularization, Pathologicxdiagnosisxphysiopathology. 2aPrognosis 2aSurvival Rate 0aHilar cholangiocarcinoma 0atumor progression1 aScholz, Arne 1 aBenckert, Christoph 1 aSchröder, Maik 1 aWeichert, Wilko 1 aWiedenmann, Bertram 1 aNeuhaus, P.q(Peter)1 aJonas, Sven 0 tJournal of gastroenterology.g2008 Dec., v. 43, no. 12 p.959-966dJapan : Springer Japanx0944-11747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00535-008-2255-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20081226b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01684naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002800144245006200172300001600234520066700250650001500917650002200932650002000954650000900974650001700983650000901000650001301009650001101022650001601033650001701049700001701066700002001083773007001103852000901173856008401182939003301266946001101299655001201310IND4480577220221119203033.0140502e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448057722DNAL7 a10.1136/inpract.30.8.4342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherubini, Giunio Bruto10aPelvic limb ataxia in the older dog 2.

Considering the high incidence of coinfections by the two pathogens, a combination vaccine that can be administered as a single regimen would be highly desirable. Recombinant Vibrio cholerae ghosts (rVCG) offer an attractive approach for the induction of humoral and cellular immune responses against human and animal pathogens. In this study, we evaluated a bivalent combination vaccine formulation comprising rVCG expressing chlamydial MOMP and HSV-2 glycoprotein D in mice for immunogenicity and protective efficacy against genital challenge with either pathogen. Mice immunized with the combination vaccine elicited secretory IgA and IgG2a antibodies to both chlamydial and HSV-2 antigens in serum and vaginal secretions. Robust antigen-specific mucosal and systemic T helper type 1 responses were induced in mice as measured by increased interferon-γ levels produced by immune T cells in response to restimulation with target antigen in vitro. In addition, mice immunized with the combination vaccine were prophylactically protected from genital challenge with high doses of live Chlamydia and HSV-2. Thus, the combination vaccine regimen delivered by rVCG elicited adequate immune effectors that simultaneously protected against the individual pathogens. 3aChlamydia 3aantibodies 3acytokines 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Vaccinesxgeneticsximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aChlorocebus aethiops. 2aChlamydia Infectionsximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aChlamydia trachomatisximmunology 2aFemale 2aGenetic Vectorsxgenetics 2aHeLa Cells 2aHerpes Genitalisximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aHerpesvirus 2, Humanximmunology 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPorinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aTh1 Cellsximmunology 2aVaccines, Combinedximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aVaccines, Subunitximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aVero Cells 2aVibrio choleraexgenetics 2aViral Envelope Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aViral Vaccinesxgeneticsximmunologyxpharmacology. 0acombination vaccine 0aHSV-2 0aprotection1 aIfere, Godwin O.1 aHe, Qing1 aIgietseme, Joseph U.1 aKellar, Kathryn L.1 aOkenu, Daniel M.1 aEko, Francis O.0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2007 Feb., v. 49, no. 1 p.46-55dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0928-82447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-695X.2006.00165.x3electronic resource  a20070128b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02840naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245011200168300001800280500002400298520146300322650003901785650003801824650001001862650001001872650001901882650001101901650001301912650003001925650000901955650001401964650001401978650001201992650001402004650002102018651001202039700001802051700001702069700001502086700002002101700001502121700001502136773011802151852000902269856009202278655001202370IND4445811320221119202927.0101126s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444581132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2010.04855.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBardiau, M.10aEnteropathogenic (EPEC), enterohaemorragic (EHEC) and verotoxigenic (VTEC) Escherichia coli in wild cervids  ap. 2214-2222.  aIncludes references  aAims: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterohaemorragic (EHEC) and verotoxigenic (VTEC) Escherichia coli strains in free‐ranging wild ruminants in Belgium and to characterize the positive isolates (serogroups and virulence‐associated factor‐encoding genes). Methods and Results: Escherichia coli strains isolated from faeces of wild cervids were characterized by PCR targeting genes coding for the main virulence properties of EPEC, EHEC and VTEC strains. The prevalence rate of these pathogenic strains in faecal samples obtained from the wild ruminants was found to be 15%. No pathogenic isolate was found to belong to the O157, O26, O111, O103 or O145 serogroups. Moreover, a new gene, eibH, showing 88% identity with eibG was detected in VTEC strains. Conclusions: The results reveal that wild ruminants could be considered as a potential source of VTEC and EPEC infection for humans and possibly also for domestic ruminants. Significance and Impact of the Study: Our study suggests the potential risk of transmission of VTEC, EHEC and EPEC strains from wild ruminants to humans via the consumption of venison and to domestic ruminants because of sharing of the same pasture. Indeed, many serogroups other than O157 EHEC have also been shown to be responsible for outbreaks in humans in several countries, and studies focusing solely on O157:H7 EHEC tend to underestimate this risk of transmission. 3aenterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli 3aenteropathogenic Escherichia coli 3afeces 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3apastures 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3aruminants 3aserotypes 3avenison 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 3aBelgium1 aGrégoire, F.1 aMuylaert, A.1 aNahayo, A.1 aDuprez, J.‐N.1 aMainil, J.1 aLinden, A.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2010 Dec., v. 109, no. 6 p.2214-2222dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2010.04855.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02354naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245005500190300001600245520096800261650002001229650001501249650001901264650001501283650002101298650001801319650001801337650002201355650002501377650002201402650001001424650001201434650001701446650003301463650001501496650001301511650002501524650001001549653002601559700002901585773011301614852000901727856009201736930003301828946001101861655001201872IND4393619920221119203328.0070729e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439361992DNAL7 a176637172pmid7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01073.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJactel, Hervé10aTree diversity reduces herbivory by forest insects  ap. 835-848.  aBiodiversity loss from plant communities is often acknowledged to affect primary production but little is known about effects on herbivores. We conducted a meta-analysis of a worldwide data set of 119 studies to compare herbivory in single-species and mixed forests. This showed a significant reduction of herbivory in more diverse forests but this varied with the host specificity of insects. In diverse forests, herbivory by oligophagous species was virtually always reduced, whereas the response of polyphagous species was variable. Further analyses revealed that the composition of tree mixtures may be more important than species richness per se because diversity effects on herbivory were greater when mixed forests comprised taxonomically more distant tree species, and when the proportion of non-host trees was greater than that of host trees. These findings provide new support for the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning across trophic levels. 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aforest insects 3aherbivores 3ahost specificity 3ameta-analysis 3amixed forests 3aplant communities 3aprimary productivity 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aFood Chain 2aForestry 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aTrees 0aecosystem functioning1 aBrockerhoff, Eckehard G.0 tEcology letters.g2007 Sept., v. 10, no. 9 p.835-848dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01073.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02200naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245006100168300001600229520093600245650001901181650002001200650001201220650001301232650001801245650001401263650001601277650001901293650001501312653003201327653002801359653002301387700001801410700002501428700002201453700001501475700001801490773012001508852000901628856008501637930003301722946001101755655001201766IND4424583220221119203144.0090814e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442458322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-009-9408-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDias, Nelson Luis 12aA Simple Method of Estimating Scalar Fluxes Over Forests  ap. 401-414.  aA simple aerodynamic-variance method is proposed to fill gaps in continuous CO₂ flux measurements in rainy conditions, when open-path analysers do not function. The method requires turbulent conditions (friction velocity greater than 0.1 ms⁻¹), and uses measurements of mean wind speed, and standard deviations of temperature and CO₂ concentration fluctuations to complement, and at times replace, eddy-covariance measurements of friction velocity, sensible heat flux and CO₂ flux. Friction velocity is estimated from the mean wind speed with a flux-gradient relationship modified for the roughness sublayer. Since normalised standard deviations do not follow Monin-Obukhov similarity theory in the roughness sublayer, a simple classification scheme according to the scalar turbulence scale was used. This scheme is shown to produce sensible heat and CO₂ flux estimates that are well correlated with the measured values. 3acarbon dioxide 3aeddy covariance 3aforests 3afriction 3aheat transfer 3aroughness 3atemperature 3aturbulent flow 3awind speed 0aAerodynamic-variance method 0aCO₂ flux measurements 0aRoughness sublayer1 aHong, Jinkyu 1 aLeclerc, Monique Y. 1 aBlack, T.

These data revealed a predominantly African origin at all locations. However, significant heterogeneity was found between the two lowland sites and the Central Valley for some isozyme markers as well as for the RFLPs considered in this study. Both isozymic and mitochondrial DNA European markers were more frequent in the Central Valley. This could be the result of different opportunities for European gene introgression at the beginning of the migration of Africanized honeybees. It is shown that different gene frequencies of mitochondrial and nuclear European genetic markers may exist in Africanized bee populations, and that this may result from different selection pressures among colonies with African and European queens. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aApis mellifera scutellata 3aloci 3ahexokinase 3amitochondrial DNA 3ageographical variation 3ahaplotypes 3aenzyme polymorphism 3agene frequency 3amalate dehydrogenase 3aisozymes 3awings 3agenetic markers 3aCosta Rica 0aApis 0aadh locus 0ahk locus 0aheterogeneity 0aApis mellifera 0amdh locus 0aanatomy and morphology0 tHeredity.g1995 Aug., v. 75, no. pt.2 p.133-141x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04022naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245015800182300001600340500002400356500001500380520165000395650001102045650001402056650002702070650003002097650002302127650002702150650001402177650001202191650001302203650002702216650002402243650001402267650003802281650007702319650001502396650001002411650002802421650001002449650002102459650003402480650001102514650003802525650001102563650001102574650000902585650001602594650002402610650004302634650001602677651000902693651000902702653002302711653002302734653002302757700002002780700002302800700001802823700002202841700002202863700002202885700002002907700001602927700003002943700001602973700002702989700002203016773009603038852000903134856008503143655001203228IND4418712620221119203203.0090403s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441871262DNAL7 a192803202pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-009-0338-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelsy, Acosta10aMolecular characterization of adenoviral infections in Cuba: report of an unusual association of species D adenoviruses with different clinical syndromes  ap. 619-627.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAdenoviruses are common pathogens that are responsible for a wide variety of infectious syndromes. The objectives of this study were to identify and characterize members of different adenovirus species at the molecular level and to describe the correlation between viruses and clinical syndromes during a period of 4 years. Between 2002 and 2006, 45 of 512 respiratory specimens (8%) from patients with acute respiratory tract infection tested positive for adenovirus. Four adenovirus isolates from samples sent for enterovirus isolation were also analyzed. This research identified 49 confirmed cases of human adenovirus infection by PCR and/or viral culture. The most common diagnosis was upper respiratory infection (44%). Human adenovirus D was the major species found (59%), followed by Human adenovirus C (36%) and Human adenovirus B (4%). Human adenovirus 5 was the major serotype found producing bronchiolitis, followed by human adenovirus 6. In patients with upper respiratory infection, the major serotype found was human adenovirus 17. Viruses of the species Human adenovirus D were identified in seven (77%) cases of acute febrile syndrome. Four isolates from clinical materials obtained from patients with encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis and meningoencephalitis were identified as belonging to the species Human adenovirus D. Our data demonstrate a surprising result about the identification of an unusual association of viruses of the species Human adenovirus D with different clinical syndromes. This observation could be evaluated as a possible indicator of the emergence of a novel strain but further studies are required. 3ahumans 3aserotypes 3aHuman mastadenovirus D 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arespiratory system 3aHuman mastadenovirus C 3aparalysis 3aviruses 3apatients 3aHuman mastadenovirus B 3ameningoencephalitis 3apathogens 2aAdenoviridae Infectionsxvirology 2aAdenoviruses, Humanxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBronchiolitisxvirology 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aEncephalitis, Viralxvirology 2aFemale 2aFever of Unknown Originxvirology 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aParalysisxvirology 2aRespiratory Tract Infectionsxvirology 2aYoung Adult 3aCuba 0aCuba 0aHuman adenovirus D 0aHuman adenovirus B 0aHuman adenovirus C1 aOdalys, Valdés1 aAlexander, Piñón1 aClara, Savón1 aAngel, Goyenechea1 aGrehete, Gonzalez1 aGuelsys, Gonzalez1 aLuis, Sarmiento1 aPedro, Más1 aGuadalupe, Guzmán María1 aAlina, Llop1 aPilar, Perez Breña Ma1 aInmaculada, Casas0 tArchives of virology.g2009 Apr., v. 154, no. 4 p.619-627dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-009-0338-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02199naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245007300124300001600197500001500213520107700228650004701305650000901352650002001361650002701381650001601408650001901424650002401443650002201467650002001489651001001509653001601519653002701535653001301562653002301575653002801598700001601626773006901642852000901711930003301720945001301753946001101766655001201777IND2050542120221119203108.0960327e199508  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205054212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBucci, G.10aGenetic variation of RAPD markers in a Picea abies Karst. population  ap. 188-197.  a2019-12-05  aWe report the results of the screening of 20 mapped RAPD loci over haploid megagametophytes from 48 individual trees of an Italian population of Norway spruce. LOD scores for 190 pairs of loci were calculated over families of megagametophytes from 'informative' trees, and linkage relationships between pairs of markers were analysed. Single-locus genotypes were inferred from haploid progeny-array data and were used to estimate linkage disequilibrium between loci. Significant deviations from equilibrium did not appear to be randomly distributed over loci. Most of the markers analysed showed an excess of heterozygotes and five out of 20 RAPD markers showed significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A weak spatial structure was detected by spatial autocorrelation at the scale considered (0-180 m), suggesting a lack of 'family structure' arising from isolation by distance. Nonrandom distribution of the genetic variability was limited to some loci. Di- and tri-locus spatial autocorrelation of loci showing linkage disequilibrium was also carried out. 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aloci 3aautocorrelation 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aPicea abies 3aheterozygosity 3apopulation genetics 3agenetic variation 3agenetic markers 3aItaly 0asegregation 0asingle locus genotypes 0agenotype 0alinkage (genetics) 0aspatial autocorrelation1 aMenozzi, P.0 tHeredity.g1995 Aug., v. 75, no. pt.2 p.188-197x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03192naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245011300193300001400306520135300320650001401673650002301687650001201710650001101722650004201733650004001775650005401815650003501869650004001904650005801944650000902002650002302011650001902034650003102053650003402084650001702118653003102135653001702166653001502183700002202198700002102220700001902241700002002260700002102280700002502301700003202326773013502358852000902493856009202502930003302594946001102627655001202638IND4399956520221119203444.0080113e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439995652DNAL7 a179959592pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-695X.2007.00349.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergin, Philip J.10aGastric gelatinase B/matrix metalloproteinase-9 is rapidly increased in Helicobacter felis-induced gastritis  ap. 88-98.  aIt has previously been shown that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels, originating from macrophages, are considerably increased in human Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis. Here, the early kinetics of the MMP-9 response resulting from Helicobacter infection in C57BL/6 and MMP-9 knock-out mice using the murine Helicobacter felis model were examined. H. felis infection induced severe gastritis in the murine stomach at just 2 weeks after infection. Before gastritis, an increase was observed in MMP-9-positive cells detected by immunohistochemistry in the basal lamina propria. This finding was corroborated by gelatin zymography of stomach samples. As the gastritis increased so did the concentration of MMP-9 and the incidence of gastric MMP-9-positive cells, their location corresponding to that of macrophages. In contrast, systemic levels of MMP-9 remained unchanged. When MMP-9-deficient mice were infected with H. felis, no significant difference in gastritis development was detected compared with disease development in wild-type animals. We conclude that MMP-9 production is an early event in the response to gastric Helicobacter infection, a feature that may favor the recruitment of immune cells early during infection. At later stages, however, the increased levels of MMP-9 may damage the integrity of the stomach mucosa. 3agastritis 3aHelicobacter felis 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aGastric Mucosaxchemistryxpathology. 2aGastritisxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aHelicobacter Infectionsxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aHelicobacter felisxphysiology 2aMacrophagesxchemistryximmunology. 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 9xbiosynthesisxdeficiency. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aMucous Membranexpathology 2aSpleenxchemistryxpathology. 2aTime Factors 0amatrix metalloproteinase-9 0agelatinase B 0amacrophage1 aRaghavan, Sukanya1 aSvensson, Helena1 aStarckx, Sofie1 aVan Aelst, Ilse1 aGjertsson, Inger1 aOpdenakker, Ghislain1 aQuiding-Järbrink, Marianne0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2008 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.88-98dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0928-82447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-695X.2007.00349.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02200naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006600127300001800193500001500211520117900226650002501405650001701430650000901447650001701456650001201473650003601485650001101521653001601532653001401548653002301562653001801585700001601603700001501619773011201634852000901746930003301755945001301788946001301801655001201814IND2045431720221119203324.0950406e199412  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204543172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLightner, J.12aA mutant of Arabidopsis with increased levels of stearic acid  ap. 1443-1451.  a2019-12-05  aA mutation at the fab2 locus of Arabidopsis caused increased levels of stearate in leaves. The increase in leaf stearate in fab2 varied developmentally, and the largest increase occurred in young leaves, where stearate accounted for almost 20% of total leaf fatty acids. The fatty acid composition of leaf lipids isolated from the fab2 mutant showed increased stearate in all the major glycerolipids of both the chloroplast and extrachloroplast membranes. Although the stearate content was increased, the hb2 mutant still contained abundant amounts of 18:1, 18:2, and 18:3 fatty acids. These results are consistent with the expectations for a mutation partially affecting the action of the stromal stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase. Positional analysis indicated that the extra 18:0 is excluded with high specificity from the sn-2 position of both chloroplast and extrachloroplast glycerolipids. Although stearate content was increased in all the major leaf membrane lipids, the amount of increase varied considerably among the different lipids, from a high of 25% of tatty acids in phosphatidylcholine to a low of 2.9% of fatty acids in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abiosynthesis 3aloci 3astearic acid 3amutants 3achemical constituents of plants 3aleaves 0afatty acids 0afab2 loci 0agenetic regulation 0aglycerolipids1 aWu-O, Jess.1 aBrowse, J.0 tPlant physiology.g1994 Dec., v. 106, no. 4 p.1443-1451aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02913naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245012800160300001600288500002400304520166200328650002801990650005602018650002002074650002202094650001102116650001302127650001602140650001402156650002202170650001202192651001602204700001902220700002002239700001702259700001902276700001802295773009602313852000902409856008502418655001202503IND4418712720221119203330.0090403s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441871272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-009-0347-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNam, Eeuri10aComplete genomic characterization of a European type 1 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus isolate in Korea  ap. 629-638.  aIncludes references  aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) isolates belonging to the European genotype 1 have recently emerged in South Korea, suggesting potential problems for disease control. In the present study, we attempted to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of the first Korean type 1 PRRSV isolate, designated KNU-07. The full-length genome of KNU-07 was found to be 15,038 nucleotides in length, which was 60 nucleotides shorter than the type 1 prototype strain Lelystad due to a notable 60-bp deletion within the nonstructural protein 2 (NSP2). The KNU-07 genome was shown to consist of a 221-nucleotide (nt) 5' untranslated region (UTR), a 14,703-nt protein-coding region, and a 114-nt 3' UTR, followed by a 42-73-bp poly(A) tail. A nucleotide sequence comparison of the KNU-07 genome with 20 complete PRRSV genomes revealed a 10.5-13.3% and 39.5-40.3% divergence from type 1 and type 2 strains, respectively, at the genome level, indicating a high similarity to the virus strains commonly identified as the European genotype. In order to investigate genetic variation and to understand the molecular evolution of the type 1 isolate in Korea, extensive phylogenetic analyses were performed using the ORF5 and ORF7 nucleotide sequences of published type 1 PRRSV isolates. The data further indicated that the newly emerging type 1 isolate KNU-07 belongs to the recently proposed pan-European subtype 1. Taken together, the results of this study describe the genomic characterization of the type 1 PRRSV isolated in South Korea, suggesting a recent introduction of the virus typical for this genotype that has commonly appeared worldwide. 3a3' untranslated regions 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3adisease control 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenotype 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3aviruses 3aSouth Korea1 aPark, Choi-Kyu1 aKim, Seong Hee.1 aJoo, Yi-Seok1 aYeo, Sang-Geon1 aLee, Changhee0 tArchives of virology.g2009 Apr., v. 154, no. 4 p.629-638dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-009-0347-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03052naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245012000189300001800309520126700327650002901594650001201623650001901635650001801654650001101672650001401683650001701697650001701714650002601731650001101757650003301768650000901801650003401810650001201844650003001856650002001886650001301906650004401919650003501963650005401998650003502052650005702087653002302144700001702167700002102184700001702205773013102222852000902353856009202362930003302454946001102487655001202498IND4420151420221119203246.0090508e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442015142DNAL7 a192454042pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04170.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, M.D.10aRemoval of heavy metals using a brewer's yeast strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: advantages of using dead biomass  ap. 1792-1804.  aThe capacities of live and heat-killed cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 45°C for the removal of copper, nickel and zinc from the solution were compared. Kinetic studies have shown a maximum accumulation of Ni²⁺ and Zn²⁺ after 10 min for both types of cells, while for Cu²⁺ this was attained after 30 and 60 min for dead and live cells, respectively. Equilibrium studies have shown that inactivated biomass displayed a greater Zn²⁺ and Ni²⁺ accumulation than live yeasts. For Cu²⁺, live and dead cells showed similar accumulation. Fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy studies have shown that no appreciable structural or molecular changes occurred in the cells during the killing process. The increased metal uptake observed in dead cells can be most likely explained by the loss of membrane integrity, which allows the exposition of further metal-binding sites present inside the cells. Heat-killed cells showed a higher degree of heavy metal removal than live cells, being more suitable for further bioremediation works. Dead flocculent cells can be used in a low cost technology for detoxifying metal-bearing effluents as this approach combines an efficient metal removal with the ease of cell separation. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3abrewers yeast 3acopper 3aeffluents 3afluorescence 3aheavy metals 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3anickel 3ascanning electron microscopy 3azinc 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiomass 2aCell Membranexphysiology 2aHot Temperature 2aKinetics 2aMetals, Heavyxisolation & purification 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purification 0ayeast flocculation1 aJanssens, S.1 aSoares, H.M.V.M.1 aSoares, E.V.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2009 June, v. 106, no. 6 p.1792-1804dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04170.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090508b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02408naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001600138245011800154300001400272520115700286650001801443650002101461650002801482650001601510650001901526650001601545650001801561650001801579650001301597650001901610650001101629650001701640653002301657653002001680700001701700773009001717852000901807856007801816930003301894945001301927946001101940990002301951655001201974IND2048122420221119203403.0951005e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204812242DNAL7 a10.1007/BF015700102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEaton, D.C.10aFed-batch and continuous fermentation of Selenomonas ruminantium for natural propionic, acetic and succinic acids  ap. 32-38.  aAn anaerobic fermentation process was developed for production of natural propionic, acetic and succinic acids from L-lactic acid using Selenomonas ruminantium. The L-lactic acid was quickly converted to a racemic mixture and there was no enantiomeric preference for further metabolism. The lactic acid was metabolized to propionic, acetic and succinic acids typically in a molar ratio of about 5:3:1. However, the ratio of propionate:succinate started high (as much as 22:1), before declining to as low as 5:1 after the first 48 h. Nutrients in corn steep liquor and yeast extract were necessary for optimal production of propionic acid. The corn steep liquor and yeast extract were heat stable at neutral pH, but some nutritional qualities were lost when heated at pH 2.4. In fed-batch fermentation on lactic acid 2.0% propionic acid was produced in 48 h and 2.3% in 68 h. A continuous culture operated at a dilution rate of 0.055 h-1 and a lactic acid feed concentration of 30 g L-1 had a propionic acid productivity of 0.59 g L-1 h-1. The steady state results were: lactic acid 0.6%, propionic acid 1.1%, acetic acid 0.50%, and succinic acid 0.33%. 3ayeast extract 3aflavor compounds 3aSelenomonas ruminantium 3alactic acid 3apropionic acid 3aacetic acid 3asuccinic acid 3aculture media 3acysteine 3aheat treatment 3ayields 3akosher foods 0amaize steep liquor 0anatural flavors1 aGabelman, A.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology.g1995 July, v. 15, no. 1 p.32-38x0169-41467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF015700103Available from publisher's Web site  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03002naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245013500173300001800308500002400326520192600350650003002276650002902306650001502335650001302350650001002363650001502373650001702388650002402405650002002429650002202449700002402471773009302495852000902588856005502597655001202652IND4444128820221119203214.0101022e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444412882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.18275.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrevens, Chloë10aRegional and local scale metapopulation dynamics in the interaction between Callosobruchus maculatus and Anisopteromalus calandrae  ap. 1735-1744.  aIncludes references  aHabitat structure increases the persistence of many extinction‐prone resource-consumer interactions. Metapopulation theory is one of the leading approaches currently used to explain why local, ephemeral populations persist at a regional scale. Central to the metapopulation concept is the amount of dispersal occurring between patches, too much or too little can result in regional extinction. In this study, the role of dispersal on the metapopulation dynamics of an over‐exploitative host-parasitoid interaction is assessed. In the absence of the parasitoid the highly vagile bruchid, Callosobruchus maculatus, can maintain a similar population size regardless of the permeability of the inter‐patch matrix and exhibits strong negative density‐dependence. After the introduction of the parasitoid the size of the bruchid population decreases with a corresponding increase in the occurrence of empty patches. In this case, limiting the dispersal of both species decouples the interaction to a greater extent and results in larger regional bruchid populations. Given the disparity between the dispersal rates of the two species, it is proposed that the more dispersive host benefits from the reduction in landscape permeability by increasing the opportunity to colonise empty patches and rescue extinction prone populations. Associated with the introduction of the parasitoid is a shift in the strength of density‐dependence as the population moves from bottom-up towards top-down regulation. The importance of local and regional scale measurements is apparent when the role of individual patches on regional dynamics is considered. By only taking regional dynamics into account the importance of dispersal regime on local dynamics is overlooked. Similarly, when local dynamics were examined, patches were found to have different influences on regional dynamics depending on dispersal regime and patch location. 3aAnisopteromalus calandrae 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3aextinction 3ahabitats 3ahosts 3alandscapes 3apermeability 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3aspecies dispersal1 aBonsall, Michael B.0 tOikos.g2010 Nov., v. 119, no. 11 p.1735-1744dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.18275.x 7aarticle03082naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169072000900178072000900187100001500196245009400211300001400305500002400319500001500343520141400358650002601772650002301798650001801821650002001839650002501859650001001884650002101894650000901915650002201924650001601946650002401962650002701986650002302013650001302036650002502049650002402074651002002098653001702118653001502135700002202150700001502172700001702187773011702204852000902321856009102330930003302421945002502454946001302479655001202492IND4413367920221119203007.0081205e20090104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441336792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aJ500 0aB200 0aX100 0aJ2001 aWang, Enli10aCapacity of soils to buffer impact of climate variability and value of seasonal forecasts  ap. 38-50.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSoil provides a buffer to store water for use by plants between rainfall (or irrigation) events. This paper presents a study on how the plant available water holding capacity (PAWC) of soil interacts with rainfall variability and nitrogen input level to determine wheat yield, water use and the potential value of seasonal forecasting in nitrogen (N) management in southeast Australia. An agricultural production systems model was used to simulate those interactions. Results show that optimising N management towards maximum economic return led to increased production risk. Wheat yield, gross margin and crop water use increased, while deep drainage decreased with increasing soil PAWC. In high rainfall areas where the risk of crop loss was generally small, increased soil PAWC reduced the variability in gross margin, leading to higher yield, less water loss by deep drainage, and reduced potential value of seasonal forecasts. In low rainfall areas, the increase in wheat yield, gross margin and crop water use with increase in soil PAWC was much smaller due to limited rainfall. In those dry regions, the potential value of seasonal climate forecasts was simulated to increase with increased soil PAWC. Soils with higher PAWC enabled more rainfall to be used by crops, but did not change the seasonal crop water use efficiency in terms of kg grain produced per unit water consumed by evapotranspiration. 3aplant available water 3aevapotranspiration 3aprofitability 3arisk management 3awater use efficiency 3awheat 3alosses from soil 3arain 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3aweather forecasting 3awater holding capacity 3aseasonal variation 3adrainage 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient management 3aNew South Wales 0aoptimization 0asoil water1 aCresswell, Hamish1 aXu, Johnny1 aJiang, Qiang0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2009 Jan. 4, v. 149, no. 1 p.38-50dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.07.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090218b20090301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/01/13  aOther US 7aarticle02485naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245006300169300001600232520134400248650000901592650001801601650001101619650001401630650002301644650000901667650002201676650003101698650001901729653002001748653002001768653002401788700001801812773012401830852000901954856009201963930003302055946001102088655001202099IND4429539520221119203254.0091207e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442953952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4603.2009.00203.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKIM, KEEHYUK10aEffects of extrusion on κ-carrageenan/agar mixed gel type  ap. 646-656.  aκ-Carrageenan and agar have a slight mutual thermodynamic incompatibility. Therefore, this study examined the effects of extrusion on the synergy ofκ-carrageenan and agar mixed gels using mathematical mixture rules for modulus and gel time. Unlike the non-extruded mixed gels, the extruded mixed gels did not follow the rule for a phase-separated gel type. The changing pattern of gel time with the varying proportion of the two components of the extruded mixed gels was also different than that of the extruded mixed gels. The extrusion specific mechanical energy showed a sudden change at the proportion of the two components where a phase inversion of a phase-separated mixed gel occurs. The polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) determined by gel permeation chromatography system suggested that the extruded agar underwent some structural changes. Extrusion is one of the more versatile bioprocessing technologies, and it is effective in converting food materials in the physicochemical properties. This study attempted to modify the mixed gel properties using the extrusion process. The findings revealed that the extrusion process caused a change in the mixed gel type of κ-carrageenan/agar, shifting from a phase-separated gel to another gel type without phase inversion. This difference can be applied to produce a new mixed gel product. 3aagar 3abioprocessing 3aenergy 3aextrusion 3agel chromatography 3agels 3akappa carrageenan 3aphysicochemical properties 3athermodynamics 0amixed gel types 0aphase inversion 0aκ-carrageenan/agar1 aLEE, SEUNG JU0 tJournal of texture studies.g2009 Dec., v. 40, no. 6 p.646-656dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx0022-49017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4603.2009.00203.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01443naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002500115245005400140300001400194500001500208520059600223650001400819650002000833650002100853650002400874653001600898653003000914653002700944773009700971852000901068939003301077945000801110946001101118655001201129991571885910742620221119203153.0840210s1982    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840041212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasavana, Michael L.10aComputer-assisted hospitality information systems  ap. 91-94.  a2019-12-04  aComputer-assisted management information systems (MIS) have enabled employees to spend more time with guests and acquire a greater sense of professionalism.

Methods and Results: DNA sequence analyses of these genes were performed against 188 MTB isolates obtained from patients put on second‐line anti‐TB drugs (SLDs) with well‐documented clinical history and treatment outcome. Mutations in rrs and gyrA have 100% positive predictive value (PPV) in predicting treatment failure for KM and OFX, while 88·9 and 80% were obtained, respectively, when tlyA and rrs mutations were considered in CPM. For ETH and PAS, the PPV of using ethA and thyA mutations to predict treatment failure was 82·5 and 89·3%, respectively. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated high specificities of gene mutations in predicting poor treatment outcome; however, further technical advancement is required to make the molecular detection of resistances to other SLDs feasible in clinical laboratories. Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to correlate different polymorphisms of major SLD resistance gene markers with predicted treatment outcome, using an international set of well‐documented clinical MTB strains. 3asequence analysis 3akanamycin 3adrugs 3aDNA 3amutation 3acodons 3apatients 3acapreomycin 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aofloxacin 3aprediction 0agenes1 aYip, C.W.1 aYeung, Y.L.1 aWong, K.L.1 aChan, W.Y.1 aChan, M.Y.1 aKam, K.M.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2010 Dec., v. 109, no. 6 p.2087-2094dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2010.04840.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02036naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245004100151300001600192500001500208520095400223650002901177650001701206650001701223650001401240650001901254650001101273650003101284650004901315653002801364653002301392653002701415653003701442653002401479773007201503852000901575939003301584945000801617946001301625655001201638991571885100742620221119202651.0840210e19821022xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840041202DNAL7 a71232362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolata, Gina.10aShould hypertensives take potassium?  ap. 361-362.  a2019-12-04  aSome medical researchers now question the need and safety of prescribing potassium (K) supplements (to avoid body depletion of K) when thiazide diuretics are prescribed for blood pressure reduction in hypertensives. Recent analysis of a large clinical trial ("Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial", MRFIT) was skewed by adverse effects in 1 subgroup: men who had high blood pressure, electrocardiogram abnormalities, and who were treated with diuretics appeared to have an unexpectedly high mortality rate. Initial suggestions implicating the K-depleting effects of the diuretics have been challenged by some researchers who have found little evidence for depletion of total body K during diuretic therapy. These researchers explain their concern about the MRFIT results, the dogmas that K supplements are necessary, and the possibility that treatment of even mild hypertension will stimulate the use of, perhaps needless, K supplementation.

This procedure is commonly used to derive incoming solar radiation from remote sensing data or using digital elevation models. We introduce a new parameterization to calculate instantaneous values of direct normal and horizontal global PAR components. The main goal was to limit the number of input parameters for PAR predictions to Ångström's turbidity coefficient, ground PAR-band albedo and atmospheric pressure (the latter two can be replaced by ground broadband albedo and site altitude). An important novel property of this parameterization is that it provides an analytical solution that provides integrated values along any time interval. Comparisons between calculated and measured values for different climatology sites demonstrate that the model can provide a good level of accuracy for instant, hourly and daily PAR estimates, with RMSE and MBE values of less than 4% and ±2%, respectively. The influence of turbidity parameters and ground albedo on model performance was also analyzed. The introduction of Ångström's turbidity coefficient and ground albedo should allow the use of the increasing worldwide aerosol information available and to consider sites affected by snow cover in an easy and fast way. 3asolar radiation 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aspectral analysis 3aremote sensing 3asimulation models 3aturbidity 3aalbedo (reflectance) 3aprediction 3aaltitude 3aclimatic factors 3aaccuracy 3atemporal variation 3asnow 3aaerosols 3aair quality 0aAngstrom's turbidity coefficient1 aLópez, G.1 aBatlles, F.J.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2009 Jan. 4, v. 149, no. 1 p.146-158dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.07.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20090218b20090301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/01/13  aOther US 7aarticle03117naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245014700170300001800317520182200335653002202157653002202179653002002201653004202221653001802263653002202281653002202303653002002325653004202345653001802387700001902405700001702424700001802441773012502459852000902584856009202593930003302685946001302718655001202731IND4420123720221119202651.0090508e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442012372DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06051.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Quan-Gui10aGinsenoside Rg1 protects against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells via IGF-I receptor and estrogen receptor pathways  ap. 1338-1347.  aOur previous studies have demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg1 is a novel class of potent phytoestrogen and can mimic the action of estradiol in stimulation of MCF-7 cell growth by the crosstalk between insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR)-dependent pathway and estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent pathway. The present study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside Rg1 against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and the possible mechanisms. Pre-treatment with ginsenoside Rg1 resulted in an enhancement of survival, and significant rescue occurred at the concentration of 0.01 μM on cell viability against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity. These effects could be completely blocked by IGF-IR antagonist JB-1 or ER antagonist ICI 182780. 6-OHDA arrested the cells at G₀G₁ phase and prevented S phase entry. Rg1 pre-treatment could reverse the cytostatic effect of 6-OHDA. Ginsenoside Rg1 also could attenuate 6-OHDA-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. These effects could also be completely blocked by JB-1 or ICI 182780. Furthermore, 6-OHDA-induced up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression could be restored by Rg1 pre-treatment. Rg1 pre-treatment could reverse the down-regulation of ERα protein expression induced by 6-OHDA treatment. Cells transfected with the estrogen responsive element (ERE)-luciferase reporter construct exhibited significantly increased ERE-luciferase activity in the Rg1 presence, suggesting that the estrogenic effects of Rg1 were mediated through the endogenous ERs. These results suggest that ginsenoside Rg1 may attenuate 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis and its action might involve the activation of IGF-IR signaling pathway and ER signaling pathway. 0a6-hydroxydopamine 0aestrogen receptor 0aginsenoside Rg1 0ainsulin-like growth factor I receptor 0aSK-N-SH cells 0a6-hydroxydopamine 0aestrogen receptor 0aginsenoside Rg1 0ainsulin-like growth factor I receptor 0aSK-N-SH cells1 aChen, Wen-Fang1 aXie, Jun-Xia1 aWong, Man-Sau0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2009 June, v. 109, no. 5 p.1338-1347dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06051.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090515b20090608c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03652naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169072000900178100001400187245010000201300001600301500002400317520230200341650001802643650001702661650002202678650001402700650001302714650002102727650003302748650001602781650001602797650002102813650001302834650001302847650001602860700001602876773011902892852000903011856009103020930003303111945002503144946001303169655001203182IND4413367520221119202616.0081205e20090104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441336752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aX100 0aJ200 0aB2001 aLiu, Gang10aMulti-layer diffusion model and error analysis applied to chamber-based gas fluxes measurements  ap. 169-178.  aIncludes references  aChambers are widely-used for measuring greenhouse gas emission from soil surfaces. Current chamber methods are generally based on constant production within the soil, both before and after the placement of the enclosed chamber, and well-mixed chamber systems. The objective of this study is to present an analytical solution for either perfectly mixed or non-mixed non-steady-state (NSS) chamber systems with a depth-dependent gas production term. Parameters such as the decreasing production rate (k), the distance from soil-atmosphere interface to the water table (l ₁), the height of chamber (l ₂ - l ₁), the diffusion coefficient in the chamber (D ₂), and the air-filled porosity (ε) were included in our model. This was accomplished by using a one-dimensional multi-layer transient diffusion model with a production term. If we know k, l ₁, l ₂ - l ₁, D ₂, and ε, the pre-deployment flux density f ₀ can be obtained by fitting the new solution to experimental concentration curve. The analytical solution can be applied to various case scenarios from pure diffusion to perfectly mixed systems, by adjusting D ₂. The widely-used linear and nonlinear regression models are subsets of the solution. The proposed solution indicates the importance of the initial concentration distribution f(x) and production term g(x) in emission rates. Without measuring g(x), a large error in estimated pre-deployment flux density f ₀ could result. Without knowing the parameters k, l ₁, l ₂ - l ₁ and D ₂, a large error in estimated f₀ could result. If the well-mixed model is used for modeling diffusion in not perfectly mixed chamber headspace, the magnitude of the error in f ₀ increases monotonically with the increase in heights of sampling ports above l ₁ and can be larger than 60% at x = l ₂. The error caused by using the well-stirred approximation increase with decreases in D ₂ and can be significant for chambers when there are no external mixing devices. The well-mixed solution could not be fitted well to the pure diffusion concentration curve, and vice versa. The solution may be helpful for better evaluating f ₀ of trace gases from soil, carrying out the errors analysis and reducing the uncertainty in measured greenhouse gas emissions from soil. 3agas emissions 3agas exchange 3asimulation models 3adiffusion 3aaccuracy 3agreenhouse gases 3asoil-atmosphere interactions 3awater table 3adiffusivity 3asoil pore system 3aporosity 3asoil air 3auncertainty1 aSi, Bing C.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2009 Jan. 4, v. 149, no. 1 p.169-178dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.07.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20090218b20090301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/01/13  aOther US 7aarticle03342naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003000152245013100182300001800313500002400331520196300355650002102318650002102339650002202360650002502382650002302407650001102430650001602441650001202457650001202469650001802481650001202499650001602511650001302527650005802540650001302598700002302611700002902634700002602663773011802689852000902807856009202816655001202908IND4445810720221119202446.0101126s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444581072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2010.04848.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez‐Zavala, J.S.10aIncreased synthesis of α‐tocopherol, paramylon and tyrosine by Euglena gracilis under conditions of high biomass production  ap. 2160-2172.  aIncludes references  aAims: To analyse the production of different metabolites by dark‐grown Euglena gracilis under conditions found to render high cell growth. Methods and Results: The combination of glutamate (5 g l⁻¹), malate (2 g l⁻¹) and ethanol (10 ml l⁻¹) (GM + EtOH); glutamate (7·15 g l⁻¹) and ethanol (10 ml l⁻¹); or malate (8·16 g l⁻¹), glucose (10·6 g l⁻¹) and NH₄Cl (1·8 g l⁻¹) as carbon and nitrogen sources, promoted an increase of 5·6, 3·7 and 2·6‐fold, respectively, in biomass concentration in comparison with glutamate and malate (GM). In turn, the production of α‐tocopherol after 120 h identified by LC‐MS was 3·7 ± 0·2, 2·4 ± 0·1 and 2 ± 0·1 mg [g dry weight (DW)]⁻¹, respectively, while in the control medium (GM) it was 0·72 ± 0·1 mg (g DW)⁻¹. For paramylon synthesis, the addition of EtOH or glucose induced a higher production. Amino acids were assayed by RP‐HPLC; Tyr a tocopherol precursor and Ala an amino acid with antioxidant activity were the amino acids synthesized at higher concentration. Conclusions: Dark‐grown E. gracilis Z is a suitable source for the generation of the biotechnologically relevant metabolites tyrosine, α‐tocopherol and paramylon. Significance and Impact of the Study: By combining different carbon and nitrogen sources and inducing a tolerable stress to the cell by adding ethanol, it was possible to increase the production of biomass, paramylon, α‐tocopherol and some amino acids. The concentrations of α‐tocopherol achieved in this study are higher than others reported previously for Euglena, plant and algal systems. This work helps to understand the effect of different carbon sources on the synthesis of bio‐molecules by E. gracilis and can be used as a basis for future works to improve the production of different metabolites of biotechnological importance by this organism. 3aEuglena gracilis 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aammonium chloride 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3acell growth 3aethanol 3aglucose 3aglutamic acid 3amalates 3ametabolites 3anitrogen 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3atyrosine1 aOrtiz‐Cruz, M.A.1 aMendoza‐Hernández, G.1 aMoreno‐Sánchez, R.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2010 Dec., v. 109, no. 6 p.2160-2172dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2010.04848.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03943naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169072000900178100001900187245012100206300001800327500014800345500002400493500001500517520201600532650001902548650002202567650002302589650001502612650001902627650001602646650001002662650001102672650001702683650001902700650002502719650001102744650002302755650001802778650001402796650001502810650002102825651001202846653002702858653002602885700001802911700001802929700001602947700001602963700001802979700001502997773012203012852000903134856009103143930003303234945002503267946001303292655001203305IND4413366320221119202724.0081205e20081208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441336632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK001 0aW000 0aB2001 aLopez C., M.L.10aComparison of carbon and water vapor exchange of forest and grassland in permafrost regions, Central Yakutia, Russia  ap. 1968-1977.  aIn the special issue: Water and energy exchange in East Siberian forest: East Siberian climate / edited by A.J.

Therefore in this study, meteorological conditions, water vapor and CO₂ fluxes were measured by the eddy correlation technique simultaneously in a larch forest and alas ecosystem (grassland thermokarst depression) in Central Yakutia, eastern Siberia, during the growing season of 2006 (approximately 100 days, May 23rd-August 31st). The alas ecosystem was a carbon sink (-1.38tCha⁻¹) but had a 60% lower carbon sequestration capacity than the surrounding larch forest (-3.44tCha⁻¹) during the study period. Despite this large difference in carbon exchange, water loss from the alas ecosystem (118mm) was only 13% lower than that from the forest ecosystem (136mm). Water vapor flux measured in the alas was higher under similar environmental conditions when the source was the lake water than when the source was the grassland. This supports the theory that lake evaporation contributes significantly to the evaporation from the alas as indicated also by the lake water level constant decrease during the growing season. Mid-summer forest and alas mean evapotranspiration was 1.4 and 1.2mmd⁻¹ respectively. Mean daily canopy conductance was higher in the forest than in the alas (3.8 and 2.4mms⁻¹, respectively) as expected due to differences in canopy architecture at each site. In this study a rough estimate of the NEE of grassland in Central Yakutia shows an underestimation of 0.9x10⁻³ Pg if this area is considered as forested, as most regional models do. Our results suggest that a more detail analysis of distinctive areas within the territory of eastern Siberia is needed in order to obtain a better understanding of carbon and water fluxes from this immense boreal region. Furthermore, if the present global warming evokes landscape change from forest to grassland, the carbon sink capacity of this boreal region could be significantly reduced. 3acarbon dioxide 3asimulation models 3aevapotranspiration 3apermafrost 3aboreal forests 3awater vapor 3alakes 3acanopy 3agas exchange 3aclimate change 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon 3aseasonal variation 3asurface water 3aoverstory 3agrasslands 3aleaf conductance 3aSiberia 0aeddy covariance method 0abiogeochemical cycles1 aGerasimov, E.1 aMachimura, T.1 aTakakai, F.1 aIwahana, G.1 aFedorov, A.N.1 aFukuda, M.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2008 Dec. 8, v. 148, no. 12 p.1968-1977dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.09.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20090225b20090301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/01/14  aOther US 7aarticle02302naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245012200168300001800290500002400308520105700332650001301389650002301402650002501425650001501450650002901465650001201494650002301506650003201529650002201561650002201583650001601605650001201621650001601633651001201649700002601661700002301687773008801710852000901798856008501807655001201892IND4445879420221119202708.0101130s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444587942DNAL7 a10.1080/089419209032781522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeyfrit, Carole L.10aMigration intentions of rural youth in Iceland: can a large-scale development project stem the tide of out-migration?  ap. 1201-1215.  aIncludes references  aRural communities in Iceland have been profoundly affected by natural resource management policies. As part of a regional development strategy, a large aluminum smelter and 650-megawatt hydroelectric plant were built in the sparsely populated Eastfjords region. This project was aimed at revitalizing the region and creating employment, enabling youth to stay in their home communities. Using surveys from 1992 through 2007, changes in migration expectations are compared among Eastfjords, equally rural Westfjords far from the project, and the urban capital region. The majority of rural youth want to out-migrate and the project had no discernable effect on such intentions. Regardless of employment opportunities, rural youth increasingly want to move to urban areas or abroad. Gender differences disappeared over time as "female flight" became "youth flight." Findings suggest large-scale natural resource projects alone are not sufficient, and more comprehensive rural development policies are needed to stem the tide of rural youth out-migration. 3aaluminum 3adevelopment policy 3adevelopment projects 3aemployment 3aemployment opportunities 3afemales 3agender differences 3anatural resource management 3arural communities 3arural development 3arural youth 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aIceland1 aÞóroddur Bjarnason.1 aKjartan Ólafsson.0 tSociety & natural resources.g2010 Dec., v. 23, no. 12 p.1201-1215x0894-19207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/089419209032781523Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02445naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245013700158300001600295500001500311520088500326650000901211650002301220650003001243650002701273650002001300650001301320650002701333650002501360650002101385650002301406650002301429650003401452650003901486653002801525653002001553700001901573700001401592700001801606700001801624700001801642700001701660700001701677700001501694700001701709773009901726852000901825930003301834945002501867946001101892655001201903IND4382880420221119202854.0060817e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438288042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Among them, the subfamily PR-1 represents low-molecular weight proteins of unknown biochemical function. Here, we describe the cloning and isolation of two PR-1 genes (PR-1b1 (GenBank accession no. SPH493450) and PR-1b2 (SPH493451)) that encode predicted basic proteins. We isolated them from Solanum phureja, a native Andean potato with horizontal resistance to late blight, caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. We demonstrate that the PR-1 genes belong to a small multigene family with an estimated copy number of 4-6 with one of them located on chromosome IX as determined by genetic mapping. The expression of PR-1 genes was different in late blight resistant and susceptible genotypes. Therefore, we propose that both PR-1 genes may play a role in horizontal late blight resistance of S. phureja. 3aloci 3agenetic resistance 3afungal diseases of plants 3aPhytophthora infestans 3agene expression 3apotatoes 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3anucleotide sequences 3amultigene family 3achromosome mapping 3adisease resistance 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3aSolanum tuberosum subsp. andigenum 0amolecular sequence data 0aSolanum phureja1 aSchweitzer, C.1 aNicot, N.1 aGigliotti, S.1 aHerrera, M.R.1 aHausman, J.F.1 aHoffmann, L.1 aTrognitz, B.1 aDommes, J.1 aGhislain, M.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2005 , v. 67, no. 3-5 p.155-163x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL  a20070927b20071002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/20  aNon-US 7aarticle04200naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245013300171300001800304520267700322650002802999650001803027650001203045650002103057650001303078650001403091650001903105650001403124650001203138650001503150650002003165650001503185650001503200650001003215650001503225650001903240650002403259650001603283651001203299653002003311653002403331653001903355700002103374700002103395773012103416852000903537856009203546930003303638946001103671655001203682IND4428608120221119202832.0091113e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442860812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01940.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGOIDTS, ESTHER10aDriving forces of soil organic carbon evolution at the landscape and regional scale using data from a stratified soil monitoring  ap. 2981-3000.  aSoil monitoring programmes face significant challenges as there is an important trade-off between detecting significant changes in soil properties on the one hand (which can be achieved by minimizing variability by higher sampling density or stratification approaches), and identifying the driving forces responsible for these changes on the other hand (which requires enough variability). This study aims to reconcile these two objectives by identifying the driving forces of soil organic carbon (SOC) evolution over a long period, based on an extensive but stratified soil monitoring programme. Data at both the finest level (questionnaires to the farmers) and the large scale (agricultural census, climate and soil databases for southern Belgium) were used in a cluster analysis, multiple linear regressions and mixed odels in order to discriminate between the driving forces involved. Results indicated that the negative 'baseline effect' (i.e. the inversely proportional effect of the initial SOC content on the SOC evolution) was responsible for an important part of the SOC variability. Consequently, the systems are not at steady state when starting the observations, although this assumption is used by most SOC dynamic models. Moreover, the baseline effect resulted in a trend of the soils to converge towards a regional SOC stock which significantly differed according to land use (36.4 t C ha⁻¹ for the plough depth of cropland and 92.2 t C ha⁻¹ for the 0-30 cm layer of grassland). Despite this strong effect, the main driving forces of the SOC decrease of cropland (-0.2 t C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) and SOC increase of grassland (+0.2 t C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) over a period of 50 years were discriminated. The agricultural management (cropland) and the clay content (grassland), together with the change in precipitation (to a lesser degree for cropland) were highlighted as the predominant factors involved in SOC evolution, when land use change is excluded. The use of questionnaires allowed to better understanding the impact of an intensive agricultural management on the SOC content, as the lowest SOC stocks were associated to the most intensively managed fields. The mixed models partly succeeded in predicting SOC evolution as they presented still large uncertainties after validation (mean error from 3% to 25%, root mean square error of prediction from 21% to 242%). While SOC monitoring schemes are increasingly being implemented, our results will likely apply to those using a similar design. It was shown that this strategy succeeded to reconcile both the SOC change detection and the distinction of the driving forces involved at the regional scale. 3aagricultural management 3aclay fraction 3aclimate 3acluster analysis 3acropland 3adatabases 3adynamic models 3aevolution 3afarmers 3agrasslands 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3aplows 3aprediction 3aquestionnaires 3asoil organic carbon 3auncertainty 3aBelgium 0abaseline effect 0along-term evolution 0aregional scale1 aWESEMAEL, BASvan1 aVanOOST, KRISTOF0 tGlobal change biology.g2009 Dec., v. 15, no. 12 p.2981-3000dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01940.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03347naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245012500187300001600312520139700328650002601725650001401751650002001765650001401785650002601799650002201825650003801847650001901885650001101904650003301915650000901948650004401957650004502001650004102046650005202087650004502139650006402184650004902248650005202297653001002349700002202359700002002381700002002401700001402421700002102435700002102456700002002477700002302497773010402520852000902624856009202633930003302725946001102758655001202769IND4427680420221119202849.0091023e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442768042DNAL7 a198455322pmid7 a10.1111/j.1600-0463.2009.02535.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSTARK, LISA10aStaphylococcus aureus isolates from blood and anterior nares induce similar innate immune responses in endothelial cells  ap. 814-824.  aTo evaluate the possibility to distinguish virulent from non-virulent isolates, gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) induced by invasive and colonizing isolates of Staphylococcus aureus was compared. Gene expression in HUVEC was analyzed by microarray analysis after 4 h of infection with Staphylococcus aureus, isolated from healthy nasal carriers (n = 5) and from blood of septic patients (n = 5), to explore possible differences between the groups of bacteria in interaction with HUVEC. All isolates were spa-typed to disclose strain relatedness. Moreover, the isolates were characterized with DNA microarray to determine the presence of virulence genes and to investigate the potential genes of importance in HUVEC interaction. The expression of 41 genes was up-regulated, and four were down-regulated in HUVEC by all isolates. Most of the up-regulated genes encode cytokines, chemokines, interferon-induced proteins, proteins regulating apoptosis and cell proliferation. There was no difference in the gene expression pattern between HUVEC infected with invasive or colonizing isolates. Furthermore, there was no difference in the presence of bacterial virulence genes between the two groups. In conclusion, our data indicate that S. aureus isolates induce comparable expression patterns in HUVEC, irrespective of invasiveness or presence of virulence genes. 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3ainfection 3agene expression 3avirulence 2aApoptosisximmunology 2aEndothelial Cells 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFlow Cytometry 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Innateximmunology 2aMale 2aNasal Cavityximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aRNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSepsisxbloodximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxbloodximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aStaphylococcus aureusxgeneticsximmunology. 2aVirulence Factorsxbloodxgeneticsximmunology. 0aHUVEC1 aMATUSSEK, ANDREAS1 aSTRINDHALL, JAN1 aGEFFERS, ROBERT1 aBUER, JAN1 aKIHLSTRÖM, ERIK1 aMONNECKE, STEFAN1 aLÖFGREN, STURE1 aLINDGREN, PER-ERIC0 tAPMIS.g2009 Nov., v. 117, no. 11 p.814-824dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0903-46417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0463.2009.02535.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091023b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02564naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245006700185300001600252520092700268650001401195650005101209650002201260650004101282650003601323650001801359650003701377650001701414650002601431650003101457650003101488650002401519650002601543650004601569650003501615650001701650653001201667653003001679653002101709653002501730700001801755700002201773773012501795852000901920856008501929930003302014946001102047655001202058IND4423120420221119202440.0090710e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442312042DNAL7 a195514602pmid7 a10.1007/s00792-009-0262-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ling-hua 10aEfficient production of ectoine using ectoine-excreting strain  ap. 717-724.  aHalophilic bacteria strain Halomonas salina DSM 5928 was found to excrete ectoine, suggesting its potential in the development of a new method of ectoine production.

Medium adopting monosodium glutamate as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen was beneficial for ectoine synthesis. The total concentration of ectoine was not affected by NaCl concentration in the range 0.5-2 mol l⁻¹.

  1 aWang, J.10aNitric oxide modulates H2O2-mediated defenses in the Colletotrichum coccodes-tomato interaction  ap. 131-137.  aNitric oxide (NO) is believed to be a key signalling molecule in plant defense responses. Pharmacological experiments were performed to evaluate the role of NO in the initial phases of the Colletotrichum coccodes-Lycopersicon esculentum interaction in which temporary defenses result in a latent (i.e. quiescent) infection process which lacks evidence of cell death. The effects of NO on superoxide (superoxide) levels, as measured by nitroblue tetrazolium staining, on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels as measured by oxidatively cross-linked proteins, and on callose deposition were investigated via a pharmacological approach to reducing or increasing NO levels. Increased superoxide levels and reductions in callose deposition and oxidative cross-linking at appressorial sites were observed when NO was reduced while increased NO resulted in a greater percentage of appressorial sites with callose and cross-linked proteins. As expected, catalase reduced the amount of protein cross-linking as did superoxide dismutase. The formation of cell wall defenses, which appear involved in temporarily limiting development of C. coccodes, are suggested to be controlled by the balance of NO, H2O2, and superoxide. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3atomatoes 3aColletotrichum coccodes 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungal diseases of plants 3anitric oxide 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aresistance mechanisms 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3asuperoxide anion 3aapoptosis 3acallose 3aoxidation 3acell wall components 3aappressoria 3acrosslinking1 aHiggins, V.J.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2005 , v. 67, no. 3-5 p.131-137x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL  a20070927b20071002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02588naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245007100172300001600243520104600259650002701305650001001332650001501342650001101357650001301368650001301381650002901394650001201423650001501435650001201450650006601462650003701528650002701565650001101592650002201603650005401625650005001679650002001729650002301749700001901772700001901791773009301810852000901903856007801912930003301990945001302023946001102036990002302047655001202070IND2049492520221119202713.0960118e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204949252DNAL7 a85194812pmid7 a10.1007/BF015698292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBower, C.K.10aInfluences on the antimicrobial activity of surface-adsorbed nisin  ap. 227-233.  aThe efficacy of the antimicrobial peptide nisin was examined after adsorption to silica surfaces. Three protocols were used to evaluate nisin's activity against adhered cells of Listeria monocytogenes: bioassay using Pediococcus pentosaceous FBB 61-2 as the sensitive indicator strain; visualization and enumeration of cells by microscopic image analysis; and viability of adhered cells as determined by Iodonitrotetrazolium violet uptake and crystallization. The activity of adsorbed nisin was highly dependent upon conditions of adsorption. The highest antimicrobial activity of adsorbed nisin occurred with high concentrations of nisin (1.0 mg ml-1) and brief contact times (1 h) on surfaces of low hydrophobicity. Sequential adsorption of a second protein (beta-lactoglobulin or bovine serum albumin) onto surfaces consistently resulted in decreased nisin activity. These data provide direction for the development of applications to limit microbial attachment on food contact surfaces through the use of adsorbed antimicrobial peptides. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3anisin 3aadsorption 3asilica 3asurfaces 3aadhesion 3aantibacterial properties 3abiofilm 2aAdsorption 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aBacterial Adhesionxdrug effects 2aBiofilmsxdrug effects 2aCattle 2aFood Microbiology 2aListeria monocytogenesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aNisinxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aSilicon Dioxide 2aSurface Properties1 aMcGuire, John.1 aDaeschel, M.A.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology.g1995 Sept., v. 15, no. 3 p.227-233x0169-41467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF015698293Available from publisher's Web site  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01916naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001600150245011500166300001600281300002100297520094200318650002901260650001001289650001201299650002601311650001801337650001301355650002701368650003901395653001001434773006701444852000901511939003301520946001301553655001201566IND8805225520221119202558.0881102e198810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880522552DNAL7 a30585482pmid7 aPMC12035162pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlein, H.L.10aDifferent types of recombination events are controlled by the RAD1 and RAD52 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 367-377.  ap. 367-377. ill.  aIntrachromosomal recombination within heteroallelic duplications located on chromosomes III and XV Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been examined. Both possible orientations of alleles have been used in each duplication. Three recombinant classes, gene conversions, pop-outs and triplications, were recovered. Some of the recombinant classes were not anticipated from the particular allele orientation of the duplication. Recovery of these unexpected recombinants requires the RAD1 gene. These studies show that RAD1 has a role in recombination between repeated sequences, and that the recombination event is a gene conversion associated with a crossover. These events appear to involve very localized conversion of a heteroduplex region and are distinct from RAD52 mediated gene conversion events. Evidence is also presented to suggest that most recombination events between direct repeats are intrachromatid, not between sister chromatids. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agenes 3astrains 3agenetic recombination 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenotype 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 0atypes0 tGenetics.g1988 Oct., v. 120, no. 2 p.367-377x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02103naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245010600158300001600264500001500280520079300295650001501088650002501103650001801128650001401146650002001160650001301180650003001193650001801223650002001241650002701261650002301288650001901311650001201330650001401342650002801356650001101384653002001395700001501415700001401430773009901444852000901543930003301552945002501585946001101610655001201621IND4382880320221119202630.0060817e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438288032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

SCM334  ap. 149-154.  a2019-12-05  aDefense responses were investigated in the leaves of a cultivar of pepper, Capsicum annuum (cv. SCM334) resistant to Phytophthora blight. Jasmonic acid (JA) increased in the resistant cultivar immediately after inoculation with the pathogen, Phytophthora capsici, but as the levels of JA later decreased, levels of salicylic acid (SA) increased and were subsequently accompanied by hypersensitive response (HR)-mediated cell death in SCM334. Simultaneously, expression patterns of JA- and HR-related genes were analyzed. The mRNA of catalase and peroxidase (suppressing HR generation) disappeared, while the mRNA of OPR3 (encoding JA synthesis reductase) was detected in SCM334 specifically. JA-mediated defense appears to be crucial in the resistance of pepper plants against P. capsici. 3aperoxidase 3aPhytophthora capsici 3amessenger RNA 3acultivars 3aCapsicum annuum 3acatalase 3afungal diseases of plants 3ajasmonic acid 3agene expression 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3asalicylic acid 3apeppers 3aapoptosis 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaves 0aoxidoreductases1 aKubota, M.1 aNishi, K.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2005 , v. 67, no. 3-5 p.149-154x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL  a20070927b20071002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02674naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245009300191300001600284520109200300650001201392650001901404650001101423650002301434650001401457650001501471650001701486650002201503650002901525650001401554650002201568650002301590650002201613650002201635650001401657650002401671653002301695653002001718653002401738653002001762653002501782653003601807653002001843700002401863773011201887852000901999856009202008930003302100946001102133655001202144IND4399976120221119202617.0080113e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439997612DNAL7 a180701002pmid7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01138.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJansson, Roland10aGlobal variation in diversification rates of flowering plants: energy vs. climate change  ap. 173-183.  aWe used the largest DNA-based phylogeny of flowering plants to date to evaluate the importance of energy vs. past climate change in predicting global patterns in diversification. Relative diversification rates increased towards the equator, suggesting that differences in per-lineage net diversification may be an important component of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The amplitude of Quaternary climate oscillations experienced by families explained variation in diversification equally well compared to contemporary energy measures, and energy and climate change measures were intercorrelated, making it difficult to reject either as a causal mechanism. Many putative mechanisms linking diversification to energy availability do not apply to plants, whereas the climate change mechanism has more support. We also present the first global map of angiosperm diversification, showing that, after correcting for family range-size, tropical diversification rates were fastest for clades currently in regions with high endemic species richness outside the main lowland rainforest areas. 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3aindigenous species 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3arain forests 3aspecies diversity 2aMagnoliopsidaxgenetics. 2aEcosystem 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aGenetic Speciation 2aGenetic Variation 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aPhylogeny 2aPopulation Dynamics 0aClimatic stability 0adiversification 0aenergy availability 0aextinction rate 0alatitudinal gradient 0aorbitally forced range dynamics 0aspeciation rate1 aDavies, T.

The first exon is composed of 335 nucleotides and does not contain any putative translation start codons. The second exon is separated from the first exon by 8 kb and contains the Gld translation start codon. The inferred amino acid sequence of the amino terminus contains two unusual features: three tandem repeats of serine-alanine, and a relatively high density of cysteine residues.

Maximum enzyme production was found in a medium containing 5% wheat bran extract as a carbon source and 0.5% beef extract as a carbon and nitrogen source. Enzyme secretion was strongly inhibited by the presence of Cu2+, Ni2+ and Hg2+ (1 mM) in the fermentation medium. Production of enzyme under stationary conditions resulted in 10-fold higher activity than under shaking conditions. The temperature range for production of the enzyme was 37 degrees C to 55 degrees C, with maximum activity (5.54 U ml-1) at 45 degrees C. Optimum pH and temperature for enzyme activity were 5.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively. One hundred per cent of the original activity was retained after heating the enzyme at 60 degrees C for 1 h. At 5 mM Hg2+ strongly inhibited enzyme activity.

Rapid protoplast release was also obtained with representatives of several other yeast genera under the modified conditions of treatment. The application of the procedure in construction of a highly flocculent Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a killer character is described. Fusion was effected between UV-killed protoplasts of S. cerevisiae NCIM 3578 with a killer character and live protoplasts of the highly flocculent S. cerevisiae NCIM 3528 in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. Fusants were selected using benomyl resistance as marker, killer toxin producer rather than the highly flocculent yeast being resistant to the fungicide at a concentration of 100 microgram ml-1. Fusants were also characterized by their DNA contents, capacity for ethanolic fermentation of moles sugar and levels of invertase, alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylase activities. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aflocculation 3aprotoplasts 3aprotoplast fusion 3abenomyl 3afungicide resistance 3aDNA 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3apyruvate decarboxylase 3aenzyme activity 3agenetic improvement 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFermentation 2aFlocculation 2aIndustrial Microbiologyxmethods 2aProtoplasts 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTransformation, Genetic 0aprotoplast regeneration1 aSivaraman, H.1 aGokhale, D.V.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology.g1995 Aug., v. 15, no. 2 p.94-102x0169-41467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF015698063Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02468naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010200126300001600228500001500244520143600259650001801695650001701713650000901730650002501739650002101764650001401785650002001799650002401819653001901843653001901862653002701881653002001908653001901928773006901947852000902016930003302025945001302058946001102071655001202082IND2050332120221119202944.0960314e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205033212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuranty, H.10aPower of tests for quantitative trait loci detection using full-sib families in different schemes  ap. 156-165.  a2019-12-05  aStrategies for mapping quantitative trait (QT) loci (QTL) need special studies in species where inbred lines cannot easily be obtained. We propose the detection of QTL with schemes including several full-sib families and study here the efficiency of such schemes-- diallel, factorial, cyclic or single-pair mating designs--for a varying number of parents, on the basis of the power of tests for QTL detection. We considered a single, fully informative marker completely linked to the QTL. The tests proposed for QTL detection are based on linear additive models. The results show that for a given number of parents, in given conditions, the mating design has no effect on power. It increases as the total number of individuals genotyped increases. The number of parents affects the power of QTL detection insofar as the effect of substituting QT alleles varies from one parent to another and as some parents can be homozygous at the QTL: with only two parents QTL detection is often less powerful than with more parents. The size of the genetic effects that can be detected with a given power decreases as the number of parents increases from two to six and is quite stable for more than six parents. If QTL heterozygote frequency in the base population is high enough (greater than 0.2) mating designs with six parents should give a good sample of variance attributable to QTL and allow the detection of QTL with reasonable power. 3atree breeding 3aforest trees 3aloci 3astatistical analysis 3abreeding methods 3adetection 3agenetic markers 3aquantitative traits 0amating designs 0aplant breeding 0afull sib family design 0agenetic effects 0agenetic models0 tHeredity.g1996 Feb., v. 76, no. pt.2 p.156-165x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02142naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001500156245008200171300001600253520063600269650002900905650001700934650001000951650002300961650001200984650003500996650001801031650003301049650001701082650001801099650002801117650002601145650002601171650001401197650006401211650003001275653002301305653001401328700001901342700001601361773009201377852000901469856007801478930003301556945001301589946001101602990002301613655001201636IND2049118420221119202815.0951205e199506  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204911842DNAL7 a76622882pmid7 a10.1007/BF015739582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSieiro, C.10aFlocculation of industrial and laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 461-466.  aA comparative study has been made of different laboratory and industrial wild-type strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in relation to their flocculation behavior.

This was to such an extent that it did not allow their inclusion in the Flo1 or NewFlo phenotypes.

This study evaluated aerial photos as substitutes for multiple‐year pre‐removal field data to assess downstream channel changes associated with a small dam removal. The Brownsville Dam, a 2.1 m tall concrete dam on the Calapooia River, Oregon, was removed in 2007. We mapped bars and the low flow channel downstream from the dam and in an upstream control reach using aerial photos (1994-2008) and in the field prior to (2007) and following (2008) removal. The locations and magnitudes of changes in bar area and wetted width, relative to errors, indicate that downstream channel changes were a result of the removal. The maximum changes (−3520 ± 1460 m² for bar area, 32 ± 8 m for wetted width) observed prior to dam removal with aerial photos were far downstream. In contrast, the maximum changes after removal were immediately below the dam (200 ± 90 m² for bar area, −11 ± 3 m for wetted width), and small in the upstream control (−150 ± 130 m² for bar area, 9 ± 4 m for wetted width). The dominant errors were photo specific: exposure error for spring to summer comparisons, position error for photos not processed for this study and identification error for small scale photos not scanned from film. We found aerial photos to be an acceptable but coarse substitute for multi‐year pre‐removal field data, and suggest best practices to minimize errors. 3aaerial photography 3amonitoring 3arivers 3aspring 3aOregon1 aTullos, Desiree D.0 tRiver research and applications.g2010 Dec., v. 26, no. 10 p.1220-1245dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1535-14597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.13233Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01814naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245008200142300001400224500001500238520057100253650002000824650001600844650001700860650001800877650002000895650004500915650001400960650004200974653001401016653002101030653001701051700001701068700001901085700001101104700002801115700001801143700001501161700001801176773009601194852000901290930003301299945001301332946001101345655001201356IND2054823520221119202721.0970110e199611  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205482352DNAL7 a89543512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkada, K.10aUbiquinone systems of the genus Cladosporium and morphologically similar taxa  ap. 39-43.  a2019-12-05  aThe ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) systems of 14 species of Cladosporium were determined.

The results presented here agree with phylogenetic and physiological studies which have shown that the human-pathogenic species of Cladosporium represent a homogeneous, cohesive group. 3aDeuteromycotina 3aubiquinones 3aCladosporium 3achemotaxonomy 3aPassalora fulva 2aCladosporiumxchemistryxclassification. 2aPhylogeny 2aUbiquinonexanalysisxclassification. 0axylohypha 0acladophialophora 0aFulvia fulva1 aTakizawa, K.1 aMaebayashi, Y.1 aXi, L.1 aCampos-Takaki, G.M. de.1 aNishimura, K.1 aMiyaji, M.1 aFukushima, K.0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g1996 Nov., v. 16, no. 1 p.39-43x0928-82447nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02832naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245004900194300001600243520127300259650001101532650003001543650001101573650001901584650001601603650001701619650001201636650002001648650002001668650001001688650001601698650001601714650002101730650001701751650003201768650002101800651001301821651001101834653001901845653002501864653002001889653002201909700002201931700002201953700002301975700002201998773011202020852000902132856009302141930003302234946001102267655001202278IND4391436420221119202857.0070521e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439143642DNAL7 a174981452pmid7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01033.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeeley, Kenneth J.10aDecelerating growth in tropical forest trees  ap. 461-469.  aThe impacts of global change on tropical forests remain poorly understood. We examined changes in tree growth rates over the past two decades for all species occurring in large (50-ha) forest dynamics plots in Panama and Malaysia. Stem growth rates declined significantly at both forests regardless of initial size or organizational level (species, community or stand). Decreasing growth rates were widespread, occurring in 24-71% of species at Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI) and in 58-95% of species at Pasoh, Malaysia (depending on the sizes of stems included). Changes in growth were not consistently associated with initial growth rate, adult stature, or wood density. Changes in growth were significantly associated with regional climate changes: at both sites growth was negatively correlated with annual mean daily minimum temperatures, and at BCI growth was positively correlated with annual precipitation and number of rainfree days (a measure of relative insolation). While the underlying cause(s) of decelerating growth is still unresolved, these patterns strongly contradict the hypothesized pantropical increase in tree growth rates caused by carbon fertilization. Decelerating tree growth will have important economic and environmental implications. 3aadults 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3acorrelation 3aforest trees 3aislands 3asolar radiation 3astem elongation 3astems 3atemperature 3atree growth 3atropical forests 3awood density 2aTreesxgrowth & development 2aTropical Climate 3aMalaysia 3aPanama 0aCarbon cycling 0acarbon fertilization 0aforest dynamics 0atree growth rates1 aJoseph Wright, S.1 aNur Supardi, M.N.1 aKassim, Abd Rahman1 aDavies, Stuart J.0 tEcology letters.g2007 June, v. 10, no. 6 p.461-469dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01033.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070521b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02967naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245010700193300001400300520108600314650002401400650001401424650001401438650003501452650001501487650002301502650001101525650002001536650001601556650002201572650002801594650001501622650003101637650001201668650000901680650004301689650004601732650004501778650005001823650004001873650004701913653002301960653001601983653001401999653002702013700002302040700001902063700002002082700002002102773011002122852000902232856009202241930003302333946001102366655001202377IND4399015820221119202922.0071216e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439901582DNAL7 a179611752pmid7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01123.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalitschke, Rayko10aShared signals -'alarm calls' from plants increase apparency to herbivores and their enemies in nature  ap. 24-34.  aThe attraction of natural enemies of herbivores by volatile organic compounds as an induced indirect defence has been studied in several plant systems. The evidence for their defensive function originates mainly from laboratory studies with trained parasitoids and predators; the defensive function of these emissions for plants in natural settings has been rarely demonstrated. In native populations and laboratory Y-tube choice experiments with transgenic Nicotiana attenuata plants unable to release particular volatiles, we demonstrate that predatory bugs use terpenoids and green leaf volatiles (GLVs) to locate their prey on herbivore-attacked plants. By attracting predators with volatile signals, this native plant reduces its herbivore load - demonstrating the defensive function of herbivore-induced volatile emissions. However, plants producing GLVs are also damaged more by flea beetles. The implications of these conflicting ecological effects for the evolution of induced volatile emissions and for the development of sustainable agricultural practices are discussed. 3aNicotiana attenuata 3aemissions 3aevolution 3agenetically modified organisms 3aherbivores 3aindigenous species 3aleaves 3anatural enemies 3aparasitoids 3apredatory insects 3asustainable development 3aterpenoids 3avolatile organic compounds 2aAnimals 2aCues 2aHeteropteraxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOils, Volatilexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxmetabolism 2aPredatory Behaviorxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTerpenesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 0acis-α-bergamotene 0aflea beetle 0akairomone 0atritrophic interaction1 aStenberg, Johan A.1 aKessler, Danny1 aKessler, André1 aBaldwin, Ian T.0 tEcology letters.g2008 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.24-34dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01123.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071216b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01914naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100002400156245006700180300001600247520048400263650001600747650002900763650001200792650001900804650001200823650001700835650001000852650001000862650002300872650001400895650002400909650001700933650002600950650002600976650003701002650005801039650002501097650002301122700001601145773009201161852000901253856007801262930003301340945001301373946001101386990002301397655001201420IND2049119320221119202856.0951205e199506  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204911932DNAL7 a76622932pmid7 a10.1007/BF015739672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaughan-Martini, A.10aFacts, myths and legends on the prime industrial microorganism  ap. 514-522.  aArchaic speculations and firmly established legends regarding the origin of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and related species are revisited in light of past and recent ecological evidence pointing to a strict association with artificial, man-made environments such as wineries and fermentation plants.

We used a 34-year time series of the abundance of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and five prey species to show that the nature of trophic control in a North Pacific ecosystem depends on climate state. Rapid warming in the 1970s caused an oscillation between bottom-up and top-down control. This shift to top-down control apparently contributed to the transition from an initial, prey-rich ecosystem state to the final, prey-poor state. However, top-down control could not be detected in the final state without reference to the initial state and transition period. Complete understanding of trophic control in ecosystems capable of transitions between alternate states may therefore require observations spanning more than one state. 3aGadus macrocephalus 3aclimate 3acod (fish) 3amarine ecosystems 3atime series analysis 2aAnimals 2aClimate 2aCrustaceaxphysiology 2aFood Chain 2aGadiformesxphysiology 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aPredatory Behavior 2aTemperature 0aPacific Ocean 0aAlternate stable states 0abottom-up control 0acommunity reorganization 0afishery 0aPacific Decadal Oscillation 0aregime shift 0atop-down control 0atrophic control1 aCiannelli, Lorenzo0 tEcology letters.g2007 Dec., v. 10, no. 12 p.1124-1134dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01111.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071111b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02604naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245007900179300001600258520128600274650001601560650001001576650001601586650001601602650001701618650001801635650001201653650002501665650002701690650001501717653001701732653001501749653002301764653002201787653003001809700002001839700001701859700001901876773011801895852000902013856009202022930003302114946001102147655001202158IND4425783120221119202633.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442578312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2009.01112.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBIERZYCHUDEK, PAULETTE10aTesting the host-finding ability of a monophagous caterpillar in the field  ap. 632-637.  a1. Relatively few studies of the host-finding ability of specialised, phytophagous insects involve direct observations of individual insects moving among intact hosts and non-hosts. Information from such studies can inform the design of restoration programmes for species of conservation concern. 2. The movement of caterpillars of the threatened Oregon silverspot butterfly, Speyeria zerene hippolyta (Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) was studied in the field in cleared arenas with 10 cm radii. Caterpillars were placed in the centre, surrounded by three individuals of their host, Viola adunca, and three different non-host individuals, separated by bare ground. In a second experiment, second instars were placed between a host and a non-host, 3-6 cm away. Caterpillars were observed to determine if they walked to their host more often than expected by chance. 3. Caterpillars walked to vegetation significantly more often than expected by chance. They did not, however, reach their hosts more often than expected, based on plant availability. 4. It is concluded that S. z. hippolyta caterpillars can distinguish vegetation from bare ground from 10 cm away. There is no evidence that they can distinguish their host plant from other herbaceous species at distances of 3 cm. 3aNymphalidae 3aViola 3abutterflies 3ahost plants 3ahost seeking 3ainsect larvae 3ainstars 3aphytophagous insects 3aplant-insect relations 3avegetation 0aConservation 0aexperiment 0amovement behaviour 0areactive distance 0aSpeyeria zerene hippolyta1 aWARNER, KATY A.1 aMCHUGH, ANNE1 aThomas, Laura.0 tEcological entomology.g2009 Oct., v. 34, no. 5 p.632-637dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2009.01112.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03026naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245017200143300001600315500009300331520156100424650002401985650002502009650001802034650002002052650001202072650004602084650003302130650003502163650004002198650004702238650000902285650001202294650003102306650003202337700001602369700001502385700001602400773009802416852000902514930003302523945001302556946001102569655001202580IND2202540120221119202544.0000214e199907  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220254012DNAL7 a103973152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbert, E.10aDevelopment and prevalidation of two different ELISA systems for the potency testing of Clostridium perfringens beta- and epsilon-toxoid containing veterinary vaccines  ap. 299-311.  aIn the special issue: Clostridia and clostridioses / edited by H. Bohnel and F. Gessler.  aThe potency testing of Clostridium perfringens mono- and multicomponent veterinary vaccines is currently performed with the mouse neutralisation test (MNT) to estimate levels of C. perfringens beta- and epsilon-antitoxin levels in the sera of rabbits immunised with the vaccine. Two in vitro methods based on monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have been developed for the determination of specific antibodies against C. perfringens beta-toxin (capture ELISA) and epsilon-toxin (competitive ELISA) in these sera. Both test systems show high specificity and good reproducibility. These ELISA procedures were used in addition to the routine batch potency test in mice (MNT) to determine beta- and epsilon-antitoxin levels in 523 samples of rabbit serum. There was good agreement between the rank order of sera determined in vivo and the rank order determined in vitro. Linear regression analysis gave correlation coefficients of 0.88 for the capture ELISA and 0.41 for the competitive ELISA, with a significance level of P < 0.01 in both cases. Furthermore, a prevalidation study was carried out in four laboratories to evaluate the transferability of the ELISA procedures and the interlaboratory reproducibility of the results. Three coded serum samples were tested several times. The results indicated that both ELISA systems are suitable candidates to replace the MNT used for the potency testing of beta- and epsilon-toxoid in mono- and multicomponent veterinary vaccines. However, these assays still need to be validated in an international collaborative study. 3aveterinary medicine 3abacterial infections 3aanimal health 3aanimal diseases 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxbloodximmunology. 2aBacterial Toxinsximmunology 2aBacterial Vaccinesximmunology 2aClostridium perfringensximmunology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aMice 2aRabbits 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity1 aOppling, V.1 aWerner, E.1 aCussler, K.0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g1999 July, v. 24, no. 3 p.299-311x0928-82447nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02060naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009900168300001600267500002400283520099100307650001501298650001001313650001501323650001701338650001401355650001201369650001401381650001101395651001201406700002101418700002201439700002001461700002801481773008301509852000901592856008501601655001201686IND4418739120221119202714.0090403s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441873912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-009-0297-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠtambuk, Anamaria10aAssessment of genotoxicity in polluted freshwaters using caged painter's mussel, Unio pictorum  ap. 430-439.  aIncludes references  aThis study was undertaken to evaluate the applicability of caged painter's mussel, Unio pictorum for freshwater environmental genotoxicity assessment. Mussels in cages were exposed for 3 weeks in 2002-2004 to polluted sites in two large rivers in the Croatia, the Sava and Drava, and on the respective reference sites. DNA damage was assessed in haemocytes of the exposed mussels by the comet and micronucleus assays. Both assays provided good discriminative power between polluted and control sites and showed the same gradation of sites according to their genotoxic properties, with high concordance between investigated years. Background levels of the DNA damage in haemocytes of painter's mussels are defined for both assays for easier detection of contamination-related genotoxicity. U. pictorum is found to be a very suitable sentinel species, sufficiently sensitive to the impact of pollution but at the same time unsusceptible to stress caused by translocation or cage exposure. 3aDNA damage 3acages 3afreshwater 3agenotoxicity 3ahemocytes 3amussels 3apollution 3arivers 3aCroatia1 aPavlica, Mirjana1 aVignjević, Goran1 aBolarić, Bruna1 aKlobučar, Göran I.

Many cities worldwide are involved; they start to reconsider their current food supply system. This study will describe some developments in the Cologne-Bonn area, Germany, which have the potential to introduce new pathways for more sustainable food futures. Recent developments in urban food systems in the Cologne-Bonn region are very much “bottom-up”, driven by lively and committed actors (gardeners, farmers, civil society). In this paper potential synergies and conflicts in the emerging urban agriculture activities, focusing on producer-consumer relations and evolving co-productive approaches are discussed. We further try to understand motivations, aims and visions of the diverse participants of such models. By using qualitative methods of empirical social research such as narratives and semi-structured interviews primary data were collected in the case region. Until now there is no consensus in the literature about the optimal institutional set-ups for the permanent adoption of the various forms of urban agriculture. Preliminary governance analysis showed that especially institutionalized forms seem to be robust and sustainable. The further exploration of the cases will also contribute to understand the dynamics coming from the involvement of citizens in the agricultural production. Co-productive or participatory agriculture, which includes the consumer into the production process, has the potential to change the way of urban food supply. It is hypothesized that shared motivations and visions between producers and consumers in favor of a sustainable food system will help to stabilize alternative food systems whereas conflicts need to be anticipated to deepen the understanding of problems in the producer-consumer co-productive process. Our first results demonstrate that co-productive models of today are primarily based on idealism from both sides and also bear the potential of conflicts. It will be up to further research and innovation to address these issues and also check the new approaches on economic viability. 3acities 3aeconomic sustainability 3afarmers 3afood availability 3agardeners 3agovernance 3ainterviews 3amodels 3amotivation 3aqualitative analysis 3aurban agriculture 3aGermany1 aHirsch, D.1 aTerlau, W.1 aLorleberg, W0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Oct. 31, , no. 1215 p.421-426dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1215.76  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245026400127300001600391520168000407650001902087650001902106650001202125650001702137650001902154650001102173650002202184650001602206650002102222653002402243653001402267653002502281700001702306700001902323773006902342852000902411930003302420945001302453946001102466655001202477IND2051460120221119203026.0960529e199604  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205146012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrooks, R.J.14aThe population genetics of the self-incompatibility polymorphism in Papaver rhoeas. XI. The effects of limited pollen and seed dispersal, overlapping generations and variation in plant size on the variance of S-allele frequencies in populations at equilibrium  ap. 367-376.  aThe effects of limited pollen and seed dispersal, of overlap between generations and of variation in plant size on the steady-state variance of S-allele frequencies have been investigated in a simulated population of size 3840 containing 16 S-alleles whose initial frequencies were exactly equal. Simulations were run with each of the 16 possible combinations of these four factors to investigate their effects on the time for the population to reach steady state and on the average variance of S-allele frequencies in steady state. The time to steady state appeared to be relatively unaffected by any of the factors and was about 50 generations. However, the steady-state variance was markedly affected, with variation in plant size increasing this variance by an average of 228 per cent and overlapping generations decreasing the variance by an average of 30 per cent. The effects of limited pollen and seed dispersal were individually small, although their combined effect was to increase the steady-state variance by an average of 12 per cent. Limited seed and pollen dispersal, when combined with variation in plant size, caused the alleles to cluster. The four factors together caused a large increase in the average steady-state variance. Furthermore, even when a population is in steady state, the variance for a particular generation can be considerably greater than this average value. Consequently the frequencies of the S-alleles of a population in steady state can be very different. It is possible, therefore, that the large variation in S-allele frequencies found in samples taken from Papaver rhoeas populations is consistent with their being in steady state. 3aPapaver rhoeas 3agene frequency 3aalleles 3apolymorphism 3aseed dispersal 3apollen 3asimulation models 3apollination 3agenetic variance 0acomputer simulation 0adispersal 0aself incompatibility1 aTobias, A.M.1 aLawrence, M.J.0 tHeredity.g1996 Apr., v. 76, no. pt.4 p.367-376x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02315naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011900126300001600245500001500261520095700276650001801233650001401251650002401265650002501289650001401314650002301328650002401351650002801375650002201403650001501425650001301440650001401453651001701467651001401484653002501498653002401523653002201547653001001569653002301579653002301602653001401625700001701639700001701656773007001673852000901743930003301752945001301785946001101798655001201809IND2051835920221119202839.0960624e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205183592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroth, J.V.10aVirulence and isozyme diversity of sexual versus asexual collections of Uromyces appendiculatus (bean rust fungus)  ap. 234-242.  a2019-12-05  aOrganisms that reproduce sexually have been assumed to be more genetically diverse (have more phenotypes with a more even frequency distribution) than those that are clonal. Rust fungi usually have regular sexual reproduction, but asexual species or populations are not uncommon. Two field collections of the bean rust fungus from sexually reproducing populations were compared with two collections from apparently nonsexual populations. Neither virulence on 10 differential lines of beans nor isozyme band patterns of five enzymes, as compared by the Gleason, Shannon, or Rogers indices of difference or with simple matching coefficients, supported the hypothesis of less population polymorphism in the asexual collections. The distribution of virulence differences among isolates in one of the asexual collections suggested that sexual reproduction was occurring at a low frequency which was, nevertheless, sufficient to maintain genetic variability. 3arust diseases 3aphenotype 3aenzyme polymorphism 3aasexual reproduction 3avarieties 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3asexual reproduction 3aUromyces appendiculatus 3agenetic variation 3apopulation 3aisozymes 3avirulence 3aNorth Dakota 3aMinnesota 0aphenotypic diversity 0aasexual populations 0adiversity indexes 0alines 0adifferential lines 0asexual populations 0adiversity1 aMcCain, J.W.1 aRoelfs, A.P.0 tHeredity.g1995 Sept., v. 75, no. pt.3 p.234-242x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02247naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006200126300001600188500001500204520102100219650002201240650002001262650002501282650001401307650001801321650000801339650001901347650002301366650001901389650001001408650001301418653002601431653001101457653001401468653001801482653001301500653001601513653001201529653002701541653001801568653001501586700001601601773007001617852000901687930003301696945001301729946001101742655001201753IND2051836520221119203015.0960624e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205183652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimenez, G.10aLateral element lengths and nuclear disposition in Lolium  ap. 273-280.  a2019-12-05  aThe 50 per cent difference in nuclear DNA amount between Lolium perenne and L. temulentum translates into a 50 per cent difference in mean total lengths per cell of lateral elements at pachytene, indicating that the same proportion of the genome is incorporated into synaptonemal complexes in these two species. Quantitative comparisons were not able to show that the accommodation of the length differential between homoeologous lateral elements in the diploid F1 hybrid is accomplished either by an equal stretching of the shorter chromosomes or a contraction of the longer. Ph-like genes in one genotype of L. perenne appear to induce irregular associations of A and B chromosomes, whereas in their absence synapsis of A chromosomes is normal and the B chromosome usually segregates to the periphery of the nucleus during meiotic prophase. The differences in chromosome behaviour at this stage have remarkably little effect on bivalent and chiasma frequencies at metaphase I, and on the fertility of the organism. 3aLolium temulentum 3apachytene stage 3asynaptonemal complex 3achiasmata 3acrossing over 3aDNA 3aLolium perenne 3achromosome pairing 3anuclear genome 3agenes 3agenotype 0aaccessory chromosomes 0agenome 0abivalents 0aph-like genes 0asynapsis 0achromosomes 0ameiosis 0achromosome disposition 0aa chromosomes 0aunivalents1 aJenkins, G.0 tHeredity.g1995 Sept., v. 75, no. pt.3 p.273-280x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02777naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245013000155300001600285520132900301650002201630650001401652650002601666650001101692650001201703650001101715650001401726650002101740650001801761650001101779650001501790650001601805650002101821650002801842650002201870653001901892653004101911653001101952653001701963653002001980700001702000773008702017852000902104856007802113930003302191945001302224946001102237990002302248655001202271IND2048863420221119202930.0951120s1994    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204886342DNAL7 a10.1007/BF007496952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrehan, S.P.12aA rapid tissue testing methodology for optimum potassium fertilization of potato grown under subtropical short-day conditions  ap. 223-231.  aField experiments were conducted at the Central Potato Research Station, Jalandhar (Punjab) during 1989-90 and 1990-91 on a sandy loam soil (Typic Ustochrept) to develop a tissue testing methodology for determining the optimum dose of K to be applied as a side dressing at the time of earthing up, based on leaf tissue analysis. The sixteen treatments consisted of all combinations of four levels of K applied as basal at planting and as side dressing at the time of earthing-up (30 days after planting (DAP) in two potato cultivars, Kufri Jyoti and Kufri Chandramukhi. The combined application of basal and side dressed K was superior in increasing tuber yield of potato compared to their individual application. The concentration of K in leaf blade or petiole at the early stages (29-40 DAP) was more related to basal K than to basal+side dressed K, while at the later stages (40-60 DAP) it was more related to basal+side dressed K than to basal K. This suggests the need to apply both basal as well as side-dressed K to maintain a high K concentration in the leaf tissues throughout the crop growth cycle. A methodology to estimate the optimum dose of K to be side dressed from leaf tissue analysis is described. Critical K concentrations in leaf tissues at different growth stages are reported for both potato cultivars. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3acultivars 3apotassium fertilizers 3asowing 3ahilling 3aleaves 3apotassium 3anutrient content 3arapid methods 3atubers 3acrop yield 3acorrelation 3aapplication rate 3afertilizer requirements 3asplit application 0aplant analysis 0afertilizer requirement determination 0atiming 0asidedressing 0abasal dressings1 aGrewal, J.S.0 tFertilizer research.g1994, v. 38, no. 3 p.223-231wJournal:20227x0167-17317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF007496953Available from publisher's Web site  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03094naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245011100185300001800296520136800314650000801682650002701690650002001717650004301737650001801780650000901798650001801807650001201825650002601837650001501863650002901878650002301907650003301930650003901963650006402002650003202066650002702098650002202125650002602147651001002173651001002183653001802193700001602211700001102227700001302238700001302251773013102264852000902395856009202404930003302496946001102529655001202540IND4427005820221119202924.0091011e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442700582DNAL7 a194862152pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04364.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, J.10aSpecific and sensitive detection of Ralstonia solanacearum in soil with quantitative, real-time PCR assays  ap. 1729-1739.  aThe aim of this study was to develop a sensitive and an effective method suitable for large-scale detection and quantification of Ralstonia solanacearum in soil. Based on the specific sequence of R. solanacearum strain G1000, the primer pair R.sol1-R.sol2 and the TaqMan probe Rs-pro were designed, and specific and sensitive PCR detection methods were successfully established. The detection limit was 100 fg μl⁻¹ DNA in conventional PCR and 1·2 fg μl⁻¹ in real-time PCR. By combining real-time PCR with the modified protocols to extract DNA from soil, it was possible to achieve real-time detection of R. solanacearum in soil, and the degree of sensitivity was 100 fg μl⁻¹. To detect inhibition in soil samples, an exogenous internal positive control (IPC) was included preventing false negative results, and IPC was successfully amplified from all samples tested. The methodology developed was used to detect the presence of R. solanacearum in tobacco fields in China. The real-time PCR combined with the protocol to extract DNA from soil led to the development of a specific, sensitive and rapid detection method for R. solanacearum in soil. The real-time PCR improves the detection sensitivity and specificity and provides an important tool for routine detection of R. solanacearum in soil samples and for epidemiological and ecological studies. 3aDNA 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3adetection limit 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3atobacco 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA Probes 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aLimit of Detection 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRalstonia solanacearumxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTobaccoxmicrobiology 3aChina 0aChina 0areal-time PCR1 aWu-O, Jess.1 aLi, C.1 aXiao, C.1 aWang, G.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2009 Nov., v. 107, no. 5 p.1729-1739dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04364.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091012b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01955naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009600124300001800220520098800238650001301226650002201239650001301261650001801274650002801292650002001320650000701340650001601347650002001363650001501383700003101398700001801429700001501447773007601462852000901538939003301547946001301580655001201593IND9203921320221119203055.0920619e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920392132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarra, M.10aSome properties of a functional reconstituted plasmalemma H+-ATPase activated by fusicoccin  ap. 1029-1034.  aFusicoccin was shown to stimulate the ATP-driven, intravesicular acidification of liposomes reconstituted with crude fusicoccin receptors and the H+-translocating ATPase, both solubilized from maize (Zea mays L.) plasma membrane. The present paper reports optimal conditions for dual reconstitution and fusicoccin activation as well as the biochemical characterization of the effect of fusicoccin on this system. Fusicoccin stimulation of proton pumping was dependent on pH and fusicoccin concentration. Its specificity was demonstrated by the positive effect of two cotylenins that have a high affinity for fusicoccin receptors and by the negative response to 7,9-epideacetylfusicoccin, an inactive fusicoccin derivative. Kinetic measurements at different ATP concentrations showed that fusicoccin increases the Vmax of the enzyme. Fusicoccin stimulation of maize H+-ATPase was also maintained when receptors from maize were substituted by those from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.). 3aZea mays 3aSpinacia oleracea 3ahydrogen 3aion transport 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aenzyme activity 3apH 3aproton pump 3aplasma membrane 3afusicoccin1 aBallio, Alessandro,d1921-1 aFullone, M.R.1 aAducci, P.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Mar., v. 98, no. 3 p.1029-1034x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03657naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001400187245016800201300001600369506007600385520133300461536045601794592002802250506003702278650002202315650002602337650002102363650002302384650000902407650001902416650001402435650001102449650001002460650001002470650001602480650001102496650002002507650001702527650001102544650001702555650001002572653003502582653002602617653001702643653001702660653001702677700001802694700001502712700001802727700001502745700001502760700001902775700001402794700001602808773010602824856008002930852000903010655001203019IND60614995420221207132025.0181003e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061499542DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858135130402doi7 aPMC42254542pmcid7 a243349952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKipar, A.10aMycobacterium microti Tuberculosis in Its Maintenance Host, the Field Vole (Microtus agrestis)bCharacterization of the Disease and Possible Routes of Transmission  ap. 903-914.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe field vole (Microtus agrestis) is a known maintenance host of Mycobacterium microti. Previous studies have shown that infected animals develop tuberculosis. However, the disease is also known in cats and is sporadically reported from humans and other mammalian species. We examined trapped field voles from an endemic area, using a range of diagnostic approaches. These confirmed that a combination of gross and histological examination with culture is most appropriate to identify the true prevalence of the disease, which was shown to be more than 13% at times when older animals that have previously been shown to be more likely to develop the disease dominate the population. The thorough pathological examination of diseased animals showed that voles generally develop systemic disease with most frequent involvement of spleen and liver, followed by skin, lymph nodes, and lungs. The morphology of the lesions was consistent with active disease, and their distribution suggested skin wounds or oral and/or aerogenic infection as the main portal of entry. The demonstration of mycobacteria in open skin lesions, airways, and salivary glands indicated bacterial shedding from the skin and with sputum and saliva. This suggests not only the environment but also direct contact and devouring as likely sources of infection.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Wellcome Trust (075202/Z/04/Z) and was licensed under Home Office project license PPL40/1813.

Indeed, feeding on these substrates, BSF is capable of transforming them into valuable fat, proteins, and chitin. The present study is aimed at evaluating different approaches to the killing of the prepupae in order to assess which is associated with the lowest production of artefacts, notably free fatty acids. Folch extraction method, via an Ultra-Turrax homogeniser, was selected to isolate and analyse prepupal fat. The same method was also applied for a direct grinding method to kill black soldier fly prepupae. The integrity of fat originated from this direct grinding approach to the killing was compared in terms of fatty acid profile with the samples obtained with two other killing procedures, i.e. freezing and blanching. Direct grinding proved to be a better preservative of fat integrity in terms of lowest amount of free fatty acids (about 2.5%) in comparison with freezing (about 15%), but also with blanching (about 10%). Furthermore, the direct grinding is a killing strategy that reduces energetic demand and process time and helps lower analytical costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHermetia illucens 3ablanching 3achitin 3afatty acid composition 3afree fatty acids 3afreezing 3agrinding 3aprepupae 3aprocessing time 3aproteins 3awastes 0ainsects 0aprocess performance 0ayield 0akilling procedure 0aartefacts1 aZanasi, L.1 aMasino, F.1 aMaistrello, L.1 aAntonelli, A.0 tJournal of insects as food and feed.g2020 Apr. 8, v. 6, no. 2 p.121-131dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:27298x2352-45887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3920/JIFF2019.00023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245020000156300002000356520159300376592002801969650001501997650002402012650001102036650002102047650001102068650001402079650001502093650002802108650001102136700001902147700001702166700001602183700001602199700001802215700001602233700002102249700001402270700001702284700001102301700001302312700001402325700001602339700002302355700001602378773014402394856007502538852000902613655001202622IND60759929620221122004326.0211216e20211214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075992962DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta09264b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Wenxi10aFunctional integration of hierarchical core–shell architectures via vertically arrayed ultrathin CuSe nanosheets decorated on hollow CuS microcages targeting highly effective sodium-ion storage  ap. 27615-27628.  aFunctional integration of metal sulfide@selenide hetero-architectures could give significant superiority on improving sluggish kinetics and optimizing electronic structures. However, the thorough exploration of these architectures for electrochemical features and construction strategies has not attracted sufficient attention so far. Herein, hollow CuS microcubes decorated by using vertically arrayed ultrathin CuSe nanosheets (CuS@CuSe) were synthesized successfully based on a template-directed asynchronous sulfidation/selenization method at room temperature. Driven by all-around achievement in aspects of unique structural engineering and morphological features, CuS@CuSe microcubes enable abundant active storage sites, large volume evolution accommodation space, and short ion diffusion channels, thus resulting in high sodiation capacity, remarkable rate capability and exceptional cycling lifespan with an admirable capacity of 303.1 mA h g⁻¹ at 20.0 A g⁻¹ when galvanically de-/sodiated to the 1500th cycle, superior to its counterparts of single CuS and CuSe, as well as most reported CuS-/CuSe-based anodes when tested as an anode for sodium ion batteries. The in situ XRD and ex situ TEM characterization experiments demonstrate a multiple electronic phase-evolution mechanism involved in the interaction and conversion of the CuS@CuSe electrode. The DFT calculations reval that the excellent performance of CuS@CuSe microcubes stemmed from adequate hetero-interfaces which afford a low Na⁺ adsorption energy and migration energy barrier for ion transport kinetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3aanodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3alongevity 3ananosheets 3aphysiological transport 3asodium1 aWang, Xiaodeng1 aMa, Xiaoqing1 aYue, Luchao1 aRen, Yuchun1 aLi, Tingshuai1 aXia, Jihong1 aZhang, Longcheng1 aLiu, Qian1 aLuo, Yonglan1 aLi, Na1 aTang, Bo1 aLiu, Yang1 aGao, Shuyan1 aAsiri, Abdullah M.1 aSun, Xuping0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 Dec. 14, v. 9, no. 48 p.27615-27628dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta09264b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245008800169300001600257520096000273592002801233650002101261650001601282650001901298650002101317650002201338650001701360650001301377650002101390650001301411650001101424650002501435650001001460653003501470653001901505653002101524653002201545653001501567653002101582653001401603653001901617700002101636700002001657700001801677700002001695700002001715773010601735856008001841852000901921655001201930IND60622260120221120185310.0181124e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062226012DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836070805232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, Rochelle10aBlue intensity in Pinus sylvestris tree-rings: developing a new palaeoclimate proxy  ap. 821-828.  aMinimum blue intensity measurements of resin-extracted Pinus sylvestris (L.) samples, conducted using a flat-bed scanner and commercially available software, are shown to provide a robust and reliable surrogate for maximum latewood density. Blue intensity data from 15 trees, from three stands, are reported relative to a standard blue-scale in a manner similar to grey-scale calibration in x-ray densitometry. The resulting time series are highly correlated with x-ray densitometry data generated from the same samples and preserve the same high level of signal strength. Sensitivity to summer climate variables is similar to that identified in the relative density record, demonstrating that minimum blue intensity can also be used for the study of climate change. While not a replacement for the powerful range of x-ray densitometry techniques, blue intensity provides an inexpensive and accessible alternative for accessing palaeoclimatic information.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aX-radiation 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acomputer software 3adensitometry 3alatewood 3apaleoclimatology 3ascanners 3asummer 3atime series analysis 3atrees 0aReflected light image analysis 0ablue intensity 0adendrochronology 0adendroclimatology 0aScots pine 0arelative density 0atree line 0apalaeoclimate.1 aMcCarroll, Danny1 aLoader, Neil J.1 aGrudd, Håkan1 aRobertson, Iain1 aJalkanen, Risto0 tHolocene.g2007 Sept., v. 17, no. 6 p.821-828dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836070805233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245014100153300001600294520136500310592002801675650001701703650002901720650001201749650001401761650002601775650001801801650001101819650001401830650001601844650001801860650001501878650002101893650001301914651001001927653002201937653002001959653001601979653001501995653002602010700001502036700001602051700001202067700001802079700001702097700001502114700001302129700001902142700001202161773011902173856007102292852000902363655001202372IND60687247920221119165203.0200330s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068724792DNAL7 a10.1071/MF190302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDou, Zhiguo10aHyperspectral inversion of Suaeda salsa biomass under different types of human activity in Liaohe Estuary wetland in north-eastern China  ap. 482-492.  aHuman activities alter the growth of coastal wetland vegetation. In the present study, we used a spectrometer and hyperspectral data to determine and compare the biomass of Suaeda salsa in a coastal wetland under protective and destructive activities. Using typical discriminants, the hyperspectral data of Suaeda salsa were distinguished under the influence of two kinds of human activity, and the accuracy of the inversion model of biomass was established following improved differentiation of the data under the influence of human activities. The original spectral reflectance and vegetation index were selected, and the biomass-inversion model was established by linear regression and partial least-squares regression. The model established by partial least-squares regression had a good precision (R2>0.85, RMSE%<5.6%). Hyperspectral technology can accurately show plant biomass and the indirect effects of interference by human activities of different intensity on coastal wetlands. The accuracy of the models can be improved by distinguishing the vegetation patterns under the influence of different types of human activity, and then constructing the biomass models. This study provides technical support for the use of quantitative remote sensing-based methods to monitor the fragile ecology of coastal wetlands under the influence of human activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuaeda salsa 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecology 3aestuaries 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aphytomass 3areflectance 3aspectrometers 3avegetation 3avegetation index 3awetlands 3aChina 0abiomass inversion 0acoastal wetland 0adestructive 0aprotective 0apartial least-squares1 aLi, Youzhi1 aCui, Lijuan1 aPan, Xu1 aMa, Qiongfang1 aHuang, Yilan1 aLei, Yinru1 aLi, Jing1 aZhao, Xinsheng1 aLi, Wei0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2020, v. 71, no. 4 p.482-492dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957320x1323-16507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF190303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245012600168300002000294520173700314592002802051650001402079650001902093650001302112650002202125650001602147650001302163650001602176650001302192650001902205650001302224650001602237650001502253653003602268653002102304653002602325653001602351653001602367700001702383700005702400700005602457773014202513856007802655852000902733655001202742IND60654261320221119152037.0190724e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065426132DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b063382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondalkar, Vijay V.10aNanohybrids of Pt-Functionalized Al₂O₃/ZnO Core–Shell Nanorods for High-Performance MEMS-Based Acetylene Gas Sensor  ap. 25891-25900.  aMetal oxide nanostructures are the most promising materials for the fabrication of advanced gas sensors. However, the main challenge of these gas sensors is humidity interference and issues related to the selectivity and high operating temperature, which limits their response in real-time applications. In this study, we proposed nanohybrids of Pt-functionalized Al₂O₃/ZnOcore–shell nanorods (NRs) for a real-time humidity-independent acetylene gas sensor. The core ZnO NRs have been fabricated on microelectromechanical system (MEMS) microheater, followed by a coating of a thin nanoscale moisture-blocking conformal Al₂O₃ shell by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and decoration of Pt NPs using photochemical deposition and e-beam evaporation. Prior to the fabrication, a COMSOL simulation was performed to optimize the microheater design and moisture-blocking layer thickness. A comparative study of the decoration of Pt NPs on the ZnO surface by photochemical (s-Pt/ZnO) and e-beam evaporation (e-Pt/ZnO) and a Al₂O₃ thin moisture-blocking shell layer (Pt/Al₂O₃/ZnO) in sensor response has been conducted. The fabricated sensors (s-Pt/ZnO) and (e-Pt/ZnO) showed a high response ΔR/R (%) of 96.46% and 68.15% to 200 ppm acetylene at 120 °C and detect trace concentrations of acetylene down to 1 ppm, but the response is influenced by humidity. Moreover, the sensor (Pt/Al₂O₃/ZnO) exhibited nearly the same sensing characteristics and high acetylene selectivity despite the wide range of humidity variation from 20% RH to 70% RH. The Pt-functionalized Al₂O₃/ZnOcore–shell NR-based sensor showed better sensing and stable performance than other sensors (s-Pt/ZnO and e-Pt/ZnO) under humidity conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3aaluminum oxide 3acoatings 3acomparative study 3aevaporation 3ahumidity 3ananohybrids 3ananorods 3aphotochemistry 3aplatinum 3atemperature 3azinc oxide 0aacetylene gas sensor; Al2O3/ZnO 0aPt nanoparticles 0ahumidity interference 0amicroheater 0aselectivity1 aDuy, Le Thai1 aSeo, Hyungtak1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9485-64051 aLee, Keekeun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9472-02090 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 July 01, v. 11, no. 29 p.25891-25900dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b063383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245008800155300002000243520097900263592002801242650001201270650001601282650001101298650001901309650002101328650002101349650001101370650002601381650001501407650001401422650001901436650001901455650001901474650001901493650000901512650002001521650002001541700001801561700001601579700001801595700001301613700001401626773014401640856007501784852000901859655001201868IND60759929720221122004314.0211216e20211214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075992972DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta09498j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jing12aA molten-salt electrochemical biorefinery for carbon-neutral utilization of biomass  ap. 27442-27447.  aSolar-driven photosynthesis to produce biomass and photocatalysis to reduce carbon dioxide are both carbon sinks. Efficient harvesting of high-performance photocatalysts from photosynthesis-derived biomass is hence promising to reduce the carbon footprint. Herein, a molten-salt electrochemical biorefinery that converts rice husks and silver chloride to silicon-carbide nanowires embedded in a carbon matrix with surface-loaded silver nanoparticles (SiC/C/Ag) is reported as a showcase of carbon-neutral utilization of biomass. The molten-salt electrochemical biorefinery features reduced CO₂ emissions, low energy consumption, and compositional/structural refining of cathodic SiC/C/Ag. The resulting SiC/C/Ag shows noticeably enhanced overall CO₂ photoreduction. Life cycle assessment (LCA) shows that the CO₂ equivalent emission from the production of SiC/C/Ag is compensated for by photocatalytic reduction of gaseous CO₂ for only 24.77 hours over the SiC/C/Ag.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon footprint 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3alife cycle assessment 3ananosilver 3ananowires 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotoreduction 3aphotosynthesis 3arice 3asilicon carbide 3asilver chloride1 aXiao, Juanxiu1 aShen, Yijun1 aLiang, Xinxin1 aLv, Teng1 aXiao, Wei0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 Dec. 14, v. 9, no. 48 p.27442-27447dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta09498j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03654naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010600167300001600273506010400289506007600393520165200469592002802121506003702149650002002186650001502206650001202221650001702233650001602250650001902266650001502285650001002300650002202310650001802332650001102350650002002361650001402381650001502395650002102410650001902431653001602450653001502466653001102481653002802492653001902520653000902539653000802548653000702556653000802563653000702571653000802578653000802586653001202594700001602606700001602622700001702638700001902655700004102674700001602715700001902731773012402750856008502874852000902959655001202968IND60749377620221207123913.0220929e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074937762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2021.08.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Chan-Ju10aOverexpression of IbLfp in sweetpotato enhances the low-temperature storage ability of tuberous roots  ap. 577-585.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas [L.] Lam) is a prospective food crop that ensures food and nutrition security under the dynamic changes in global climate. Peroxidase (POD) is a multifunctional enzyme involved in diverse plant physiological processes, including stress tolerance and cell wall lignification. Although various POD genes were cloned and functionally characterized in sweetpotato, the role of POD in lignification and low-temperature storage ability of sweetpotato tuberous roots is yet to be investigated. In this study, we isolated the cold-induced lignin forming peroxidase (IbLfp) gene of sweetpotato, and analyzed its physiological functions. IbLfp showed more predominant expression in fibrous roots than in other tissues. Moreover, IbLfp expression was up-regulated in leaves and roots under cold stress, and was altered by other abiotic stresses. Tuberous roots of transgenic sweetpotato lines overexpressing IbLfp (LP lines) showed improved tolerance to low temperature, with lower malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide contents than non-transgenic sweetpotato plants under cold stress. The enhanced cold tolerance of LP lines could be attributed to the increased basal activity of POD, which is involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. Moreover, greater accumulation of lignin could also contribute to the enhanced cold tolerance of LP lines, as lignin acts as a protective barrier against invading pathogens, which is a secondary symptom of chilling injury in sweetpotato. Overall, the results of this study enhance our understanding of the function of POD in low-temperature storage of sweetpotato tuberous roots.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aIpomoea batatas 3acell walls 3aclimate 3acold storage 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3afood crops 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alignification 3alignin 3amalondialdehyde 3anutrition 3aperoxidase 3astress tolerance 3asweet potatoes 0aSweetpotato 0aPeroxidase 0aLignin 0aLow-temperature storage 0aTuberous roots 0aAcBr 0aLfp 0aLP 0aMDA 0aNT 0aPEG 0aPOD 0aqRT-PCR1 aPark, Sul-U1 aKim, So-Eun1 aLim, Ye-Hoon1 aJi, Chang Yoon1 aKim, Yun-Heec(Marketing researcher)1 aKim, Ho Soo1 aKwak, Sang-Soo0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2021 Oct., v. 167 p.577-585dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2021.08.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245016400202520206900366592002802435650001402463650001202477650001402489650001302503650001402516650000902530650002202539650001402561650000902575650001602584650002602600650001902626650001602645650001402661650001302675650001402688650002002702653002102722653002102743653001302764653002102777700002902798700001502827700002202842773011202864856008502976852000903061655001203070IND60743825920221122024402.0210904e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074382592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1195532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4135-896810aIntegration of oxalic acid chelation and Fenton process for synergistic relaxation-oxidation of persistent gel-like fouling of ceramic nanofiltration membranes  aCeramic nanofiltration (NF) is a newly-developed technology for water recycling, but is still limited to pilot-scale applications. Lacking efficient and eco-friendly strategies for cleaning ceramic NF membrane impedes its scaling-up in industries. Forward flush, backwash and acidic/caustic cleaning are not efficient enough. In this work, a novel oxalic acid-aided Fenton process was proposed for synergistic relaxation/oxidation of persistent Ca²⁺-mediated gel-like fouling of ceramic NF membrane. A reactive catalyst layer was online pre-coated on top of the membrane via a pressure-driven cross-flow pre-filtration of Fe₃O₄ hydrosols. The gel-like fouling was simulated by alginate in the presence of Ca²⁺ ions. Results show that the Fe₃O₄ loading could be readily tuned from 0.16 to 1.34 g m⁻² by altering the permeate flux during the pre-coating. The membrane permeability loss due to the pre-coating was minimal (<10%). The combination of oxalic acid chelation and Fenton-based oxidation resulted in high flux recovery (85.07%) for the iron-oxide pre-coated membrane, whereas the single treatment by hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) or oxalic acid was inefficient. This synergistic effect was attributed to relaxation of the Ca²⁺-mediated gel layer via oxalic acid/Ca²⁺ chelation, which presumably facilitated H₂O₂ diffusion at the Fe₃O₄/foulant interface. The iron-oxide pre-coated membrane maintained stable initial normalized fluxes (83.33–90.15%) through the oxalic acid/H₂O₂ cleaning over five cycles, with no need of refreshing the iron-oxide pre-coat. Additionally, the leaching of iron from the iron-oxide pre-coat by oxalic acid was suppressed by the oxalic acid/H₂O₂ combination, owing to a reactive shielding by competitive sorption of H₂O₂ onto the Fe₃O₄ surface. Overall, the synergistic relaxation/oxidation method, demonstrated in this study, provides new insights into improving reactivity of Fenton-based processes on hybrid catalytic ceramic membranes for water treatment or fouling control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3acalcium 3acatalysts 3aceramics 3achelation 3agels 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrosols 3airon 3airon oxides 3amembrane permeability 3ananofiltration 3aoxalic acid 3aoxidation 3asorption 3asynergism 3awater treatment 0aCeramic membrane 0aMembrane fouling 0aCleaning 0aFenton oxidation1 aHeijman, Sebastiaan G.J.1 aShang, Ran1 aRietveld, Luuk C.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 636 p.119553-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1195533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001100148245008300159300001600242520140200258592002801660650001801688650002001706650002301726650001501749650001001764650001801774650001301792650002101805650001501826650001201841650002501853650001801878650001601896653003301912653002201945653003301967653001202000700001802012700002102030700001902051700002002070700001902090700001502109700001502124700001602139700005702155773011202212856008202324852000902406655001202415IND60694083620221120213213.0200509e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069408362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.08.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Li10aEnhanced electrochemical voltammetric fingerprints for plant taxonomic sensing  ap. 102-107.  aGraphene-embedded plant tissues show a high sensitivity to electrochemical signals, which enables a screen-printed electrode to be used for electrochemical fingerprint recording. The electrochemical fingerprints obtained under different conditions can be transformed into multidimensional recognition modes for plant identification. These electrochemical fingerprints reflect the types and quantities of the electrochemically active substances in plant tissues such that the fingerprints can be used for chemotaxonomic investigations. In this paper, five species of Lycoris bulbs, including L. chinensis, L. radiate, L. aurea, L. sprengeri and L. straminea, were successfully recognized by electrochemical fingerprinting. The species's interspecific relationships were also investigated. L. chinensis and L. aurea show highly similar morphology but have a relatively distant relationship. Hybridized L. radiata shows a notably close relationship with L. straminea, suggesting that one of its parents may be L. radiata. In addition, L. chinensis also shows a close relationship with L. straminea, suggesting that the L. straminea may be produced by cross-breeding L. chinensis and L. radiate. The results mentioned above indicate that the proposed electro-chemotaxonomic methodology is an inexpensive and quick taxonomic method that can provide additional evidence for the existing taxonomy system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLycoris aurea 3aLycoris radiata 3aactive ingredients 3abiosensors 3abulbs 3achemotaxonomy 3acrossing 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aparents 3aplant identification 3aplant tissues 3avoltammetry 0aElectrochemical fingerprints 0aTaxonomic sensing 0aSolid state electrochemistry 0aLycoris1 aZheng, Yuhong1 aZhang, Pengchong1 aZhang, Haoyang1 aZhuang, Weibing1 aZhang, Huaiwei1 aWang, Aiwu1 aSu, Weitao1 aYu, Jinhong1 aLin, Cheng-Te1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7090-96100 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 120 p.102-107dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.08.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245013700159300001600296520175900312592002802071650001502099650001202114650001802126650002302144650001902167650001302186650001002199650001602209650000902225650001702234650002002251650002402271650001602295650001202311653002202323653002102345653001802366700001802384700001602402700001602418773014102434856007702575852000902652655001202661IND60688043620221122062419.0200407e20200408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068804362DNAL7 a10.3920/JIFF2019.00242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiiru, S.M.10aPartial substitution of soy protein isolates with cricket flour during extrusion affects firmness and in vitro protein digestibility  ap. 169-177.  aThe rapid increase in global population and the unsustainable conventional meat production have created demand for alternative animal-derived protein.

Currently, edible insects are researched as a potential alternative source of proteins and a valuable ingredient in development of meat analogues. High moisture extrusion was applied to a mixture of soy protein isolate (SPI) and full or low-fat cricket flour (CF) and the impact of cricket inclusion levels as well as extruder barrel temperature on the firmness and in vitro protein digestibility was evaluated. The SPI flour was substituted at 0 (control), 15, 30 and 45% and extruded on a laboratory co-rotating twin-screw extruder with a throughput of 1 kg/h at 150 rpm screw speed. Cooking temperature was varied at 120, 140 and 160 °C and water flowrate set to 10 ml/min. Texture as evaluated on all the treatments by texture profile analysis while the in vitro crude protein digestibility (CPD) was done on raw flours and extrudates with 15 and 45% CF inclusion and at 120 and 160 °C. The extrusion temperature had a negative correlation (r=-0.49) with the CPD but the CF inclusion had a correlation; r=0.71 (120 °C) and -0.28 (160 °C). The highest CPD (50%) was recorded from 45% full-fat CF extruded blend at 120 °C. Firmness was positively influenced (r=0.56) by temperature but negatively influenced (r≈-0.57) by CF inclusions at selected temperatures. Overall the low-fat CF blends had lower firmness values compared to their full-fat counterparts and control samples. The findings from this research demonstrated to be relevant for processing of high-protein and insect-based meat alternatives for food dependencies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthoptera 3acooking 3acrude protein 3adigestible protein 3aedible insects 3afirmness 3aflour 3aingredients 3ameat 3ameat analogs 3ameat production 3asoy protein isolate 3atemperature 3atexture 0aAcheta domesticus 0afull and low-fat 0ameat analogue1 aKinyuru, J.N.1 aKiage, B.N.1 aMarel, A.K.0 tJournal of insects as food and feed.g2020 Apr. 8, v. 6, no. 2 p.169-177dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:27298x2352-45887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3920/JIFF2019.00243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02021naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245012500160300001800285520079400303592002801097650001101125650001901136650000901155650001101164650001001175650002301185651001001208653001901218653001001237653002901247653001301276653002601289700001601315700001801331700001901349700001601368700001901384773010701403856008001510852000901590655001201599IND60622260420221120185306.0181124e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062226042DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836070805302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Hui12aA record of Holocene climate change in the Guanzhong Basin, China, based on optical dating of a loess-palaeosol sequence  ap. 1015-1022.  aOptical dating was used to obtain a chronology for a loess-palaeosol sequence in the Guanzhong Basin on the Loess Plateau in China. The sedimentary sequence recorded two dry episodes (3.7~2.4 ka and 1.2~0.8 ka ago) in the Holocene as shown by the presence of two layers of loess within the Holocene deposits. These two arid events are consistent with records of global climate change in the Holocene and also coincident with major historic events in China. This finding suggests that loess-paleosol sequences in China can record global climate changes and implies that rapid climate change affected the progress of human civilization. In addition, changes in the sedimentation rate through the section suggest that agricultural expansion may have accelerated the rate of dust accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate change 3adust 3ahumans 3aloess 3asedimentation rate 3aChina 0aOptical dating 0aChina 0aloess-palaeosol sequence 0aHolocene 0arapid climate change.1 aChen, Fa-Hu1 aLi, Shenghua,1 aWintle, Ann G.1 aFan, Yu-Xin1 aXia, Dun-Sheng0 tHolocene.g2007 Nov., v. 17, no. 7 p.1015-1022dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836070805303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245010400181520160800285592002801893650002801921650002501949650003201974650001102006650002602017650002202043650001702065650002202082653004002104653004102144653002502185653003302210653002102243700002302264773011302287856008602400852000902486655001202495IND60701034220221121125256.0210212e20201020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070103422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1222012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNematollahi, Mohammadreza10aPast, present, and prospective themes of sustainable agricultural supply chains: A content analysis  aSustainable supply chain management has been a topic of high interest to scholars and practitioners over the last 30 years. Accordingly, many review papers have been published on this topic with various areas of focus. Nevertheless, the overall body of literature still lacks a systematic review that thoroughly explores sustainability-driven decisions in the agriculture sector. To fill this research gap, the present paper presents an extensive review of 247 quantitative studies on sustainable agricultural supply chains. Our review scope includes both crop-based and livestock sectors that are monitored by eco-social corporate initiatives or government sustainability-driven legislation. To do so, we employ a content analysis-based review method, which is well known as an effective means of conducting literature reviews in a transparent, systematic, and rule-governed way, to rigorously collect, filter, and classify the existing research context. We classify the collected materials based on different structural dimensions and related analytic categories, which are obtained from both deductive and inductive categorization techniques. More specifically, we thoroughly evaluate the review results from four research perspectives – agricultural planning, supply chain management, sustainability development, and modeling methodology – aiming at presenting an overview of quantitative research projects. We conclude this study with a detailed discussion on evolving and promising research streams along with future research directions, which could be used as a roadmap by future researchers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural management 3alaws and regulations 3alivestock and meat industry 3amodels 3aquantitative analysis 3aresearch projects 3asupply chain 3asystematic review 0aSustainable supply chain management 0aAgricultural supply chain management 0aQuantitative methods 0aSystematic literature review 0aContent analysis1 aTajbakhsh, Alireza0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Oct. 20, v. 271 p.122201-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1222013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03534naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245017300167300001800340520187400358592002802232650002102260650001502281650002002296650003102316650001102347650002802358650001702386650002102403650001802424650002402442650001102466650001302477650002402490650002102514650001402535650001602549650002102565650002902586650002302615650001802638650001102656650002002667650001102687700001302698700001802711700001602729700001702745700001802762773010602780856008502886852000902971655001202980IND4484413420221117234119.0150810e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448441342DNAL7 a10.1016/S1671-2927(11)60139-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJIANG, Dan-li10aRaising on Water Stocking Density Reduces Geese Reproductive Performances via Water Bacteria and Lipopolysaccharide Contaminations in “Geese-Fish” Production System  ap. 1459-1466.  aThis study was carried out to unravel the mechanism of reductions in production performances in high stocking density geese flocks during summer months in “geese-fish” production system. Experiment 1 observed the water bacterial growth, lipopolysaccharde concentrations in water and geese blood, and geese reproductive performances from summer to winter, in two flocks with varying on water stocking densities. Results showed that counts of total bacteria, Escherichia coli and Salmonella in water, as well as water and geese plasma LPS concentrations, exhibited a tendency decreasing from the highest levels in summer, to intermediate levels in autumn, and to the lowest values in winter. Such seasonal decreases in bacteria and LPS concentrations were associated with similar seasonal decreases in embryo mortality during incubation. In addition, embryos dead or showing development retardation by day 25 of incubation contained copious LPS in allantoic fluid, in contrast to the negligible amount in normal developing embryos. Raising on water stocking density elevated bacteria counts, LPS concentrations in water and geese plasma, and decreased egg fertility but increased embryo mortality during incubation. In experiment 2, exogenous LPS treatment to the geese depressed egg laying, reduced egg hatchability, caused sickness behavior in the goslings hatched. In experiment 3, exogenous LPS directly administered to day 8 and 18 embryos during incubation dose dependently increased mortality and decreased hatchability, and caused sickness behavior in the goslings hatched. It is concluded that the raising on water geese stocking density stimulates pathogenic bacteria growth in water, which via LPS contamination impaires embryo development in incubation and therefore reduces geese reproductive performance and gosling quality during the hot summer months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella 3aallantoic fluid 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aautumn 3abacterial contamination 3ablood plasma 3aegg hatchability 3aembryogenesis 3aembryonic mortality 3aflocks 3agoslings 3alipopolysaccharides 3amicrobial growth 3amortality 3aoviposition 3apoultry diseases 3areproductive performance 3aseasonal variation 3astocking rate 3asummer 3awater pollution 3awinter1 aLiu, Li,1 aWANG, Cong-li1 aChen, Fang,1 aSUN, Ai-dong1 aSHI, Zhen-dan0 tAgricultural sciences in China.g2011 Sept., v. 10, no. 9 p.1459-1466dElsevier B.V.x1671-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1671-2927(11)60139-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245008200182300001600264520167500280592002801955650002601983650001802009650001802027650002102045650001902066650001802085650004302103650000902146650003802155650003002193650001202223650003002235650004002265650006202305650005002367650002702417650003002444650002202474650000902496650004702505650000902552650001702561700001902578700001702597700001702614700001902631700001602650700001802666700001902684700002002703700001902723773011402742856008102856990002302937852000902960655001202969IND60093644420221116232422.0141103e20120205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009364442DNAL7 a222449872pmid7 a10.1016/j.cbi.2011.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Soo Jin10aHepatic expression of cytochrome P450 in type 2 diabetic Goto–Kakizaki rats  ap. 173-179.  aAlthough hepatic expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) changes markedly in diabetes, the role of ketone bodies in the regulation of CYP in diabetes is controversial. The present study was performed to determine the expression and activity of CYP in non-obese type II diabetic Goto–Kakizaki (GK) rats with normal levels of ketone bodies. In the present study, basal serum glucose levels increased 1.95-fold in GK rats, but acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate levels were not significantly different. Hepatic expression of CYP reductase and CYP3A2 was up-regulated in the GK rats, and consequently, activities of CYP reductase and midazolam 4-hydroxylase, mainly catalyzed by CYP3A2, increased. In contrast, hepatic expression of CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 was down-regulated and the activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and 7-methoxyresorufin-O-demethylase, mainly catalyzed by CYP1A, also decreased in GK rats. Hepatic levels of microsomal protein and total CYP and hepatic expression of cytochrome b₅, CYP1B1, CYP2B1 and CYP2C11 were not significantly different between the GK rats and normal Wistar rats. Moreover, the expression and activity of CYP2E1, reported to be up-regulated in diabetes with hyperketonemia, were not significantly different between GK rats and control rats, suggesting that elevation of ketone bodies plays a critical role in the up-regulation of hepatic CYP2E1 in diabetic rats. Our results showed that the expression of hepatic CYP is regulated in an isoform-specific manner. The present results also show that the GK rat is a useful animal model for the pathophysiological study of non-obese type II diabetes with normal ketone body levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aanimal models 3ablood glucose 3acytochrome P-450 3ahyperketonemia 3aketone bodies 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3arats 2a3-Hydroxybutyric Acidxmetabolism 2aAcetoacetatesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP1A1xmetabolism 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxenzymology. 2aIsoenzymesxmetabolism 2aKetone Bodiesxmetabolism 2aLiverxenzymology 2aMale 2aMicrosomes, Liverxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar1 aChoi, Jong Min1 aYun, Kang Uk1 aOh, Jung Min1 aKwak, Hui Chan1 aOh, Jin-Gyo1 aLee, Kye Sook1 aKim, Bong Hee,1 aHŏ, Tʻae-hoe,1 aKim, Sang Kyum0 tChemico-biological interactions.g2012 Feb. 5, v. 195, no. 3 p.173-179dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-27977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2011.12.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015600168520131900324592002801643650001401671650001501685650002601700650001101726650001701737650001901754650001301773653002301786653002601809653002501835653002401860653002601884700001901910700005301929700001701982773011201999856008502111852000902196655001202205IND60743826420221123022557.0210904e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074382642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1195582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Guixue10aMicropore formation and crystalline evolution during biaxial stretching process of iPP film constructed of ordered and continuous β-transcrystallinity  aSince biaxial stretched polypropylene (PP) microporous membrane was increasingly popular and crucial in scientific research and industrial production, the problems of less porosity and uneven micropore distribution urgently awaited solution. To further explore these issues, two kinds of iPP films, one constructed of continuous and ordered β transcrystallinity and the other constructed of β spherulite, were introduced into synchronous biaxial stretching process in this work. The experiments demonstrated that the direction of β lamellae arrangement along the force field played a key role in the micropore formation and crystalline evolution. As a result, the lamellae in β transcrystallinity were easier to be separated to form micropores and the crystalline transformation process was steadier, hence contributing to the higher porosity, less stems and much more uniform distribution. In practice, the microporous membrane stretched from the β transcrystallinity film achieved considerable enhancement in separation performance as well as the permeation property. Furthermore, an interpretation model concerning the relevance between the initial lamellae arrangement and microporous membrane property was proposed, providing fresh insights on how to produce microporous membrane with better performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevolution 3amicropores 3amicroporous membranes 3amodels 3apermeability 3apolypropylenes 3aporosity 0aBiaxial stretching 0aβ-transcrystallinity 0aMicroporous membrane 0aMicropore formation 0aCrystalline evolution1 aFang, Wenxiang1 aLi, Jiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5159-23201 aGuo, Shaoyun0 tJournal of membrane science.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 636 p.119558-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1195583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011500167300001400282520114600296592002801442650001301470650002601483650002001509650001601529650001501545650001801560650002201578650001801600653001801618653001701636653002801653653002401681653002201705700001801727700005601745773009801801856008601899852000901985655001201994IND60538040420221120121649.0190412e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053804042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zheng10aDetermining β-diversity of protozoa for bioassessment in coastal ecosystems using community-based dispersions  ap. 47-52.  aThe β-diversity of protozoan communities is a useful bioindicator of environmental heterogeneity and water quality status in global change research. As a broad β-diversity measure, multivariate dispersions are subject to influence from the relative weight placed on changes in composition versus abundance. To identify a feasible numeral resolution for determining β-diversity of protozoa using community-based dispersions, a dataset of the protozoan communities was studied. Results showed that although species composition was the primary contributor to the multivariate dispersions, the community-based dispersions showed a significant linear relationship to the Whittaker’s β-diversity index. However, the data transformations on species-abundance data represented clear influences on outputs of community-based dispersion measures: heavy (e.g., fourth root or log) transforms were more feasible than slight ones. Based on the results, we suggest that the community-based multivariate dispersions with heavy data transforms may be used to summarize the β-diversity of protozoan communities for bioassessment in coastal ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3abiological assessment 3adata collection 3adispersions 3aecosystems 3aglobal change 3aspecies diversity 3awater quality 0aBioassessment 0aβ-diversity 0aMultivariate dispersion 0aProtozoan community 0aMarine ecosystems1 aXu, Guangjian1 aXu, Henglong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1954-66470 tEcological indicators.g2017 Jan., v. 72 p.47-52dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008200173300001600255520180800271592002802079650002202107650002202129650002702151650000902178650003502187650002102222650001102243650001502254650001102269653000802280653000902288653001102297653001002308653001002318653001102328653000802339653000902347653000802356653000802364653000802372653001302380653001102393653001402404653001902418653002402437653001502461653002602476653002402502700001702526700002202543773010202565856008502667852000902752655001202761IND60538040520221120121709.0190415e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053804052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2013.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadinger, Johannes10aFIDIMO — A free and open source GIS based dispersal model for riverine fish  ap. 238-247.  aDispersal is a key process in community ecology and dynamics that comprise not only various movement processes, but also behavioural components and large-scale spatio-temporal patterns. Modelling fish dispersal further has to consider the species-specific dispersal abilities and the branching, dendritic nature of river networks.With FIDIMO (fish dispersal model) a tool is provided for predicting and simulating spatio-temporal patterns of fish dispersal in river networks with a real integration of GIS for the first time. The model has been written in Python programming language as open source add-on for GRASS GIS. The model has been developed to apply the characteristics of heterogeneous, species and size class specific fish movement on a rasterized river network including migration barriers. Fish dispersal is modelled as a leptokurtic diffusion process spreading from spatially predefined source populations consisting of stationary and mobile components each. The fish dispersal model FIDIMO links conceptual considerations on dispersal modelling with empirically observed fish movement patterns and the strengths of geographically explicit modelling in FOSS GIS. It can be used for different species and any river network meeting the input requirements.As main results FIDIMO yields probabilities of occurrence of fish species in river raster cells based on empirically derived dispersal kernels after the time step of interest modelled.The model output serves to understand and predict time lags and spatio-temporal patterns of recolonization events, the related success of river rehabilitation and also the spread of invasive species. The consequent use of open source programmes allows free access to the code and facilitates easy modifications, adoptions and improvements of the model.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity ecology 3acomputer software 3aecological restoration 3afish 3ageographic information systems 3ainvasive species 3amodels 3aprediction 3arivers 0aGIS 0aFOSS 0aFIDIMO 0aGRASS 0aWGS84 0aETRS89 0aUTM 0aEPSG 0aGUI 0aGNU 0aWFD 0aIWRM-net 0aIMPACT 0aGRASS GIS 0aFish dispersal 0aDispersal modelling 0aRaster GIS 0aLeptokurtic dispersal 0aDispersal time lags1 aKail, Jochem1 aWolter, Christian0 tEcological informatics.g2014 Nov., v. 24 p.238-247dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2013.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01777naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014700164300001800311520064800329592002800977650001701005650002501022650001001047650002201057650002501079651001201104653001901116653002201135653000801157653001701165700001701182700001701199700001801216773007901234856008101313852000901394655001201403IND60519832420221117204457.0160511e20081204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051983242DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-008-0176-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFroufe, Elsa10aGenetic diversity within Scorpio maurus (Scorpiones: Scorpionidae) from morocco: Preliminary evidence based on CO1 mitochondrial DNA sequences  ap. 1157-1160.  aThe large-clawed scorpion, Scorpio maurus, is a medically important scorpion and yet nothing is known regarding genetic diversity within this species.

However, some of these fuels do not provide good ignition features under diesel engine like conditions, which affects engine efficiency. Thus, in order to extend the application of alternative fuels, the current research proposes the use of a laser induced plasma ignition system to assist on the combustion of blends of fuels with less reactivity than pure diesel. This fuel has been chosen as the base component and it has been mixed with gasoline (as the low-reactivity fuel) in different ratios as an example of fuels with very different reactivity properties. Tests have been performed in a single cylinder optically accessible engine, allowing deeper study of combustion development and soot formation. For different in-cylinder conditions and fuel blends, the effect of laser induced plasma ignition system has been evaluated at different crank angle degrees and locations inside the combustion chamber. The application of these blends under low-reactivity engine conditions show that combustion efficiency is dramatically affected. However, the study proves that it is possible to control blend ignition delay and flame lift-off length by means of laser induced plasma. Besides, using the proper ignition system configuration, combustion characteristics similar to those of diesel fuel autoignition can be achieved for high gasoline substitution rates. They lead to similar energy release rates, which confirms that diesel-gasoline blends can reach a combustion efficiency close to pure diesel, while a strong reduction on soot formation was also obtained. These results open a door to efficiency improvement and pollutant reduction by means of a highly tunable ignition of alternative fuel blends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative fuels 3acombustion 3acombustion efficiency 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3aenergy 3agasoline 3apollutants 3apollution control 3asoot 0aDieseline 0aCompression ignition engine 0aLaser plasma ignition 0aAlternative fuel 0aSoot reduction1 aGarcía-Oliver, José M.1 aGarcia, Antonio,1 aMicó, Carlos0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Oct. 20, v. 271 p.122499-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1224993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013600167300001600303520154800319592002801867650002601895650002901921650003901950650001401989650001602003650001002019650001602029650002002045650001502065650001202080650001502092650001402107650002302121650001402144653001502158653002602173653004102199700001702240700002002257700001702277700001802294700001802312700001902330700001802349700001802367773011302385856008202498852000902580655001202589IND60749378620221120072340.0211009e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074937862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2021.08.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Kwang-Min10aFirst report of eosinophil peroxidase in starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus): Gene identification and gene expression profiling  ap. 155-159.  aEosinophils are granular leukocytes that are evolutionarily preserved in the innate immune system of some invertebrates and vertebrates, and these cells can directly remove invading microorganisms and secrete various cytokines, and are also involved in homeostasis. These eosinophils are made up of specific granular proteins that can be differentiated from other cells, and eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) is a peroxidase released only from eosinophils that plays an important role in maintaining the main function and homeostasis of eosinophils. We obtained the sequence information of EPX for the first time from the starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus), and predicted it by amino acid sequencing to confirm sequence alignment and phylogenetic characteristics with other species. Based on analysis of the expression characteristics of PsEPX mRNA in healthy P. stellatus, it was expressed at the highest level in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and was also expressed at a relatively high level in the head kidney and intestine, which are immune-related tissues. After artificial infection with Streptococcus parauberis and viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus, which are the causes of major pathogenic diseases, the expression level of PsEPX was significantly regulated, which showed specific characteristics of pathogens or tissues. These results suggest that PsEPX is an important component of the immune system of P. stellatus and is considered a basic research case for the study of the immunological function of eosinophils in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatichthys stellatus 3aStreptococcus parauberis 3aViral hemorrhagic septicemia virus 3acytokines 3aeosinophils 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ainnate immunity 3aintestines 3akidneys 3aperoxidase 3aphylogeny 3asequence alignment 3ashellfish 0aEosinophil 0aEosinophil peroxidase 0aViral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus1 aJoo, Min-Soo1 aKang, Gyoungsik1 aWoo, Won-Sik1 aKim, Kyung Ho1 aJeong, Son Ha1 aSon, Min Young1 aKim, Do-Hyung1 aPark, Chan-Il0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2021 Nov., v. 118 p.155-159dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2021.08.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245010500164520122600269592002801495650001401523650002501537650001601562650001101578650001201589650001401601650001501615650001501630653001701645653002701662653002401689653002501713653002301738700001501761700001201776700001401788700001301802700001501815700001701830700001401847773011301861856008601974852000902060655001202069IND60701035220221121125234.0210212e20201020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070103522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1225132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiao10aEconomic feasibility of a wind-battery system in the electricity market with the fluctuation penalty  aAs the rapid development of wind energy and electricity markets, wind farms (WFs) in mounting numbers join the electricity markets such as spot and regulating markets, etc. The large-scale integration of WFs into the power system may threaten the safe and stable operation of power systems due to the inherent fluctuation nature of wind power, and as a consequence, the WFs may be penalized by the grid operator in the electricity market. In this case, WF owners will take actions to reduce the fluctuation and one of the promising strategies is to integrate battery storage system (BSS) into the WFs. Base on this idea, a novel framework of considering fluctuation penalty (FP) in the Danish spot market which is the electricity market investigated in this study is firstly proposed. The economic feasibility of integrating BSS into a WF in the spot market is analyzed and a bi-level programming is adopted to design the sizing of the BSS based on Return on Investment (ROI). This research also analyzes the impact of various fluctuation penalties and subsidies on the ROI. It is found that the net revenue of integrating BSS into a WF can increase by 15.8% and the FP can reduce by 64.9% in the spot market with the FP.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aeconomic feasibility 3aelectricity 3aincome 3amarkets 3asubsidies 3awind farms 3awind power 0a—Wind farm 0aBattery storage system 0aFluctuation penalty 0aBi-level programming 0aElectricity market1 aHu, Weihao1 aCao, Di1 aHuang, Qi1 aLiu, Wen1 aChen, Cong1 aLund, Henrik1 aChen, Zhe0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Oct. 20, v. 271 p.122513-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1225133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151242007300177245005100250300001400301520163200315592002801947650001501975650001101990650001002001650001002011650001102021650001302032650002302045653002202068653002902090653001702119653002102136653002702157700002802184700002702212700002302239773012202262856008502384852000902469655001202478IND60694438420221120115840.0200513e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069443842DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2017.13579402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcazzan, Gian Luigi10aUna revisión de los métodos para el análisis sensorial de la miel12aA review of methods for honey sensory analysis  ap. 75-87.  aSensory analysis of honey may be used as a complement to physico-chemical and pollen analyses. It is used to confirm quality, verify the absence of defects, evaluate the conformity to established sensory profiles of unifloral honeys and also to understand consumer preferences. This paper will present a guide to sensory analysis methods for assessing the organoleptic properties of honey and the general procedures required to evaluate them. The standards for honey sensory analysis were developed in reference to specific scientific articles or ISO standards. General requirements for tasting procedures are defined by controlled experimental protocols regarding the design of test booths and best practice for storage, preparation and presentation of honey samples. The assessors should be selected and trained for each method. They must follow the tasting procedures and rules when evaluating and reporting the visual, olfactory, olfactory-gustatory and tactile characteristics of honey (including their intensity) and confirm the absence of defects. Two methods for descriptive analysis are reported: the semi-quantitative method which uses detailed descriptors for visual, odor and flavor, and the profile method which employs twelve descriptors related to the botanical origin and whose intensity is scored using a horizontal line scale of 10 cm.

A piezoelectric actuator linearly moving on a guide is employed to drive a wiper fixed on the actuator. At a proper pressure force between the wiper and solar panel, the actuator can drive the wiper to effectively wipe a dust layer away from the solar panel's surface. The cleaning system's energy gain, which is defined as the ratio of a solar panel's output electric energy increase caused by cleaning to the energy consumption by the piezoelectric actuator, is much higher than 1. The merits of using the piezoelectric actuator in a solar panel cleaning system is that the cleaning system has light weight and compact structure, which is a common feature of piezoelectric systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleaning 3aenergy 3apower generation 3asolar collectors1 aZhang, Qi1 aHu, Junhui0 tEnergy.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 60 p.401-406dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.07.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01310naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002000144245007000164300001800234520035100252592002800603650000800631650001300639650001200652650001900664653002000683653001100703653002300714700002100737700002300758773011300781856008100894852000900975655001200984IND6012387920221120123932.0181018e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND601238792DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175103959952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacRae, Braid A10aImportance of air spaces when comparing fabric thermal resistance  ap. 1963-1965.  aComparing fabrics on the basis of properties determined in the laboratory can provide information valuable to manufacturers and users of fabrics and garments, although small changes to test methods seem to have the potential to yield data which is more relevant.

However, information on PG gene family in pear genome and the specific member involved in fruit softening is still rudimentary. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 61 PG genes, which could be divided into six subclasses, were identified from the pear genome with diverse chromosome locations, gene structures, motifs and cis-acting elements. Most PbrPGs were derived from WGD/segmental duplication blocks, and purifying selection was the main driving force for their expansion. The expression profiles of PbrPGs in pear were tissue/development-stage/cultivar-dependent. During ‘Housui’ pear storage, associated with the reduction of firmness was the accumulation of PG activity. Totally, 28 PbrPGs were expressed during fruit storage, which could be classified into five categories based on different expression patterns; most demonstrated an increased trend. Of these, PbrPG6 were proposed to account for pear softening in combination of the phylogenetic and correlation analysis among firmness, PG activity and PbrPGs. By constructing the silencing vector, a higher firmness was observed in PbrPG6-silenced fruit when compared with that of the control (empty vector). In a further study, we found that the expression of PbrPG6 was regulated by postharvest 1-MCP/ethrel treatment, and several PbrERFs might function in this process. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 61 PbrPG genes from pear genome; of these, PbrPG6 was involved in fruit softening process; furthermore, the expression of PbrPG6 might be under the control of PbrERF. This study provides a foundation for future work aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying pear softening.  aPublisher supplied data  a31701868cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31830081cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018T110508cPostdoctoral Research Foundation of China  a2017M620213cPostdoctoral Research Foundation of China  aKJQN201813cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3aPyrus 3achromosomes 3aethephon 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3apears 3apectins 3aphylogeny 3apolygalacturonase 3aregulatory sequences1 aMa, Min1 aZhang, Huping1 aZhang, Shaoling1 aQian, Ming1 aZhang, Zhen1 aLuo, Weiqi1 aFan, Jinbu1 aLiu, Zhiqiang1 aWang, Libin0 tBMC plant biology.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.587-587dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-019-2168-13Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01908naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245014000170300001400310520078800324592002801112653003101140653005501171653002701226700002201253700002101275700001901296700002301315700002401338700001701362773011201379856008201491852000901573655001201582IND60127703020221119093532.0151110e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012770302DNAL7 a10.1897/IEAM_2004a-023.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDearfield, Kerry L.10aEcological Risk Assessment Issues Identified During the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Examination of Risk Assessment Practices  ap. 73-76.  aRecently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency examined its current risk-assessment principles and practices. As part of the examination, aspects of ecological risk-assessment practices were reviewed. Several issues related to ecological risk assessment were identified, including the use of organism-level versus population-level attributes to characterize risk, the possible opportunities associated with the increased use of probabilistic approaches for ecological risk assessment, and the notion of conservatism in estimating risks. The agency examination provides an understanding of current practices and is intended to begin a dialogue in which the risk assessment community can engage in addressing the identified issues to improve and enhance ecological risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEcological risk assessment 0aOrganism-level versus population-level assessments 0aProbabilistic analysis1 aBender, Edward S.1 aKravitz, Michael1 aWentsel, Randy1 aSlimak, Michael W.1 aFarland, William H.1 aGilman, Paul0 tIntegrated Environmental Assessment and Management.g2005 Jan., v. 1, no. 1 p.73-76dSETACx1551-37937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897%2FIEAM_2004a-023.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100005900192245006200251300001400313506007600327520187700403592002802280506003702308650001102345650000802356650002002364650000902384650000902393650000902402650001302411650001102424650001202435653001102447653001802458653001202476653001602488653000802504653001602512653001902528653001602547653001402563653001302577700002202590700002302612700002102635700001802656700002202674773009802696856008602794852000902880655001202889IND60532287820221207085527.0190214e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053228782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.04.0202doi7 aPMC45236902pmcid7 a262574032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallis, Lisa J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3931-325010aTraining for eye contact modulates gaze following in dogs  ap. 27-35.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFollowing human gaze in dogs and human infants can be considered a socially facilitated orientation response, which in object choice tasks is modulated by human-given ostensive cues. Despite their similarities to human infants, and extensive skills in reading human cues in foraging contexts, no evidence that dogs follow gaze into distant space has been found. We re-examined this question, and additionally whether dogs' propensity to follow gaze was affected by age and/or training to pay attention to humans. We tested a cross-sectional sample of 145 border collies aged 6 months to 14 years with different amounts of training over their lives. The dogs' gaze-following response in test and control conditions before and after training for initiating eye contact with the experimenter was compared with that of a second group of 13 border collies trained to touch a ball with their paw. Our results provide the first evidence that dogs can follow human gaze into distant space. Although we found no age effect on gaze following, the youngest and oldest age groups were more distractible, which resulted in a higher number of looks in the test and control conditions. Extensive lifelong formal training as well as short-term training for eye contact decreased dogs' tendency to follow gaze and increased their duration of gaze to the face. The reduction in gaze following after training for eye contact cannot be explained by fatigue or short-term habituation, as in the second group gaze following increased after a different training of the same length. Training for eye contact created a competing tendency to fixate the face, which prevented the dogs from following the directional cues. We conclude that following human gaze into distant space in dogs is modulated by training, which may explain why dogs perform poorly in comparison to other species in this task.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCollie 3aage 3aanimal behavior 3adogs 3aeyes 3aface 3aforaging 3ahumans 3ainfants 0aageing 0aborder collie 0aclicker 0adevelopment 0adog 0aeye contact 0agaze following 0ahabituation 0alife span 0atraining1 aRange, Friederike1 aMüller, Corsin A.1 aSerisier, Samuel1 aHuber, Ludwig1 aVirányi, Zsófia0 tAnimal behaviour.g2015 Aug., v. 106 p.27-35dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010100165300001600266520175200282592002802034653000902062653002002071653002202091653001502113653001402128773011402142856008202256852000902338655001202347IND60127703220221119093624.0151110e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012770322DNAL7 a10.1897/IEAM_2004-002r.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStark, John D.10aHow Closely Do Acute Lethal Concentration Estimates Predict Effects of Toxicants on Populations?  ap. 109-113.  aAcute lethal dose/concentration estimates are the most widely used measure of toxicity and these data often are used in ecological risk assessment. However, the value of the lethal concentration (LC50) as a toxicological endpoint for use in ecological risk assessment recently has been criticized. A question that has been asked frequently is how accurate is the LC50 for prediction of longer-term effects of toxicants on populations of organisms? To answer this question, Daphnia pulex populations were exposed to nominal concentrations equal to the 48-h acute LC50 of 6 insecticides, Actara, Aphistar diazinon, pymetrozine, Neemix, and Spinosad; and 8 agricultural adjuvants, Bond, Kinetic, Plyac, R-11, Silwet, Sylgard 309, Water Maxx, and X-77; for 10 d. None of the D. pulex populations exposed to the acute LC50 of these insecticides were 50%% lower than the control populations at the end of the study; exposure to diazinon resulted in populations that were higher than expected (91%% of the control). Exposure to Actara and Aphistar resulted in populations that were <1 and 29%% of the control, respectively. Exposure to Fulfill, Neemix, and Spinosad resulted in extinction. Extinction occurred after exposure to all of the adjuvants, except Silwet L-77 where the population was 31%% of the control. These results corroborate other studies that indicate that the LC50 is not a good predictor of effects on population growth. Although lethal concentration estimates have their place in toxicology, namely to compare intrinsic toxicity of chemicals among species or susceptibility of a species to different chemicals over short time periods, population growth and growth-rate studies are necessary to predict toxicant effects on populations.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLC50 0aRisk assessment 0aPopulation growth 0aPesticides 0aAdjuvants0 tIntegrated Environmental Assessment and Management.g2005 Apr., v. 1, no. 2 p.109-113dSETACx1551-37937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897%2FIEAM_2004-002r.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008500171300001600256520112700272592002801399650000801427650001801435650001701453650002001470650001401490650001101504650001401515650001501529650001101544650001901555651001301574700001801587773007301605856008401678852000901762655001201771IND60096565520221117225247.0141104e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009656552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolaymani, Saeed10aEnvironmental and economic effects of high petroleum prices on transport sector  ap. 435-441.  aUsing Malaysia as a case study in comparison with other studies that apply aggregate models, this study employs a multi-sector CGE model (computable general equilibrium) to derive the short-run and long-run effects of sustained increase in world petroleum prices on the transport sector. Since the transport sector is the main consumer of petroleum products, the study highlights the transmission channels through which the rising cost of petroleum products affects this sector in particular. The simulation results suggest that in the short-run, the effects of the shock are negative towards the economy and the transportation sector, but it will eventually encourage the reallocation of resources and, therefore, induces inequality in sectoral adjustments. However, in the long-run, the shock will be beneficial for the transportation sector because it will contribute to an increase in domestic output and stimulate investment. In the whole of the economy and all transportation sectors, the shock will lead to an increase in the emissions of all air pollutants in the short-run while it decreases them in the long-run.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3acase studies 3aeconomic impact 3aemissions 3amodels 3apetroleum 3apollutants 3aprices 3atransportation 3aMalaysia1 aFatimah Kari,0 tEnergy.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 60 p.435-441dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245009300211300001600304506007600320520172200396592002802118506003702146650000802183650001402191650002202205650001602227650002002243650001402263650001202277650001202289650001502301650004302316650001002359650001102369650001802380650001602398651001802414653002302432653002002455653003202475653003902507700002902546700002102575700002502596700002502621700002102646700002302667700002002690700001902710773011802729856008302847852000902930655001202939IND60635910020221207110144.0190628e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063591002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2019.03.0132doi7 aPMC66622022pmcid7 a313599072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrebitz, Anett S.10aDreissena veligers in western Lake Superior – Inference from new low-density detection  ap. 691-699.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe notion that Lake Superior proper is inhospitable to dreissenid mussel survival has been challenged by recent finds on shipwrecks and rocky reefs in the Apostle Islands region. Motivated by concerns surrounding these finds, we conducted an intensive sampling campaign of Apostle Islands waters in 2017 to understand Dreissena prevalence and distribution. The 100-site effort combined random and targeted sites and collected zooplankton, benthos, video, environmental DNA, and supporting water quality data. We did not find settled Dreissena in any video footage or benthos samples, and quantitative PCR applied to eDNA samples was negative for Dreissena. Dreissena veligers were found in almost half the zooplankton samples but at orders of magnitude lower densities than reported from other Laurentian Great Lakes. Veligers were most prevalent around the western islands and associated with shallower depths and slightly higher phosphorus and chlorophyll, but did not spatially match known (still very localized) settled Dreissena colonies. This is the first study to conduct veliger-targeted sampling in western Lake Superior and the first to report consistent detection of veligers there. We speculate that these Apostle Islands veligers are not a new locally-spawned component of the zooplankton community, but instead are transported from an established population in the St. Louis River estuary (~100 km away) by longshore currents; i.e., low-density propagule pressure that may have been present for years. Small-mesh zooplankton data collected along a gradient from the Apostle Islands to the St. Louis River estuary and enumerated with thorough veliger searching would help elucidate these alternatives.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDreissena 3abenthic organisms 3achlorophyll 3adata collection 3aestuaries 3aislands 3amussels 3aphosphorus 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areefs 3arivers 3awater quality 3azooplankton 3aLake Superior 0aDreissenid mussels 0aEarly detection 0aAquatic invertebrate survey 0aApostle Islands National Lakeshore1 aHatzenbuhler, Chelsea L.1 aHoffman, Joel C.1 aMeredith, Christy S.1 aPeterson, Gregory S.1 aPilgrim, Erik M.1 aBarge, Jonathan T.1 aCotter, Anne M.1 aWick, Molly J.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2019 June, v. 45, no. 3 p.691-699dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2035x0380-13307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2019.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245010800159300002000267500001900287520136800306592002801674650001501702650002001717650002601737650001301763650001801776650001801794650001401812650000701826650002201833650001501855650001601870700001401886700005701900773014201957856007902099852000902178655001202187IND60662495920221118042216.0190904e20190807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066249592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b029752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yan10aRemoval of Carbon Monoxide from Simulated Flue Gas Using Two New Fenton Systems: Mechanism and Kinetics  ap. 10387-10397.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTwo novel removal processes of carbon monoxide using two new Fenton systems (i.e., Cu²⁺/Fe²⁺ and Mn²⁺/Fe²⁺ coactivated H₂O₂ systems) were developed. The effect of several process parameters (concentrations of H₂O₂, Fe²⁺, Cu²⁺, and Mn²⁺, reagent pH value, solution temperature, and simulated flue gas components) on CO removal was studied in a bubbling reactor. The mechanism and kinetics of CO removal were also revealed. Results show that adding Cu²⁺ or Mn²⁺ obviously enhances the removal process of CO in new Fenton systems. The measured results of free radical yield demonstrate that the enhancing role is derived from producing more ·OH (they are produced due to the synergistic activation role of Cu²⁺/Fe²⁺ or Mn²⁺/Fe²⁺ in new Fenton systems. The removal efficiency of CO is raised by increasing concentrations of Fe²⁺, Cu²⁺, and Mn²⁺ and is reduced by raising concentrations of CO, NO, and SO₂. Increasing H₂O₂ concentration, reagent pH, and solution temperature demonstrates a dual impact on CO absorption. Three oxidation pathways are found to be responsible for CO removal in new Fenton systems. Results of mass-transfer reaction kinetics reveal that CO removal processes are located in a fast-speed reaction kinetics region (the CO removal process is controlled by the mass transfer rate).  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon monoxide 3aenvironmental science 3aflue gas 3afree radicals 3amass transfer 3aoxidation 3apH 3areaction kinetics 3atechnology 3atemperature1 aHan, Xuan1 aLiu, Yangxian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9069-40070 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Aug. 07, v. 53, no. 17 p.10387-10397dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b029753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04160naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002700167245011400194300001600308520212000324592002802444650002302472650001502495650001802510650002002528650002002548650001002568650001202578650001502590650002502605650001702630650001202647650005102659650001102710650006602721650003002787650002402817650002102841650001102862650004802873650004202921650007602963650002303039650002203062650005103084650008503135700002303220700001803243700002203261700002403283700002203307700002603329773011003355856008403465852000903549655001203558IND4451269320221117002327.0141111e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445126932DNAL7 a212325382pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBousquet-Mélou, Alain10aLicking behaviour induces partial anthelmintic efficacy of ivermectin pour-on formulation in untreated cattle  ap. 563-569.  aLicking behaviour in cattle has been reported to account for the disposition of topically administered macrocyclic lactones. However, its impact on anthelmintic efficacy remains to be established. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of ivermectin exchange between cattle on the reduction in the faecal egg count (FEC) after pour-on administration in a group of 10 heifers experimentally infected with Ostertagia ostertagi and Cooperia oncophora. Four treated (500μg/kg, pour-on) and six untreated animals were put together after treatment and plasma and faecal exposure to ivermectin as well as the FECs were evaluated before and over 40days after treatment. Ivermectin was detected in plasma and faeces of the six untreated heifers, with maximal exposures two- to three-fold lower than the minimal exposures in treated animals. The interindividual variability of exposure was very high in untreated animals, with a ten-fold difference between the upper and lower limits compared with treated heifers, where there was only a two-fold difference. Anthelmintic efficacy, expressed as an average reduction of the FECs over the experimental period, was maximal in the treated group. In untreated heifers, anthelmintic efficacies ranged from zero to maximal efficacy, with intermediary values between 30% and 80%. The use of a classical pharmacodynamic model demonstrated a clear relationship between exposure and efficacy and enabled us to define the critical plasma or faecal ivermectin concentrations delimiting an exposure window associated with partial anthelmintic efficacy. This range of ivermectin plasma concentrations (0.1–1ng/mL) could be considered as a potential selection window for anthelmintic resistance. Finally, our results show that macrocyclic lactone exchange between cattle after pour-on administration, resulting from natural grooming behaviour, can significantly impact on anthelmintic efficacy. This raises several issues such as the design of comparative clinical trials and the occurrence of partial efficacy which is considered a risk factor for the development of anthelmintic resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCooperia oncophora 3aOstertagia 3aanthelmintics 3aclinical trials 3afecal egg count 3afeces 3aheifers 3aivermectin 3apour-on formulations 3arisk factors 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdrug therapyxparasitologyxphysiopathology. 2aChemistry, Pharmaceutical 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aIvermectinxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aOstertagiaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOstertagiasisxdrug therapyxparasitologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aParasite Egg Count 2aTreatment Outcome 2aTrichostrongyloideaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTrichostrongyloidiasisxdrug therapyxparasitologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary.1 aJacquiet, Philippe1 aHoste, Hervé1 aClément, Julien,1 aBergeaud, Jean-Paul1 aAlvinerie, Michel1 aToutain, Pierre-Louis0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2011 Apr., v. 41, no. 5 p.563-569dElsevier Ltdx0020-75197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245004300167300001600210520126500226592002801491650001801519650001901537650001901556650002201575650001401597650002401611650001601635650001401651650001101665650001301676700001801689700001501707773007301722856008401795852000901879655001201888IND60096565720221117225303.0141104e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009656572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRenforth, P.10aEngineering challenges of ocean liming  ap. 442-452.  aThe relationship between the level of atmospheric CO₂ (carbon dioxide) and the impacts of climate change is uncertain, but a safe concentration may be surpassed this century. Therefore, it is necessary to develop technologies that can accelerate CO₂ removal from the atmosphere. This paper explores the engineering challenges of a technology that manipulates the carbonate system in seawater by the addition of calcium oxide powder (CaO; lime), resulting in a net sequestration of atmospheric CO₂ into the ocean (ocean liming; OL). Every tonne of CO₂ sequestered requires between 1.4 and 1.7 t of limestone to be crushed, calcined, and distributed. Approximately 1 t of CO₂ would be created from this activity, of which >80% is a high purity gas (pCO₂ > 98%) amenable to geological storage. It is estimated that the thermal and electrical energy requirements for OL would be 0.6–5.6 and 0.1–1.2 GJ tCO₂ ⁻¹ captured respectively. A preliminary economic assessment suggests that OL could cost approximately US$72–159 t⁻¹ of CO₂. The additional CO₂ burden of OL makes it a poor alternative to point source mitigation. However, it may provide a means to mitigate some diffuse emissions and reduce atmospheric concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aeconomic analysis 3aemissions 3aenergy requirements 3aengineering 3alimestone 3aliming 3aseawater1 aJenkins, B.G.1 aKruger, T.0 tEnergy.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 60 p.442-452dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012700167300001800294520121200312592002801524650002801552650002301580650002101603650001501624650002301639650002201662650000901684650001101693650001601704650002401720651001401744651002101758653002801779653001801807653001001825653000901835653001301844700002301857700001701880773008001897856008101977852000902058655001202067IND60119870920221120210032.0160511e20150106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011987092DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-014-0476-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAydın, Mehmet,10aMorphometric aspects and growth modeling of exotic bivalve blood cockle Scapharca inaequivalvis from the Black Sea, Turkey  ap. 1707-1715.  aThis study was planned to determine biometric features and relationships between them in blood cockle, Scapharca inaequivalvis, a benthic exotic bivalve species of the Black Sea, Turkey during a period of 12 months. Over the study, 4,543 samples were collected and their shell length (SL), width (SWi), thickness (ST) and weight (SWe), as well as total (TW) and meat weights (MW) were measured. SL changed between 0.45 and 7.18 cm with an average value of 3.77 ± 0.02 cm. Average TW of the samples was 22.37 ± 0.26 g. Average MW of S. inaequivalvis was calculated as 10.66 ± 0.32 g with a rate of 26.85% of TW. The findings obtained showed that monthly measurements of SWe and MW had a small variation. On the other hand, monthly ST varied greatly. SL and SWe increment (%) models were also generated according to SL classes using regression analysis. Correlation and cluster analysis showed that MW had a weak association with other variables. The strongest correlation was between ST and SWe in October (R 2 = 1.0). The results present valuable information for this exotic species but more studies are required to better understand its biological characteristics and long term effects on the ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScapharca inaequivalvis 3aTegillarca granosa 3acluster analysis 3aecosystems 3aintroduced species 3along term effects 3ameat 3amodels 3amorphometry 3aregression analysis 3aBlack Sea 3aTurkey (country) 0aScapharca inaequivalvis 0amorphometrics 0ashell 0ameat 0amodeling1 aKaradurmuş, Uğur1 aTunca, Evren0 tBiologia.g2015 Jan. 6, v. 69, no. 12 p.1707-1715dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-014-0476-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010200167300001800269520133500287592002801622650001801650650001901668650001301687650001201700650002401712650001801736650001501754650001001769653002501779653001801804653001401822653002401836700002001860700002201880773012901902856008402031852000902115655001202124IND60123880920150811000000.0150411e20150803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012388092DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2014.9816692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobs, Anna10aSoil organic carbon as affected by direct drilling and mulching in sugar beet – wheat rotations  ap. 1079-1087.  aThe effect of conventional ploughing, mulching, and direct drilling on the soil organic C (soil C ₒᵣg) contents through the soil profile and on total soil C ₒᵣg stocks (0–45 cm) was investigated at five different German sites. All sites showed similar results: after 10–13 years, soil C ₒᵣg contents in the surface soil (0–10 cm) were 15–71% and 33–42% higher under direct drilling and mulching, respectively, than under ploughing (8–18 g kg ⁻¹). Under ploughing, the soil C ₒᵣg contents were distributed homogenously through the soil profile. Either mulching or direct drilling resulted in 3–28% higher soil C ₒᵣg stocks than ploughing (49–116 t ha ⁻¹). However, the tillage management was no significant factor since the sites showed the effects to different extents but were the mathematical replications. Five to six years later, trends and values were similar. We concluded that the main effect of mulching or direct drilling was the stratification with higher soil C ₒᵣg contents in the surface soil. Since this is a positive means for soil protection, we suggested that the use of mulching or direct drilling can contribute to a sustainable soil management in crop rotations with sugar beet which are characterized by a strong physical impact on the soil during harvest.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop rotation 3adirect seeding 3amulching 3aplowing 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil profiles 3asugar beet 3awheat 0aconventional tillage 0acrop rotation 0asoil mass 0asoil organic matter1 aJungert, Stefan1 aKoch, Heinz-Josef0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2015 Aug. 3, v. 61, no. 8 p.1079-1087dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2014.9816693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245005900175506010400234506007600338520117300414592002801587506003701615650001301652650001501665650001901680650001501699650001701714650002501731653001601756653002601772653002101798653001501819653000901834653002401843700002101867700002301888700002101911700001901932700001901951700002301970773015101993856008202144852000902226655001202235IND60776705220221207073607.0220531e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077670522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2022.1028062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasquarella, Valerie J.10aDemystifying LandTrendr and CCDC temporal segmentation  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aImproved access to remotely sensed imagery and time series algorithms in combination with increased availability of cloud computing resources and platforms such as Google Earth Engine have significantly expanded the community of users processing and analyzing time series of satellite observations.

A number of restrictions on organic wastes which can be treated in anaerobic digestion facilities and the subsequent handling of the digested material are specified in European legislation. Regulation 1774/2002/EC as amended states that after reduction the material must be heated to either 70 °C or 90 °C for a minimum of 60 min. An alternative Irish national standard of 60 °C for 48 h twice has been introduced in place of the EU standard. Anaerobic digestion systems are successful only if they produce a significant energy output. The aim of this research was therefore to examine both the EU and Irish national standards as well as a number of alternative treatment scenarios to determine their respective pasteurisation efficiency and energetic requirement. Post-digestion pasteurisation above 60 °C was found to satisfactorily remove all viable Escherichia coli bacteria from the test feedstock. It was determined that the most energy and economically efficient heat treatments were 60 °C for 1 h, 70 °C for 1 h (EU standard), and 80 °C for 30 min. The Irish national standard was found to be prohibitively energy inefficient and expensive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aEuropean Union 3aanaerobic digestion 3abacteria 3aenergy efficiency 3afeedstocks 3alaws and regulations 3aorganic wastes 3apasteurization 3aIreland1 aWalsh, Eilín1 aMcDonnell, Kevin P.0 tEnergy.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 60 p.125-128dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.07.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002900143245011900172300001600291520148000307592002801787650001501815650001401830650002301844650003901867650002101906650001001927650001301937650002001950650001601970650003101986650001402017650001802031650002002049650001102069650001402080653000902094653001502103653002302118653001702141653001502158700001702173700003102190700002202221700001802243700001802261700002002279700001902299773008802318856007702406852000902483655001202492IND60518115220221117111656.0160406e20131012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051811522DNAL7 a10.1139/gen-2013-01192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarchałowska-Śliwa, E.10aMolecular and classical chromosomal techniques reveal diversity in bushcricket genera of Barbitistini (Orthoptera)  ap. 667-676.  aThe cytogenetic characteristics of 17 species of bushcricket belonging to eight genera of the tribe Barbitistini were examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization with 18S rDNA and (TTAGGₙ) telomeric as probes and by C-banding, silver, and fluorochrome staining. These markers were used to understand chromosomal organization and evolutionary relationships between genera or species within the same genus. The number of 18S rDNA clusters per haploid genome that co-localized with active nucleolus organizer regions (NORs) ranged from one to five, with the most common pattern being the presence of one NOR-bearing chromosome. This ribosomal cistron was preferentially located in the paracentromeric region of autosomes and very rarely in the sex chromosome. The results demonstrated coincidence between the localization of major ribosomal genes and active NORs and the position of C-band and GC-rich regions. The rDNA/NOR distribution and the composition of chromosome heterochromatin proved to be good cytogenetic markers for distinguishing species and phylogenetic lines and for understanding the genomic differentiation and evolution of Barbitistini. A comparison of cytogenetic and morphological or behavioral traits suggests that morphological and behavioral specialization in this group was not followed by major karyotype modification (except for Leptophyes). However, the occurrence and distribution of different repetitive DNA sites tends to vary among the taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthoptera 3aautosomes 3achromosome banding 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3afluorescent dyes 3agenes 3ahaploidy 3aheterochromatin 3akaryotyping 3anucleolus organizer region 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3asex chromosomes 3asilver 3atelomeres 0aFISH 0arDNA sites 0achromosome banding 0acytogenetics 0aOrthoptera1 aGrzywacz, B.1 aMaryańska-Nadachowska, A.1 aKaramysheva, T.V.1 aHeller, K.-G.1 aLehmann, A.W.1 aLehmann, G.U.C.1 aChobanov, D.P.0 tGenome.g2013 Oct. 12, v. 56, no. 11 p.667-676dNRC Research Pressx1480-33217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2013-01193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245010900201300002000310500001900330520118100349592002801530650001501558650001501573650001101588650002201599650001901621650001301640650001401653650001501667650001301682650001701695650001501712700001301727700001801740700005601758700005501814700006401869700005701933773014201990856007902132852000902211655001202220IND60662496220221118042105.0190904e20190806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066249622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b030672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Chiheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9493-912010aCooperative Pollutant Adsorption and Persulfate-Driven Oxidation on Hierarchically Ordered Porous Carbon  ap. 10352-10360.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study presents a 3D hierarchically ordered porous carbon material (HOPC) that simultaneously achieves efficient adsorption of a range of water pollutants as well as catalytic oxidation of adsorbed pollutants. High adsorption capacity and rapid adsorption kinetics are attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the carbon substrate, the large surface area due to high porosity, and the relatively uniform size of pores that comprise the structure. The oxidative degradation is achieved by efficient mediation of electron transfer from pollutants to persulfate through the sp²-hybridized carbon and nitrogen network. As the persulfate activation and pollutant oxidation do not involve reactive radicals, oxidative degradation of the adsorbent is prevented, which has been a primary concern when adsorption and oxidation are combined either to regenerate adsorbate or to enhance oxidation performance. Batch tests showed that near complete removal of various recalcitrant micropollutants can be achieved within a short time (less than 1 min) even when treating a complex water matrix, as pollutants are concentrated on the surface of HOPC, where their oxidation is catalyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3aelectron transfer 3ahydrophobicity 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3aporosity 3asurface area 3atechnology1 aYang, Ji1 aHuang, Dahong1 aLi, Jianfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1598-68561 aWang, Aiqin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4552-03601 aAlvarez, Pedro J.

In order to study the effects of mineral nitrogen fertilization and biofertilizer inoculation on yield and some physiological traits of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) under different levels of sulfur fertilizer, field experiments in factorial scheme based on randomized complete block design were conducted with three replications in 2012 and 2013. Experimental factors were: (1) four levels of chemical nitrogen fertilizer (0, 100, 150 and 200 kg N ha ⁻¹), (2) two levels of biofertilizer (with and without inoculation) consisting Azotobacter sp. and Azospirillum sp. and (3) two levels of sulfur application (0 and 50 kg S ha ⁻¹). Rapeseed yield, oil content of grains and studied physiological traits had a strong association with the N fertilization, biofertilizer inoculation and sulfur (S) application. Higher rates of N fertilization, biofertilizer inoculation and S application increased the grain yield of rapeseed. In the case of physiological traits, the highest value of relative water content (RWC) was recorded in 100 kg N ha ⁻¹ that was statistically in par with 150 kg N ha ⁻¹ application, while usage of 150 kg N ha ⁻¹ showed the maximum cell membrane stability (CMS). Inoculation with biofertilizer and S fertilization resulted in higher RWC and CMS in rapeseed plants. The chlorophyll content showed its maximum values in the highest level of N fertilization, biofertilizer inoculation and S application. The usage of 200 kg N ha ⁻¹ significantly decreased the oil content of rapeseed grains, but the highest grain oil content was obtained from the application of 150 kg N ha ⁻¹, Azotobacter sp. and Azospirillum sp. inoculation and S fertilization. It seems that moderate N rate (about 150 kg N ha ⁻¹) and S application (about 50 kg S ha ⁻¹) can prove to be beneficial in improving growth, development and total yield of inoculated rapeseed plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzospirillum 3aAzotobacter 3aBrassica napus 3abiofertilizers 3acell membranes 3achlorophyll 3acrops 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3agrains 3alipid content 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anonpoint source pollution 3arapeseed 3arisk reduction 3asulfur 3asulfur fertilizers 3awater content 0abiofertilizer 0aBrassica napus L 0agrain yield 0anitrogen fertilizer 0aoil content 0aphysiological traits 0asulfur fertilizer1 aKhandan, Teymur0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2015 Aug. 3, v. 61, no. 8 p.1137-1149dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2014.9825503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245007000163300001600233500001500249520131900264592002801583650001501611650001201626650001601638650001801654650001601672650002101688650002001709653001701729700001501746700001401761773007301775856008401848852000901932655001201941IND60096566020221117225055.0141104e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009656602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Z.Y.12aA novel variable effect LiBr-water absorption refrigeration cycle  ap. 457-463.  a2019-12-06  aGeneration temperatures from 110 °C to 140 °C are not enough to drive a double effect LiBr-water absorption cycle but too high for a single effect cycle under typical operating conditions. A novel LiBr-water absorption cycle which contains an AGX (absorber generator heat exchanger) is introduced for this. The AGX absorption cycle is able to make use of the high pressure condensation heats of different temperature, and get different amounts of extra refrigeration thus obtains 1.n effect refrigeration. The novel cycle can work under generation temperatures from 85 °C to 150 °C with evaporation temperature of 5 °C, absorption temperature of 35 °C and condensation temperature of 40 °C. The results of simulation show that the novel cycle can work in single effect mode, 1.n effect mode and double effect mode when the generation temperatures are in the ranges of 85 °C–93 °C, 93oC–140 °C and 140 °C–150 °C, and reach a COP (coefficient of performance) of 0.75, 0.75–1.08 and 1.08–1.25 respectively. Comparison between this novel cycle and existing cycle working under similar generation temperature range shows that the novel cycle has a better performance. The large working range also makes the cycle suitable for solar cooling utilizing medium temperature solar collector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acooling 3aevaporation 3arefrigeration 3atemperature 3asolar collectors 3aheat exchangers 0acondensation1 aWang, R.Z.1 aXia, Z.Z.0 tEnergy.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 60 p.457-463dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245008200177300001600259520096600275592002801241650001301269650001401282650002101296650003101317650001901348650001801367650002601385650001101411650001401422650002601436650001601462650003701478650002301515650003001538650002501568650002101593650004201614650003001656650002301686650002201709650002701731650002701758700002001785700001401805773010701819856008101926852000902007655001202016IND4473640520221117002602.0141111e20110720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447364052DNAL7 a217778522pmid7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2011.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li10aEvolutionary rewiring and reprogramming of bacterial transcription regulation  ap. 279-288.  aRewiring and reprogramming of transcriptional regulation took place during bacterial speciation. The mechanistic alterations among transcription factors, cis-regulatory elements and target genes confer bacteria novel ability to adapt to stochastic environmental changes. This process is critical to their survival, especially for bacterial pathogens subjected to accelerated evolution. In the past two decades, the investigators not only completed the sequences of numerous bacterial genomes, but also made great progress in understanding the molecular basis of evolution. Here we briefly reviewed the current knowledge on the mechanistic changes among orthologous, paralogous and xenogenic regulatory circuits, which were caused by genetic recombinations such as gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer, transposable elements and different genetic contexts. We also discussed the potential impact of this area on theoretical and applied studies of microbes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3aevolution 3agene duplication 3agene expression regulation 3agene targeting 3agene transfer 3agenetic recombination 3agenome 3apathogens 3atranscription factors 3atransposons 2aAdaptation, Biologicalxgenetics 2aBacteriaxgenetics 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Duplication 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGene Transfer, Horizontal 2aGenetic Speciation 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aWang, Fang-Fang1 aQian, Wei0 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2011 July 20, v. 38, no. 7 p.279-288dElsevier Ltdx1673-85277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2011.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014400168300001600312520143200328592002801760650001001788650002001798650000901818650001401827650001401841650001901855650001001874650001101884650001801895650001101913650001801924653002101942653001801963653001401981653001201995653002202007653002402029700001302053700002302066700002302089773013502112856008502247852000902332655001202341IND60643556620221121045230.0190511e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064355662DNAL7 a10.1080/23308249.2019.15831662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunt, Len M.10aCatch and Non-catch-related Determinants of Where Anglers Fish: A Review of Three Decades of Site Choice Research in Recreational Fisheries  ap. 261-286.  aStudies of where people recreationally fish were reviewed to understand which attributes influence these choices, to make this literature accessible to individuals who manage or rely upon recreational fishers, and to shape future research. Between 1988 and 2017, researchers published 114 studies and 189 distinct models of angler behaviors from 96 unique data sets. On average, costs such as travel were universally important while measures of catch-related fishing quality also generally and positively influenced choices of fishing sites. Although frequently omitted from studies, facility quality (e.g., boat launch presence), destination size (e.g., lake area), and measures of environmental quality (e.g., water quality) tended to positively influence choices of fishing sites by anglers. Finally, the influence of regulations and congestion on fishing site choices was more often a significant factor in the choice of hypothetical (i.e. stated preference) than actual (i.e. revealed preference) fishing trips. Researchers are also encouraged to facilitate future reviews by: (i) more clearly communicating details of their studies; (ii) enhancing comparability among studies by using where possible standardized attribute measures; (iii) explicitly testing alternate model specifications related to how anglers’ tradeoff fishing site attributes and; (iv) expanding the scope and scale of research on where people fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboats 3adata collection 3afish 3afishermen 3agame fish 3ahuman behavior 3alakes 3amodels 3asport fishing 3atravel 3awater quality 0aAngler behaviors 0ameta-analysis 0avaluation 0autility 0astated preference 0arevealed preference1 aCamp, Ed1 avan Poorten, Brett1 aArlinghaus, Robert0 tReviews in fisheries science & aquaculture.g2019 July 3, v. 27, no. 3 p.261-286dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19676x2330-82577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23308249.2019.15831663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013700163300001800300520120200318592002801520650001101548650001101559650002301570650003101593650001001624650002201634650001701656650001801673650001301691651002101704653001701725653002001742653001301762653000801775653001301783700001801796700001501814773008001829856008101909852000901990655001201999IND60119871220221120184909.0160511e20150106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011987122DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-014-0479-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Keum13aAn evolutionary and developmental approach toward understanding of growth variations of two closely related dwarfism of Galium verum  ap. 1660-1667.  aGalium L. is one of the largest and most widespread genus of Rubiaceae, consisting of more than 650 species worldwide. Galium verum var. asiaticum (G. verum a.) is a perennial herbaceous and widely distributed in in Korea peninsula. On the other hand, Galium verum var. asiaticum for. pusillum (G. verum a.p.) is endemic to Korea, inhabiting only on high land of Mt. Halla of Jeju. G. verum a.p. appears to be a dwarfism of G. verum a. We wondered what physiological, environmental, or genetic factors rendered those two taxa morphologically differentiated. We found that G. verum a.p. shows a low activity of the cell proliferation and was not associated with responsiveness contents of auxin and gibberellins. In order to search for genetic factors involved, we carried out an mRNA differential display method using the ACPs, and isolated several different expression genes between the two taxa. We chose one of those genes, which encoded RADIALIS-like proteins: GvaRADL1 from G. verum a. and GvapRADL1 from G. verum a.p. We discuss the relevancy of the genetic variations in regard to the differential expression patterns of those genes and the differential growth patterns of the two variants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGalium 3aauxins 3acell proliferation 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agibberellins 3amessenger RNA 3aproteins 3aKorean Peninsula 0aGalium verum 0aalpine dwarfism 0aevo-devo 0aACP 0aRADIALIS1 aPak, Jae-Hong1 aKim, Jeong0 tBiologia.g2015 Jan. 6, v. 69, no. 12 p.1660-1667dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-014-0479-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04315naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245015800173300001200331520224400343592002802587650003402615650002202649650002602671650002602697650002502723650001202748650002602760650002502786650002402811650001302835650001202848650001802860650001902878650002202897650001202919650001602931650001502947650002102962650002202983650002303005650001503028650002703043650001203070650001503082650001503097650001703112653001803129653002403147653002303171653002003194653002803214653002003242653000903262653002303271653001903294700003203313700002403345700002503369700002103394773012303415856008203538852000903620655001203629IND60635910420221118204123.0190711e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063591042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejbt.2019.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlasehinde, Tosin A.10aChlorella sorokiniana and Chlorella minutissima exhibit antioxidant potentials, inhibit cholinesterases and modulate disaggregation of β-amyloid fibrils  ap. 1-9.  aMicroalgae are aquatic chlorophyll-containing organisms comprising unicellular microscopic forms, and their biomasses are potential sources of bioactive compounds, biofuels and food-based products. However, the neuroprotective effects of microalgal biomass have not been fully explored. In this study, biomass from two Chlorella species was characterized, and their antioxidant, anticholinesterase and anti-amyloidogenic activities were investigated.GC–MS analysis of the extracts revealed the presence of some phenols, sterols, steroids, fatty acids and terpenes. Ethanol extract of Chlorella sorokiniana (14.21 mg GAE/g) and dichloromethane extract of Chlorella minutissima (20.65 mg QE/g) had the highest total phenol and flavonoid contents, respectively. All the extracts scavenged 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, 2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) and hydroxyl radicals. The highest metal chelating activity of the extracts was observed in the ethanol extracts of C. minutissima (102.60 μg/mL) and C. sorokiniana (107.84 μg/mL). Furthermore, the cholinesterase inhibitory activities of the extracts showed that ethanol extract of C. sorokiniana (13.34 μg/mL) exhibited the highest acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, while dichloromethane extract of C. minutissima (11.78 μg/mL) showed the highest butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. Incubation of the β-amyloid protein increased the aggregation of amyloid fibrils after 96 h. However, ethanol extract of C. sorokiniana and C. minutissima inhibited further aggregation of Aβ1–42 and caused disaggregation of matured protein fibrils compared to the control. This study reveals the modulatory effects of C. sorokiniana and C. minutissima extracts on some mediators of Alzheimer's disease and provides insights into their potential benefits as functional food, nutraceutics or therapeutic agent for the management of this neurodegenerative disease.How to cite: Olasehinde T, Odjadjare EC, Mabinya LV, et al.

Hence, an objective scheme to assess the quality of toxicity data forms an important part of this process. The variation of scores from 2 research papers using the Australasian ecotoxicity database (AED) quality assessment scheme was evaluated by 23 ecotoxicologists. The results showed that the quality class that the assessors gave each paper varied by less than 10%% when compared with a quality score agreed a priori between the authors of this study. It was determined that the majority of the variation in each assessment was due to ambiguous or poorly written assessment criteria, information that was difficult to find, or information in the paper that was overlooked by the assessor. This led to refinements of the assessment criteria in the AED, which resulted in a 16%% improvement (i.e., reduction) in the mean variation of scores for the 2 papers when compared with the a priori scores. The improvement in consensus among different assessors evaluating the same research papers suggests that the data quality assessment scheme proposed in this article provides a more robust scheme for assessing the quality of aquatic toxicity data than methods currently available.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAquatic 0aBiota 0aToxicity data 0aQuality criteria 0aRisk assessment1 aWarne, Michael StJ.1 aMarkich, Scott J.0 tIntegrated Environmental Assessment and Management.g2005 July, v. 1, no. 3 p.174-180dSETACx1551-37937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897%2F2004-003R.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007700172300001600249520190900265592002802174650001402202650002002216650001002236650001402246650001102260650001402271650001502285650001002300653002202310653001402332653002202346653001402368653002002382653001102402700006002413773015102473856008602624852000902710655001202719IND60532288320221122113102.0190214e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053228832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Thomas E.10aTechnicolour deceit: a sensory basis for the study of colour-based lures  ap. 231-243.  aThe study of deceptive signalling has provided compelling insights into evolutionary and ecological processes. Aside from mimicry, however, research into the use of colour as a deceptive instrument has progressed largely without an explicit theoretical basis. This is especially true for colour-based prey lures, that is, displays of colour used by predators to actively attract and deceive prey. Such lures are widespread and phenotypically diverse, and a valuable body of research has laid the foundation for novel tests of evolutionary theory in these systems. In this review, we aim to cast the study of colour-based luring under a theoretical framework centred on sensory drive, and outline hypotheses and predictions that may guide future work. We first discuss the principles of sensory drive theory, and briefly review its relevance and use in colour lure research. Notably, although rarely framed in explicit sensory drive terms, many studies consider questions highly relevant to this theory, such as the influence of signalling environments on lure evolution. We then highlight how hypotheses drawn from sensory drive theory may guide the study of intriguing features of colour lure systems. To that end, we review the empirical literature with a focus on two key areas: signal function and the evolution and maintenance of polymorphism. We examine the predictions of the relevant model of signal function, sensory traps, against the limited literature evidence in orb-web spiders, and find little support, at present, for the common contention that lures act as sensory traps via floral mimicry. Finally, we suggest that just as a more explicit consideration of sensory drive theory may allow new or broader insights into colour lure evolution, the study of lure systems offers unique opportunities to test theory in visual ecology, predator–prey dynamics and the evolution of polymorphism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneidae 3aanimal behavior 3acolor 3aevolution 3amodels 3apredators 3aprediction 3atraps 0aanimal coloration 0abehaviour 0adeceptive signals 0aevolution 0asensory ecology 0aspider1 aKemp, Darrell J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5845-55130 tAnimal behaviour.g2015 July, v. 105 p.231-243dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245009000163300001600253520141100269592002801680653001301708653001401721653002001735653001301755653002201768700002101790700002001811773011401831856007701945852000902022655001202031IND60127704020221119093310.0151110e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012770402DNAL7 a10.1897/2004-004R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinger, Parley V.10aPotential Impact of Dare County Landfills on Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge  ap. 267-282.  aRunoff of leachate from East Lake and Dare County Construction and Demolition Debris landfills has the potential to impact wildlife resources at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, Dare and Hyde Counties, North Carolina. Sediment quality of samples collected in August 2000 at 14 locations down-gradient from the landfills was assessed by measuring metal and organic contaminants in the sediments, chronic toxicity of solid-phase sediment (28-d static-renewal exposures; survival and growth as test endpoints) and acute toxicity of sediment porewater (96-h static exposures) to Hyalella azteca (Crustacea: Amphipoda). In addition, contaminant bioaccumulation from 4 sediments was determined using 28-d exposures of Lumbriculus variegatus (freshwater oligochaete). Although survival was not impaired, length of H. azteca was significantly reduced in sediments from 5 locations. Pore water from 4 locations was acutely toxic to H. azteca. Metals and a few polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were bioaccumulated by L. variegatus from the sediments. Several metals and PAHs exceeded sediment quality guidelines, and metals in porewater from several sites exceeded water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic wildlife. Runoff of leachate from the landfills has reduced sediment quality and has the potential to adversely affect wildlife resources at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSediment 0aPorewater 0aBioaccumulation 0aToxicity 0aLandfill leachate1 aLasier, Peter J.1 aAugspurger, Tom0 tIntegrated Environmental Assessment and Management.g2005 July, v. 1, no. 3 p.267-282dSETACx1551-37937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897%2F2004-004R.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011300172300001600285520135800301592002801659650001201687650001401699650001501713650001901728650001301747650001501760650001601775650002201791650001601813653001801829653002001847653000801867653002201875653001701897700006101914700001901975700003301994700006302027773012502090856008302215852000902298655001202307IND60672940520221122044706.0200221e20200322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067294052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThursch, Lavenia J.10aExploring the gel phase of cationic glycylalanylglycine in ethanol/water. I. Rheology and microscopy studies  ap. 499-509.  aThe cationic tripeptide glycylalanylglycine (GAG) self-assembles into long, thick crystalline fibrils in an ethanol/water solution. At sufficiently high concentrations, the fibrils form a volume spanning hydrogel network. We report an extensive rheology and microscopy-based study regarding the self-assembly of GAG in ethanol/water solutions to understand the conditions for fibril formation as well as the thermal stability for future developments of this material.By systematically varying GAG concentration and ethanol fraction, we observe a two-dimensional fibril aggregate phase diagram. Microscopy studies shed light on the shape and size of fibrils as well as the macroscopic packing depending on conditions. The kinetics and evolution of the macroscopic fibril microstructure was investigated using rheology.The mechanism of fibril formation is put into the context of a solubility framework, where ethanol reduces peptide solubility and induces self-assembly. The rate of fibril formation and strength of the gel can be controlled by peptide concentration and ethanol fraction. The faster rate of fibril formation leads to inhomogeneous packing of fibrils denoted by discrete dense fibril clusters. The solubility of the fibrils can be manipulated by temperature making the gel thermo-switchable, a property of interest for biomedical systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethanol 3ahydrogels 3amicroscopy 3amicrostructure 3arheology 3asolubility 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3atripeptides 0aSelf-assembly 0aPeptide fibrils 0aGAG 0aGelation kinetics 0aGel rheology1 aDiGuiseppi, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9888-91481 aLewis, Todd R.1 aSchweitzer-Stenner, Reinhard1 aAlvarez, Nicolas J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0976-65420 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Mar. 22, v. 564 p.499-509dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245007000163300001600233520093000249592002801179650001701207650001601224650001701240650001601257650004301273650001401316650001801330650001901348650001701367653002101384653001301405653001101418653001601429700001801445700001701463700002001480700001501500700001701515700001501532700001901547700001501566773009101581856008601672852000901758655001201767IND60625771120221123022513.0190131e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062577112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Rui12aA novel thermometer-type hydrogel senor for glutathione detection  ap. 191-196.  aA thermometer-type visual sensor for glutathione (GSH) sensing was developed with stimulus-responsive fluorescent hydrogel which was obtained by using 5, 6-bicarboxylic fluorescein crossli`nked partly ammoniated polyacrylamide.

(Fabaceae) is an endemic tree of the Northeast region of Brazil, mainly in the Caatinga region. More commonly, inner bark or flowers are traditionally used to treat many painful and inflammatory processes. A common use of this plant is made by macerating a handful of its stem bark in a liter of wine or sugarcane brandy. It is drunk against stomachache, dysenteries, and diarrheas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ethanol extract of Caesalpinia pyramidalis inner bark was used in mice via oral route, at the doses of 10, 30, and 100mg/kg, in behavioral models of nociception and investigates some of the mechanisms underlying this effect. RESULTS: The ethanol extract (30 and 100mg/kg, P<0.001), given orally, produced dose dependent inhibition of acetic acid-induced visceral pain. The ethanol extract also caused significant and dose-dependent inhibition of capsaicin-(100mg/kg, P<0.001) and glutamate-(10, 30, and 100mg/kg, P<0.01) induced pain. The antinociception caused by the ethanol extract (30mg/kg) in the abdominal constriction test was significantly attenuated (P<0.001) by intraperitoneal treatment of mice with l-arginine (600mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the present results suggest that the ethanol extract of Caesalpinia pyramidalis produced dose-related antinociception in several models of pain through mechanisms that involved both glutamatergic system and/or the l-arginine–nitric oxide pathway, supporting the folkloric usage of the plant to treat various painful processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaesalpinia 3abark 3abrandy 3aethanol 3aflowers 3amice 3amodels 3anociception 3apain 3asugarcane 3atrees 3awines 2aAcetic Acid 2aAnalgesicsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAnimals 2aArgininexphysiology 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aCaesalpinia 2aCapsaicin 2aEthanolxchemistry 2aFemale 2aGlutamic Acid 2aMale 2aMice 2aNitric Oxidexphysiology 2aPainxchemically inducedxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Bark 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aSolventsxchemistry 3aBrazil1 aSantos, Dayanne S.1 aSantana, Danielle G.1 aThomazzi, Sara M.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 June 21, v. 148, no. 1 p.205-209dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.03.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03886naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011700172300001300289520218500302592002802487650003002515650002202545650001402567650001402581650001302595650002002608650003102628650001002659650001302669650001602682650002102698650001702719650001102736650001002747650002502757650001202782653003002794653001902824653003202843653001302875653001902888653002902907700002102936700002802957700002702985700002503012700006403037773014803101856008603249852000903335655001203344IND60532288520221122113106.0190214e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053228852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTapia, Daniel H.10aDifferences in learning and memory of host plant features between specialist and generalist phytophagous insects  ap. 1-10.  aInsects are able to learn from experience acquired in their natal habitat, thereby obtaining adaptive advantages. However, the acquisition of new information could involve defects in retrieving previously learned information (i.e. forgetting), a process known as retroactive interference, which diminishes learning capacities. In this study, we evaluated the learning capacity and the impact of retroactive interference during host searching by ecological specialist and generalist phytophagous insects. We examined whether the generalist aphid, Myzus persicae s. str., and the tobacco-specialized subspecies, Myzus persicae nicotianae differ in (1) learning capacity, or (2) retroactive interference during host selection, and (3) whether the learning-associated foraging gene (for) is differentially expressed. Differences in learning capacity and retroactive interference were assessed in bioassays using rearing hosts and alternative hosts followed by choices between or transferences to rearing or alternative hosts. During the pre-alighting phase of host searching, the generalist aphid showed attraction to the alternative host after 12h of experience, while the specialist showed no attraction to the alternative host regardless of the amount of time on the plant. The retroactive interference experiments showed that when aphids were exposed to an alternative host for different periods, odour attraction to the rearing host persisted in the generalist after 72h of experience on the alternative host, whereas in the specialist the attraction to the rearing host was lost after 12h of experience on the alternative host. During the post-alighting phase of host searching, both taxa performed better on their rearing hosts, but in the specialist aphid, a short period on the alternative host reversed this behaviour. In addition, the specialist showed lower levels of gene for expression, which could be associated with the differences in learning performance. Herein we present further evidence of differences in learning capacities between a specialist and a generalist aphid, which may influence the process of host searching and evolution of ecological specialization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyzus persicae nicotianae 3aalternative hosts 3abioassays 3aevolution 3aforaging 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3ahost preferences 3ahost seeking 3amemory 3aodors 3aphytophagous insects 3arearing 0aecological specialization 0ahost selection 0ainsect–plant relationship 0alearning 0aMyzus persicae 0aretroactive interference1 aSilva, Andrea X.1 aBallesteros, Gabriel I.1 aFigueroa, Christian C.1 aNiemeyer, Hermann M.1 aRamírez, Claudio C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6110-39730 tAnimal behaviour.g2015 Aug., v. 106 p.1-10dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001100151245021600162300001600378520118100394592002801575650002001603650002001623650002401643650002301667650001901690650001201709650001401721650002401735650000701759650001801766650002701784650001301811650001301824650001601837650001601853653005501869653002601924653003001950653001001980653002301990700001702013700001402030700001302044700001802057700001502075700001802090773009102108856008602199852000902285655001202294IND60625771220221123022722.0190131e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062577122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xi10aMicrowave assisted magnetic solid phase extraction using a novel amino-functionalized magnetic framework composite of type Fe3O4-NH2@MIL-101(Cr) for the determination of organochlorine pesticides in soil samples  ap. 572-578.  aIn this research, microwave assisted magnetic solid phase extraction (MAE-MSPE) coupled with GC-ECD have been successfully used for the determination of eight organochlorine pesticides in soil samples. Specially, the novel Fe3O4-NH2@MIL-101(Cr) composites as the MSPE sorbent played a role of selective enrichment and purification towards the targets. The MAE-MSPE procedure was optimized focusing on microwave extraction temperature and time, solution pH, the amount of sorbent, ultrasonic extraction time, ionic strength, elution solvent type, elution solvent volume, and elution time. The parameters of the analytical method were evaluated. Under the optimal condition, the detection limits of α-HCH, β-HCH, γ-HCH, δ-HCH, p,p′-DDE, p,p′-DDD, o,p′-DDT, and p,p′-DDT were in the range of 0.15–0.28 ng g−1. Satisfactory recoveries were obtained in the range of 71.2–102.4% with the RSDs less than 10.0%. The obtained results demonstrated that the method was suitable for the trace analysis of OCPs. Additionally, molecular docking was employed to calculate the molecular interactions and free binding energies between MIL-101(Cr) and the organochlorines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aHCH (pesticide) 3acomputer simulation 3agas chromatography 3aionic strength 3alindane 3amagnetism 3amicrowave treatment 3apH 3asoil sampling 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asorbents 3atemperature 3aultrasonics 0aMicrowave assisted magnetic solid phase extraction 0aFe3O4-NH2@MIL-101(Cr) 0aOrganochlorine pesticides 0aSoils 0aMolecular dockings1 aZhou, Yiyuan1 aYang, Wei1 aLi, Shuo1 aLiu, Tingting1 aWang, Ting1 aHou, Xiaohong0 tTalanta.g2019 May 01, v. 196 p.572-578dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245009100160300002000251500001900271520138100290592002801671650001501699650001501714650001801729650002201747650002601769650001301795650001401808650000701822650000901829650001501838700002401853700001501877700002501892700006501917700005701982773014202039856007902181852000902260655001202269IND60662496620210804000000.0190904e20190813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066249662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b032142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lian10aWater Flow Variability Affects Adsorption and Oxidation of Ciprofloxacin onto Hematite  ap. 10102-10109.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe mobility of pharmaceuticals in environmental systems is under great scrutiny in the scientific literature and in the press. Still, very few reports have focused on redox-driven transformations when these compounds are bound to mineral surfaces, and how their transport is affected under flow-through conditions. In this study, we examined the adsorption and electron transfer reactions of ciprofloxacin (CIP) in a dynamic column containing nanosized hematite (α-Fe₂O₃). CIP binding and the subsequent redox transformation were strongly dependent on inflow pH and residence time. These reactions could be predicted using transport models that account for adsorption and transformation kinetics. Our results show that flow interruption over a 16 h period triggers oxidation of hematite-bound CIP into byproducts. These reactions are likely facilitated by inner-sphere iron–CIP complexes formed via the sluggish conversion from outer-sphere complexes during interrupted flow. When intermittent flow/no-flow conditions were applied sequentially, a second byproduct was detected in the column effluent. This work sheds light on a much overseen aspect of redox transformations of antibiotics under flow-through conditions. It has important implications in adequately predicting transport, and in developing risk assessments of these emerging compounds in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abyproducts 3aciprofloxacin 3aelectron transfer 3aenvironmental science 3ahematite 3aoxidation 3apH 3arisk 3awater flow1 aMartin, Sébastien,1 aCheng, Wei1 aLassabatere, Laurent1 aBoily, Jean-François1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4954-64611 aHanna, Khalil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6072-12940 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Aug. 13, v. 53, no. 17 p.10102-10109dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b032143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014100169300001600310520110300326592002801429650004401457650002601501650001801527650001201545650001401557650001901571650000901590650001101599650001501610650001201625650001801637650001601655650001701671650001601688700001901704700002801723773010401751856008101855852000901936655001201945IND60119871620221120200100.0150110e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011987162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-014-1386-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCareche, Mercedes10aMonitoring the Time and Temperature History of Frozen Hake (Merluccius merluccius, L.)

Fillets of a total of 90 hake (Merluccius merluccius, L.), stored at −10, −20, −30 or −80 °C for up to 150 weeks, were used and lipids analysed by attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Three spectral regions corresponding to ν(C-H) vibrations (3,100–2,750 cm⁻¹), ν(C=O) vibrations from ester and carboxylic groups (1,800–1,670 cm⁻¹) and ν ₐₛ (PO₂⁻) phospholipid vibrations (1,330–1,127 cm⁻¹) were studied separately. Principal component scores were used as the response variables for the kinetic modelling. Three models were obtained, each per region, and the best one resulted from the region corresponding to the phosphorous moiety of the phospholipids with R² = 0.93. They kept a close relationship with other reported quality parameter such as Kramer shear resistance which suggests their potential for the estimation of frozen storage time and temperature in fishery products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aMerluccius merluccius 3abioprocessing 3afillets 3afisheries 3afrozen storage 3ahake 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amuscles 3aphospholipids 3areflectance 3astorage time 3atemperature1 aCarmona, Pedro1 aSánchez-Alonso, Isabel0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2015 Jan., v. 8, no. 1 p.112-119dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-014-1386-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013500173300001600308520117100324592002801495650000901523650001401532650001801546650002001564650001801584650001601602650002501618650001401643700002101657700001601678773007301694856008401767852000901851655001201860IND60096566520221117225008.0141104e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009656652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.07.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheikholeslami, M.10aNumerical investigation of MHD effects on Al₂O₃–water nanofluid flow and heat transfer in a semi-annulus enclosure using LBM  ap. 501-510.  aIn this study, free convection heat transfer in a concentric annulus between a cold square and heated elliptic cylinders in presence of magnetic field is investigated. The square and elliptic cylinders are maintained at uniform temperatures and it is assumed that the walls are insulating magnetic field. Lattice Boltzmann method is applied to solve the governing equations. The effective thermal conductivity and viscosity of nanofluid are calculated by KKL (Koo–Kleinstreuer–Li) correlation. In this model effect of Brownian motion on the effective thermal conductivity is considered. The numerical investigation is carried out for different governing parameters namely; the Hartmann number, Rayleigh number and nanoparticle volume fraction. Also a correlation of Nusselt number corresponding to active parameters is presented. The results reveal that average Nusselt number is an increasing function of nanoparticle volume fraction and Rayleigh number, while it is a decreasing function of Hartmann number. Moreover it can be found that the enhancement in heat transfer increases as Hartmann number increases but it decreases with increase of Rayleigh number.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3aequations 3aheat transfer 3amagnetic fields 3ananoparticles 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 3aviscosity1 aGorji-Bandpy, M.1 aGanji, D.D.0 tEnergy.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 60 p.501-510dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.07.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010500167300001400272520162300286592002801909650002201937650001301959650001201972650002201984650001902006650002102025650002402046650002202070650001302092650001602105650001802121650001702139650001302156650001202169650001702181651001302198700002102211700002102232700002102253700002102274773015302295856008102448852000902529655001202538IND60679506620221119233320.0191228e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067950662DNAL7 a10.1007/s12892-019-0091-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBirhan, Techale10aEvaluation and Genetic Analysis of a Segregating Sorghum Population under Moisture Stress Conditions  ap. 29-38.  aIntensive evaluation of segregating populations for a pattern of drought stress in a target region is one of the best ways to select genotypes that mitigate adverse effect of drought. However, evaluation for yield and drought tolerance-related traits and genetic analysis using segregating populations under moisture stress is so far rare in Ethiopia. The present study was initiated to evaluate sorghum segregating populations, estimate the genetic variability, and identify the best-performing genotypes for yield and drought tolerance under moisture stress. The study was conducted during the 2016/2017 cropping season at Kobo and Meiso research stations. A bi-parental population was obtained from crossing two parents (Meco-1 x Birmash) with contrasting traits for drought tolerance. A total of 207 F2:3 genotypes were evaluated using an alpha lattice design. The sorghum genotypes were significantly different in their response to drought stress. Genotypes 26, 162, 187, 157, and 170 at Kobo and 42, 82, 87, 152, and 139 at Meiso were the best-performing genotypes in terms of grain yield. The shortest dates to flowering were registered from genotypes 42, 73, 57, 71, and 200 at Kobo and genotype 34, at Meiso suggesting the use of these materials for specific area moisture adaptations and drought escape. High heritability coupled with high genetic advance as percent of mean was noted for panicle harvest index and 1000-seed weight; hence, good progress is expected from selection for these traits. These genotypes appear well suited for further specific area drought stress adaptation breeding and research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3acrossing 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aflowering date 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3aheritability 3apanicles 3aparents 3awater stress 3aEthiopia1 aBantte, Kassahun1 aPaterson, Andrew1 aGetenet, Mihrete1 aGabizew, Aregash0 tJournal of crop science and biotechnology.g2020 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.29-38dThe Korean Society of Crop SciencewJournal:J000000101x1975-94797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12892-019-0091-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245007300158300001600231520260100247592002802848650001302876650001202889650001502901650001602916650001502932650001002947650001302957650001502970650001402985650001402999650001403013650002503027650001603052650001603068700002403084773011003108856007103218852000903289655001203298IND60518277420221122185221.0160411e197902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051827742DNAL7 a10.2307/19425132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGowan, John A.10aStructure in the Copepod Community of the North Pacific Central Gyre  ap. 195-226.  aThe North Pacific central gyre is a large, monotonous, and geologically old system. It (and other such gyres) is probably the nearest oceanic equivalent to an essentially self—regulating, climax ecosystem. We have taken a series of replicated, vertically stratified net tows for macrozooplankton and have replicated measures of a number of habitat variables. Copepods are the most numerous members of the macrozooplankton fraction of the community of the central gyre. It is likely that they are also the largest part of the biomass. There are at least 125 species regularly present and although we do not know what many of them eat, certain species can almost certainly be identified as herbivores or carnivores, and others as omnivores. We show that some species are significantly more frequent parts of each other's biotic environment than other species. These recurrent groups of species tend to occupy different depth zones. The members of the groups show strong concordance of abundance at the depth of high group coherence. Thus there is a dividing up of the water column and a clear tendency for vertical spatial structure in the copepod fauna. Within groups there is a significant constancy of dominance at the group's preferred depth over time. Thus there appears to be a large amount of species structure as well as spatial structure. A highly regulated species equilibrium is implied. There are congeners occurring within the same recurrent groups. The physical and biotic environment of each group differs with respect to both concentration (e.g., chlorophyll α) or magnitude (e.g., temperature) of habitat variables and with respect to the spatial variability of these. Our most diverse group tends to occupy a depth zone ranking high in primary productivity but does not have the greatest total environmental ᵣichness or greatest or least heterogeneity, and this seems contrary to what some current community theory predicts. Our evidence indicates that within groups many similar species coexist spatially and temporally. We speculate about the relative roles of competition and predation influencing the structure we see. Aspects of modern community theory, based on competitive equilibrium, seem inadequate to explain our results. Predator regulation of structure seems a more likely explanation. However, existing information indicates a lack of sufficient specialization of what we believe to be the main predators on copepods to account for the observed constancy of copepod species structure. We suggest that a more intensive study of the role of predation is in order.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3abiomass 3acarnivores 3achlorophyll 3aecosystems 3afauna 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3aomnivores 3apredation 3apredators 3aprimary productivity 3atemperature 3azooplankton1 aWalker, Patricia W.0 tEcological monographs.g1979 Feb., v. 49, no. 2 p.195-226dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19425133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002800141245009900169300001600268520138100284592002801665653002401693653001101717653002201728653001401750653002201764773011401786856007701900852000901977655001201986IND60127704520221119093300.0151110e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012770452DNAL7 a10.1897/2004-020R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTannenbaum, Lawrence V.10aTwo Simple Algorithms for Refining Mammalian Receptor Selection in Ecological Risk Assessments  ap. 290-298.  aAlthough guidelines exist for selecting appropriate ecological receptors for risk assessments at contaminated sites, it can be demonstrated that many of the mammals commonly evaluated are spatially irrelevant. Terrestrial risk assessments could be simplified and made more efficient, though, if mammals that are initially considered were screened for their spatial relevance. This article presents 2 simple algorithms that each demonstrate that most mammalian receptors are not spatially relevant for the overwhelming majority of hazardous waste and other contaminated sites. The algorithms use readily available and curiously overlooked spatial distribution (e.g., animal density) information and suggest that contaminated sites need to be 80 to 100 acres in size to justify the inclusion of most mammalian receptors. Given that hazardous waste sites are generally much smaller than this, many ecological risk assessments (ERA) could reasonably dispense with incorporating mammals entirely. An awareness on the part of decision makers and risk managers of the nonsuitability of many mammalian receptors evaluated in terrestrial ERAs could significantly impact the perceived need to monitor or remediate sites. This article also examines the anticipated challenges of regulators and other decision makers when entertaining the notion of a spatial relevance screen for mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEcological receptor 0aMammal 0aSpatial relevance 0aScreening 0aContaminated site0 tIntegrated Environmental Assessment and Management.g2005 July, v. 1, no. 3 p.290-298dSETACx1551-37937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897%2F2004-020R.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100007000155245015000225500002200375520136900397592002801766650001201794650001601806650000901822650001901831650001501850650002001865650001401885650001201899650001001911650001401921650002301935650001501958650001401973650001801987650001502005650001802020650001102038650000902049650001002058651001102068653002502079653001502104653003502119653003102154653003702185700003202222700004002254700002602294700003602320773008802356856009002444852000902534655001202543IND60655261220221119194400.0190801e20190730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065526122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1244992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Guilherme Martins1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1153-723610aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in tree barks, gaseous and particulate phase samples collected near an industrial complex in São Paulo (Brazil)  aPre-press version  aUrban trees are a new tool for pollutant monitoring since gaseous and particulate pollutants can deposit in its barks. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) levels were determined in gaseous phase samples collected in polyurethane foam (PUF), total suspended particles (TSP) samples collected in quartz fiber filters and tree bark samples (Tipuana and Sibipiruna) collected in the surroundings of an industrial complex in the metropolitan area of São Paulo. Benzo(b)fluoranthene presented the highest average concentration in the TSP samples and phenanthrene, the highest average concentration in the PUF samples; the sum of carcinogenic equivalents for benzo(a)pyrene (BaPEq) for both phases was above 20 ng m−3, representing a high cancer risk. The most abundant PAH for tree barks was fluoranthene; low weight PAHs presented a higher abundance than the observed in TSP. Coronene (vehicular exhaust marker) presented good correlations with fluoranthene in the tree bark samples, suggesting an influence of vehicular emissions. A tree bark sample collected near the petrochemical area presented biomarkers of petrogenic origin (hopanoids) in the mass spectrum and an unresolved complex mixture (UCM) profile. The results suggested an influence of both vehicular and industrial sources on the air quality observed in the atmosphere and tree barks samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTipuana 3aair quality 3abark 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3abiomarkers 3acarcinogenicity 3aemissions 3afilters 3afoams 3ahopanoids 3ametropolitan areas 3amonitoring 3aneoplasms 3aphenanthrenes 3apollutants 3apolyurethanes 3aquartz 3arisk 3atrees 3aBrazil 0aIndustrial emissions 0aTree barks 0aAtmospheric particulate matter 0aGaseous organic pollutants 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons1 aEllen da Silva Caumo, Sofia1 aMota do Nascimento, Emerson Queiroz1 aParra, Yendry Jomolca1 ade Castro Vasconcellos, Pérola0 tChemosphere.g2019 July 30,  p.124499-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1244993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013400163300001400297520181500311592002802126650002402154650002002178650001002198650002002208650001202228650001602240650001102256650001402267650002002281650001202301650001802313650001002331700001802341700001802359700001702377773015302394856008102547852000902628655001202637IND60679506820221119233416.0191228e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067950682DNAL7 a10.1007/s12892-019-0345-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeo, Ji Hye10aGrowth Responses and Differences in Gene Expression depending on Cultivation Temperature between Alternative type Wheat Varieties  ap. 47-55.  aTwo domestic wheat varieties were grown in the growth chamber set at 17°C, 20°C, 23°C and 26°C on average after the emergence of three above-ground leaves to compare the response to high-temperature stress in different varieties. Periodic growth surveys were conducted to observe changes in growth stages. After the maturation stage, the spikes of experimental wheat were harvested to observe the phenotypic characteristics of grains. All varieties showed poor growth at a daily average of 26°C. Suan at 26°C treatment showed severe yellowing and death of leaves, but heading was progressed, but Joeun at 26°C treatment could not enter into the heading stage and finally died. The size and weight of grains decreased at 23°C treatment than 17°C treatment in both Joeun and Suan. To determine the difference in growth response between varieties at different temperatures at gene level, RT-qPCR was carried out using Suan and Joeun samples after 50 days of temperature treatment at 17°C and 23°C. Comparison of the expression patterns of 15 genes known to be related to high-temperature stress found that the expression patterns of HsfA3, PIF4, PhyB, and MYB73 showed opposite trends according to the temperature treatment. All genes showed higher levels of expression in the Suan than in the Joeun as the temperature increased except VRN-A1. The differences in the expression patterns of the genes between varieties make a difference in growth characteristics according to varieties under high-temperature conditions. Both Joeun and Suan cultivars showed similar characteristics in terms of needs of low temperature for vernalization. However, their physiological response to high ambient temperature was quite different. Different varieties are expected to have different stress response strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth chambers 3aheading 3aheat stress 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3astress response 3asurveys 3avernalization 3awheat1 aSeong, Hye Ju1 aYang, Woon Ho1 aJung, Woosuk0 tJournal of crop science and biotechnology.g2020 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.47-55dThe Korean Society of Crop SciencewJournal:J000000101x1975-94797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12892-019-0345-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009700166300001400263500001500277520163300292592002801925650002101953650001801974650000901992650001402001650001402015650002402029650002502053650001702078650001802095650002102113650001502134650001302149650002102162650002402183651001602207653002502223700001902248773008702267856008102354852000902435655001202444IND60123881820221119135824.0150411e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012388182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00035-014-0142-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeller, Roland10aClonal growth and demography of a hemicryptophyte alpine plant: Leontopodium alpinum Cassini  ap. 31-40.  a2019-12-04  aClonally reproducing hemicryptophytic rosette plants are common in the alpine belt. However, their demography and, indirectly, their growth and reproductive strategy in these harsh conditions were rarely studied. We analysed the morphology, clonal reproduction and demography of one such species, Leontopodium alpinum, in two populations of the Swiss Alps. The species forms small colonies of 1–5 (maximum 30) sterile rosettes with a few flowering stalks. After flowering, the apical meristem dies and one or two new axillary buds grow below the previous rosette in the following year, developing into short rhizomes (<2 cm), which decay after 4 years. The new stalk produces sterile rosettes before flowering after 2–4 years, depending on climatic conditions. The apical meristem often dies during the sterile stage, and is replaced by a new axillary bud. Levkovitch matrices on two stages (sterile and flowering rosettes) showed that rosette survival and clonal reproduction maintain long-lived populations (λ = 0.96). Elasticities indicated that a change in the survival of sterile rosettes had the strongest effect on population dynamics, and this stage lasts, on average, 6.8 years at 2,480 m. Altogether, L. alpinum is following Tomlinson’s architectural model. This growth form appears perfectly adapted to harsh alpine conditions: the clonal ramification ensures longevity to genets and the semelparous behaviour of the rosettes allows an efficient flowering, whatever the climatic conditions. L. alpinum appears to follow a common growth model among rosette possessing hemicryptophytes in the alpine belt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapical meristems 3aalpine plants 3abuds 3aflowering 3alongevity 3aLeontopodium nivale 3aasexual reproduction 3aelasticities 3agrowth models 3ahemicryptophytes 3ademography 3arhizomes 3aclimatic factors 3apopulation dynamics 3aAlps region 0aLeontopodium alpinum1 aVittoz, Pascal0 tAlpine botany.g2015 Apr., v. 125, no. 1 p.31-40dSpringer-Verlagx1664-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00035-014-0142-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015500167300001400322520149300336592002801829650001901857650002201876650002401898650001801922650001101940650001501951650001201966650001501978650003101993650001202024650001302036650002102049650002202070700002402092700002402116700002402140773008702164856008102251852000902332655001202341IND60123881920221119135712.0150411e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012388192DNAL7 a10.1007/s00035-014-0143-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLonati, Michele10aNitrogen fixation assessment in a legume-dominant alpine community: comparison of different reference species using the 15N isotope dilution technique  ap. 51-58.  aIn arctic and alpine environments the highest biologically fixed nitrogen inputs are measured in the presence of leguminous plants, with a maximum annual nitrogen input recorded of about 10 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹. Among the high-elevation legumes, Trifolium alpinum spreads over many southern European mountain grasslands as a dominant or co-dominant species, accounting for 30–40 % or more of total above-ground phytomass. We estimated the amount of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in T. alpinum-dominant communities using the¹⁵N isotope dilution technique and comparing the calculations derived from different non-fixing reference species. The estimated percentage of nitrogen derived from the atmosphere varied significantly depending on the reference species used and they were comparable to the ones reported in literature. No differences were detected among years. In the community studied, the use of one reference species instead of another can yield differences of more than 10 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹, which may represent a considerable difference in the estimation of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in alpine ecosystems. Taking a very precautionary approach and using the grass Nardus stricta as the reference species, we estimated 21.9 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹of nitrogen fixation in T. alpinum-dominant communities. This quantity of nitrogen is the highest ever estimated in a natural alpine grassland and it is related to the high annual above-ground phytomass of T. alpinum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNardus stricta 3aTrifolium alpinum 3aaboveground biomass 3aalpine plants 3abotany 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aisotope dilution technique 3alegumes 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fixation1 aProbo, Massimiliano1 aGorlier, Alessandra1 aLombardi, Giampiero0 tAlpine botany.g2015 Apr., v. 125, no. 1 p.51-58dSpringer-Verlagx1664-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00035-014-0143-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245010600209520134700315592002801662650001501690650001001705650002101715650001701736650002601753650001701779650001001796650001701806650002401823650001701847650001801864650001301882650000701895650001701902650001101919650001601930653001801946653001601964653001701980653001801997653002902015700001702044700005302061773010402114856008702218852000902305655001202314IND60694081020221120023953.0201209e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069408102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1111072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huaxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1739-012410aAlbumin-gated zwitterion-stabilized mesoporous silica nanorod as a pH-responsive drug delivery system  aSilica nanoparticles as drug delivery systems (DDS) have received huge attention in nanomedicine research. However, their drug release processes were usually discussed in the absence of proteins, which are abundant in real delivery media and likely to affect the release behaviors. In this work, novel pH-sensitive silica-based DDSs were constructed using the endogenous protein, human serum albumin (HSA), as the gatekeeper, and their release properties in protein-containing media were measured for the first time. As-synthesized mesoporous silica nanorod (MSNR) was modified with zwitterions to suppress the nonspecific adsorption of protein and to improve the dispersity. HSA was fixed onto MSNR through drug-protein interactions and covalent bonds, respectively. Benzoic-imine bonds were introduced into the designs to realize pH responsiveness. The fluorescence quenching effect of drugs on HSA was used to monitor the drug release in simulated body fluids containing proteins. The results indicated that protein gating could effectively reduce premature release in normal blood environment. The endogenous protein capping, high dispersity and stability, considerable loading content, low cytotoxicity and favorable responsiveness to acidic microenvironment enable the present structures to be promising carriers for chemotherapy drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ablood 3achemical bonding 3acytotoxicity 3adrug delivery systems 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3ahuman serum albumin 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3apH 3aporous media 3asilica 3azwitterions 0aSerum albumin 0aZwitterions 0aDrug vehicle 0apH-responsive 0aSynchronous fluorescence1 aXia, Qinghua1 aZhou, Dan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8194-67160 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Sept., v. 193 p.111107-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1111073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012700160520148500287592002801772650002501800650001701825650001501842650002001857650002201877650002101899650002201920651001001942700001901952773012701971856007402098852000902172655001202181IND60652859820221119162711.0190713e20190318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065285982DNAL7 a10.3390/su110616172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Xiaohua 10aExploring Participatory Microregeneration as Sustainable Renewal of Built Heritage Community: Two Case Studies in Shanghai  aSince the 1990s, Shanghai has experienced massive urban development and renewal as ways to respond to its demographic, economic, and living space needs. Previous policies have led to the demolishment of many historical communities and valuable heritage housing. The existing ones continue to face extreme threats, such as bad physical conditions and the marginalization of communities. Yet there is a recent trend that emphasizes sustainable urban renewal named microregeneration (微更新), launched by municipal and local states since 2016. One of the main approaches of the initiative was to form new urban coalitions to focus on collaborative governance that helps integrate different agents&rsquo; expertise and values for more sustainable urban developments and renewals. This paper explores two cases on how this concept has emerged. The first case is An Shan Si Cun (鞍山四村). This housing block was built in the 1950s for employees of some state-owned enterprises. The second case is Jing Lao Cun (敬老邨). This alley house neighborhood was built in 1930s for migrants who came to Shanghai. Furthermore, this paper is to explore and compare their approaches to sustainable urban renewal, which attempts to preserve these communities that represent cultural and built heritage in Shanghai. Specifically, this paper examines the challenges and accomplishments of these experiments, and discusses policy implications for future tactics of sustainable urban renewal.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3agovernance 3ahuman resources 3aissues and policy 3apublic ownership 3aurban development 3aChina1 aLeung, Ho  Hon0 tSustainability.g2019 Mar. 18, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110616173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03912naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245018900160300001600349520166000365536028802025592002802313650001402341650002102355650001502376650002102391650000902412650001502421650002302436650001502459650001102474650002502485650001602510650003102526650002702557650001702584653002602601653002502627653002202652653000902674653002202683653002602705653003102731700001302762700002902775700001502804700001602819700001902835700001402854700001702868700001702885700001902902700001602921700001802937700001502955700001302970700001402983700001702997700002903014773010603043856008003149852000903229655001203238IND60614993820221120080032.0181003e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061499382DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858135093882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeña, L.10aCanine Mammary TumorsbA Review and Consensus of Standard Guidelines on Epithelial and Myoepithelial Phenotype Markers, HER2, and Hormone Receptor Assessment Using Immunohistochemistry  ap. 127-145.  aAlthough there have been several studies on the use of immunohistochemical biomarkers of canine mammary tumors (CMTs), the results are difficult to compare. This article provides guidelines on the most useful immunohistochemical markers to standardize their use and understand how outcomes are measured, thus ensuring reproducibility of results. We have reviewed the biomarkers of canine mammary epithelial and myoepithelial cells and identified those biomarkers that are most useful and those biomarkers for invasion and lymph node micrometastatic disease. A 10% threshold for positive reaction for most of these markers is recommended. Guidelines on immunolabeling for HER2, estrogen receptors (ERs), and progesterone receptors (PRs) are provided along with the specific recommendations for interpretation of the results for each of these biomarkers in CMTs. Only 3+ HER2-positive tumors should be considered positive, as found in human breast cancer. The lack of any known response to adjuvant endocrine therapy of ER- and PR-positive CMTs prevents the use of the biological positive/negative threshold used in human breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry results of ER and PR in CMTs should be reported as the sum of the percentage of positive cells and the intensity of immunolabeling (Allred score). Incorporation of these recommendations in future studies, either prospective or retrospective, will provide a mechanism for the direct comparison of studies and will help to determine whether these biomarkers have prognostic significance. Finally, these biomarkers may ascertain the most appropriate treatment(s) for canine malignant mammary neoplasms.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work has been partially supported by grants AGL2011-025553 (Ministry of Science and Innovation) and BIO-287 (Junta de Andalucía, Spain).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aanimal pathology 3abiomarkers 3abreast neoplasms 3adogs 3aepithelium 3aestrogen receptors 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alymph nodes 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3aprogesterone receptors 3atherapeutics 0acanine mammary tumors 0aimmunohistochemistry 0aphenotype markers 0aHER2 0aestrogen receptor 0aprogesterone receptor 0aconsensual recommendations1 aGama, A.1 aGoldschmidt, Michael H.,1 aAbadie, J.1 aBenazzi, C.1 aCastagnaro, M.1 aDíez, L.1 aGartner, F.,1 aHellmén, E.1 aKiupel, Matti,1 aMillán, Y.1 aMiller, M.

Herein, we successfully used single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis to crystallographically visualize I₂ binding sites in two isostructural metal–organic frameworks, viz. Co₂(m-DOBDC) (m-DOBDC⁴– = 4,6-dioxo-1,3-benzenedicarboxylate) and Co₂(p-DOBDC) (p-DOBDC⁴– = 2,5-dioxo-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), with increasing I₂ loading. Interestingly, the C–H bond at the electron-rich carbon (C5) of m-DOBDC⁴⁻ is activated toward electrophilic aromatic substitution, forming an aryl C–I bond and I– or I₃– that coordinates to unsaturated open Co sites. Cooperation between the ligand and the open Co sites leads to rapid chemisorption of I₂ even under mild adsorption conditions, such as room temperature. In contrast, molecular I₂ coordinates to the open Co sites of Co₂(p-DOBDC). Owing to the chemisorption of I₂, I₂@Co₂(m-DOBDC) decomposes at a much higher temperature than I₂@Co₂(p-DOBDC), as revealed by thermogravimetric analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3aaromatic compounds 3abinding sites 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3achemical bonding 3acoordination polymers 3aiodine 3aligands 3astorage time 3athermogravimetry 0aiodine capture 0achemisorption 0ametal−organic frameworks 0aaryl C−H bond activation 0asingle crystal−single crystal transformation1 aChen, Ying-Pin1 aPark, Jinkyu1 aPark, Jinhee1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7755-58890 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 June 26, v. 11, no. 29 p.25817-25823dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b047683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04273naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245009600183300001600279500001500295520204800310592002802358650003402386650003602420650001802456650001802474650002502492650001102517650003702528650001202565650002402577650002102601650001502622650001702637650002602654650002202680650001002702650002002712650001702732650002102749650001802770650002202788650004502810650001502855650002102870650001602891650003202907650001102939650001102950650003202961650002702993650003803020650004703058650002003105650004603125650005203171653001803223700002003241700002003261700002003281700002003301773011703321856008103438990002303519852000903542655001203551IND60093642220221116232419.0141103e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009364222DNAL7 a220334752pmid7 a10.1016/j.cbi.2011.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Kuei-Li10aAntimetastatic effect and mechanism of ovatodiolide in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells  ap. 148-158.  a2019-12-06  aCancer metastasis is a primary cause of cancer death. Ovatodiolide, a bioactive cembrane-type diterpenoid isolated from Anisomeles indica (L.) Kuntze (Labiatae), has been shown to inhibit the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. However, the anti-metastatic effects of ovatodiolide on highly metastatic human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells remain unclear. In this study, we first noted that ovatodiolide inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion by wound-healing assay and Boyden chamber assay. Western blot, gelatin zymography and reversed transcription-PCR analysis showed that ovatodiolide significantly and selectively suppressed the expression, activation, and mRNA of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in a concentration-dependent manner. Ovatodiolide significantly decreased the nuclear level of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB), increased inhibitor of kappaBα (IκBα) through preventing phosphorylation of upstream signal IκB kinase (IKK). Pretreatment with a specific NF-κB inhibitor (PDTC) and an IκB protease inhibitor (TPCK) also reduced MMP-9 activity, cell migration and cell invasion. Moreover, ovatodiolide can suppress activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt, while it did not affect phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulating kinases (ERK)1/2. Additionally, the treatment of inhibitors specific for PI3K (wortmannin), JNK (SP600125) or p38 MAPK (SB203580) to MDA-MB-231 cells could result in a reduced activation of MMP-9, concomitantly with a marked inhibition on cell migration and invasion. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ovatodiolide inhibits the metastatic ability of MDA-MB-231 cells by reducing MMP-9 activity through suppressing JNK, p38 MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and inhibiting NF-κB activity. These results are the first to reveal the function of ovatodiolide in tumor metastasis and its underlying molecular mechanism, thus suggesting ovatodiolide to be a promising antimetastatic agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3amessenger RNA 3acell movement 3abioactive properties 3ahumans 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3agelatin 3asignal transduction 3aWestern blotting 3ametastasis 3aditerpenoids 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aAnisomeles indica 3adeath 3aphosphorylation 3agelatinase B 3abreast neoplasms 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Western 2aBreast Neoplasmsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCell Cycle 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aDNA Primers 2aDiterpenesxtherapeutic use 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMAP Kinase Signaling System 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aNeoplasm Metastasisxdrug therapy 2aPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinasesxmetabolism 2aPhosphorylation 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-aktxmetabolism 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 0acell invasion1 aTsai, Pei-Chien1 aHsieh, Chi-Ying1 aChang, Long-Sen1 aLin, Shinne-Ren0 tChemico-biological interactions.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 194, no. 2-3 p.148-158dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-27977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2011.10.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245020400160520180100364592002802165650002102193650001502214650001102229650002302240650001802263650001702281650001502298650001202313650002002325650002202345650002002367650001402387650001502401650001802416650001502434650001602449650001802465650000902483653002202492653001802514653001602532653002902548653001702577653002302594700001402617700001702631700001302648700001702661700001102678700001802689700001302707700001602720700001602736773011202752856008302864852000902947655001202956IND60701031820221121214551.0201111e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070103182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2020.1124082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Yu10aOne-step modification of nano-polyaniline/glucose oxidase on double-side printed flexible electrode for continuous glucose monitoring: Characterization, cytotoxicity evaluation and in vivo experiment  aThe single-step modification of the nanostructured polyaniline (PANI)/glucose oxidase (GOD) enzyme on double-sided, screen-printed, flexible electrodes doped with Prussian blue (PB), has been achieved and successfully applied in continuous glucose monitoring in vivo, and its biocompatibility has been evaluated systematically. The proposed fabrication procedure is simple, low cost, and suitable for large-scale production. PB doped with carbon ink catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) in low-voltage conditions, which could help eliminate interferences. And the PANI/GOD nanostructure makes the GOD enzyme more stable for long-term, in vivo monitoring. More importantly, a polyurethane (PU) layer is deposited on the electrode's surface as a diffusion limiting membrane that enhanced the linear range and biocompatibility. In tests in vitro, the proposed biosensor achieved a linear range of 0–12 mM and a good sensitivity of 16.66 μA·mM⁻¹·cm⁻²(correlation coefficient R² = 0.9962) with an excellent specificity to glucose. The biosensor exhibits long-term stability, with a maximum lifespan of 14 days when stored in phosphate buffer solution at 4 °C, and achieves a sensitivity of 120%. The biocompatibilities of the electrode materials have also been systematically evaluated in cytotoxicity and cell adhesion tests to ensure the safety of implantation. In experiments in vivo, the biosensor can successfully monitor the glucose level fluctuation of rats after 24 h following implantation. Overall, the biosensor fabricated with the double-side, screen-printing process, satisfies the glucose monitoring range in vivo and eliminates various types of interference, thus establishing a new, large-scale production procedure for flexible in vivo biosensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiosensors 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3acell adhesion 3acytotoxicity 3aelectrodes 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ain vivo studies 3alongevity 3amonitoring 3ananomaterials 3aphosphates 3apolyaniline 3apolyurethanes 3arats 0aGlucose biosensor 0aPrussian blue 0aPolyaniline 0aScreen-printed electrode 0aCytotoxicity 0aImplantable sensor1 aLiang, Bo1 aChen, Shidie1 aZhu, Qin1 aTu, Tingting1 aWu, Ke1 aCao, Qingpeng1 aFang, Lu1 aLiang, Xiao1 aYe, Xuesong0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 165 p.112408-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.1124083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001900135245010900154300001500263520106400278592002801342650002201370650002501392650001501417650002701432700001601459700001801475700001901493700001801512700001701530773015201547856006901699856010601768990002301874852000901897655001201906IND60688041520221121235803.0200407e20200406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068804152DNAL7 a10.3791/606942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Myeongjin10aStudy of a dot-patterning process on flexible materials using impact print-type hot embossing technology  ap. e60694.  aHere we present our study on an impact print-type hot embossing process which can create dot patterns with various designs, widths, and depths in real time on polymer film. In addition, we implemented a control system for the on-off motion and position of the impact header to engrave different dot patterns. We performed dot patterning on various polymer films, such as polyester (PET) film, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film. The dot patterns were measured using a confocal microscope, and we confirmed that the impact print-type hot embossing process produces fewer errors during the dot patterning process. As a result, the impact print-type hot embossing process is found to be suitable for engraving dot patterns on different types of polymer films. In addition, unlike the conventional hot embossing process, this process does not use an embossing stamp. Therefore, the process is simple and can create dot patterns in real time, presenting unique advantages for mass production and small-quantity batch production.  aPublisher supplied data 3afilms (materials) 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolyesters 3apolymethylmethacrylate1 aAhn, Jaewon1 aBae, Junseong1 aSong, Jinhyeok1 aKim, Donghyun1 aYun, Dongwon0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2020 Apr. 06, , no. 158 p.e60694-e60694dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/606943Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/60694/study-dot-patterning-process-on-flexible-materials-using-impact-print  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01762naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245007700203300001600280506007600296520054500372592002800917506003700945650001000982650001500992650001401007650000901021650001101030650001801041650001801059650003001077700002301107700001501130773014301145856007901288852000901367655001201376IND60312927920221207132847.0150714e20141031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031292792DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12589962doi7 aPMC46315242pmcid7 a253599722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoo, William10aDendrite morphogenesis depends on relative levels of NT-3/TrkC signaling  ap. 626-629.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMaking dendritic arbors during development Developing axons are known to compete for limiting, target-derived neurotrophins for survival and growth in the peripheral nervous system.

The ability of workers to detect and remove unhealthy or dead brood prevents the transmission of brood diseases inside the colony. Over the last five decades, this trait has been extensively studied and improved in several research and breeding programs. Given the strong interest for hygienic behavior, we here review the costs and benefits associated with this trait, extending preceding reviews on this subject from the late 1990s. Since the 1990s, there have been no major new insights on the efficiency of this behavior against American foulbrood and chalkbrood. However, the number of publications on hygienic behavior against the mite Varroa destructor has considerably increased, fueling the debate regarding the efficiency of hygienic behavior against this parasite. Breeding programs have shown that selection for a specific trait might also impact other traits. Thus, we also review the cost of trade-offs between hygienic behavior and other economically important traits for bee breeders. Overall, the benefits of hygienic behavior seem to largely outweigh its costs for both colonies and bee breeders.  aPublisher supplied data  aD31-1328cService public de Wallonie 3aAmerican foul brood 3aApis mellifera 3aVarroa destructor 3aagricultural research 3achalk brood 3ahoney 3ahygiene 3aimmunity 3amites 3aparasites 0ahygienic behavior 0aefficiency 0achalkbrood 0aAmerican foulbrood1 aPannebakker, Bart1 aGengler, Nicolas1 aNguyen, Bach Kim1 aFrancis, Frédéric0 tJournal of agricultural research.g2017 Aug. 8, v. 56, no. 4 p.366-375dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2017.13279383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015700166520155300323592002801876650002301904650001501927650001101942650001701953650001801970650001901988650001102007650001402018650000902032650001802041650003202059650003102091650002302122650001202145650001602157653003802173653002102211653002302232653001802255653003002273653001602303700001502319700001702334700001302351700001502364700001802379773011102397856008602508852000902594655001202603IND60749375720221121002813.0211030e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074937572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1106692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jing10aEffects of high-temperature pressure cooking on cold-grind and blanched soymilk: Physico-chemical properties, in vitro digestibility and sensory quality  aThe present work investigated effects of high-temperature pressure cooking (HP) on physico-chemical properties and in vitro protein digestibility of cold-grind soymilk (CS) and blanched soymilk (BS). Confocal laser scanning microscopy presented that proteins and lipids in BS were obviously coalesced compared with CS, while HP treatment contributed to homogeneous dispersion of protein and lipid. Particle size of the BS and BSHP were larger than that of CS and CSHP. Tertiary structure of protein suggested that hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds in CS and CSHP were main force among protein molecules. Meanwhile hydrophobic interactions were account for 70% of the total bonds in BS and BSHP. The maximum fluorescence excitation wavelength (λₘₐₓ) of BSHP (349.0 nm) was shown a red shift compared with CS (346.5 nm). For secondary structure of protein, β-sheet was 30.61% in CS, while CSHP, BS and BSHP decreased by 2.65%, 5.73% and 7.77%, respectively. Thus, the protein in BS and BSHP were evidently aggregated, loose and disorder; while the CS and CSHP protein were dense and orderly. Also, HP treatment led to loose and unordered protein structure. Moreover, the in vitro digestibility was BSHP > BS > CSHP > CS. The difference in digestibility of four soymilk was determined by the protein structure. Sensory evaluation showed that blanching treatment effectively reduced beany flavor and HP decreased the diameter of oil bodies of BS, which led to smooth mouth feel and thus the highest global impression of BSHP.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigestible protein 3adisulfides 3aflavor 3afluorescence 3afood research 3ahydrophobicity 3alipids 3amouthfeel 3aoils 3aparticle size 3aprotein secondary structure 3aprotein tertiary structure 3asensory evaluation 3asoymilk 3awavelengths 0aHigh-temperature pressure cooking 0aBlanched soymilk 0aCold-grind soymilk 0aDigestibility 0aProtein spatial structure 0aAggregation1 aLi, Mengdi1 aZhang, Jiayu1 aLv, Ying1 aLi, Xingyu1 aGuo, Shuntang0 tFood research international.g2021 Nov., v. 149 p.110669-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1106693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012500172520152100297592002801818650002201846650002001868650001501888650001901903650001901922650003001941650002301971650002001994650002102014650001502035650002002050650002902070650001302099650001802112650002602130650002302156653001602179653001902195653001502214653001702229653003202246700002402278700002102302700002502323700002002348700002102368773011202389856008302501852000902584655001202593IND60701032020221121235119.0201111e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070103202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2020.1124112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaratelli, Veronica10aPrecision medicine in Alzheimer’s disease: An origami paper-based electrochemical device for cholinesterase inhibitors  aIn the overall scenario of precision medicine, we propose a novel paper-based lab-on-a-chip to deliver a cost-effective and easy to use sensing tool for customized administration of drugs in Alzheimer’s disease. Among several drugs, we designed the device for evaluating the efficacy of compounds (e.g. physostigmine, rivastigmine, donepezil) which are able to inhibit in a reversible way the cholinesterase enzyme. Because cholinesterase activity is peculiar to each patient, the administration of customized amount of the drug can improve the treatment efficacy and the quality of patient life, avoiding side effects due to the overdosage. In detail, we exploited Vivid™ Plasma Separation membrane to threat the whole blood sample, filter paper to load the reagents needed for the measurement, and office paper to print electrodes able to measure the butyrylcholinesterase activity, delivering a reagent free analytical tool. The calibration curve of butyrylcholinesterase obtained in blood sample provided linearity between 2 and 12 U/mL, with sensitivity of 0.050 ± 0.004 μA mL/U. The physostigmine, rivastigmine, and donepezil inhibition activities toward the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme were also measured in blood sample with linearity up to respectively 0.5 μM, 25 μM, 30 μM, and detection limits of 0.009 μM, 0.4 μM, 0.3 μM. These results demonstrate the capability of paper-based origami sensors as point of care devices to customize the drug administration in Alzheimer’s disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aadverse effects 3abiosensors 3ablood sampling 3acholinesterase 3acholinesterase inhibitors 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenzyme activity 3alab-on-a-chip technology 3apatients 3aphysostigmine 3apoint-of-care systems 3aprecision medicine 0aAmperometry 0aCholinesterase 0aInhibition 0aCarbon black 0aPrussian Blue nanoparticles1 aCiampaglia, Adriana1 aGuiducci, Jacopo1 aSancesario, Giuseppe1 aMoscone, Danila1 aArduini, Fabiana0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 165 p.112411-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.1124113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245012300202300002000325520090900345592002801254650001501282650002001297650001301317650001501330650001601345650001601361653003301377653003101410653002501441653002601466700005801492773014201550856007801692852000901770655001201779IND60654259520221117173345.0190724e20190627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065425952DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b051122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanjkesh, Amid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4411-560610aFabrication of a Single-Substrate Flexible Thermoresponsive Cholesteric Liquid-Crystal Film with Wavelength Tunability  ap. 26314-26322.  aRecently, single-substrate flexible liquid crystal (LC) devices have attracted considerable attention because they can provide desirable shapes, small weight, flexibility, and rollability. In this work, we fabricate a flexible single-substrate thermoresponsive cholesteric LC (CLC) film by a facile method called photoenforced stratification method. Our fabricated single-substrate CLC film consists of microscale polymer containers filled with a CLC solution. Our results showed that the temperature response of the fabricated single-substrate CLC film depends on the chiral material doped into the CLC solution. The single-substrate ultrathin CLC film exhibits very high flexibility and robustness without performance reduction. The fabricated flexible single-substrate CLC film may pave the way for the development of novel technologies for thermoresponsive devices with changeable shapes and designs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontainers 3aliquid crystals 3apolymers 3atechnology 3atemperature 3awavelengths 0astimuli-responsive materials 0acholesteric liquid crystal 0aflexible application 0asingle-substrate film1 aYoon, Tae-Hoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9047-80020 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 June 27, v. 11, no. 29 p.26314-26322dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b051123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011700154300002000271520160400291592002801895650002201923650001501945650002101960650002201981650001002003650001302013650001802026650001502044650001102059700001502070700001202085700001502097700001602112700001202128700001602140700001702156700001602173773014402189856007502333852000902408655001202417IND60759927820221121234906.0211216e20211214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075992782DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta08148a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Lina10aNi₃S₂/Cu–NiCo LDH heterostructure nanosheet arrays on Ni foam for electrocatalytic overall water splitting  ap. 27639-27650.  aThe development of highly efficient transition metal-based catalysts for overall water splitting is of extreme significance for promoting large-scale sustainable utilization of hydrogen energy and energy conversion. Herein, we report novel 3D Ni₃S₂/Cu–NiCo LDH heterostructure nanosheet arrays grown on nickel foam as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for the OER and HER. In this design, copper ions are firstly doped into NiCo LDH to tune the electronic structure and enhance the inherent activity of pristine LDH. Metallic Ni₃S₂ is then introduced to establish a coupling heterostructure interface with Cu–NiCo LDH to boost the conductivity and activity. The incorporation of Cu ions and Ni₃S₂ into NiCo LDH also creates more active sites through crystal structure disorder and interface defects. Moreover, the 3D hierarchical nanosheet arrays can accelerate the electrolyte diffusion, promote the rapid release of gas bubbles, and ensure fast electron/mass transport along with strong electrochemical stability. All these merits endow the materials with a superior overall water splitting ability in an alkaline environment, showing low overpotentials of 119 and 218 mV for the OER and overpotentials of 156 and 304 mV for the HER at 10 and 100 mA cm⁻², respectively. Furthermore, the overall water electrolytic cell using Ni₃S₂/Cu–NiCo LDH as both electrodes can reach 100 mA cm⁻² at 1.75 V with outstanding durability. This study provides a new strategy and insights for the exploration of high activity non-noble metal catalysts for overall water splitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3afoams 3ahydrogen 3amass transfer 3ananosheets 3anickel1 aDu, Gaohui1 aHan, Di1 aHao, Yawen1 aZhao, Wenqi1 aFan, Yi1 aSu, Qingmei1 aDing, Shukai1 aXu, Bingshe0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 Dec. 14, v. 9, no. 48 p.27639-27650dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta08148a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245006400153300001800217520120400235592002801439650002101467650002001488650002401508650001901532650001801551650001701569650001901586650002001605650002801625650001801653650002001671650001801691650003001709650001901739650003101758700001701789700001701806700001201823700001501835700001701850773012401867856007401991852000902065655001202074IND60688041820221122033702.0200407e20200406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068804182DNAL7 a10.1039/c9gc03738a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Fei10aApplications of ionic liquids in starch chemistry: a review  ap. 2162-2183.  aRecently, the utilization of starch to replace synthetic polymers for the manufacture of green materials has gained extensive interest, due to its renewability, biodegradability, abundance and low cost. On the other hand, ionic liquids (ILs) have been widely recognized as promising “green solvents” to replace volatile organic solvents for polysaccharide processing. Over the past few years, ILs have been increasingly demonstrated to serve as excellent media for the dissolution, plasticization and derivatization of starch. This allows the synthesis of chemically modified starches with high degree of substitution (DS) and the development of various starch-based materials such as thermoplastic starch, composite films, solid polymer electrolytes, nanoparticles and drug carriers. The main objective of this review is to present an overview of the roles of ILs in starch dissolution, gelatinization, modification and plasticization, and their industrial applications. Moreover, this review is intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind the IL-processing of starch and to provide insights into the rational development of novel starch-based materials with ILs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3aderivatization 3adrug carriers 3aelectrolytes 3agelatinization 3agreen chemistry 3aindustrial applications 3aionic liquids 3amodified starch 3ananoparticles 3asustainable manufacturing 3athermoplastics 3avolatile organic compounds1 aWang, Jinwei1 aXie, Fengwei1 aZan, Ke1 aWang, Shuo1 aWang, Shujun0 tGreen chemistry.g2020 Apr. 6, v. 22, no. 7 p.2162-2183dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9gc03738a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01346naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245007000159300001800229520029500247592002800542650002400570650002300594650001400617650002000631650001200651650001700663650001400680700002200694700001800716700002600734700002500760773012900785856007300914852000900987655001200996IND60657714420221120183351.0190816e20051026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065771442DNAL7 a10.1039/b508063k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavazzini, Marco10aTwo-color luminescence from a tetranuclear Ir(iii)/Ru(ii) complex  ap. 5266-5268.  aA new tetranuclear compound containing Ru(ii) and Ir(iii) polypyridine subunits exhibits two independent emissions at room temperature, as a consequence of weak interchromophoric coupling; in contrast, at 77 K energy transfer from Ir-based chromophores to the Ru-based ones is quantitative.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3achemical reactions 3aemissions 3aenergy transfer 3airidium 3aluminescence 3aruthenium1 aPastorelli, Paola1 aQuici, Silvio1 aLoiseau, Frédérique1 aCampagna, Sebastiano0 tChemical communications.g2005 Oct. 26, , no. 42 p.5266-5268dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b508063k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02073naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245005900157300001800216520100300234592002801237650002101265650002201286650001301308650002001321650001801341650002601359650001901385700002801404700003001432700001801462700003601480773012401516856007401640852000901714655001201723IND60688041920221122033808.0200407e20200406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068804192DNAL7 a10.1039/c9gc03961a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Ziwei10aGrowth kinetics of humins studied via X-ray scattering  ap. 2301-2309.  aWe use ultra-Small Angle X-ray Scattering (USAXS) to investigate the evolution of size, morphology, volume fraction and number concentration of humins formed during dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and the further polymerization of HMF between 80–95 °C in 1 M hydrochloric acidic solutions. The radius of gyration (Rg) of suspended humins particles grows linearly with time and is accompanied by an increase in polydispersity (PD), before possible precipitation occurs. The scattering patterns indicate fractal-like structures. The apparent activation energy of humins growth is 102 ± 0.4 kJ mol⁻¹. The trends in the number of particles over time reveal competing processes entailing the continuous formation of new particles (nucleation) leading to increasing polydispersity with time and the aggregation of existing particles and possible precipitation. The direct observation of growth of humins indicates that humins form primarily from HMF rather than fructose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray scattering 3aactivation energy 3afructose 3agreen chemistry 3agrowth models 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3apolymerization1 aGoulas, Konstantinos A.1 aQuiroz Rodriguez, Natalia1 aSaha, Basudeb1 aVlachos, D.

BglA from Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus (CsBglA) is among the β-glucosidases with highest known activity and thermostability, however with a temperature optimum of 70–80 °C. To improve the enzyme's activity at moderate temperatures, a semi-rational approach based on homology modeling, conservation scoring and subsequent site-saturation mutagenesis was combined with random mutagenesis, resulting in the variant CsBglA-LYTH with 150% improvement of kcₐₜ/KM at 55 °C, a specific activity of 504 U mg⁻¹ (CsBglA: 359 U mg⁻¹) and a KM-value of 37.1 mM (CsBglA: 61.2 mM). The temperature optimum of the enzyme was altered from 80 °C to 65 °C while retaining stability at the temperature of 55 °C as applied for cellulose hydrolysis. To our knowledge, this makes CsBglA-LYTH the bacterial β-glucosidase with highest activity and stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus 3abeta-glucosidase 3abiomass 3acellobiose 3acellulose 3aengineering 3aglucose tolerance 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulose 3amutagenesis 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aZurek, Paul1 aUmlauf, Martina1 aTozakidis, Iasson E.

Besides separation, AF4-MALS-dRI can provide more information about PGEs, such as size and molecular weight (Mw) distributions, apparent density, and conformation. The effects of PGEs on the proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle of MCF-7 cells were investigated. The cell activity assay indicated that the PGEs can inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells by inducing late apoptosis. The results indicated that PGEs with a spherical conformation and compact structure seem to be beneficial to inducing MCF-7 cells late apoptosis. Moreover, results demonstrated that the information obtained by AF4-MALS-dRI is valuable for better understanding of the relationship of structure–activity of PGEs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastrodia elata 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3afood research 3afractionation 3amolecular weight 3apolysaccharides 3arefractive index 3astructure-activity relationships 3aultrasonic treatment 0aPolysaccharide 0aAsymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation 0aAntitumor activity1 aZhang, Wenhui1 aDou, Yuwei1 aLiu, Hongmei1 aChen, Xue1 aShi, Jianhong1 aDou, Haiyang0 tFood research international.g2021 Nov., v. 149 p.110673-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1106733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010100168520139700269592002801666650001501694650002001709650002201729650002101751650001401772650001301786650001101799650001201810650002401822650001301846650001601859653002201875653002801897653001101925653001301936653002301949700001701972700002801989700001702017700001802034700001902052700001802071700001902089700002502108700001902133700002002152773011202172856008302284852000902367655001202376IND60701032520221121235109.0201111e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070103252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2020.1124192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanielson, Eric10aNon-enzymatic and highly sensitive lactose detection utilizing graphene field-effect transistors  aField-effect transistor (FET) biosensors based on low-dimensional materials are capable of highly sensitive and specific label-free detection of various analytes. In this work, a FET biosensor based on graphene decorated with gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) was fabricated for lactose detection in a liquid-gate measurement configuration. This graphene device is functionalized with a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of the human galectin-3 (hGal-3) protein to detect the presence of lactose from the donor effect of lectin – glycan affinity binding on the graphene. Although the detection of lactose is important because of its ubiquitous presence in food and for disease related applications (lactose intolerance condition), in this work we exploit the lectin/carbohydrate interaction to develop a device that in principle could specifically detect very low concentrations of any carbohydrate. The biosensor achieved an effective response to lactose concentrations over a dynamic range from 1 fM to 1 pM (10⁻¹⁵ to 10⁻¹² mol L⁻¹) with a detection limit of 200 aM, a significant enhancement over previous electrochemical graphene devices. The FET sensor response is also specific to lactose at aM concentrations, indicating the potential of a combined lectin and graphene FET (G-FET) sensor to detect carbohydrates at high sensitivity and specificity for disease diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adisease diagnosis 3aelectrochemistry 3agalectins 3agraphene 3ahumans 3alactose 3alactose intolerance 3ananogold 3atransistors 0aLactose biosensor 0aField effect transistor 0aLectin 0aGraphene 0aGold nanoparticles1 aDindo, Mirco1 aPorkovich, Alexander J.1 aKumar, Pawan1 aWang, Zhenwei1 aJain, Prashant1 aMete, Trimbak1 aZiadi, Zakaria1 aKikkeri, Raghavendra1 aLaurino, Paola1 aSowwan, Mukhles0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 165 p.112419-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.1124193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008100174300001800255520161300273592002801886650001201914650001601926650001001942650001901952650002701971650002001998700001502018700002202033773009902055856008602154852000902240655001202249IND60577480320221119140323.0170809e20160628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057748032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b006562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBournival, Ghislain10aBehavior of Bubble Interfaces Stabilized by Particles of Different Densities  ap. 6226-6238.  aStability of bubbles laden with particles of different densities was investigated. Capillary-held bubbles were produced and coated with particles across the density range of 1.2–3.6 g·cm–³. The materials used were poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), glass, and anatase. The interaction of the bubbles, once brought into contact, was monitored using high-speed video recording. Visual inspection indicated that denser particles were more easily displaced during the contact of the bubbles and therefore the PMMA particles provided a particle barrier more resistant to coalescence. The coalescence events yielded information on the surface properties of the bubble and the detachment of particles. The attached particles commonly dampen the oscillation of the coalesced bubbles through viscous drag and change in the surface properties (e.g., area-exclusion principle). The dampening of the oscillation generally leads to a reduced mass of particles detaching from the bubble surface. It was found that the different materials investigated did not offer clear evidence of the effect of particle detachment on the bubble surface properties in the present systems. On the other hand, the detachment of different particle materials seemed to be consistent with one another when comparing the attachment and detachment forces exerted on the particles based on their density, size, and hydrophobicity. It was concluded that particles of lower density are more effective in stabilizing interfaces, and thus particle density is an important parameter in the selection of materials for the handling of dispersions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3adispersions 3aglass 3ahydrophobicity 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3avideo recording1 aAta, Seher1 aWanless, Erica J.0 tLangmuir.g2016 June 28, v. 32, no. 25 p.6226-6238dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b006563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009200166300001600258520160600274592002801880650001201908650001501920650001301935650000901948650001001957650001501967650000801982650001201990650001002002650001102012650001102023651001802034651001502052653001502067653001502082653001202097653001602109653001302125653002002138653001802158653001402176700002002190773010602210856008002316852000902396655001202405IND60622258920221122134912.0181124e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062225892DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836070805072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrockford, S.J.10aSea ice expansion in the Bering Sea during the Neoglacial: evidence from archaeozoology  ap. 699-706.  aThe Neoglacial was a period of cold that lasted more than 2000 years during the mid-Holocene, from approximately 4700 to 2500 years ago. Although proxy data from a number of sources document the regional onset and duration of cold conditions in the Northern Hemisphere during this period, none have suggested an expansion of sea ice in the Bering Sea. Here we provide new evidence that Neoglacial sea ice expansion in the Bering Sea was substantial enough to have altered the distribution of North Pacific pinnipeds and cetaceans, using prehistoric skeletal remains recovered from an archaeological site on the island of Unalaska in the eastern Aleutians (Amaknak Bridge, occupied from c. 3500—2500 yr BP (radiocarbon years before present, uncalibrated)). Comprehensive archaeozoological analysis of the Amaknak Bridge fauna indicates that sea ice in the Bering Sea must have reached a more southerly position at the height of the Neoglacial and persisted longer than it does today. We infer from this evidence that for most of the Neoglacial period, sea ice must have surrounded the Pribilof Islands until early summer and blocked the Bering Strait until late summer. Such an expansion and seasonal persistence of sea ice would have prevented fur seals from using the Pribilofs as a summer breeding rookery and whales from making summer migrations into arctic waters to feed, as they do today. We suggest this expansion of sea ice in the Bering Sea during the Neoglacial may explain several unresolved phenomena of mammalian distributions, genetic partitioning and extinctions in the North Pacific.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCetacea 3aPinnipedia 3abreeding 3acold 3afauna 3aglaciation 3aice 3aislands 3aseals 3asummer 3awhales 3aArctic region 3aBering Sea 0aNeoglacial 0aBering Sea 0asea ice 0aringed seal 0afur seal 0awhale migration 0aarchaezoology 0aHolocene.1 aFrederick, S.G.0 tHolocene.g2007 Sept., v. 17, no. 6 p.699-706dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836070805073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245015100171300001600322520153100338592002801869650002001897650002801917650001501945650001201960650001601972650001301988650000802001650001002009650001102019650002002030650001802050651001202068651001602080653002002096653002902116653003702145653002302182653001802205653002002223700002102243700002302264773010502287856008002392852000902472655001202481IND60622259020221122134851.0181124e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062225902DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836070805082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosqvist, Gunhild C.10aNorth Atlantic region atmospheric circulation dynamics inferred from a late-Holocene lacustrine carbonate isotope record, northern Swedish Lapland  ap. 867-873.  aThe first high-resolution record of climate variation based on the oxygen and carbon isotope composition of authigenic carbonate for northern Scandinavia is presented. Modern lake-water isotope data indicate that controls on its oxygen and hydrogen (δ¹⁸Ow and δDw) composition are unlikely to be evaporation or temperature, and its variations must therefore reflect changes in, or at the source of, precipitation. Substantial and persistent changes of the isotopic composition of the precipitation are required to change the mean annual isotope composition of lake surface water. For this reason we argue that the recorded changes were significant and that the recurrence of such changes would greatly affect future regional climate conditions in the North Atlantic region. Oxygen isotope (δ¹⁸O) minima occurring at ∼ 200, 500, 1300, 1600 and at 2900 cal. yr BP all coincide with major peaks in North Atlantic ice rafted debris deposition. We suggest that the depletion events in δ¹⁸O cycles recorded in several lakes in northern Swedish Lapland are caused by the same climatic shifts as those noted in the North Atlantic marine records. This is because changes of atmospheric circulation pattern and the lower ocean and atmospheric temperatures associated with the IRD events help to explain why ¹⁸O depletion of precipitation occurred during these events. Our findings indicate that the recorded changes in North Atlantic ice drift and surface hydrography are coupled to changes in atmospheric circulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric circulation 3acarbonates 3aclimate 3aevaporation 3ahydrogen 3aice 3alakes 3aoxygen 3astable isotopes 3asurface water 3aLapland 3aScandinavia 0aOxygen isotopes 0acarbonate lake sediments 0aatmospheric circulation dynamics 0aNorth Atlantic IRD 0alate Holocene 0anorthern Sweden1 aLeng, Melanie J.1 aJonsson, Christina0 tHolocene.g2007 Nov., v. 17, no. 7 p.867-873dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836070805083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03606naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245016900164300001600333520168600349536012202035592002802157650002102185650002102206650001402227650000902241650001002250650002502260650001902285650003102304650001802335650002202353650002702375650004302402650005202445650002202497650002902519653000802548653001902556653002602575653001402601653001402615653006302629653002502692700001702717700001702734700002702751700001602778700002202794700002902816773010602845856008002951852000903031655001203040IND60614994720221120131604.0181003e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061499472DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858135111272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuil-Luna, S.10aProgesterone Receptor Isoform Analysis by Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction in Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Canine Mammary Dysplasias and Tumors  ap. 895-902.  aCloning and sequencing of the progesterone receptor gene in dogs have revealed 2 isoforms, A and B, transcribed from a single gene. Distribution of isoforms A and B in canine mammary lesions has hitherto been investigated only by Western blot analysis. This study analyzed progesterone receptor and its isoforms in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from canine mammary lesions (4 dysplasias, 10 benign tumors, and 46 carcinomas) using 1-step SYBR Green quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Progesterone receptor was expressed in 75% of dysplasias, all benign tumors, and 59% of carcinomas. Carcinomas, and particularly simple epithelial-type carcinomas, displayed the lowest levels of expression. A high rate of agreement was recorded between RT-qPCR and immunohistochemical labeling. Isoforms A and B were successfully amplified, with correlation coefficients of 0.99 and amplification efficiencies close to 2, and were expressed in all lesion types analyzed. Predominance of A over B expression was observed in carcinomas and complex adenomas. Low-grade tumors exhibited higher progesterone receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, but no difference was observed in the expression of isoform A versus B. Analysis of progesterone receptor mRNA isoforms by RT-qPCR was successful in routinely formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples and enabled the distribution of isoforms A and B to be identified for the first time in dysplasias, benign tumors, and malignant tumors of the canine mammary gland. These findings will facilitate future research into the role of progesterone receptor isoforms in the progression of canine mammary tumors.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal pathology 3acarcinoma 3adogs 3agenes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amammary glands 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3aprogesterone receptors 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 0adog 0amammary tumors 0aprogesterone receptor 0aisoform A 0aisoform B 0aquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) 0aimmunohistochemistry1 aStenvang, J.1 aBrünner, N.1 aSánchez-Céspedes, R.1 aMillán, Y.1 aGómez-Laguna, J.1 aMulas, J.

The results of two experiments, conducted in a field and an online setting, show that consumers with a fast, rather than slow, life-history strategy are more susceptible to scarcity cues, boosting choice and actual consumption of healthy foods when these cues are associated with the healthy option. Conversely, for slow LHS consumers, the evidence suggests that scarcity cues are less influential, and instead abundance cues tend to foster healthy choice. Finally, in line with the LHS logic, acute food craving mediates the impact of scarcity vs. abundance cues for fast, but not slow, strategists, while perceptions of socially validated trust in the food source fulfill this role for slow, but not fast, strategists.  aPublisher supplied data 3acraving 3ahealthy diet 3alife history 3asocioeconomic status 0aLife History Theory 0aSES 0aScarcity 0aAbundance 0aNudging 0aObesity1 aGineikiene, Justina1 aBarauskaite, Dovile1 avan Koningsbruggen, Guido M.0 tFood quality and preference.g2020 Oct., v. 85 p.103967-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2020.1039673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245011300168300001600281520084600297592002801143650001101171650001201182650001901194650001601213650001501229650001301244650001101257650001401268650001401282650002201296653001001318653001901328653002301347653002501370653001701395653002101412653001901433653001401452700002001466773010601486856008001592852000901672655001201681IND60622259120221122134855.0181124e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062225912DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836070805102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForwick, Matthias10aHolocene mass-transport activity and climate in outer Isfjorden, Spitsbergen: marine and subsurface evidence  ap. 707-716.  aThe analyses of high-resolution seismic data, swath bathymetry data and sediment cores from the basin Svensksunddjupet in Isfjorden, Spitsbergen, reveal the deposits of repeated slope failures. Most of the slope failures occurred during three periods at c. 9650 cal. BP, 8350—8200 cal. BP and 3000 cal. BP. Suggested factors causing instability of the slopes include earthquake activity resulting from rapid isostatic uplift, excess pore pressure caused by relative sea-level fall and/or the presence of gas as well as climatic changes. Mass-transport deposits at the mouth of an incision at the southern slope of Svensksunddjupet are suggested to mainly relate to runoff from the land-based glacier Vardebreen. The increase of the mass-transport activity may indicate that Vardebreen either formed or increased in size at c. 7000 cal.

Hepburn et al. have now identified NGF-β as a functional equivalent to Spaetzle in vertebrates. NGF-β acts as a paracrine “alarmin” orchestrating macrophage and neutrophil responses to S. aureus infection. People with deleterious mutations in genes encoding NGF-β or its high-affinity receptor TRKA are predisposed to recurrent and severe staph infections. S. aureus proteins selectively trigger macrophage production of NGF-β, which enhances uptake and superoxide-dependent killing of S. aureus , stimulates proinflammatory cytokine production, and promotes neutrophil recruitment. Moreover, TrkA silencing in vivo increases susceptibility to S. aureus . Thus, the NGF-β–TRKA pathway is a critical, evolutionarily conserved component of vertebrate immunity to S. aureus infection.

In some cases, such as persimmons, males are determined by a Y chromosome. Akagi et al. examined the gene transcript differences between male and female persimmons. A gene on the Y chromosome regulated a non–sex chromosome–linked small RNA that suppresses female organ development. This small RNA was localized to male flowers and could affect female development in other plant species. The evolutionary history of these genes suggests that they are tied to the origin of the separation of sexes in the persimmon family.

Similar infrastructure rating tools have started to be developed and implemented, being highly necessary to promote its development. Even though the existing sustainable infrastructure rating systems are focused on advanced economies, growing environmental concerns are increasing the need for new systems in the Developing World. This research analyses some of the mainstream infrastructure rating frameworks such as Envision (USA), Civil Engineering Environmental Quality (CEEQUAL) assessment (UK) and Infrastructure Sustainability (IS) Rating Tool (Australia) from the perspective of the Triple Bottom Line (economy, environment and society), in order to determine the effectiveness of their application in the context of the least developed countries. The analysis revealed that the three tools are biased towards the environmental dimension and are mainly oriented to developed countries. Consequently, the foundations on which these systems are based need to be further developed and enhanced to be of real relevance in poorer nations by balancing the weight of sustainable pillars, incorporating effective management guidelines and development goals set by United Nations declarations, and considering impacts beyond the single project framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3acivil engineering 3aconstruction industry 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3aenvironmental engineering 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental quality 3agreen infrastructure 3aguidelines 3asociety 3aAustralia 3aUnited Kingdom 3aUnited States 0aTriple bottom line 0aInfrastructure rating frameworks 0aRating systems 0aSustainable infrastructure 0aDeveloping countries1 aJato-Espino, Daniel1 aAlsulami, Badr1 aCastro Fresno, Daniel,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5658-39010 tEcological indicators.g2016 Dec., v. 71 p.491-502dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.07.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009300159520126500252592002801517650001101545650000901556650000901565650002301574650001901597650002101616650001201637650002001649650001401669650001301683650001301696650001601709651001801725773012701743856007401870852000901944655001201953IND60652861020221120052805.0190713e20190318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065286102DNAL7 a10.3390/su110616282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaikh, Imlak 10aOn the Relationship between Economic Policy Uncertainty and the Implied Volatility Index  aThis article examines the effects of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on the implied volatility index. The implied volatility index of various markets has been analyzed in relation to scheduled macroeconomic announcements, such as EPU and equity market policy uncertainty (EMPU) indices. The study highlights that EPU contains important information to explain the diverse market effects of the U.S., which is gauged into the volatility index. Estimates obtained in an autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity framework indicate the persistence of volatility during spikes in the EPU. More importantly, the lagged values of the policy uncertainty index also contains market-related information to explain the markets&rsquo; future volatility. Major political and economic events have also contributed positively in that a presidential election contains information to explain various asset classes. Commodities, such as crude oil, gold, corn, and soybean, have been impacted significantly followed by EPU. Moreover, interest rate market volatility has also been moved adversely due to tight monetary policy. The Markov regime switching regression manifests that the implied volatility index (VIX) behaves abruptly in two different regimes followed by EPU.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3acorn 3agold 3aheteroskedasticity 3amacroeconomics 3amarketing policy 3amarkets 3amonetary policy 3apetroleum 3apolitics 3asoybeans 3auncertainty 3aUnited States0 tSustainability.g2019 Mar. 18, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110616283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04076naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245018100184300001400365520163300379592002802012650003302040650001802073650002302091650002002114650001002134650002002144650001202164650002602176650001302202650001302215650002102228650001102249650001002260650002402270650004302294650001302337650002002350650002602370650007302396650003702469650004502506650003102551650003002582650005302612650004302665650001702708650001102725650003802736650002402774650002002798650005002818650004002868650004202908650006202950650002403012700001803036700001803054700001803072700001803090700002103108773011203129856008103241990002303322852000903345655001203354IND60093643220221116232538.0141103e20120105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009364322DNAL7 a220628062pmid7 a10.1016/j.cbi.2011.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Hai-Dan10aGinsenoside Rg2 induces orphan nuclear receptor SHP gene expression and inactivates GSK3β via AMP-activated protein kinase to inhibit hepatic glucose production in HepG2 cells  ap. 35-42.  aPanax ginseng is known to have anti-diabetic activity, but the active ingredients have not been fully explored yet. Here, we test whether ginsenoside Rg2 has an inhibitory effect on hepatic glucose production and determine its mechanism of action. Rg2 significantly inhibits hepatic glucose production and induces phosphorylations of liver kinase B1 (LKB1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in time- and concentration-dependent manners in human HepG2 hepatoma cells, and these effects were abolished in the presence of compound C, a selective AMPK inhibitor. In addition, phosphorylated form of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), a key transcription factor for hepatic gluconeogenesis, was decreased in time- and concentration-dependent manners. Next, gene expression of orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) was also examined. Rg2 markedly enhanced the gene expression of SHP and its direct interaction with CREB, which results in disruption of CREB·CRTC2 complex. Consequently, expressions of relevant genes such as peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) were all significantly suppressed and these effects were also reversed in the presence of compound C. In conclusion, our results propose that ginsenoside Rg2 suppresses the hepatic glucose production via AMPK-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β and induction of SHP gene expression. Further studies are warranted to elucidate a therapeutic potential of Rg2 for type 2 diabetic patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aPanax ginseng 3aactive ingredients 3agene expression 3agenes 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3aglucose-6-phosphatase 3aglycogen 3ahepatoma 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aliver 3amechanism of action 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3atranscription factors 2aAMP-Activated Protein Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aCREB-Binding Proteinxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGinsenosidesxpharmacology 2aGluconeogenesisxgenetics 2aGlucosexantagonists & inhibitorsxbiosynthesis. 2aGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3xmetabolism 2aHep G2 Cells 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxpharmacology 2aLiverxdrug effects 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxmetabolism. 2aPyrazolesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPyrimidinesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aReceptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclearxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction1 aKim, Do-yeon,1 aQuan, Hai-Yan1 aKim, Su-jung,1 aJung, Mi Song1 aChung, Sung Hyun0 tChemico-biological interactions.g2012 Jan. 5, v. 195, no. 1 p.35-42dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-27977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2011.10.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245006700159300002000226520128300246592002801529650002101557650002601578650001601604650001901620650001401639650001001653650001701663650002401680650001501704653002201719653002501741653002201766653002001788653001401808700006601822773014201888856007802030852000902108655001202117IND60654260520221119151829.0190724e20190604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065426052DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b060712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Tong10aPaper-Based Mechanical Sensors Enabled by Folding and Stacking  ap. 26339-26345.  aElectronics based on paper substrates can be foldable, inexpensive, and biodegradable, making such systems promising for low-cost sensors, smart packaging, and medical diagnostics. In this work, we saturate tissue paper with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) by using a simple and scalable process and construct pressure sensors that exhibit an enhanced response when the active material is folded or stacked. Nanoscale pressure actuation and current mapping reveals a sensing mechanism that takes advantage of the fibrous microstructure of the paper and relies on the formation and expansion of electrical contacts between fibers in adjacent paper layers as pressure is applied. The resulting paper-based pressure sensors respond to an impulse within 20 ms and are robust, showing only a 4.6% decrease in the operating current after 30 000 load/unload cycles. Pressure distribution mapping was achieved by using a sensor array with a stacked architecture, whereas folding was used to demonstrate multistate switching and to detect conformational change in a three-dimensional origami system. These strategies of folding and layering paper saturated with functional materials open up new avenues for building multifunctional paper electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectronics 3amicrostructure 3apackaging 3apaper 3apolystyrenes 3asensors (equipment) 3asulfonates 0apaper electronics 0afoldable electronics 0amechanical sensor 0apaper composite 0aPEDOT:PSS1 aMativetsky, Jeffrey M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6574-98430 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 June 04, v. 11, no. 29 p.26339-26345dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b060713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03915naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245014000192300001400332520140400346592002801750650001101778650002501789650001701814650001801831650001801849650001601867650001301883650001301896650002701909650001501936650001601951650002701967650002801994650002002022650001202042650001202054650002302066650001002089650004302099650002402142650002102166650000702187650000902194650002502203650001402228650002502242650001202267650003002279650002502309650008302334650002602417650002802443650003902471650004002510650003802550650003502588650003702623650003402660650000902694650001602703650003502719650000902754650001702763650001702780650003702797650002602834700002402860773011202884856008102996990002303077852000903100655001203109IND60093643320221116232516.0141103e20120105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009364332DNAL7 a220566472pmid7 a10.1016/j.cbi.2011.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrinivasan, Subramani10aAmeliorative effect of diosmin, a citrus flavonoid against streptozotocin-nicotinamide generated oxidative stress induced diabetic rats  ap. 43-51.  aOxidative stress has been suggested as a contributory factor in development and complication of diabetes. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of diosmin (DS) in oxidative stress in streptozotocin-nicotinamide (STZ-NA)-induced diabetic rats by measuring the lipid peroxidation (LPO) as well as the ameliorative properties. Experimental diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of STZ (45mg/kg body weight (b.w.)) dissolved in 0.1mol/L citrate buffer (pH 4.5), 15min after the i.p administration of NA (110mg/kg b.w.). Diabetic rats exhibited increased plasma glucose with significant decrease in plasma insulin levels. The activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and the levels of low-molecular weight antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin E and reduced glutathione (GSH) were decreased while increases in the levels of LPO markers were observed in liver and kidney tissues of diabetic control rats as compared to normal control rats. Oral treatment with DS (100mg/kg/day) for a period of 45days showed significant ameliorative effects on all the biochemical parameters studied. Biochemical findings were supported by histological studies. These results indicated that DS has potential ameliorative effects in addition to its antidiabetic effect in type 2 diabetic rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3acatalase 3acitrates 3adiabetic complications 3aflavonoids 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3aglycemic effect 3ainsulin 3akidneys 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avitamin E 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAscorbic Acidxmetabolism 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxchemically inducedxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aDiosminxpharmacology 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aGlutathione Transferasexmetabolism 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxpharmacology 2aKidneyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aLiverxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMale 2aNiacinamide 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aStreptozocin 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aVitamin Exmetabolism1 aPari, Leelavinothan0 tChemico-biological interactions.g2012 Jan. 5, v. 195, no. 1 p.43-51dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-27977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2011.10.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245017200167520135400339592002801693650001501721650001101736650002301747650001001770650002101780650001801801650000901819650001801828650001701846650001501863650001601878650001801894650001901912650001101931653002901942653001101971653001101982653001501993653001702008700001702025700001402042700001802056700001602074700001602090700002402106700005602130773011402186856008602300852000902386655001202395IND60670321020221118022726.0200809e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067032102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1212762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Jinyu10aPolydopamine protected hollow nanosphere with AuAg-nanoframe-core@Carbon@AuAg-nanocrystals-satellite hybrid nanostructure (AuAg@C@AuAg/PDA) for enhancing nanocatalysis  aThis work reported a facile method for fabricating multi-layered polydopamine (PDA) encapsulated AuAg@C@AuAg core/shell nanosphere with a hollow interior. During the synthetic process, the preliminary Ag@C nanosphere is easily covered by an AuAg/PDA hybrid layer through the in situ redox-oxidized polymerization to form the Ag-AuAg@C@AuAg/PDA precursor, in which the AuAg bimetallic nanocrystals are simultaneously obtained via the electrochemical substitution reaction. After etching the residue Ag core, the final AuAg@C@AuAg/PDA hybrid nanosphere is achieved and the inner AuAg shows a unique nanoframe-like nanostructure. The carbon shell plays an important role for the formation and structure evolution of the AuAg@C@AuAg/PDA, and the composition can be modulated by varying the polymerization process. Owing to the well distributed AuAg nanocrystals and inner AuAg nanoframes, the AuAg@C@AuAg/PDA shows better performance than Ag-AuAg@C@AuAg/PDA precursor in catalyzing 4-nitrophenol, and the rate constant (K) to catalyst weight ratio reaches as high as 3.63 min⁻¹ •mg⁻¹. As a result, this work not only offers a hybrid bi-metallic nanocatalyst with excellent performance, but also has valuable implications for compositional modulation of hollow interior multi-layered nanostructure in adsorption, drug delivery, and nanocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3adrugs 3aelectrochemistry 3aencapsulation 3agold 3ananocatalysts 3ananocrystals 3ananosilver 3ananospheres 3ap-nitrophenol 3apolymerization 3asilver 0aBi-metallic nanocrystals 0aCarbon 0aHollow 0aCore shell 0aPolydopamine1 aBai, Linfeng1 aXu, Kezhu1 aFang, Qunling1 aSun, Yuhang1 aXu, Huajian1 aLeung, Ken Cham-Fai1 aXuan, Shouhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8232-97360 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 384 p.121276-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1212763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245021200170300001400382520122800396592002801624650002501652650001501677650001601692650002101708650002001729650003701749650002801786650001101814650001901825650001301844650003301857653001401890653002501904653001001929653002201939653002601961700002301987700001802010773009502028856008702123852000902210655001202219IND60562485120221120105126.0170713e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056248512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoja, Yalda10aEnzymatic biosensor based on entrapment of d-amino acid oxidase on gold nanofilm/MWCNTs nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode by sol-gel network: Analytical applications for d-alanine in human serum  ap. 20-27.  aSensing and determination of d-alanine is studied by using an enzymatic biosensor which was constructed on the basis of d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) immobilization by sol-gel film onto glassy carbon electrode surface modified with nanocomposite of gold nanofilm (Au-NF) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The Au-NF/MWCNT nanocomposite was prepared by applying the potentiostatic technique for electrodeposition of Au-NF on the MWCNT immobilized on glassy carbon electrode surface. The modified electrode is investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry(CV) techniques. The linear sweep voltammetry was used for determination of d-alanine and the results showed an excellent linear relationship between biosensor response and d-alanine concentration ranging from 0.25μM to 4.5μM with correction coefficient of 0.999 (n=20). Detection limit for the fabricated sensor was calculated about 20nM (for S/N=3) and sensitivity was about 56.1μAμM−1cm−2. The developed biosensor exhibited rapid and accurate response to d-alanine, a good stability (4 weeks) and an average recovery of 98.9% in human serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aD-amino-acid oxidase 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahumans 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aBiosensor 0ad-Amino acid oxidase 0aMWCNT 0aAu nanostructures 0aEnzyme immobilization1 aRafati, Amir Abbas1 aGhodsi, Javad0 tEnzyme and Microbial Technology.g2017 May, v. 100 p.20-27dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01631naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245005100162300001800213500001900231520050700250592002800757650001900785650001300804650001700817650001800834650001000852650000900862653001800871653001600889653002300905653002100928700002000949700002000969773018400989856007501173852000901248655001201257IND60691992120221122223555.0200502e20030101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069199212DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.67.17972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWATANABE, Yoshio10aIsolation of Actinomycetes from Termites' Guts  ap. 1797-1801.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aActinomycetes could be isolated efficiently on a defatted wood powder medium from the guts of various species of termites.

In the present study, we assessed whether Se could alleviate the toxic effects of Cd on growth and metabolism of maize. Seeds of maize variety FH-985 were sown in pots filled with sand treated with CdCl ₂ (0, 50 and 100 µM) and Se (0, 2 and 4 mg L ⁻¹) through Hoagland’s nutrient solution. Low Se (2 mg L ⁻¹) increased germination percentage and rate, while high Se (4 mg L ⁻¹) increased fresh and dry biomass under Cd stress. Interestingly, all Se concentrations were effective in alleviating the toxic effects of Cd on photosynthetic pigments, whereas higher Se mitigated the Cd-induced oxidative stress and increased flavonoids both in the shoots and roots while phenolics in the roots. The results demonstrated that root zone Se altered tissue-specific primary metabolism in maize. Furthermore, low Se mitigated the Cd-induced decrease in total proteins in the root. Overall, Se-mediated decrease in the oxidative stress in the shoots while increase of secondary metabolites in the roots helped the plants to grow faster at early growth stage and caused increase in the biomass under different Cd regimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3abiomass 3acadmium 3acorn 3adevelopmental stages 3aflavonoids 3agermination 3anutrient solutions 3aoxidative stress 3aphenolic compounds 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asand 3asecondary metabolites 3aseeds 3aselenium 3ashoots 3atoxicity 0aCd toxicity 0aoxidative stress 0aCd–Se interactions 0asecondary metabolites 0agrowth1 aIqbal, Muhammad1 aRasheed, Rizwan1 aAshraf, M.

In this study, deferoxamine (DFO)-loaded ethosomes (Eth) were combined with gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)/gellan gum methacrylate (GGMA) hybrid bioink to fabricate 3D-printed scaffold by photo- and ion-crosslinking. The GelMA/GGMA bioinks showed excellent printability and improved mechanical property through the double-crosslinking method. In vitro experiments showed that Eth-DFO@GelMA/GGMA scaffold had good cytocompatibility while achieved sustained release of DFO, which significantly promoted endothelial cells migration and tube formation, mineralized matrix deposition and alkaline phosphatase expression of osteoblast. In vivo experiments of rat cranial defect model demonstrated that composite scaffold could promote angiogenesis and bone regeneration by activating the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1-α) signaling pathway. In conclusion, this 3D bioprinted Eth-DFO@GelMA/GGMA scaffold can couple angiogenesis and osteogenesis, and will be a promising candidate for the bone defects treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aangiogenesis 3abioprinting 3abone formation 3adeferoxamine 3agelatin 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3aosteoblasts 3arats 0a3D bioprinting 0aDeferoxamine 0aEthosomes 0aVascularization 0aBone regeneration1 aLi, Shikai1 aYang, Jin1 aHa, Yujie1 aZhang, Qianqian1 aZhou, Xiaojun1 aHe, Chuanglong0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 290 p.119469-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1194693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245010500172300001500277520121000292592002801502650001401530650001701544650001301561650001001574650001301584650001901597650001501616651001601631651001501647653001701662653001201679653001701691653001301708653001601721653001901737653001301756653001301769773010801782856008801890852000901978655001201987IND60562485420221120121026.0190318e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056248542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnes, R.S.K.10aAre seaward pneumatophore fringes transitional between mangrove and lower-shore system compartments?  ap. 99-109.  aWork in temperate New Zealand has concluded that seaward fringes of Avicennia pneumatophores (P) form an 'important ecological transitional environment' between seagrass (Z) and mangrove (M), supporting intermediate macrofaunal numbers and biodiversity (Alfaro, 2006). This study re-examined that hypothesis in subtropical Moreton Bay, Queensland, and investigated its dependence on the nature of the lower-shore habitat; i.e. whether seagrass or sandflat (S). Adjacent macrobenthic assemblages across 45 m deep Z:P:M and S:P:M interfaces were compared uni- and multivariately and via various assemblage metrics. Here, system compartment P was not intermediate. In Z:P:M interfaces it was essentially an extension of the lower-shore assemblage and supported peak biodiversity. In contrast, P in S:P:M interfaces was partly an extension of the upper-shore assemblage with unchanged biodiversity but minimum abundance. Several species spanned the whole interface zone, and assemblage structure and several metrics remained unchanged across it. These findings are discussed in relation to ecotones in general. Like other such zones the characteristics of pneumatophore-fringe ecotones are context dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia 3abiodiversity 3aecotones 3afauna 3ahabitats 3apneumatophores 3aseagrasses 3aNew Zealand 3aQueensland 0aBiodiversity 0aEcotone 0aMacrobenthos 0aMangrove 0aMoreton Bay 0aPneumatophores 0aSandflat 0aSeagrass0 tMarine environmental research.g2017 Apr., v. 125 p.99-109dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007600171520135900247592002801606650002301634650003001657650001001687650001301697650001501710650001701725650001701742650002301759650001501782650001101797650001201808650002001820653002401840653000901864653001901873653000901892653001601901700002701917700002301944700002301967700002301990700005802013773011402071856008602185852000902271655001202280IND60670321320221118022719.0200809e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067032132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1212792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLafuente, Marta10aGas phase detection of chemical warfare agents CWAs with portable Raman  aThe development of SERS substrates for chemical detection of specific analytes requires appropriate selection of plasmonic metal and the surface where it is deposited. Here we deposited Ag nanoplates on three substrates: i) conventional SiO₂/Si wafer, ii) stainless steel mesh and iii) graphite foils. The SERS enhancement of the signal was studied for Rhodamine 6 G (R6 G) as common liquid phase probe molecule. We conducted a comprehensive study with λ = 532, 633 and 785 nm on all the substrates. The best substrate was investigated, at the optimum laser 785 nm, for gas phase detection of dimethyl methyl phosphonate (DMMP), simulant of the G-series nerve agents, at a concentration of 2.5 ppmV (14 mg/m³). The spectral fingerprint was clearly observed; with variations on the relative intensities of SERS Raman bands compared to bulk DMMP in liquid phase reflects the DMMP-Ag interactions. These interactions were simulated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and the simulated spectra matched with the experimental one. Finally, we were detected the characteristics DMMP fingerprint with hand-held portable equipment. These results open the way for the application of SERS technique on real scenarios where robust, light-weight, miniaturized and simple to use and cost-effective tools are required by first responders.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3adensity functional theory 3agases 3agraphene 3ananosilver 3anerve agents 3aphosphonates 3aportable equipment 3arhodamines 3asilica 3asilicon 3astainless steel 0aGas phase detection 0aSERS 0aPortable Raman 0aCWAs 0aTrace level1 aSanz Martínez, Diego,1 aUrbiztondo, Miguel1 aSantamaria, Jesus,1 aPina, María Pilar1 aMallada, Reyes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4758-93800 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 384 p.121279-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1212793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245007100179300001400250520128700264592002801551650001901579650002201598650001501620650001301635700002301648700002601671700005701697700003101754700002701785700002201812773011601834856008601950852000902036655001202045IND60624906120221118203814.0191017e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062490612DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btx5552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiménez-García, Brian10aLightDock: a new multi-scale approach to protein–protein docking  ap. 49-55.  aComputational prediction of protein–protein complex structure by docking can provide structural and mechanistic insights for protein interactions of biomedical interest. However, current methods struggle with difficult cases, such as those involving flexible proteins, low-affinity complexes or transient interactions. A major challenge is how to efficiently sample the structural and energetic landscape of the association at different resolution levels, given that each scoring function is often highly coupled to a specific type of search method. Thus, new methodologies capable of accommodating multi-scale conformational flexibility and scoring are strongly needed. We describe here a new multi-scale protein–protein docking methodology, LightDock, capable of accommodating conformational flexibility and a variety of scoring functions at different resolution levels. Implicit use of normal modes during the search and atomic/coarse-grained combined scoring functions yielded improved predictive results with respect to state-of-the-art rigid-body docking, especially in flexible cases.

The focus on wheat based dough and bread was in order to objectively compare the influence of the fibre and flour fractions of cereals and pseudocereals on the same food matrix. The evident heterogeneity, contradiction of scientific results and the lack of objective comparability were the main reason for compilation of systematic review. Remarkably, the literature is characterized by a large methodology gap that leads to significant knowledge gap due to the lack of the comparability of presented results on dietary fibre content, composition and influence on wheat based dough and bread properties. Based on this, the authors must emphasize the need for standardized presentation of scientific results in the future by scientific community.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreads 3acarbohydrates 3adietary fiber 3adough 3afiber content 3aflour 3afood matrix 3apseudocereals 3asystematic review 3awheat 0aCereals 0aPseudocereals 0aDietary fibre 0aWholegrain flour 0aDough rheology 0aBread quality1 aRadosavljević, Miloš1 aBelović, Miona1 aDjukić, Nevena1 aMarkovic, Stefan,0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 290 p.119470-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1194703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245015600170300001400326520103800340592002801378650002301406650001301429650001801442650001201460650001901472650001401491650001401505650001501519650002401534650001101558650000701569650002701576650001301603650001301616651000901629653002401638653001201662653002301674653001501697653002101712653001801733700001301751700001201764700001501776700001501791700001601806700001901822700001701841773010701858856008801965852000902053655001202062IND60562485520221120095109.0190318e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056248552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xinguo10aOcean acidification adversely influences metabolism, extracellular pH and calcification of an economically important marine bivalve, Tegillarca granosa  ap. 82-89.  aOceanic uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere has significantly reduced surface seawater pH and altered the carbonate chemistry within, leading to global Ocean Acidification (OA). The blood clam, Tegillarca granosa, is an economically and ecologically significant marine bivalve that is widely distributed along the coastal and estuarine areas of Asia. To investigate the physiological responses to OA, blood clams were exposed to ambient and three reduced seawater pH levels (8.1, 7.8, 7.6 and 7.4) for 40 days, respectively. Results obtained suggest that OA suppresses the feeding activity and aerobic metabolism, but elevates proteins catabolism of blood clams. OA also causes extracellular acidosis and decreases haemolymph Ca2+ concentration. In addition, our data also suggest that OA impairs the calcification process and inner shell surface integrity. Overall, OA adversely influences metabolism, acid-base status and calcification of blood clams, subsequently leading to a decrease in the fitness of this marine bivalve species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTegillarca granosa 3aacidosis 3acalcification 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3aestuaries 3ahemolymph 3ametabolism 3aocean acidification 3aoceans 3apH 3aphysiological response 3aproteins 3aseawater 3aAsia 0aOcean acidification 0aBivalve 0aTegillarca granosa 0aMetabolism 0aAcid-base status 0aCalcification1 aShi, Wei1 aHan, Yu1 aLiu, Saixi1 aGuo, Cheng1 aFu, Wandong1 aChai, Xueliang1 aLiu, Guangxu0 tMarine environmental research.g2017 Apr., v. 125 p.82-89dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03670naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100001700172245014800189300001800337500001500355520179800370592002802168650001602196650001102212650001002223650001702233650001202250650003102262650001802293650002402311650002402335650002102359650002302380650003002403650001402433650001002447650001602457650001202473650003002485650003502515650004002550650003602590650001102626650003002637650003702667650004902704650003602753650004002789653001702829700002202846700003002868773008402898856008902982852000903071655001203080IND4466548320221122034918.0141110e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446654832DNAL7 a224106242pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNault, Rance10aEffects of polychlorinated biphenyls on whole animal energy mobilization and hepatic cellular respiration in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss  ap. 1057-1062.  a2019-12-06  aThe production of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was banned in 1977 but these chemicals persist in the environment and threaten aquatic organisms. PCB exposure often results in activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and increases in hepatic detoxification mechanisms. Activation of these detoxification mechanisms is believed to be associated with energetic demands that may come at the expense of other physiological processes such as growth, activity and reproduction. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to sub-lethal levels of PCBs results in increased energy demand and energy mobilization using both an in vivo and in vitro approach. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) received a single intraperitoneal sub-lethal dose (50μgkg⁻¹) of 3,3’,4,4’,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) and left for 10d after which standard oxygen consumption and plasma and liver metabolites were assessed. PCB 126 exposed trout did not alter standard oxygen consumption but did increase plasma glucose concentration implying the mobilization of glucose to cope with this exposure regime. Cellular respiration was assessed in trout hepatocytes exposed to PCB 126 or PCB 77 (3,3′4,4′-tetrachlorobiphenyl) two AhR activators but with different potencies (PCB 126≫PCB 77). Mitochondrial respiration was assessed by stimulating complex II with succinate and although no increases in respiration were associated with PCB exposure in non-stimulated cells, PCB 77 impaired mitochondrial respiration by preventing stimulation of complex II respiration and potentially masking any actual energetic costs of PCB exposure. These studies suggest that energy is mobilized upon exposure to PCBs, however, actual increases in energy demand may be overshadowed by impaired mitochondrial respiration.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahepatocytes 3aenergy 3aliver 3areproduction 3aglucose 3aenergy use and consumption 3ablood glucose 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aaquatic environment 3acell respiration 3aoxygen consumption 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3areceptors 3atrout 3ametabolites 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCell Respirationxdrug effects 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP1A1xmetabolism 2aEnergy Metabolismxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aHepatocytesxdrug effects 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMicrosomes, Liverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aOncorhynchus mykissxmetabolism 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxtoxicity 0ahydrocarbons1 aAl-Hameedi, Samar1 aMoon, T.

Optical remote sensing data have been successfully used in damage detections. Cloud conditions limit their potential, especially while monitoring floods or storms that are usually related to cloudy situations. Conversely, data from the Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) are operational in all-weather conditions and are sensitive to the geometrical properties of crops. Apple orchards play a key role in the Italian agriculture sector, presenting a cultivation system that is very sensitive to high-wind events. In this work, the H-α-A polarimetric decomposition technique was adopted to map damaged apple orchards with reference to a stormy event that had occurred in the study area (NW Italy) on 12 August 2020. The results showed that damaged orchards have higher H (entropy) and α (alpha angle) values compared with undamaged ones taken as reference (Mann–Whitney one-tailed test U = 14,514, p < 0.001; U = 16604, p < 0.001 for H and α, respectively). By contrast, A (anisotropy) values were significantly lower for damaged orchards (Mann–Whitney one-tailed test U = 8616, p < 0.001). Based on this evidence, the authors generated a map of potentially storm-damaged orchards, assigning a probability value to each of them. This map is intended to support local funding restoration policies by insurance companies and local administrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3acrop damage 3acrop losses 3aflood damage 3afloods 3aorchards 3apolarimetry 3aremote sensing 3astorm damage 3astorms 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atree damage 3avegetation maps 3awind damage 3aItaly1 aSarvia, Filippo 1 aGullino, Michele 1 aTarantino, Eufemia 1 aBorgogno-Mondino, Enrico 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Mar. 09, v. 13, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130510303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012900169520142800298592002801726650001201754650001301766650002201779650002301801650001501824650001001839650001401849650002201863650001101885650001901896650001101915650001301926650001401939650002201953650001601975650002501991653002002016653002002036653002402056653001602080700001902096700005602115700001802171773011402189856008602303852000902389655001202398IND60670321520221118022705.0200809e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067032152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1212812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhaohui10aResolving the kinetic and intrinsic constraints of heat-activated peroxydisulfate oxidation of iopromide in aqueous solution  aIopromide (IOP) has been identified as one of the most persistent pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment processes, however, kinetic and intrinsic factors constraining its fast removal in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are yet to be resolved. Here oxidation of IOP by heat-activated peroxydisulfate (PDS) was investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Rates of IOP degradation were enhanced by elevating solution temperature and acidity. An apparent kinetic rate equation was developed, based on the pseudo-first-order reaction model and assumption of steady state of SO₄⁻. The common water constituents showed inhibitory effects on IOP decomposition to various extent. An insufficient supply of SO₄⁻ was considered as the major kinetic constraint. Eight byproducts were identified and most of which had intact triiodinated benzene ring. O-demethylation, oxidation of amino moiety and oxidation/elimination of alcohol groups are proposed as the primary degradation pathways, in accordance with the incomplete mineralization and non-detectable release of inorganic iodine. Quantum chemical calculations predict that oxidation of alkyl chains of IOP preferentially occurs and IOP byproducts with shorter side chains and intact triiodinated ring are more reactive than IOP. By virtue of the identified kinetic and intrinsic constraints, strategies to maximize degradation efficiency of IOP are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aalcohols 3aaqueous solutions 3aaromatic compounds 3abyproducts 3adrugs 3aequations 3aintrinsic factors 3aiodine 3amineralization 3amodels 3amoieties 3aoxidation 3aquantum mechanics 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment 0aPeroxydisulfate 0aReaction orders 0aDegradation pathway 0aAlkyl chain1 aWang, Xiaoxiao1 aYuan, Ruixia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4471-530X1 aXiao, Dongxue0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 384 p.121281-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1212813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245011900158300001400277520136300291592002801654650001301682650002901695650001701724650002401741650001101765651002201776700001801798700002001816773010101836856003901937852000901976655001201985IND50090541020221117233449.0140621e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009054102DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.24272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlessi, Jessica10aPhoto‐identification of sperm whales in the north‐western Mediterranean Sea: an assessment of natural markings  ap. 11-22.  aPhoto‐identification is an important, non‐invasive tool that can be used to obtain data about cetacean population dynamics that are essential for proper environmental management. A standardized protocol is crucial for obtaining optimal results, particularly for long‐lived and highly migratory species such as sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) but also to study resident populations. Photo‐identification of individuals using natural marks has been widely used to study sperm whales in the Mediterranean Sea. However, the prevalence of the marks used for identification is unknown. Thus, the goal of this study was to identify which mark types are most useful for identifying individual sperm whales. A photo‐identification catalogue of sperm whales from the north‐western Mediterranean Sea was produced and examined to determine the most frequent mark types present on whales in the study area. Mark types and their distribution were described, prevalence and the size of each mark type were calculated, variability in visibility was investigated, and gain and loss rates were analysed. Analysis of natural pigmentation may characterize sperm whale flanks in this study area as the best and most convenient element on which matching technique can be based. Indeed, this technique led to the identification of 97% of photographed individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyseter 3aenvironmental management 3apigmentation 3apopulation dynamics 3awhales 3aMediterranean Sea1 aAïssi, Mehdi1 aFiori, Cristina0 tAquatic conservation.g2014 July, v. 24, no.

In this study, adsorptive removal of diclofenac sodium (DCF) from neutral aqueous solution by available lignite activated cokes (LACs) was reported for the first time. Diclofenac sodium could be quickly removed from aqueous solution by LAC-2, with the maximum Langmuir adsorption capacity qₘ of 224 mg/g at pH 6.5. Characterization results (including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, elemental analyses, Boehm titrations, N₂ adsorption-desorption isotherms and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) and a series of adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms model studies revealed that high porosity with developed macro- and micropore structures on LAC-2, as well as high content of phenolic groups, could obviously enhance the DCF adsorption capacity and rate. Moreover, LAC-2 showed high affinity towards DCF at low concentrations, as well as good reusability after three adsorption-desorption cycles. pH effect studies revealed that hydrogen-bonding interaction plays an important role during adsorption, accompanied with certain contribution from electrostatic interaction and π-π interaction. This study indicates the promising potential of LAC-2 as an efficient, low-cost and recyclable material for DCF removal from water bodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3adiclofenac 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3alignite 3amodels 3apH 3apollutants 3apollution control 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3asurface water 3atexture 0aLignite activated cokes 0aPore structure 0aAdsorption 0aLow-cost 0aDiclofenac sodium1 aDu, Chunxiao1 aHe, Juan1 aYang, Zhichao1 aLi, Haiyan0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 384 p.121284-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1212843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015100155500001900306520259100325592002802916650001102944650000902955650001502964650001102979650001302990700001803003700001803021700001803039773012803057856007403185852000903259655001203268IND60730846920221118181801.0210312e20210309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073084692DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130510372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dehai 12aA New Cycle-Slip Repair Method for Dual-Frequency BDS Against the Disturbances of Severe Ionospheric Variations and Pseudoranges with Large Errors  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMany Beidou navigation satellite system (BDS) receivers or boards provide dual-frequency measurements to conduct precise positioning and navigation for low-power consumption. Cycle-slip processing is a primary work to guarantee consistent, precise positioning with the phase data. However, the cycle-slip processing of BDS dual-frequency phases still follows with those of existing GPS methods. For single-satellite data, cycle-slip detection (CSD) with the geometry-free phase (GF) is disturbed by severe ionospheric delay variations, while CSD or cycle-slip repair (CSR) with the Melbourne–Wubbena combination (MW) must face the risk of the tremendous disturbance from large pseudorange errors. To overcome the above limitations, a new cycle-slip repair method for BDS dual-frequency phases (BDCSR) is proposed: (1) An optimal model to minimize the variance of the cycle-slip calculation was established to the dual-frequency BDS, after correcting the ionospheric variation with a reasonable and feasible way. (2) Under the BDS dual-frequency condition, a discrimination function was built to exclude the adverse disturbance from the pseudorange errors on the CSR, according to the rankings of the absolute epoch-difference GFs calculated by the searched cycle-slip candidates after correcting the ionospheric variation. Subsequently, many compared CSR tests were implemented in conditions of low and medium elevations during strong geomagnetic storms. Comparisons from the results of different methods show that: (1) The variations of ionospheric delays are intolerable in the cycle-slip calculation during the geomagnetic storm, and the tremendous influence from the ionospheric variation should be corrected before calculating the cycle-slip combination with the BDS dual-frequency data. (2) Under the condition of real dual-frequency BDS data during the geomagnetic storm, the actual success rate of the conventional dual-frequency CSR (CDCSR) by employing the optimized combinations, but absenting from the discrimination function, is lower than that of BDCSR by about 2%; The actual success rate of the CSD with MW (MWCSD), is lower than that of BDCSR by about 2%. (3) After adding gross errors of 0.7 m to all real epoch-difference pseudoranges epoch-by-epoch, results of CDCSR and MWCSD showed many errors. However, BDCSR achieved a higher actual success rate than those of CDCSR and MWCSD, about 43% and 16%, respectively, and better performance of refraining the disturbance of large pseudorange error on the cycle-slip determination was achieved in the BDCSR methodology.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3arisk 3asatellites 3astorms 3avariance1 aDang, Yaming 1 aYuan, Yunbin 1 aMi, Jinzhong 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Mar. 09, v. 13, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130510373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245006600163300001800229500001900247500002000266520161200286592002801898650001301926650001201939650001201951650001101963650002901974650001302003650001502016650001902031650001702050650002002067650001302087650001402100650003002114650001202144650002402156700002602180700002102206700002402227700002502251700006202276700002202338773014202360856007402502852000902576655001202585IND60704672120221119203928.0200725e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070467212DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.157892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurgiano, Leonardo10aKDM2B‐associated paunch calf syndrome in Marchigiana cattle  ap. 1657-1661.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Chianina, Romagnola, and Marchigiana are the 3 most important Italian breeds of cattle raised in the Apennine Mountains. Inherited disorders have been reported in the Chianina and Romagnola breeds but not in the Marchigiana breed. Recently, a case resembling recessively inherited KDM2B‐associated paunch calf syndrome (PCS) in Romagnola cattle was identified in Marchigiana cattle. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To characterize the features of the observed congenital anomaly, evaluate its possible genetic etiology, and determine the prevalence of the deleterious allele in the Marchigiana population. ANIMALS: A single stillborn Marchigiana calf was referred for clinicopathological examination because of the presence of PCS‐like morphological lesions. METHODS: The animal was necropsied and the calf and its parents were genotyped. A PCR‐based direct gene test was applied to determine the KDM2B genotype and 114 Marchigiana bulls were genotyped. RESULTS: The pathological phenotype included facial deformities, enlarged fluid‐filled abdomen, and hepatic fibrosis. The affected animal was the offspring of consanguineous mating and homozygous presence of the KDM2B missense variant was confirmed. Both parents were heterozygous for KDM2B and the prevalence of carriers in a selected population of Marchigiana bulls was <2%. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The characteristic malformations and genetic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of PCS and provide evidence that the deleterious KDM2B variant initially detected in Romagnola cattle also occurs in the Marchigiana breed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChianina 3aabdomen 3aalleles 3acalves 3acongenital abnormalities 3aetiology 3agenotyping 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3aliver cirrhosis 3anecropsy 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprogeny 3aveterinary medicine1 aMiliterno, Gianfranco1 aSbarra, Fiorella1 aDrögemüller, Cord1 aG.

Soil samples were collected from the roots of A. capillaries from cropland abandoned for 1, 3, 5, 10, and 13 years and from the roots of A. sacrorum from cropland abandoned for 13, 15, 20, and 30 years. The levels of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were determined to characterize microbial community structure, and community-level physiological profiles for identifying the patterns of use of carbon (C) substrates were determined to describe the functional diversity of the microbial communities. The rhizospheric microbial biomass (total PLFA), Gram-negative bacterial PLFA, fungal PLFA, and the carbon use (carbohydrates, amino acids, carboxylic acids, and polymers) of the pioneering successional species, A. capillaries, tended to decrease during the first 10 years and thereafter increased. The middle-late successional species, A. sacrorum, exhibited increasing Gram-negative bacterial, Gram-positive bacterial, bacterial, total PLFA, and use of carbohydrates, amino acids, carboxylic acids, phenolic acids, and polymers as the abandonment time increased. The higher microbial biomass, Gram-negative bacterial and bacterial PLFAs was found in the rhizospheric soil than that in the bulk soil for A. capillaries. Redundancy and correlation analyses indicated that the rhizospheric microbial PLFAs and C use for A. capillaries were more closely correlated with its coverage and aboveground biomass than with soil organic C and total nitrogen (N), while those for A. sacrorum were correlated more with organic C and total N contents than with coverage and aboveground biomass. Our study demonstrated that the structure and function of the rhizospheric microbial communities of different successional species generally changed differentially over time. Rhizospheric microbial communities were initially determined primarily by the host plant, but the soil C and N supplies selected for specific microfloras during the middle-late stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil organic carbon 3aroots 3aGram-positive bacteria 3afunctional diversity 3anitrogen content 3acarbohydrates 3aamino acids 3aArtemisia gmelinii 3aGram-negative bacteria 3acommunity structure 3amicrobial communities 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3ahost plants 3asoil 3acropland 3aphenolic acids 3aaboveground biomass 3amicrobial biomass 3apolymers 3aArtemisia capillaris 3afungi 3aChina 0acarbon 0aNatural succession 0aPhospholipid fatty acids 0aCommunity-level physiological profiles 0aMicrobial community 0aRhizosphere1 aLiu, Guobin1 aXue, Sha1 aWang, Guoliang0 tEcological engineering.g2015 Feb., v. 75 p.161-171dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2014.11.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012200164300001600286500001500302520091200317592002801229650002001257650001701277650002201294650001901316650002501335650001801360650001201378650002001390650002501410650003201435653001901467653002701486653001201513653001301525653001701538700002001555700001901575700001701594700001301611700001501624700001901639700001701658700002201675700001501697700001701712700001201729773010301741856008601844852000901930655001201939IND60537911720221117192410.0190408e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053791172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2014.11.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Piao10aCadmium induced hydrogen peroxide accumulation and responses of enzymatic antioxidants in Phanerochaete chrysosporium  ap. 110-115.  a2019-12-06  aThe white-rot fungi Phanerochaete chrysosporium have been widely applied in heavy metal bioremediation, which commonly results in a stress exposure. Exposure studies showed that Cd bioaccumulation triggered H2O2 generation. Thereafter, the H2O2, as signal molecules, activated the enzymatic antioxidant response in the case of the conjunction of SOD and CAT. High levels of R (SOD/CAT) were found initially under Cd exposure, and then a significant decline occurred in time-course Cd exposure. Antioxidant activities also provided an alternative as an indication of the existence of antioxidant response upon Cd exposure, via coupling H2O2 level with the variation in antioxidant activities. This finding potentially has implications for the understanding of tolerance behavior and detoxification mechanisms, which is beneficial to expand the application of P. chrysosporium in bioremediation biotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioaccumulation 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3abioremediation 3asuperoxide dismutase 3abiotechnology 3acadmium 3awhite-rot fungi 3aantioxidant activity 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 0aDetoxification 0aEnzymatic antioxidants 0aCadmium 0aToxicity 0aantioxidants1 aZeng, Guangming1 aHuang, Danlian1 aDong, Haoran1 aLai, Cui1 aChen, Ming1 aTang, Wangwang1 aLi, Fangling1 aLeng, Y.q(Yang),1 aCheng, Min1 aHe, Xiaoxiao1 aHe, Yan0 tEcological engineering.g2015 Feb., v. 75 p.110-115dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2014.11.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01770naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245010300162300001800265500001400283520057200297592002800869650002100897650002900918650001800947650002000965650001700985650001401002653002701016653004401043653001501087700002001102700001801122773018401140856007501324852000901399655001201408IND60691993520221122010233.0200502e20030101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069199352DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.67.18442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTAJIMA, Hirokuni10aParadoxical Effect of Synthetic Hydroxy Isothiocyanates on Antimicrobial Action of Aminoglycosides  ap. 1844-1846.  aNAL-light  aHydroxy isothiocyanates, especially 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl isothiocyanate (hITC), were examined for antimicrobial synergism with streptomycin (SM) against Escherichia coli.

A TF network map is a graph that indicates which TFs bind and directly regulate each gene. Previous work has described network mapping algorithms that rely exclusively on gene expression data and ‘integrative’ algorithms that exploit a wide range of data sources including chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of many TFs, genome-wide chromatin marks, and binding specificities for many TFs determined in vitro. However, such resources are available only for a few major model systems and cannot be easily replicated for new organisms or cell types. We present NetProphet 2.0, a ‘data light’ algorithm for TF network mapping, and show that it is more accurate at identifying direct targets of TFs than other, similarly data light algorithms. In particular, it improves on the accuracy of NetProphet 1.0, which used only gene expression data, by exploiting three principles. First, combining multiple approaches to network mapping from expression data can improve accuracy relative to the constituent approaches. Second, TFs with similar DNA binding domains bind similar sets of target genes. Third, even a noisy, preliminary network map can be used to infer DNA binding specificities from promoter sequences and these inferred specificities can be used to further improve the accuracy of the network map.

Determination of management practices or phenotypic markers associated with ID may benefit animal welfare. OBJECTIVES: Determine ID status of a population of Finnhorses using an oral sugar test (OST) and compare phenotypes and management factors between ID and non‐ID Finnhorses. ANIMALS: One hundred twenty‐eight purebred Finnhorses ≥3 years of age. METHODS: Owners were recruited using an online questionnaire regarding signalment, history, feeding, and exercise of their horses. Selected contributing stables within a predefined area were visited. Phenotypic markers of obesity and the weight of each horse were recorded. After fasting overnight, horses received 0.45 mL/kg corn syrup PO. Serum samples before and at 60 and 90 minutes after syrup administration were analyzed for insulin by chemiluminescent assay. Horses met ID criteria if insulin concentrations were ≥33 μIU/mL at T0, ≥66 μIU/mL at T60 or T90 or some combination thereof. Associations between phenotypic markers, feeding and exercise variables, and ID were examined using mixed effects logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: Several phenotypic markers of obesity were significant on univariable analysis but in the final multivariable model, only obesity (body condition score ≥8) was associated with ID (P = .04). Over half of the horses (60% [95% confidence interval (CI), 51%‐68%]) were considered overweight or obese whereas 16% (95% CI, 10%‐23%) were classified as having ID. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Because obesity is associated with ID in cold‐blooded type horses, objective monitoring of phenotypic markers by owners may be beneficial for health outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFinnhorse 3aanimal welfare 3ablood serum 3abody condition 3aconfidence interval 3acorn syrup 3aexercise 3ahorses 3ainsulin 3alaminitis 3aluminescent assay 3aobesity 3aphenotype 3apurebreds 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asugars 3aveterinary medicine1 aMcGowan, Cathy M.1 aRaekallio, Marja R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2653-003X1 aMykkänen, Anna K.1 aCarslake, Harry1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1288-17681 aKarikoski, Ninja P.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2020 July, v. 34, no. 4 p.1599-1605dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.157823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100006200159245010100221300001400322520124600336592002801582650004401610650001001654650001601664650002601680650001501706650001301721650001901734650003301753650002101786650001301807650002101820650001501841650001501856653002701871653002201898653001601920700001901936700001701955773009701972856009302069852000902162655001202171IND60562486220221123041619.0170719e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056248622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2015.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButylina, Svetlana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7282-984110aWeathering properties of coextruded polypropylene-based composites containing inorganic pigments  ap. 10-16.  aThis study concerns the weathering properties of coextruded polypropylene-based composites containing pigments. Three different pigments were incorporated in the shell layer of the composites: iron oxide, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. The surface colour, surface gloss and tensile properties were tested. In addition, the weathered surfaces were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The surfaces of the composites containing inorganic pigments were found to have fewer cracks after 500 h of weathering than the surface of the reference composite. The results revealed that the composites containing titanium oxide pigment exhibited better colour stability than the composites made with the other pigments. In spite of its high colour stability in weathering, the tensile properties (strength, Young's modulus and elongation at break) of the composite containing titanium oxide were reduced by weathering. The FTIR analysis revealed that the composite containing zinc oxide had a stabilising effect on polypropylene photo-degradation, which correlates well with the results of mechanical testing, showing that this composite retained its mechanical properties after weathering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acolor 3airon oxides 3amodulus of elasticity 3aphotolysis 3apigments 3apolypropylenes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atensile strength 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 3aweathering 3azinc oxide 0aWood-polymer composite 0aInorganic pigment 0aCoextrusion1 aMartikka, Ossi1 aKärki, Timo0 tPolymer Degradation and Stability.g2015 Oct., v. 120 p.10-16dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2015.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02161naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245008200168300002000250520067800270592002800948596007300976596011001049596012201159650001601281650001401297650001301311650002201324650001601346650002101362700006901383700006001452700006101512773013701573856008001710852000901790655001201799IND60793436420220916000000.0220916e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079343642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.2c014862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmallman, Harry R.10aContinuous Flow Generation of Acylketene Intermediates via Nitrogen Extrusion  ap. 12297-12305.  aA flow chemistry process for the generation and use of acylketene precursors through extrusion of nitrogen gas is reported. Key to the development of a suitable continuous protocol is the balance of reaction concentration against pressure in the flow reactor. The resulting process enables access to intercepted acylketene scaffolds using volatile amine nucleophiles and has been demonstrated on the gram scale. Thermal gravimetric analysis was used to guide the temperature set point of the reactor coils for a variety of acyl ketene precursors. The simultaneous generation and reaction of two reactive intermediates (both derived from nitrogen extrusion) is demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcUniversity College Londondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000765  a2021/06661-5cFunda??o de Amparo ?

To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that the Galβ1-3GlcNAcβ1-4Man unit occurs in N-glycans of insect glycoproteins, indicating a β1-3 galactosyl transferase and β1-4GlcNAc transferase (GNT-IV) are expressed in the honeybee cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3aglycoproteins 3ahoney bees 3aroyal jelly 3atransferases 0aN-glycan 0ainsect glycoprotein 0aβ1-3galactosyl transferase 0aApis mellifera1 aTSUMURA, Kazunori1 aKIMURA, Mariko1 aOKIHARA, Kiyoshi1 aSugimoto, Hiroyuki,1 aYamada, Hideo,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2003 Jan. 1, v. 67, no. 8 p.1852-1856dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.67.18523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01455naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007100140245013100211300001800342520039600360592002800756650002100784650002300805650001200828700001300840700001700853700001900870700001900889700001700908773013300925856007401058852000901132655001201141IND60638649420221119035944.0190430e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063864942DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc09314g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnThe first two authors contributed equally to this work., Shu-wen14aThe templated synthesis of a unique type of tetra-nuclear uranyl-mediated two-fold interpenetrating uranyl–organic framework  ap. 1641-1644.  aTwo novel tetra-nuclear uranyl-mediated two-fold interpenetrating networks, [U₄O₁₀(dbsf)₃]₂[H₂bpp]₂ and [U₄O₁₀(dbsf)₃][H₂bpp], have been hydrothermally synthesized from a semi-rigid carboxylic acid, H₂dbsf, with the organic base, bpp, as the charge balancing agent and stacking template (H₂dbsf = 4,4′-dicarboxybiphenyl sulfone, bpp = 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane).  aPublisher supplied data 3acarboxylic acids 3achemical reactions 3apropane1 aMei, Lei1 aHu, Kong-qiu1 aXia, Chuan-qin1 aChai, Zhi-fang1 aShi, Wei-qun0 tChemical communications.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 52, no. 8 p.1641-1644dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5cc09314g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015800159300001800317500001900335500002000354520171600374592002802090650001602118650001502134650002102149650002002170650001202190650001902202650001602221650002002237650002402257700002002281700002202301700001702323700006202340773014202402856007402544852000902618655001202627IND60704672520221119204216.0200725e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070467252DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.158142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Gong‐Yi10aRelationship between ultrasonographically determined renal dimensions and International Renal Interest Society stages in cats with chronic kidney disease  ap. 1464-1475.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The correlation between renal dimensions and renal function in cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unclear. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between renal dimensions and CKD severity in cats using ultrasound examination. ANIMALS: Nineteen healthy cats and 30 cats with CKD. METHODS: Renal ultrasound images obtained between 2012 and 2016 were reviewed. Severity of CKD was determined using the International Renal Interest Society CKD staging system. Renal length, cortical thickness, medullary thickness, and corticomedullary ratio were measured, and the relationship between these renal dimensions and serum creatinine concentrations as well as differences in dimensions between the control and disease groups was investigated. The sensitivity and specificity of the renal dimensions for differentiation of the CKD also were evaluated. RESULTS: The disease group was subdivided into stage I to II (15 cats) and stage III to IV (15 cats) groups. Cortical thickness was significantly decreased in both disease groups and negatively correlated with disease severity. Compared with other renal dimensions, cortical thickness had a stronger linear correlation with the reciprocal of the serum creatinine concentration and superior diagnostic performance (Youden index: left kidney, 90.0% sensitivity and 94.7% specificity for a cutoff of 4.7 mm; right kidney, 83.3% sensitivity and 94.7% specificity for a cutoff of 4.5 mm). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Decreased renal cortical thickness is observed in cats with loss of renal function. Measurement of cortical thickness using ultrasonography could be a useful method to evaluate the progression of CKD in cats.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3adisease severity 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3arenal function 3aultrasonics 3aultrasonography 3aveterinary medicine1 aChen, Kuan‐Yo1 aWang, Hsien‐Chi1 aMa, Tzu‐Yi1 aChen, Kuan‐Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3191-15630 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2020 July, v. 34, no. 4 p.1464-1475dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.158143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011000168520108700278592002801365650001501393650002001408650000901428650001101437650001501448650000901463650001201472650001401484653002901498653000801527653001401535653000901549653003401558700001901592700001901611700002301630773012101653856008201774852000901856655001201865IND60773085520221119052549.0220605e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077308552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2022.1044202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFutami, Kunihiko10aLack of a p16INK4a/ARF locus in fish genome may underlie senescence resistance in the fish cell line, EPC  aUnlike most mammalian cell lines, fish cell lines are immortal and resistant to cellular senescence. Elevated expression of H-Ras contributes to the induction of senescence in a fish cell line, EPC, but is not sufficient to induce full senescence. Here, we focused on the absence of a p16ᴵᴺᴷ⁴ᵃ/ARF locus in the fish genome, and investigated whether this might be a critical determinant of the resistance of EPC cells to full senescence. We found that transfected EPC cells constitutively overexpressing p16ᴵᴺᴷ⁴ᵃ exhibited large size and flat morphology characteristic of prematurely senescent cells; the cells also showed p53-independent senescence-like growth arrest and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors increased in EPC cells constitutively overexpressing p16ᴵᴺᴷ⁴ᵃ. These results suggest that the lack of p16ᴵᴺᴷ⁴ᵃ in the fish genome may be a critical determinant of senescence resistance in fish cell lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell lines 3acell senescence 3afish 3agenome 3aimmunology 3aloci 3amammals 3aphenotype 0a5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine 0aEPC 0aSA-β-gal 0aSASP 0aSenescence-like growth arrest1 aSato, Shunichi1 aMaita, Masashi1 aKatagiri, Takayuki0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2022 Aug., v. 133 p.104420-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2022.1044203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008800168300001600256520130500272592002801577650002601605650001601631650001501647650002001662650001301682650001101695650001401706650001701720650001401737650001301751651002301764653002401787653002101811653001501832653001901847653002101866653000901887653001601896700002001912773010301932856008602035852000902121655001202130IND60537912020221117192053.0190408e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053791202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2014.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiloshis, M.10aCoastal wetland management: A rating system for potential engineering interventions  ap. 195-198.  aThis study focuses on coastal management issues relevant to key decision-makers in Australia’s Northern Territory with respect to growing concerns about the effects of sea level rise on coastal freshwater wetlands. There is a growing global knowledge base and understanding of the symbiotic relationship between ecological forms of coastal protection and benefits to both small- and large-scale anthro-natural systems. This work summarises, and then provides a new scoring/ranking system for, the range of traditional and modern eco-engineering options available in terms of their effectiveness at addressing the concerns of stakeholders in the future. Considering the evidence that the Mary River is already showing signs of adaptation and that the coastal wetlands in this area are relatively pristine compared to most coastal wetlands around the world, there is a positive outlook. The opportunity to use natural wetland processes without significant cost or land management burden should be harnessed with planning in place to prepare for the effects of sea level rise. In the case of the Mary River wetlands, traditional engineering is neither required, nor beneficial; ecological engineering associated with conservation and rehabilitation is deemed as the more effective management response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem engineering 3aengineering 3afreshwater 3aland management 3aplanning 3arivers 3asea level 3astakeholders 3asymbiosis 3awetlands 3aNorthern Territory 0aFreshwater wetlands 0aCoastal wetlands 0aManagement 0aSea level rise 0aSaline intrusion 0aCost 0aEngineering1 aFairfield, C.A.0 tEcological engineering.g2015 Feb., v. 75 p.195-198dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2014.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245012800204300001100332506007600343520162900419592002802048596008102076596006202157596006902219596005202288506003702340650001502377650001902392650002002411650001402431650003102445650001002476650001102486650001402497650002402511650000902535650002202544650003002566700001602596700001902612700002302631700002302654700001702677700002402694700001702718773009602735856008202831852000902913655001202922IND60650429720221207055208.0191228e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065042972DNAL7 a10.1186/s41065-019-0100-12doi7 aPMC66176252pmcid7 a313333382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zihao12aA co-expression network for differentially expressed genes in bladder cancer and a risk score model for predicting survival  ap. 24.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Urothelial bladder cancer (BLCA) is one of the most common internal malignancies worldwide with poor prognosis. This study aims to explore effective prognostic biomarkers and construct a prognostic risk score model for patients with BLCA. METHODS: Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used for identifying the co-expression module related to the pathological stage of BLCA based on the RNA-Seq data retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Prognostic biomarkers screened by Cox proportional hazard regression model and random forest were used to construct a risk score model that can predict the prognosis of patients with BLCA. The GSE13507 dataset was used as the independent testing dataset to test the performance of the risk score model in predicting the prognosis of patients with BLCA. RESULTS: WGCNA identified seven co-expression modules, in which the brown module consisted of 77 genes was most significantly correlated with the pathological stage of BLCA. Cox proportional hazard regression model and random forest identified TPST1 and P3H4 as prognostic biomarkers. Elevated TPST1 and P3H4 expressions were associated with the high pathological stage and worse survival. The risk score model based on the expression level of TPST1 and P3H4 outperformed pathological stage indicators and previously proposed prognostic models. CONCLUSION: The gene co-expression network-based study could provide additional insight into the tumorigenesis and progression of BLCA, and our proposed risk score model may aid physicians in the assessment of the prognosis of patients with BLCA.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.2015A030313289cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China  aNo.81272844cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a№ 02.A03.21.0006cAct 211 Government of the Russian Federation  aNo. AAAA-A18-118020590108-7cIIP UB RAS project0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomarkers 3acarcinogenesis 3adata collection 3adatabases 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amodels 3aprognosis 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asequence analysis 3aurinary bladder neoplasms1 aLiu, Guojun1 aHossain, Aslam1 aDanilova, Irina G.1 aBolkov, Mikhail A.1 aLiu, Guoqing1 aTuzankina, Irina A.1 aTan, Wanlong0 tHereditas.g2019 Dec., v. 156, no. 1 p.24-24dBioMed CentralwJournal:6164x1601-52237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41065-019-0100-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008900173300001600262520132000278536032401598592002801922596005701950596008202007650001302089650001302102650002502115650001702140650002302157650002602180650002002206650001502226650001302241650001702254650001302271650001502284650001902299650001402318650002102332653002802353653002802381700002102409700002002430773012502450856008502575852000902660655001202669IND60693904120221118131056.0200509e20200303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069390412DNAL7 a10.1080/1040841X.2020.17359912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanerji, Rajashri10aRole of interspecies bacterial communication in the virulence of pathogenic bacteria  ap. 136-146.  aBacteria live in a polymicrobial community where it interacts with biotic and abiotic factors using specific signalling molecules. Acyl homoserine lactones, autoinducing peptides, bacteriocins and polyamines are a few signals documented for interspecies signalling. The signalling system could be used for a coordinated behaviour categorised as Quorum sensing (QS). QS is a term used to define a cell – cell communication process amongst bacteria that helps to gather cell density information and regulate gene expression accordingly. QS had been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in bacterial pathogenesis by regulating the expression of different virulence factors affecting adhesion, invasion and survival within a tissue. In the current review, we discuss the role of interspecies bacterial communication in pathogenicity. The molecules involved in the interspecies bacterial communication affecting virulence factors required for the establishment of infection have been discussed in detail to gain an insight for development of strategies that can be proposed to combat bacterial infections by attenuating their communication systems. The knowledge on the role of interspecies bacterial communication on virulence will assist in understanding the factors affecting symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.  aThe work was supported by the Ramalingaswami fellowship programme of Department of Biotechnology, India under grant BT/RLF/Re-entry/41/2015; Major research project grant of Symbiosis International (Deemed University) under grant SIU/SCRI/MJRP-Approval/2019/1556 and ERASMUS+ grant 598515-EPP-1-2018-1-IN-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP.  aPublisher supplied data  aBT/RLF/Re-entry/41/2015cDepartment of Biotechnology  aSIU/SCRI/MJRP-Approval/2019/1556cSymbiosis International (Deemed University) 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3abacteriocins 3acell communication 3aenvironmental factors 3agene expression 3ahomoserine 3alactones 3apathogenesis 3apeptides 3apolyamines 3aquorum sensing 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 0ainterspecies signalling 0abacterial communication1 aKanojiya, Poonam1 aSaroj, Sunil D.0 tCritical reviews in microbiology.g2020 Mar. 3, v. 46, no. 2 p.136-146dTaylor & FranciswJournal:14619x1549-78287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1040841X.2020.17359913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03775naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245013800204300001600342520218800358592002802546650002302574650001202597650002202609650001202631650002002643650001502663650001302678650001202691650003302703650001602736650001502752650002302767650002502790650002802815650001102843650002202854650001502876653001802891653001702909653001402926653002002940653001902960700001402979700001702993700001803010700001703028773010503045856008603150852000903236655001203245IND60614337120221118215205.0190318e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061433712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.09.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2811-900910aHydraulic redistribution and its contribution to water retention during short-term drought in the summer rainy season in a humid area  ap. 377-385.  aHydraulic redistribution (HR) in sites with shallow soils and its response to random droughts during the summer rainy season in humid areas remains poorly understood. We investigated the soil moisture dynamics, HR and water buffer of shallow soils by monitoring the soil moisture content at multiple depths during a random drought event in the summer rainy season, in typical forestland and orchard in a subtropical area. Soil moisture sensors were installed at depths of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 cm at three sites (forest, peach1, and peach2). The total and net daily water use and water buffer capacity of the root zone were defined and calculated. During the short-term drought, the HR of soil moisture occurred at all sites, suggesting that it could be an important process in both forest and orchard land in response to short-term drought. HR occurred at both daily and multiple-day timescales in the shallow soils. The net daily water use had less difference between the sites than the total daily water use. Principal component analysis of the total and net daily water use showed only evident clustering characteristics for the total daily water use, indicating an important plant-soil interaction effect. The depth-averaged magnitude of daily HR varied from 0.385 mm (0.0077 m3 m−3) at the forest site to 0.725 mm (0.0145 m3 m−3) at the peach1 site. The redistributed water replenished over 75% of the water depleted from the shallow soil. In particular, soil moisture was better retained in 15–20 cm root zone than in other soil layers. Furthermore, the water buffer capacity of the forest site was not higher than those of the two peach sites (where land use converted from forest), indicating that land use conversion does not necessarily weaken soil water retention. The study results highlighted that HR has a significant influence on water recharge and water retention in humid area, thus benefiting plant drought tolerance and total water utilization. This study provides more insights to evaluate HR’s effect on water retention and enhance our understanding of HR in shallow soils during random droughts in the summer rainy season in humid areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffering capacity 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aforests 3aland use change 3amonitoring 3aorchards 3apeaches 3aprincipal component analysis 3arhizosphere 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoil water retention 3asoil-plant interactions 3asummer 3awater utilization 3awet season 0aSoil moisture 0aShallow soil 0aWater use 0aBuffer capacity 0aRandom drought1 aYang, Lei1 aChen, Liding1 aZhao, Fangkai1 aLi, Shoujuan0 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 Nov., v. 566 p.377-385dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.09.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01209naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245010800200300001800308520013100326592002800457650001500485650002300500650001700523650002100540700001800561700001700579700001600596700001900612700001100631700001300642773013300655856007400788852000900862655001200871IND60650429820221122022406.0190710e20190709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065042982DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc01651a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanThese authors contributed equally to this work., Wei12aA nuclear-targeted titanium dioxide radiosensitizer for cell cycle regulation and enhanced radiotherapy  ap. 8182-8185.  aA nuclear-targeted titanium dioxide radiosensitizer was developed to regulate the cell cycle and enhance the radiation effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell cycle 3achemical reactions 3aradiotherapy 3atitanium dioxide1 aGong, Shaohua1 aWang, Jianbo1 aYu, Longhai1 aChen, Yuanyuan1 aLi, Na1 aTang, Bo0 tChemical communications.g2019 July 9, v. 55, no. 56 p.8182-8185dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc01651a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245013400174500001400308520184100322592002802163650001602191650001202207650002402219650001702243650001202260650001502272650002402287650002302311650002302334650001102357650001602368650001502384650001202399650001502411650001302426650001502439650001902454650001302473650002702486653003002513653002102543653002802564653002102592653002202613653003302635700001602668700001602684700002002700773009502720856008402815852000902899655001202908IND60707642020221119101250.0210105e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070764202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2020.1020372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutherland, Donna L.10aEffects of nutrient load on microalgal productivity and community composition grown in anaerobically digested food-waste centrate  aNAL-light  aAnaerobic digestion of food waste has many environmental benefits over traditional landfilling and is a promising technology to convert food waste to energy. However, the centrate, a liquid by-product of anaerobic digestion, is high in total ammonia, with concentrations ~20,000 g m⁻³, which requires treatment being discharged to the environment. Microalgae offer a promising and cost-effective treatment solution for this centrate but some dilution is required to prevent free-ammonia inhibition. In this study, we investigate the performance of microalgae, grown outdoors in high rate algal mesocosms, under three different total ammonia loads i) 20 g m⁻³ (20N), ii) 60 g m⁻³ (60 N) and iii) 100 g m⁻³ (100N). Both total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) increased with increasing nutrient load, with 100 N significantly higher (p < .01) than 60 N and 20 N biomass. The percentage nitrogen uptake was significantly higher in 20 N compared to 60 N (p < .05) and 100 N (p < .01). In contrast, the percentage biological uptake of phosphorus (P) did not differ significantly between treatments. Total microalgal biovolume increased with increasing nutrient load with nine species of chlorophytes (green algae) observed across all treatments throughout the experiment. Bray–Curtis percentage similarities between the microalgal community relative abundance, showed that the community in the 100 N treatment was at least 50% dissimilar to 20 N and 60 N, which were at least 75% similar to each other throughout the course of the experiment. These results indicate the capability of microalgae to bioremediate centrate from anaerobically digested food waste with high ammonia loading. Coupled centrate treatment and resource recovery could help support the circular bioeconomy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorophyta 3aammonia 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioeconomics 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3acommunity structure 3acost effectiveness 3aecosystem services 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3afood waste 3aliquids 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apollution load 3aresearch 3atotal suspended solids 0aHigh rate algal mesocosms 0aCircular economy 0aMicroalgal productivity 0aNutrient removal 0aResource recovery 0aMicroalgal treatment systems1 aBurke, Joel1 aLeal, Erica1 aRalph, Peter J.0 tAlgal research.g2020 Oct., v. 51 p.102037-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2020.1020373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012700165300001600292500001900308520155600327592002801883596005901911596006201970596008902032596013202121650001702253650001202270650001402282650001502296650001102311650001302322650001402335700001302349700002102362700001702383700002102400700001802421700005902439773010402498856008202602852000902684655001202693IND60693545520221119092547.0200507e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069354552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-020-01482-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ya-Hui10aTranscript profiling of genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis among three carrot cultivars with various taproot colors  ap. 949-963.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCarotenoids are a group of natural pigments that are widely distributed in various plants. Carrots are plants rich in carotenoids and have fleshy roots with different colors. Carotenoid accumulation is a complex regulatory process with important guiding significance for carrot production. In this work, three carrot cultivars with different taproot colors, Hongxinqicun (orange), Benhongjinshi (red), and Tianzi (purple) were chosen as experimental materials to explore the molecular mechanism of carotenoid accumulation in carrot. Results showed that the three carotenoids, namely, α-carotene, β-carotene, and lutein, had accumulated in orange carrot cultivar Hongxinqicun. Lycopene was only detected in the taproots of Benhongjinshi. Lutein was the main carotenoid in Tianzi. Comparison of the carotenoid contents in different tissues of carrot showed that leaf blade was the tissue with the highest carotenoid accumulation. Expression analysis of carotenoid biosynthesis genes and its correlation with carotenoid accumulation confirmed the regulatory role of structural genes in carrots. The high expression of five lycopene synthesis-related genes, DcPSY2, DcPDS, DcZDS1, DcCRT1, DcCRT2, and low expression of DcLCYE may result in the lycopene accumulation in Benhongjinshi. However, the function of certain genes, such as DcPSY1 that was lowly expressed in red carrot, requires further investigation. Our results provided potential insights into the mechanism of carotenoid accumulation in three carrot cultivars with different taproot colors.  aPublisher supplied data  a31872098cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNCET-11-0670cNew Century Excellent Talents in University  aPAPDcPriority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions  aZW201905cthe Open Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University 3abiosynthesis 3acarrots 3acultivars 3aleaf blade 3alutein 3alycopene 3atap roots1 aLi, Tong1 aZhang, Rong-Rong1 aKhadr, Ahmed1 aTian, Yong-Sheng1 aXu, Zhi-Sheng1 aXiong, Ai-Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7900-50010 tProtoplasma.g2020 May, v. 257, no. 3 p.949-963dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl44608x0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-020-01482-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245012100207300001800328520145800346592002801804650002301832650001901855650002701874650001801901650001501919650001101934650001501945650001801960650001201978650001401990650001002004650001702014651001302031700006402044700005902108700006102167700005602228773016302284856008302447852000902530655001202539IND60769621220221119111555.0220308e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076962122DNAL7 a10.1007/s42690-021-00664-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIqbal, Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8933-613810aBiorational approach for management of whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae), on cotton crop  ap. 1461-1469.  aWhitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae), has become a key pest of transgenic cotton crop in Pakistan. As insecticides are losing effectiveness, there is dire need to work on microbial and bioinsecticides for early season management of whitefly. The current study was designed for the evaluation of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae and synthetic insecticides against whitefly to find out their effectiveness under laboratory and field conditions. Under laboratory conditions, significantly higher mortality (74-84%) was observed in treatments of synthetic insecticides (spirotetramat, flonicamid, pyriproxyfen and buprofezin) and bioinsecticides (Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae) against laboratory reared whitefly populations. However, when applied against whitefly at three locations under field conditions, these products (insecticides and entomopathogenic fungi) reduced the population ranging from 14-63% for nymphs and 16-62% for adults of whitefly. Synthetic insecticides, insect growth regulators (spirotetramat and pyriproxyfen) were found effective as nymphicidal action, whereas flonicamid and diafenthiuron were better as adulticidal action. Bioinsecticides showed the least effectiveness under the field conditions. This study is the first report of field evaluation from Pakistan and would help in application of entomopathogenic fungi as alternative technique for pest management in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aBemisia tabaci 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3abiopesticides 3abuprofezin 3acotton 3aflonicamid 3ainsect growth 3ainsects 3amortality 3apests 3apyriproxyfen 3aPakistan1 aArif, Muhammad Jalal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3185-40041 aShafqat, Saeed,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1892-977X1 aHasan, Mansoor ul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8283-41371 aJaved, Nazir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4250-59850 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2022 Apr., v. 42, no. 2 p.1461-1469dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42690-021-00664-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245011600162300001800278500002000296520153800316592002801854650001401882650001001896650002001906650002101926650001601947650002401963650001201987650002601999650001102025650001702036650001302053650000702066650001502073650001202088650001202100650001402112650002902126650001502155700001702170700002202187700002402209700002102233700005902254773012502313856007902438852000902517655001202526IND60689248320221119042334.0200420e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068924832DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.150782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinghu, Ziyi10aAmino acids effects on heterocyclic amines formation and physicochemical properties in pan‐fried beef patties  ap. 1361-1370.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effects of surface application of amino acids on the formation of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and meat quality properties were evaluated in pan‐fried beef patties (230 °C/15 min). Tryptophan, lysine, leucine, and proline at three concentrations, 0.05%, 0.20%, and 0.50% (w/w), were tested. The meat crusts were analyzed for HCA content using liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry. Results showed that surface application of all tested amino acids significantly reduced total HCA content (P < 0.05), and the interaction of amino acid type and concentration significantly affected (P < 0.05) both individual and total HCA formation. Tryptophan at 0.50% reduced total HCAs the most (0.92 ng/g, 93% inhibition), followed by 0.50% lysine (1.94 ng/g, 84% inhibition), while leucine (3.95 ng/g, 64% inhibition) and proline (4.71 ng/g, 56% inhibition) were less effective at 0.50%. In addition, applying amino acids to meat surface significantly influenced (P < 0.05) pH and surface color change of beef crusts; particularly, lysine at 0.20% and 0.50% increased pH and a* (redness) but reduced b* (yellowness), while tryptophan and leucine at 0.50% increased L* (whiteness). No significant effect was observed on cooking loss. Adding amino acids at 0.50% affected (P < 0.05) formation of aldehydes and pyrazines (as the key flavor compounds of fried beef). Overall, the results of this study suggested that adding amino acids to ground beef patties could effectively mitigate mutagenic HCA formation during cooking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3acolor 3acooking quality 3aflavor compounds 3aground beef 3aheterocyclic amines 3aleucine 3aliquid chromatography 3alysine 3ameat quality 3amutagens 3apH 3apan frying 3apatties 3aproline 3apyrazines 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atryptophan1 aKarim, Faris1 aTaghvaei, Mostafa1 aAlbashabsheh, Zaher1 aHouser, Terry A.1 aSmith, J.

The effects of different CE parameters such as concentration and pH of the running buffer, voltage, injection time and concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were optimized. Under the optimized conditions, naringenin could be well determined within 6 min using 40 mM borate buffer, 40 mM SDS at pH 9.0, at an applied voltage of 25 kV. For the quantitative determination of naringenin (flavonoid aglycone) in grapefruit juice, the naringin (flavonoid glycoside) was hydrolysed and the resulting aglycone was identified and quantified. The calibration curve was linear in the studied concentration range of 0.1 to 50 μg mL⁻¹ (R² = 0.995). The detection limit and the limit of quantification were found to be 0.05 and 0.19 μg mL⁻¹, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3aborates 3adetection limit 3aelectric potential difference 3agrapefruit juice 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3amicellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography 3anaringenin 3anaringin 3apH 3aquantitative analysis 3asodium dodecyl sulfate1 aSolangi, Amber R.1 aMemon, Saima Q.1 aMallah, Arfana1 aMemon, Najma0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 May 28, v. 7, no. 11 p.4521-4527dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay00632e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245008300174300001800257520089200275592002801167650001601195650001301211650002101224650001701245650001501262650001801277650001601295700001801311700001901329773011601348856009001464852000901554655001201563IND60439718620221118093926.0151024e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043971862DNAL7 a10.1023/B:JMSC.0000026944.85440.f32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Jianxun10aWater vapor transport in liquid crystalline and non-liquid crystalline epoxies  ap. 3413-3423.  aThis paper presents a comparison of moisture permeation in liquid crystalline and non-liquid crystalline epoxy systems. The permeability is obtained using a dynamic method. It is found that diffusion in both epoxy systems is Fickian. The liquid crystalline epoxy network exhibits higher barrier properties to moisture transport than the conventional epoxy network. The efficient chain packing of the smectic mesophase of the liquid crystalline epoxy is the main factor for this difference. The stoichiometry has a large effect on the moisture permeation. The diffusion coefficient decreases monotonically with increasing amine/epoxide functional ratio. The permeability (P) and solubility coefficient (S) reach a minimum for a functional ratio of one. The results are described on the basis of hydrogen bonding of water to the epoxy network and the two phase morphology of cured epoxies.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiffusivity 3aepoxides 3ahydrogen bonding 3apermeability 3asolubility 3astoichiometry 3awater vapor1 aBerger, K.

The litter size in some wool sheep breeds is associated with the presence of mutations, mainly in the family of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) genes. To explore genetic mechanisms underlying the variation in litter size, we conducted a genome-wide association study in two groups of Pelibuey sheep (multiparous sheep with two lambs per birth vs. uniparous sheep with a single lamb at birth) using the OvineSNP50 BeadChip. We identified a total of 57 putative SNPs markers (p < 3.0 × 10⁻³, Bonferroni correction). The candidate genes that may be associated with litter size in Pelibuey sheep are CLSTN2, MTMR2, DLG1, CGA, ABCG5, TRPM6, and HTR1E. Genomic regions were also identified that contain three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for aseasonal reproduction (ASREP), milk yield (MY), and body weight (BW). These results allowed us to identify SNPs associated with genes that could be involved in the reproductive process related to prolificacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPelibuey (sheep breed) 3abody weight 3afarms 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3alitter size 3amilk yield 3aquantitative traits 3awool1 aMartínez-Núñez, Mario  Alberto1 aRamón-Ugalde, Julio  Porfirio1 aRomán-Ponce, Sergio  Iván1 aCalderón-Chagoya, Rene 1 aZamora-Bustillos, Roberto 0 tAnimals.g2020 Mar. 04, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100304343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245012300179300001800302520155800320592002801878596007601906650002301982650003002005650001802035650001202053650002102065650001502086650001802101650001202119650001202131650001102143650001402154650001302168650001202181650001702193650000902210650001402219651001002233700003702243700002702280700007602307700003202383700002502415700001902440700002402459773016302483856008302646852000902729655001202738IND60769621420221119111749.0220308e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076962142DNAL7 a10.1007/s42690-021-00663-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammad, Ahmed Mohammed Ali10aEfficacy of indigenous entomopathogenic fungi for the control of the tomato leafminer Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) in Sudan  ap. 1449-1459.  aThe current study evaluated the efficacy of indigenous isolates of entomopathogenic fungi against the third larval instar of tomato leaf miner (Tuta absoluta Meirick; Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). Four virulent isolates were subject to morphological and molecular identification and they were identified as; Beauveria bassiana isolate Hammad-R7 (Sudan) accession (MN598666); Beauveria bassiana isolate-Sud-afro-18ITS accession (MK046654); Beauveria bassiana isolate Sud-afro-2oITS accession (MK046652) and Purpureocillium lilacinum isolate Khartoum accession (MK046655). Efficacy test was done by larval dipping in the fungal suspension along with the commercial product Eco-Bb®. Mycosis test was performed to confirm the growth of fungus from the cadaver. Treated larvae died within three days after the appearance of the symptoms. The four indigenous isolates showed medium mortality responses (LT₅₀ ranged between 4.1–4.3 days) close to or slightly even better than that induced by the commercial product ECO-Bb (LT₅₀ 4.2 days) however three of them induced superior responses (LT₉₀ ranged between 9.5–11.7 days) to the commercial product ECO-Bb (LT₉₀ 14.4 days) at higher doses measured at the LT₉₀. Endophytic capability of the isolates was tested by seed dipping and soil drenching methods and the fungal mycelia was detected microscopically in the leaves and stems without apparent negative effects on plant growth. The current results indicate the promising potential of these isolates in the regulation of T. absoluta.  aPublisher supplied data  a500000 SDGcministry of higher education and scientific research, sudan 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aPurpureocillium lilacinum 3aTuta absoluta 3acadaver 3aefficacy testing 3aendophytes 3afungal growth 3ainsects 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amortality 3amycelium 3amycoses 3aplant growth 3asoil 3avirulence 3aSudan1 aBashir, Hamas Altibe Abd Alwahed1 aAbdelbagi, Azhari Omer1 aIshag, Abd Elaziz Sulieman Ahmed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2605-72191 aAli, Mutasim Mohamed Yassin1 aBashir, Magzoub Omer1 aHur, Jang-Hyun1 aLaing, Mark Delmege0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2022 Apr., v. 42, no. 2 p.1449-1459dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42690-021-00663-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002800141245011400169500001400283520144700297592002801744650003301772650002101805650002601826650000901852650002201861650001401883700002301897700001901920773012001939856007602059852000902135655001202144IND60702172920221118155312.0200717e20200305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070217292DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100304352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPowell, Christopher  D.10aNew Insights into Modelling Bacterial Growth with Reference to the Fish Pathogen Flavobacterium psychrophilum  aNAL-light  aTwo new models, based upon the principles promulgated by Baranyi and co-workers are presented and resulting growth functions evaluated based upon their ability to mimic bacterial growth of the fish pathogen Flavobacterium psychrophilum. These growth functions make use of a dampening function to suppress potential growth, represented by a logistic, and are derived from rate:state differential equations. Dampening effects are represented by a rectangular hyperbola or a simple exponential, incorporated into a logistic differential equation and solved analytically resulting in two newly derived growth equations, viz. logistic × hyperbola (log × hyp) and logistic × exponential (log × exp). These characteristics result in flexible and robust growth functions that can be expressed as equations with biologically meaningful parameters. The newly derived functions (log × hyp and log × exp), along with the Baranyi (BAR), simple logistic (LOG) and its modified form (MLOG) were evaluated based upon examination of residuals and measures of goodness-of-fit and cross-validation. Using these criteria, log × hyp, log × exp and BAR performed better than, or at least equally well as, LOG and MLOG. In contrast with log × exp and BAR, log × hyp can be easily manipulated mathematically allowing for simple algebraic expressions for time and microbial biomass at inflexion point, in addition to maximum and scaled maximum growth rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFlavobacterium psychrophilum 3abacterial growth 3adifferential equation 3afish 3amicrobial biomass 3apathogens1 aLópez, Secundino 1 aFrance, James 0 tAnimals.g2020 Mar. 05, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100304353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04158naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245017800157500001400335520285500349592002803204650001703232650002203249650002203271650002103293650001203314650001103326650001103337650001103348650001303359650001503372650000903387650001203396650000903408651001903417700002103436700001903457700002403476700002203500773012003522856007303642852000903715655001203724IND60724455920221120185546.0210122e20201224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072445592DNAL7 a10.3390/f120100132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJůza, Radek 10aPossibilities for Harmonisation between Recreation Services and Their Production within the Forest Sector—A Case Study of Municipal Forest Enterprise Hradec Králové (CZ)  aNAL-light  aThis paper deals with the possibility of harmonising the needs of society and the possibilities of the forest property manager. The Municipal forest enterprise of the city of Hradec Králové (MLHK) in the Czech Republic (CZ) is an example of this principle, which proves that the intensive development of a recreational service is possible without limiting this principle. The forest enterprise manages 3707 ha of forest in the immediate vicinity of the city with 92,000 inhabitants. The forest enterprise pays the city rent and makes a profit. The data were obtained by analysing the economic data of the surveyed company, the annual observation of the forest attendance, the surveys of the characteristics of the forest visitors and the surveys of selected 16 companies (from seven countries) managing the forests of some European cities. The main results concerning MLHK are as follows: the share of recreational service costs in the total costs of the forestry activities is 19.7%. The recreational services of the forest are financed from 71.5% from revenues from the sale of raw wood, 17.5% from revenues from the sale of sand from its own quarry, 3.9% from revenues from the recreational services and 7.1% from subsidies. The operation of the gravel quarry contributes to the economic result of the forest enterprise roughly by an amount corresponding to the costs of the recreational services. An average annual forest attendance is 243 people/ha. The inhabitants of the city account for 61.5% of the visitors, 20.4% of the visitors live within a distance of up to 30 km, and 18.1% of the visitors live at a distance of more than 30 km. The main results of the survey among the forest enterprises managing the forests of the selected European cities are as follows: the share of costs for the recreational services in the total costs of the forestry activities is 21–72% for cities with a population of over 100,000, and 3–14% for cities with less than 100,000 inhabitants. As a source of financing recreational services, the forest enterprises from mentioned cities with over 100,000 inhabitants, the money especially came from the city budget (70–100%). Forest enterprises from cities under 100,000 inhabitants stated that they fund a recreational service with 95–100% of the revenues from the sale of raw wood. Data on the MLHK show that it is possible to finance a recreational forest service from its own resources if this is the owner’s priority. However, this only applies under certain conditions, such as that, in addition to the income from forest management, there are other sources of income (in this case, sand mining or subsidies from public programmes).

METHODS: Bulk soil samples from an arenized site and rhizospheric soil and roots of L. albescens grown in this arenized site as well as samples from soils of the same region outside of the arenized area and rhizospheric soil and roots of L. albescens grown in non-arenized sites were evaluated. Phosphate solubilization, indolic compound and siderophore production abilities of the isolates were screened and compared. Some isolates were selected for in vivo plant growth promotion in greenhouse experiment. RESULTS: The samples from the arenized area presented less microbial biomass and less diverse bacterial communities compared with those from non-arenized areas. The PGP characteristics produced by the bacterial isolates showed differences among arenized and non arenized areas. A growth chamber experiment with L. albescens showed that phosphate-insoluble conditions coupled with bacterial inoculation resulted in the best PGP effect. CONCLUSIONS: Culture-dependent and culture-independent methods showed converging results regarding diversity indices and the rhizospheric environments increased bacterial diversity and biomass when compared to bulk soils. The PGP traits analyzed in this work were affected by environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLupinus 3abacterial communities 3aenvironmental factors 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agrowth promotion 3ain vivo studies 3aindoles 3amicrobial biomass 3aphosphates 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asampling 3asiderophores 3asoil 3asoil management 3asoil sampling 3asolubilization 3aspecies diversity 3aweathering 3aBrazil1 ada Costa, Pedro Beschoren1 aLisboa, Bruno Brito1 aVargas, Luciano Kayser1 aPassaglia, Luciane M.

In this paper we demonstrate how spatial modelling co-produced with managers can support the assessment of interactions between two cultural services: outdoor recreation and iconic terrestrial vertebrates. In two French national parks (Ecrins and Vanoise) we showed clear seasonal differentiation in spatial patterns for potential iconic vertebrate diversity, recreation opportunities and their interactions. Our first hypothesis that limited access and mobility of recreationists during winter would increase potential wildlife refugia was largely validated for Ecrins. Our second hypothesis that lower but spatially diffuse pressure from recreationists in Ecrins would increase potential interference as compared to more intense but directed activity in Vanoise was consistent with patterns in summer. For winter the spatial concentration of recreation around ski resorts of Vanoise was highly impactful. Across both parks concerns about the expansion of winter activities are legitimate, especially for climate-sensitive species. We also showed the critical role of refuge areas in high valleys (summer) and lower slopes away from tracks (winter), highlighting threats from off-track practices. Beyond regulation our results will support dialogue with the public and professionals based on communication and education.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aconservation areas 3aecosystem services 3aeducation 3amanagers 3amodels 3anational parks 3aoutdoor recreation 3aprofessionals 3arefuge habitats 3aresorts 3asummer 3atourism 3avalleys 3avertebrates 3awildlife 3awinter 3aAlps region 3aFrance 0aCultural ecosystem services 0aIconic biodiversity 0aPhysical and psychological experiences 0aSupporting identities 0aNature protection 0aSeasonality 0aEcosystem service maps1 aRey, Pierre-Louis1 aGrigulis, Karl1 aZawada, Mégane1 aByczek, Coline0 tEcosystem services.g2020 Oct., v. 45 p.101155-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2020.1011553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001200162245009700174300001600271520101000287592002801297650005701325650002901382650004201411650004201453650003301495650002501528650001601553650001001569650002401579650002101603650002201624650002201646650002401668650001201692650002801704650001701732650001801749650002301767650002301790650005201813650005001865650002801915650002001943650003801963650002402001650003102025650002302056650003402079650002702113650002402140650004102164700002102205700001502226700001602241773009602257856004402353852000902397655001202406IND50089225820221116175429.0140520e199904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008922582DNAL7 a103651642pmid7 a10.1007/s0070500505392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBah, A.10aChoristoneura fumiferana granulovirus: sequence analysis and 5′ characterization of ORF891  ap. 737-746.  aA gene located immediately upstream of the granulin gene of Choristoneura fumiferana (ChfuGV) granulovirus was identified, sequenced and named ORF891. The determined, putative open reading frame (ORF) of 891 bp encodes an estimated 34.6 kDa protein. The 5′ end transcript of the gene was mapped and analysed. A putative promoter region organization of ChfuGV ORF891 contains a consensus late baculovirus promoter element, TAAG, and two putative early TATA boxes similar to the promoters of ORF909 of Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus (ClGV). Sequence comparisons of ChfuGV ORF891 with ClGV ORF909 and Cydia pomonella granulovirus (CpGV) ORF124R showed respective homologies of 60.9 and 63.9% for nucleotides and 46.3 and 49.3% for amino acids. Homology of ChfuGV ORF891 with ME53 ORF of Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) was 68.2% for nucleotides but a total lack of homology for amino acid sequences.

The IMP content was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Transcriptome sequencing was used to screen the differentially expressed gene AK1 and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the expression level of AK1 mRNA associated with IMP synthesis. IMP and inosine content in the breast muscles of both Jingyuan cocks and hens was found to be significantly higher than that in the leg muscles. Similarly, the expression of AK1 mRNA in the breast muscles of cocks and hens was significantly higher than that in the leg muscles. Moreover, AK1 mRNA expression in cock breast muscles was negatively correlated with IMP content, whereas its expression in cock leg muscles was positively correlated with IMP content. In contrast, the expression of AK1 mRNA in hen breast and leg muscles was significantly positively correlated with IMP content. These findings provide a scientific basis for enhancing the meat flavor of Jingyuan chicken and promoting the development and utilization of local variety resources, as well as constituting a basis for screening IMP-regulated genes. Our study will advance our current understanding of AK1 function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenylate kinase 3abreasts 3aflavor 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahens 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainosine 3ainosine monophosphate 3ameat 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atranscriptome1 aHu, Honghong 1 aMu, Tong 1 aWang, Weizhen 1 aYu, Baojun 1 aGuo, Ju 1 aWang, Ying 1 aZhou, Zihang 1 aGu, Yaling 1 aHuang, Zengwen 1 aCai, Zhengyun 1 aXin, Guosheng 0 tAnimals.g2020 Mar. 06, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100304393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245011200164500001400276520238800290592002802678650002102706650001102727650001502738650001202753650002602765650001302791650001202804650002302816650002002839650002302859651001102882700002802893773012002921856007303041852000903114655001203123IND60724456420221120195532.0210122e20201222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072445642DNAL7 a10.3390/f120100022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorakaki, Evangelia 10aSap Flow in Aleppo Pine in Greece in Relation to Sapwood Radial Gradient, Temporal and Climatic Variability  aNAL-light  aResearch Highlights: The radial gradient of sap flux density (Js) and the effects of climatic factors on sap flow of Aleppo pine were assessed at different time scales in an eastern Mediterranean ecosystem to improve our understanding of the species water balance. Background and Objectives: Aleppo pine’s sap flow radial profile and responses to environmental parameters in the eastern Mediterranean were, to our best knowledge, originating to date from more arid planted forests. Information from natural forests in this region was lacking. Our objectives were to (a) determine the species’ radial variability in Js on a diurnal and seasonal basis and under different climatic conditions, (b) scale up to tree sap flow taking into account the radial profile of Js and (c) determine the responses of Aleppo pine’s sap flow over the year to climatic variability. Materials and Methods: Js was monitored in Aleppo pine in a natural forest in northern Greece with Granier’s method using sensors at three sapwood depths (21, 51, and 81 mm) during two periods differing in climatic conditions, particularly in soil water availability. Results: Js was the highest at 21 mm sapwood depth, and it declined with increasing depth. A steeper gradient of Js in deep sapwood was observed under drier conditions. The same patterns of radial variability in Js were maintained throughout the year, but the contribution of inner sapwood to sap flow was the highest in autumn when the lower seasonal Js was recorded in both study periods. Not taking into account the radial gradient of Js in the studied Aleppo pine would result in a c. 20.2–27.7 % overestimation of total sap flow on a sapwood basis (Qs), irrespective of climatic conditions. On a diurnal and seasonal basis, VPD was the strongest determinant of sap flux density, while at a larger temporal scale, the effect of soil water content was evident. At SWC > 20% sap flow responded positively to increasing solar radiation and VPD, indicating the decisive role of water availability in the studied region. Moreover, in drier days with VPD > 0.7 KPa, SWC controlled the variation of sap flow. Conclusions: There is a considerable radial variability in Js of the studied Aleppo pine and a considerable fluctuation of sap flow with environmental dynamics that should be taken into account when addressing the species water balance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus halepensis 3aautumn 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aplant available water 3asap flow 3asapwood 3asoil water content 3asolar radiation 3atemporal variation 3aGreece1 aFotelli, Mariangela  N.0 tForests.g2020 Dec. 22, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120100023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012700167300001600294520091900310592002801229650002601257650001601283650002001299650001001319650002101329650002801350650001601378650001901394650003301413650001101446650001001457700002101467700002001488700001801508773014201526856008201668852000901750655001201759IND60123769020221117222712.0190521e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012376902DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-014-1323-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarang, Jagriti10aVoltammetric detection of anti-HIV replication drug based on novel nanocomposite gold-nanoparticle–CaCO3 hybrid material  ap. 815-822.  aA novel bionanocomposite, horse radish peroxidase- gold-nanoparticle–Calcium carbonate (HRP-AuNPs-CaCO₃), hybrid material was encapsulated by silica sol on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE).

The purpose of this study was to analyze the CNV and its genetic effects of the Opn4 gene in 284 Guizhou goats (Guizhou black goat: n = 186, Guizhou white goat: n = 98). We used qPCR to detect the CNV of the Opn4 gene in Guizhou goats, and the classification results were correlated with the corresponding individual growth traits by SPSS software. The results showed that the Opn4 gene had a superior effect on growth traits with multiple copy variants in Guizhou black goats, and there was a significant correlation between copy number variation sites and body length traits. Contrary to the former conclusion, in Guizhou white goats, individuals with the Normal copy number type showed superior growth traits and copy number variant sites were significantly associated with body weight traits. Therefore, the CNV of the Opn4 gene can be used as a candidate molecular genetic marker to improve goat growth traits, speeding up the breeding process of goat elite varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody length 3abody weight 3acomputer software 3acopy number variation 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agoats 3aChina1 aYang, Peng 1 aShi, ShuYue 1 aZhang, Zijing,1 aShi, QiaoTing 1 aXu, Jiawei,1 aHe, Hua 1 aLei, ChuZhao 1 aWang, ErYao 1 aChen, Hong 1 aHuang, Yongzhen,0 tAnimals.g2020 Mar. 06, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100304413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245013600173300001400309520106400323592002801387650003101415650002301446650002101469650002501490650002401515650001001539650002301549650001001572650001801582650001201600650001901612650002101631650001801652650002301670650001001693650001601703700003401719773011801753856008201871852000901953655001201962IND60589808320221120074113.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058980832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-018-0653-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaparra, JoséMoisés10aInclusion of Whole Flour from Latin-American Crops into Bread Formulations as Substitute of Wheat Delays Glucose Release and Uptake  ap. 13-17.  aBakery formulations limiting glucose availability for uptake without compromising product quality are required. Herein, bread formulations containing whole flour from Amaranthus hypochondriacus (AB), Chenopodium quinoa (QB), Salvia hispanica L (ChB) or wheat (WWB) were compared to white bread (WB) for glycaemic index (GI) in fasted animals. The hepatic expression (mRNA) of PPAR-γ receptor as key regulator in substrate fractionation towards energy expenditure was monitored. GIs were associated to fluxes of glucose release (FGₗᵤc) and metabolic response (MTT assay) of HepG2 cells. ChB (19.7%) and AB (13.5%) decreased GI to a higher extent than QB (2.7%), but all increased expression of PPARγ in relation to WB. FGₗᵤc (AB> > ChB, WWB, WB > QB) showed a reciprocal relationship with the area under curve (AUC) in vivo, and decreased MTT conversion values (WB > WWB, ChB, AB, QB) by HepG2 cells. Thus, inclusion of latin-american crops (LAcs) reducing GI, without compromising bread quality, could help preventing metabolic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus hypochondriacus 3aChenopodium quinoa 3aSalvia hispanica 3abiochemical pathways 3abreadmaking quality 3acrops 3aenergy expenditure 3aflour 3afractionation 3aglucose 3aglycemic index 3ahuman cell lines 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolic diseases 3awheat 3awhite bread1 aHaros, Claudia Monika,d1966-0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2018 Mar., v. 73, no. 1 p.13-17dSpringer USwJournal:jnl42388x0921-96687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-018-0653-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007100170520142100241592002801662650001701690650002301707650001201730650002201742650001601764650001201780653002901792653002701821653001001848653001001858653003101868700002001899700002201919700002001941700002101961700002201982700001702004700002202021700002102043700001602064700002402080700002402104700002202128773011402150856008502264852000902349655001202358IND60707643220221119101355.0201111e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070764322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2020.1011602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinisdore, John14aThe 18 benefits of using ecosystem services classification systems  aEcosystem services (ES) practitioners (e.g., researchers, policy makers) have been working to better define, measure, and value the ways that nature contributes to society. Because measurement techniques follow the labeling or identification of ES, precise identification is critical. This article reviews literature and consults experts in classification science and ES to determine the expected benefits of using ES classification knowledge (classification knowledge); ecosystem services classification systems (ES-CS) and their principles. An informal analysis of the costs of transitioning from the current ad-hoc approach—based on various ES lists—to using classification knowledge was conducted. 18 benefits of using classification knowledge were found, including allowing ES to be defined more easily and precisely, easing the transfer of knowledge among studies, and avoiding the need to recreate ES identification systems. Collectively, these 18 benefits should allow for more accurate and consistent definition of ES, thereby serving to improve communication and measurement of ES. Moreover, the expected benefits of using ES-CS outweigh expected costs of the transition. Practitioners can use ES-CS in whole, or in parts, as their research or their institutions warrant. Finally, a case study was conducted that shows how ES measures can be organized using ES-CS, delivering benefits to practitioners.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aecosystem services 3aexperts 3aissues and policy 3aresearchers 3asociety 0aFinal ecosystem services 0aClassification systems 0aNESCS 0aCICES 0aEcosystem services metrics1 aRhodes, Charles1 aHaines-Young, Roy1 aMaynard, Simone1 aWielgus, Jeffrey1 aDvarskas, Anthony1 aHoudet, Joel1 aQuétier, Fabien,1 aLamothe, Karl A.1 aDing, Helen1 aSoulard, François,1 aVan Houtven, George1 aRowcroft, Petrina0 tEcosystem services.g2020 Oct., v. 45 p.101160-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2020.1011603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245010200212300001600314500001900330520116700349592002801516596008301544596008301627650001601710650001401726650001901740650001601759650001401775650001101789650001401800650001001814700003001824700003401854700002701888773010401915856008202019852000902101655001202110IND60693546620221119092410.0200507e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069354662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-019-01472-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Luna, Bruna Nunes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3767-092710aAre the glandular trichomes in Jacquinia armillaris (Theophrastoideae—Primulaceae) salt glands?  ap. 863-870.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSalt stress is harmful to plants, especially for those that live under conditions of intense salt aport. For this reason, several species present alternatives to prevent or diminish the damages that high salt concentrations may cause to the cells. Salt glands are one of these alternatives once they are specialized structures that secrete salt. Here, we aimed to investigate if the glandular trichomes in the leaves of Jacquinia armillaris are salt glands. Anatomical and ultrastructural observations showed that the glandular trichomes in J. armillaris resemble the salt glands from other recretohalophytes Primulaceae, such as, their occurrence in sunken regions in the leaf epidermis, the presence of a large basal cell that acts as a collecting cell, the detachment of the cuticle from the outer periclinal walls forming a cuticular chamber, the thickness of the cuticle in the stalk portion of the trichome, and the presence of sodium and chloride ions in the secretion and in the xylem. Altogether, the gathered results support the hypothesis that the glandular trichomes in J. armillaris are adapted to salt secretion, thus characterizing as salt glands.  aPublisher supplied data  a153892/2018-8cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a310419/2018-2cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aPrimulaceae 3achlorides 3aleaf epidermis 3asalt stress 3asecretion 3asodium 3atrichomes 3axylem1 aFreitas, Maria de Fátima1 ada Silva, Karla Marins Mattos1 aBarros, Claudia Franca0 tProtoplasma.g2020 May, v. 257, no. 3 p.863-870dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl44608x0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-019-01472-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010600159520143500265592002801700650001101728650002001739650002201759650001901781650002001800650001601820650001901836700002201855700001901877700002201896700001801918700002001936700001901956700002101975700002201996773012602018856007302144852000902217655001202226IND60651971320221119032712.0190712e20170616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065197132DNAL7 a10.3390/su90610322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharifi, Ayyoob10aConceptualizing Dimensions and Characteristics of Urban Resilience: Insights from a Co-Design Process  aResilience is a multi-faceted concept frequently used across a wide range of disciplines, practices, and sectors. There is a growing recognition of the utility of resilience as a bridging concept that can facilitate inter-and transdisciplinary approaches to tackle complexities inherent in decision making under conditions of risk and uncertainty. Such conditions are common in urban planning, infrastructure planning, asset management, emergency planning, crisis management, and development processes where systemic interdependencies and interests at stake influence decisions and outcomes. A major challenge that can undermine the use of resilience for guiding planning activities is the value-laden and contested nature of the concept that can be interpreted in a variety of ways. Because resilience is context-specific and generally depends on local aspirations, this issue can be partially tackled by adopting participatory approaches for the conceptualization of resilience. This paper provides an example of how co-design methods can be employed for conceptualizing resilience. The Structured Interview Matrix was used as a technique to facilitate discussions among a diverse group of researchers and practitioners attending the International Workshop on Tools and Indicators for Assessing Urban Resilience.

The effect of calcination temperature is evaluated. With increasing calcination temperature, Mn valence-state of the powder decreased while size of powder increased. The cycle life of the powder decreases with increasing calcination temperature. The results indicated that the Mn valence-state and powder size of cathode powder should be important variables to improve cycle life.

Herein, for the first time, we studied the combination of curcumin and 3',4'‐didemethylnobiletin (DDMN), a primary metabolite of nobiletin, to determine their combinatory effects in inhibiting growth of human colon cancer cells. Isobologram analysis revealed a synergistic interaction between curcumin and DDMN in the inhibition of cell growth of HCT116 colon cancer cells. The combination treatment induced significant G₂–M cell‐cycle arrest and extensive apoptosis, which greatly exceeded the effects of individual treatments with curcumin or DDMN. Proteins associated with these heightened anticarcinogenic effects were p53, p21, HO‐1, c‐poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase, Cdc2, and Cdc25c; each of the proteins was confirmed to be substantially impacted by the combination treatment, more than by individual treatments alone. Interestingly, an increase in the stability of curcumin was also observed with the presence of DDMN in cell culture medium, which could offer an explanation in part for the synergistic interaction between curcumin and DDMN. This newly identified synergy between curcumin and DDMN should be explored further to determine its chemopreventive potential against colon cancer in vivo. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study identifies for the first time the synergistic inhibition of colon cancer cell growth by the dietary component curcumin present in turmeric, in combination with a metabolite of nobiletin, a unique citrus flavonoid. The synergism of the combination may be due to cell‐cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by the combination as well as an improvement in the stability of curcumin as a result of the antioxidant property of the nobiletin metabolite. These significant findings of synergism between curcumin and the nobiletin metabolite could offer potential chemopreventive value against colon cancer.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNIHdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  aR01AT010229cNational Institutes of Health  a2019‐67017‐29249cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCitrus 3aNAD ADP-ribosyltransferase 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3abioactive compounds 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell growth 3achemoprevention 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aculture media 3acurcumin 3aflavonoids 3afood composition 3ahuman diseases 3ametabolites 3aneoplasm cells 3aproteins 3asynergism 3atoxicity 3aturmeric1 aRakariyatham, Kanyasiri1 aLi, Zhengze1 aDu, Zheyuan1 aZheng, Jinkai1 aWu, Xian1 aXiao, Hang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6194-27960 tJournal of food science.g2020 Apr., v. 85, no. 4 p.1292-1301dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.150733Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245016400158500001400322520206400336592002802400650002202428650002902450650001202479650002702491650001102518650001502529650001902544650002402563650001102587650002902598650001502627700001702642700002002659700001902679700001702698700001902715773012002734856007302854852000902927655001202936IND60724456720221120195602.0210122e20201227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072445672DNAL7 a10.3390/f120100222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Liangsuo 10aVegetation Properties in Human-Impacted Riparian Zones Based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Imagery: An Analysis of River Reaches in the Yongding River Basin  aNAL-light  aRiparian zones, transitional areas between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, have high plant species diversities. However, they are extremely vulnerable to natural factors, such as changes in river hydrological conditions (floods, droughts) and disturbances from human activities (dams, farmland encroachment, etc.). The distribution of plant life forms and variations in the degree of vegetation coverage in a riparian zone can reflect changes in the environmental conditions. In this study, we analyzed eight reaches from the four main tributaries (Dongyang River, Yang River, Sanggan River, and Yongding River) of the Yongding River Basin, which were selected based on their climate, terrain, and degree of human disturbance. One reach was located on the Dongyang River (DYR), two reaches on the Yang River (YR1 and YR2), three on the Sanggan River (SGR1, 2, and 3), and two on the Yongding River (YDR1 and YDR2). Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology was used to obtain high-resolution, true-color, multispectral images. The distributions of the plant life forms and the differences in the vegetation coverage were analyzed in the eight selected riparian zones. The results showed that grasses dominated the riparian zone and shrubs and trees were sparsely distributed along both banks of all streams, excluding SGR2 and YDR1. The areas with an extremely high vegetation coverage classification accounted for the highest proportion in the DYR (29.3%), YR2 (48.1%), SGR1 (32.9%), SGR2 (39.9%), SGR3 (85.1%), YDR1 (36.7%), and YDR2 (51.1%) reaches. Extremely low vegetation coverage accounted for the highest proportion in the YR2 reach, reaching 37.4%. This study indicated that natural factors and human activities have a serious impact on the distribution of different plants life forms and vegetation coverage classifications in the riparian zones of the Yongding River Basin. We hope that this research can provide practical assistance in the efforts of ecological restoration and the management of riparian vegetation in the Yongding River Basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate 3aecological restoration 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3ariparian areas 3ariparian vegetation 3arivers 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3awatersheds1 aLiu, Yadong 1 aZhang, Shurong 1 aCheng, Lirong 1 aGuo, Yujing 1 aDing, Aizhong 0 tForests.g2020 Dec. 27, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120100223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004800094024004500142024005200187040001800239100001800257245012400275300001400399506002800413506003600441506007600477506003100553520162900584592002802213596004502241506003702286650001702323650001502340650001302355650001102368650001302379650002002392650001402412650001302426650001502439650001902454650001102473650001302484650001002497653002102507653003802528653002502566653003102591653003402622700001802656773011202674856009202786903002402878852000902902655001202911IND60531250820221207094424.0190412e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053125082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.06.0102chorus7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.06.0102doi7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.06.0102chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmatya, Suraj10aIntegration of visible branch sections and cherry clusters for detecting cherry tree branches in dense foliage canopies  ap. 72-81.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aTo minimise the demand for seasonal workers in sweet cherry production, there is a need to develop automated harvesting systems. The first step in automating a shake-and-catch type harvesting system is to develop a machine vision system for detecting tree branches and localising shaking points in those branches. In this study, an image processing algorithm was developed to detect branches of cherry trees using segmentation of branch and cherry pixels. Firstly, partially visible branch segments within the tree canopies were connected using morphological features of the segments to form whole branches. Then, the positions of cherry clusters in the canopy were used as an indication to detect branch sections that were occluded by cherries and leaves. Different cherry clusters were grouped together based on their spatial location and distance between them. Branch equations were then defined through those cherry clusters using minimum residual criteria. Overall, 93.8% branches were detected in a Y-trellis fruiting wall cherry orchard, with 55.0% of branches detected using only branch pixels and 38.8% additional branches detected using cherry clusters. The method resulted in a total of 12.4% of false positive detection. The results showed that branch detection accuracy can be substantially improved by integrating cherry location information with the location of segments of partially visible branches. This study has shown the potential of machine vision systems to detect cherry tree branches in full foliage season, which is highly promising for the development of automated sweet cherry harvesting systems.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPrunus avium 3aalgorithms 3abranches 3acanopy 3acherries 3acomputer vision 3aequations 3afruiting 3aharvesting 3aimage analysis 3aleaves 3aorchards 3atrees 0aBranch detection 0aShake-and-catch cherry harvesting 0aAutomated harvesting 0aUpright fruiting offshoots 0aY-trellis canopy architecture1 aKarkee, Manoj0 tBiosystems engineering.g2016 Sept., v. 149 p.72-81dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012000172300001600292500001900308520148300327592002801810650001401838650001801852650001801870650001301888650002301901650000901924650002401933650003201957650002101989650001702010650002502027650002102052653002102073653004002094653003002134653001202164700002402176700002502200700002702225773013202252856008502384852000902469655001202478IND60693905720221120232605.0200509e20200504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069390572DNAL7 a10.1080/10826068.2019.17107122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasannaraja, C.12aA dipyrrole derivative from Aloe vera inhibits an anti-diabetic drug target Dipeptidyl Peptidase (DPP)-IV in vitro  ap. 511-520.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAloe vera, a succulent herb, has a long history of use in traditional medicine, including diabetes. Earlier studies from our laboratory demonstrated that the Aloe vera extract has the ability to inhibit the diabetic drug target dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) IV in vitro. This current study focuses on the isolation of small water soluble active molecule(s) involved in DPP-IV inhibition from Aloe vera extract, and further to characterize its structure and to elucidate the mode of inhibition of the DPP-IV enzyme. Aloe vera gel ethanolic extract was subjected to preparative reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), LH-20 Sephadex gel filtration chromatography, followed by analytical RP-HPLC, to isolate the active molecule involved in DPP-IV inhibition. Based on the spectroscopic studies, the structure of the isolated DPP-IV inhibitor was predicted to be 3, 6-dioxo-3, 3a, 6, 6 a-tetrahydropyrrolo [3, 4-c] pyrrole-1, 4-dicarboxamide with the chemical formula C8H6N4O4, having the molecular weight of 225.175 Da. This molecule inhibited the DPP-IV enzyme in a noncompetitive manner with an IC50 value of 8.59 ± 2.61 µM, with a Ki of 4.7 ± 0.038 µM. Thus, the mechanism of DPP-IV inhibition and the inhibitory constants were determined. The results of our studies suggested that the inhibition of the DPP-IV enzyme as one of the pathways by which the Aloe vera extract may restore the pancreatic islets cell mass in diabetic animal model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe vera 3aanimal models 3abiotechnology 3adiabetes 3agel chromatography 3agels 3ahypoglycemic agents 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amolecular weight 3aspectroscopy 3atraditional medicine 3awater solubility 0aDPP-IV inhibitor 0aLH-20 gel filtration chromatography 0anoncompetitive inhibition 0aRP-HPLC1 aKamalanathan, A.

This study investigated the benefits of reforestation upon nitrate–nitrogen (NO3−N) and orthophosphate (PO43−) load reductions in the Lower Yazoo River Watershed (LYRW) within the LMRB using the BASINS-HSPF model. The model was calibrated and validated with available experimental data prior to its applications. Two simulation scenarios were then performed: one was chosen to predict the NO3−N and PO43− loads without reforestation and the other was selected to estimate the impacts of reforestation upon NO3−N and PO43− load reductions following the conversion of 25, 50, 75, and 100% of the agricultural lands (with most lands near or in the batture of the streams) into forests. In general, an increase in forests reduced NO3−N and PO43− loads and occurred because forest soils enriched in organic matter absorb water and nutrients and reduce the surface water runoff. Overall, a two-fold increase in forest land would result in approximately two-fold decrease in annual average NO3−N and PO43− loads. On average, over a 10-year simulation, the specific NO3−N and PO43− load reductions were, respectively, 0.06 and 0.004ton/ha/y. Although the annual average NO3−N and PO43− loads always decreased with increasing forest land conversion, the optimal specific NO3−N and PO43− load reductions were found at a 75% reduction of agricultural land for the simulation conditions used in this study. Additionally, the annual average NO3−N load was about 16 times higher than that of PO43− in the LYRW. This study suggests that reforestation in or around the batture of streams is a beneficial practice for NO3−N and PO43− load reductions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3adeforestation 3aforest soils 3aforests 3aland use change 3amodels 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aorthophosphates 3aphosphorus 3areforestation 3arivers 3arunoff 3astreams 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aGulf of Mexico 3aMississippi 3aMississippi River 0aHSPF model 0aNitrate and orthophosphate load 0aReforestation 0aYazoo River Watershed1 aLeininger, Theodor D.1 aMoran, Matt0 tEcological engineering.g2015 Feb., v. 75 p.449-456dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2014.11.0323Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245015600164300002000320520118300340592002801523596008101551650001601632650001501648650001501663650001301678650002201691650001101713650001101724650001301735700001801748700002201766700006101788773013701849856008001986852000902066655001202075IND60793433720220916000000.0220916e20220902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079343372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.2c011512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLowe, Jared M.10aPrecyclization Conformer Profiles of −SiR₃⁺- and −Bcat⁺-Activated Linear Si-Protected Hexitols Explain Condensative Cyclization Selectivities  ap. 12065-12071.  aThe condensative cyclization of sp³ C–O bonds in per-silylated hexitols is investigated by computation. Conformer searches using the Monte Carlo algorithm, followed by successively higher levels of theory (MMFF, PM3, and B3LYP), of −SiR₃⁺- and −Bcat⁺-activated substrates lead to structures primed for intramolecular chemistry. Silane activation features O4 to C1 attack, while borane activation suggests boronium ions that activate O5 to C2 reactivity. This, in conjunction with Boltzmann population analysis, parallels reported reactivity for sorbitol, mannitol, and galactitol. Calculations using the meta-hybrid M06-2X functional additionally provide free-energy profiles for each cyclization event. In most of the cases presented, precyclization conformers that position a nucleophilic oxygen less than 3.0 Å from the C–O leaving group correlate to efficient experimental reactivities. Two examples of galactitol containing bridging silyl groups are analyzed computationally, and the experimental outcomes match predictions. The computational regime presented is a step closer to providing predictive power for the reduction of per-functionalized molecules.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE-FG02-05ER15630cBasic Energy Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006151 3aLewis bases 3aalgorithms 3agalactitol 3amannitol 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxygen 3asilane 3asorbitol1 aSeo, Youngran1 aClarke, Joshua J.1 aGagné, Michel R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8424-55470 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2022 Sept. 02, v. 87, no. 18 p.12065-12071dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.2c011513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009600168520128600264592002801550650001401578650002101592650001701613650001201630650002301642650002401665650001901689651001301708653003201721653001501753653001301768653002701781653001701808700001701825700001601842700001301858700001801871700001801889773009701907856008502004852000902089655001202098IND60773082720221119051243.0220426e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077308272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.1026992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Hongtai10aExploring built environment factors that influence the market share of ridesourcing service  aThe ridesourcing service has taken a large portion of the taxi market in the past few years. Many studies have explored the influencing factors of traditional taxi and ridesourcing demand in different areas of the city. Few studies investigated the market share of ridesourcing in different regions of the city. Understanding the spatial distribution of the market share of ridesourcing service and the factors that determine this distribution could help government agencies understand the role that each type of service plays in the transportation system and evaluate the effect of different public policies on the two types of services. This paper studies this topic by constructing a panel fractional regression model based on the taxi trip data of New York City in 2017. Results show that the market share of the traditional taxi is declining while that of ridesourcing service is increasing. The market share of ridesourcing services is higher in remote areas, areas with low population density, low density of transportation facilities, low household income, and high proportion of young residents. It indicates that ridesourcing service could provide more equitable service by better serving the underserved areas while traditional taxi caters more to the high-demand areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageography 3ahousehold income 3amarket share 3amarkets 3apopulation density 3aregression analysis 3atransportation 3aNew York 0aFractional regression model 0aPanel data 0aLand use 0aSocio-economic factors 0aMarket share1 aHuo, Jinghai1 aPan, Renbin1 aXie, Kun1 aZhang, Wenjia1 aLuo, Xinggang0 tApplied geography.g2022 May, v. 142 p.102699-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.1026993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245007900175300001800254520114200272592002801414650002001442650001501462650001501477650001601492650003201508650002401540650001001564650001701574650001201591650001801603651003101621653001701652653001801669653004001687653002001727653003101747653002001778700001801798700002001816700002301836700001901859773012201878856008502000852000902085655001202094IND60580605820221118022105.0170923e20171202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058060582DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2016.12764352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrasier, Kathryn J.10aBarriers to sharing water quality data: experiences from the Shale Network  ap. 2103-2121.  aThe Shale Network is a group of stakeholders collating, publishing, and conducting research on water quality data collected in the northeastern United States experiencing natural gas extraction from shale using hydraulic fracturing. In developing the Shale Network, we have experienced reluctance to share data from all participating sectors. This paper explores this reluctance, identifying barriers to greater collaboration among multiple stakeholders in natural resource management projects. Findings are derived from participant observation of the Shale Network team, surveys conducted during Shale Network workshops, interviews with water quality stakeholders, and participant observation of water quality monitoring training sessions. The barriers identified include perceptions about data problems and quality, technical capacity, regulatory and legal limitations, competition for resources, and resource allocation decisions. This paper identifies strategies the Shale Network has used to overcome data-sharing barriers to expand a culture of data sharing that supports enhanced nature resource management and citizen engagement.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ainterviews 3amonitoring 3anatural gas 3anatural resource management 3aresource allocation 3ashale 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3awater quality 3aNortheastern United States 0adata sharing 0awater quality 0acommunity-based resource management 0acitizen science 0atransdisciplinary research 0aMarcellus Shale1 aJalbert, Kirk1 aKinchy, Abby J.1 aBrantley, Susan L.1 aUnroe, Colleen0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2017 Dec. 2, v. 60, no. 12 p.2103-2121dRoutledgex1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2016.12764353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03905naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245011300207506011700320506007600437520211500513592002802628506003702656650002502693650001102718650000902729650001202738650001002750650002202760650001002782650000902792650001402801650001802815650001302833650001102846650001202857650001302869651003002882653002202912653001702934653001002951653001902961653002602980653002703006700002103033700002203054700002103076700002003097700002303117700002603140773011303166856005103279852000903330655001203339IND60791681320221207052708.0220830s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079168132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crmicr.2022.1001612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanuti, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9959-128X10aDistinct epidemiological profiles of porcine circovirus 3 and fox circovirus in Canadian foxes (Vulpes spp.)  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCircoviruses (genus Circovirus, family Circoviridae) are ssDNA viruses that infect mammals, and they sometimes can transmit among different species. We investigated the distribution and diversity of porcine circovirus 3 (PCV-3, species Porcine circovirus 3) and fox circovirus (species Canine circovirus 1) in different populations of foxes (Vulpes spp.) inhabiting the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador to compare their epidemiological profiles. Of the 210 samples tested in this study 9 were positive for PCV-3 and 99 were positive for fox circovirus. Eight foxes were PCV-3-positive (8/128, 6.3%) and the virus was only found in the most human-populated areas. The PCV-3 positivity rate was significantly higher in stool (7/180, 8.8%) than in spleen (2/120, 1.7%: p < 0.05). Phylogenetic analyses showed that sequences from different animals were unrelated to each other. Fox circovirus was identified in 66 animals (51.6%) and positivity rates were the highest in the least human-populated areas. There were no significant differences between positivity rates in stool (32/80, 40.0%), spleen (59/120, 49.2%), or lymph nodes (8/10, 80.0%). Among 54 positive animals for which both spleen and stool samples were available, 25 (46.3%) had detectable virus in both samples. All fox circovirus sequences recovered in this study formed a monophyletic clade, and no geographic segregation of study strains was observed. The high prevalence and high genetic diversity observed for fox circovirus implies that the virus has been circulating in this population for a long time. PCV-3 cases were consistent with sporadic infections from multiple sources, possibly related to scavenging behavior and consumption of meat by-products and human waste, while fox circovirus was endemic, indicating that foxes are likely the maintenance host for this virus. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating the presence of fox circovirus in North America and to show that PCV-3 can be detected in foxes. Future studies should evaluate the pathogenic potential of these viruses for wildlife.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorcine circovirus-3 3aVulpes 3adogs 3aexcreta 3afoxes 3agenetic variation 3alymph 3ameat 3amonophyly 3apathogenicity 3aresearch 3aspleen 3aviruses 3awildlife 3aNewfoundland and Labrador 0aCanine circovirus 0aCircoviruses 0aPCV-3 0aCanine viruses 0aFood-borne infections 0aMolecular epidemiology1 aRodrigues, Bruce1 aBouchard, Émilie1 aWhitney, Hugh G.1 aLang, Andrew S.1 aDufour, Suzanne C.1 aVerhoeven, Joost T.P.0 tCurrent research in microbial sciences.g2022, v. 3 p.100161-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27595x2666-51747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crmicr.2022.100161  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015700169520147900326592002801805650001201833650001201845650001801857650001201875650001801887650002201905650001401927650000701941650001901948650001901967650001401986653002902000653001202029653001202041653003102053653001202084700001702096700001602113700001602129700001602145700001802161700001802179700001402197700002802211700005602239773012902295856008602424852000902510655001202519IND60670319420221119235455.0200809e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067031942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1212582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Ningyuan10aBismuth impregnated biochar for efficient estrone degradation: The synergistic effect between biochar and Bi/Bi2O3 for a high photocatalytic performance  aAn innovative advanced oxidation process was successfully developed to photocatalytic-degradation of estrone through the synergistic effect of biochar and Bi/Bi₂O₃ in bismuth-containing photocatalytic biochar (BiPB). The highest reaction rate constant (kₒbₛ) of estrone degradation by BiPB was 0.045 min⁻¹ under the conditions of initial concentration of estrone =10.4 μmol L⁻¹, [BiPB] =1 g L⁻¹, pH = 7.0. The kₒbₛ was almost tenfold and more than 20 times than that of biochar without bismuth impregnation and pristine Bi/Bi₂O₃, respectively. The best photocatalytic performance of BiPB composites for the degradation of estrone was primarily attributed to generation of OH radicals. Impregnation of bismuth helped control the concentration of persistent free radicals (PFRs) and develop a hierarchical porous structure of biochar. The presence of biochar facilitated pre-concentration estrone on BiPB and improved the separation and transfer efficiency of charge carriers. The synergistic effect between biochar and Bi/Bi₂O₃ contributed to the generation of OH radicals for estrone degradation under neutral pH conditions. The transformation pathway of estrone was also proposed based on the measured transformation products in the presence of BiPB. The high efficiency of BiPB composites indicated that this easily-obtained material was promising for estrone-wastewater treatment applications as a low-cost composite photocatalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3abismuth 3abismuth oxide 3aestrone 3afree radicals 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asynergism 0aPersistent free radicals 0aBismuth 0aBiochar 0aPhotocatalytic degradation 0aEstrone1 aLi, Chunquan1 aBu, Lingjun1 aTang, Cilai1 aWang, Sichu1 aDuan, Pengfei1 aYao, Lunguang1 aTang, Jun1 aDionysiou, Dionysios D.1 aWu, Yonghong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3767-35780 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 384 p.121258-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1212583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03467naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245011300163300001800276500001900294500002000313520158900333592002801922596007701950596007702027596007702104596008502181650002602266650001502292650002702307650001202334650002002346650001702366650001702383650001802400650001902418650003502437650001702472650001502489650002102504650001302525700002002538700002602558700002402584700002702608700002202635700006302657773013602720856007202856852000902928655001202937IND60704669820221118050403.0200725e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070466982DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.47402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVentura, Fernanda F.10aEvaluation of Phenolic Compound Toxicity Using a Bioluminescent Assay with the Fungus Gerronema viridilucens  ap. 1558-1565.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBasidiomycetes (phylum Basidiomycota) are filamentous fungi characterized by the exogenous formation of spores on a club‐shaped cell called a basidium that are often formed on complex fruiting bodies (mushrooms). Many basidiomycetes serve an important role in recycling lignocellulosic material to higher trophic levels, and some show symbiotic relationships with plants. All known bioluminescent fungi are mushroom‐forming basidiomycetes in the order Agaricales. Hence, the disruption of the basidiomycete community can entirely compromise the carbon cycle in nature from fungi to higher trophic levels. The fungus Gerronema viridilucens was used in the present study to investigate the toxicity of a phenolic compound series based on the inhibition of its bioluminescence. The median effect concentration (EC50) obtained from curves of bioluminescence inhibition versus log [phenolic compound] showed that 2,4,6‐trichlorophenol was the most toxic compound in the series. The log EC50 values of all phenolic compounds were then used for the prediction of their toxicity. The univariate correlation of log EC50 values obtained from 6 different phenolic compounds was stronger with the dissociation constant (pKₐ) than with 1‐octanol/water partition coefficient (KOW). Nevertheless, the toxicity can be better predicted by using both parameters, suggesting that the phenol‐driven uncoupling of fungus mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthesis is the origin of phenolic compound toxicity to the test fungus.

One means entails the use of Landsat 8 images, for which mono window (MW), single channel (SC) and split window (SW) algorithms are needed. Knowing the precision and seasonal variability of the LST can improve urban climate alteration studies, which ultimately help make sustainable decisions in terms of the greater resilience of cities. In this study we determine the LST of a mid-sized city, Granada (Spain), applying six Landsat 8 algorithms that are validated using ambient temperatures. In addition to having a unique geographical location, this city has high pollution and high daily temperature variations, so that it is a very appropriate site for study. Altogether, 11 images with very low cloudiness were taken into account, distributed between November 2019 and October 2020. After data validation by means of R² statistical analysis, the root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE) and standard deviation (SD) were determined to obtain the coefficients of correlation. Panel data analysis is presented as a novel element with respect to the methods usually used. Results reveal that the SC algorithms prove more effective and reliable in determining the LST of the city studied here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aclimate change 3apollution 3aseasonal variation 3astandard deviation 3asurface temperature 3aSpain1 aArco Díaz, Julián 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Mar. 07, v. 13, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130510123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01552naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010500163300001600268500001900284520036700303592002800670650001400698650000900712650002300721650002500744650001300769650001800782650000900800653001300809653001900822653000800841700001600849700001800865700001800883773018200901856007401083852000901157655001201166IND60691990120221120114351.0200502e20030101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069199012DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.67.1662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYAMANISHI, Rintaro10aAdjuvant Activity of Alum in Inducing Antigen Specific IgE Antibodies in BALB/c Mice: a Reevaluation  ap. 166-169.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe IgE production was compared in the presence and absence of aluminum hydroxide gel (alum).

It only requires the collection of sufficient information, establishment of databases and input of human and capital resources for analysis. However, many countries are unable to effectively ensure the sustainable development of marine fisheries due to technological limitations. The main challenge is the gap in the conditions for sustainable development between developed and developing countries. Therefore, this study applied the Web of Science database and geographic information systems to analyze the gaps in fisheries science in various countries over the past 10 years. Most studies have been conducted in the offshore marine areas of the northeastern United States of America. In addition, all research hotspots were located in the Northern Hemisphere, indicating a lack of relevant studies from the Southern Hemisphere. This study also found that research hotspots of satellite RS applications in fisheries were mainly conducted in (1) the northeastern sea area in the United States, (2) the high seas area of the North Atlantic Ocean, (3) the surrounding sea areas of France, Spain and Portugal, (4) the surrounding areas of the Indian Ocean and (5) the East China Sea, Yellow Sea and Bohai Bay sea areas to the north of Taiwan. A comparison of publications examining the three major oceans indicated that the Atlantic Ocean was the most extensively studied in terms of RS applications in fisheries, followed by the Indian Ocean, while the Pacific Ocean was less studied than the aforementioned two regions. In addition, all research hotspots were located in the Northern Hemisphere, indicating a lack of relevant studies from the Southern Hemisphere. The Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean have been the subjects of many local in-depth studies; in the Pacific Ocean, the coastal areas have been abundantly investigated, while offshore local areas have only been sporadically addressed. Collaboration and partnership constitute an efficient approach for transferring skills and technology across countries. For the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030, research networks can be expanded to mitigate the research gaps and improve the sustainability of marine fisheries resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3adatabases 3ahumans 3asatellites 3aspatial data 3asustainable development 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aEast China Sea 3aFrance 3aIndian Ocean 3aPacific Ocean 3aPortugal 3aSpain 3aTaiwan 3aYellow Sea1 aChen, Chia-Hsiang 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Mar. 08, v. 13, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130510133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245013900207520144500346592002801791650001001819650001901829650002601848650002001874650001901894650001901913650001901932650002001951650001901971653000901990653002901999653002902028653000802057653002402065700005902089700002902148700002002177773011402197856008602311852000902397655001202406IND60670319620221119235331.0200809e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067031962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1212612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDixit, Fuhar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3116-029610aEfficient removal of GenX (HFPO-DA) and other perfluorinated ether acids from drinking and recycled waters using anion exchange resins  aCarcinogenic GenX chemicals, heptafluoropropylene-oxide-dimer-acid (HFPO-DA), have been recently detected in surface, ground and recycled water sources worldwide. However, GenX removals under the influence of variable characteristics of the organic and inorganic compounds present in the natural water sources, have often been overlooked in scientific literature. This is critically important given that the ionic composition and characteristics of organic matter in natural waters are spatially and seasonally variable. A strongly basic anion exchange (IX) resin was used to remove GenX and two other perfluorinated ether acids (PFEAS) from natural surface and recycled water sources. Factors influencing the uptake behavior included the PFEAS concentrations, resin dosage, and background anion characteristics. The equivalent background compound was employed to evaluate the competitive uptake between natural organic matter (NOM), inorganic ions and PFEAS in natural water matrices. Experimental data were compared with different mathematical and physical models and it was depicted that approximately 4–6% of the initial NOM competed with PFEAS for active exchange sites. Further, IX was able to achieve complete PFEAS removal (Cfᵢₙₐₗ<10 ng/L) with simultaneous removal of>60% NOM and >80% inorganic ions. Results of this study indicate that IX exhibits great potential for PFEAS removal from natural drinking water sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aanion exchange 3aanion exchange resins 3acarcinogenicity 3adrinking water 3ainorganic ions 3aorganic matter 3aphysical models 3arecycled water 0aGenX 0aCompetitive interactions 0aPerfluorinated compounds 0aNOM 0aShort-chained PFASs1 aBarbeau, Benoit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4108-81551 aMostafavi, Shadan Ghavam1 aMohseni, Madjid0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 384 p.121261-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1212613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01977naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245012800203300002000331520051600351592002800867596009600895596009600991650000901087650004601096650001201142650004401154650002201198650001401220700002001234700001901254700005501273700006201328773013601390856008001526852000901606655001201615IND60793434020221121093359.0220916e20220826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079343402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.2c011882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabata, Yoichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0712-623112aA Structure-Adaptive Ligand: The Conformation Changes to Fit with the Lengths and Angles of Tetravalent Bis-Paraquat Guests  ap. 12434-12440.  aA flexible cylindrical cryptand (1b) with two m-phenylene-26-crown-8 ethers has been prepared, and its complexing properties with respect to tetravalent cationic bis-paraquat guests have been investigated.

Perception of underlying causes of anthropogenic climate change in coastal communities in Cambodia and Tanzania  ap. 2150-2173.  aPublic perception of the underlying causes of anthropogenic climate change is a complex and subjective issue that is critical to effective risk communication. This issue is important to scientists and policymakers because of the role of individual perceptions in influencing their protective behaviour towards risk (e.g., the adoption of climate risk reduction and mitigation strategies). This cross-sectional study elucidated people's perceptions of the underlying causes of human-induced climate change in coastal communities in Cambodia and Tanzania. The multinomial logistic regression model was based on a geographically and demographically stratified national sample of 3,706 individuals conducted between March and September 2013. The distribution of the fundamental causes of anthropogenic climate change in the pooled sample was deforestation (29%), overpopulation – births and immigration (18%), greenhouse gas emissions (12%), illegal resource extraction (14%), and God's will and transgressing cultural norms (26%). Few people in both countries believed that, the usual suspect, greenhouse gas emission was the fundamental cause of anthropogenic climate change. The number of poor rural residents who indicated that deforestation was the major underlying cause of climate change was approximately three times more than members of the same sub-group who noted that greenhouse gas emissions were the underlying cause of climate change. People who had tertiary education were less likely to consider God's will and transgressing cultural norms as the underlying cause of anthropogenic climate change rather than attributing it to greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, it is imperative to mainstream climate change into educational curricula in both countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3across-sectional studies 3acurriculum 3adeforestation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aimmigration 3apublic opinion 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3arisk communication 3arisk reduction 3aCambodia 3aTanzania 0arisk 0aperception 0aclimate change 0aurban poverty 0amultinomial 0aCambodia 0aTanzania1 aYengoh, Genesis T.1 aUng, Mengieng1 aLuginaah, Isaac1 aRatana Chuenpagdee,1 aCampbell, Gwyn0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2017 Dec. 2, v. 60, no. 12 p.2150-2173dRoutledgex1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2017.12817973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245017800206506011700384506007600501520137200577592002801949506003701977650002302014650001302037650001902050650001702069650001602086650002902102650001302131650001102144650001802155650001502173650002302188650001502211650001002226650002402236650001702260653002802277653002302305653001202328653002902340653001402369700006002383700001902443700006502462700006702527700006502594700006002659700002602719773010902745856008302854852000902937655001202946IND60791681620221207052805.0220906e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079168162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fhfh.2022.1000842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida, Diana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9319-205310aEffect of emulsification/internal gelation-based microencapsulation on the viability of Akkermansia muciniphila upon prolonged storage and simulated gastrointestinal passage  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAkkermansia muciniphila is a common human intestinal commensal with a mucin-degrading nature. Its immunomodulatory characteristics and regulatory role of mucus layer and gut barrier integrity highlight the potential benefits of using this bacterium as an interventional player against inflammatory/cardio-metabolic disorders. In this work, we evaluate the effect of microencapsulation by the emulsification/internal gelation method on A. muciniphila survival during aerobic storage (0, 15, 30 and 95 days) and subsequent exposure to simulated gastrointestinal passage, in comparison with that of free cells. The present results show that microencapsulation by internal gelation promotes a 64.4 % entrapment efficacy of A. muciniphila cells (maintaining a 10⁸ order of magnitude for cell viability). Moreover, physical characterization showed that microparticles mean size was 53,5 ± 12,1 µm and, as observed by electron scanning microscopy, microcapsules were spherical in shape. More importantly, as storage time increased, encapsulated A. muciniphila demonstrated higher stability in GI conditions, when compared to its free counterpart. In conclusion, microencapsulation by internal gelation seems to be an appropriate strategy in protecting A. muciniphila against the detrimental gastrointestinal transit after long periods of aerobic refrigerated storage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption barrier 3abacteria 3acell viability 3acold storage 3aemulsifying 3agastrointestinal transit 3agelation 3ahumans 3ahydrocolloids 3aintestines 3amicroencapsulation 3amicroscopy 3amucus 3aphysical properties 3astorage time 0aAkkermansia muciniphila 0aMicroencapsulation 0aStorage 0aGastrointestinal passage 0aStability1 aMachado, Daniela1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7182-17521 aSousa, Sérgio1 aSeabra, Catarina Leal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9382-70471 aBarbosa, Joana Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9437-56871 aAndrade, José Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2403-60621 aGomes, Ana Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7883-24461 aFreitas, Ana Cristina0 tFood hydrocolloids for health.g2022 Dec., v. 2 p.100084-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:28426x2667-02597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fhfh.2022.1000843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01751naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001600186245009900202300002000301520071300321592002801034653002401062653002101086700001901107700001801126700002401144773019301168856007901361852000901440655001201449IND60518011520221118002330.0160406e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051801152DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15203931122doi7 aPMC46728032pmcid7 a266272442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Dapeng10aImbalanced signal transduction in regulatory T cells expressing the transcription factor FoxP3  ap. 14942-14947.  aSignificance The homeostasis of FoxP3 ⁺ Treg cells, essential controllers of immune and autoimmune responses, integrates inputs from the antigen-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) and from trophic cytokines or chemotactic cues. Expanding upon previous indications that Treg cells might be hyporesponsive, we find that TCR triggering induces dampened responses along all tested pathways in Treg compared with conventional CD4 ⁺ T cells, whereas their responses to IFN-I, IL6, or IL2 were equal or stronger. This imbalance indicates that Treg cells are less sensitive to direct recognition of novel antigens, for instance of an infectious nature, and more to cytokine-based cues or intercellular communication.  aPublisher supplied data 0asignal transduction 0aimmunoregulation1 aFarache, Julia1 aMathis, Diane1 aBenoist, Christophe0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Dec. 1, v. 112, no. 48 p.14942-14947dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15203931123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245007700212300001800289500001900307520160300326592002801929596008301957596007902040596008302119596008302202596004502285596004402330596004602374596004602420596007502466596007502541596007502616596007602691650001202767650001202779650001302791650002202804650001102826650001102837651001802848700002102866700004502887700003402932700002002966773012802986856008203114852000903196655001203205IND60714506720221119201210.0201024e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071450672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-020-05424-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHounsou-Gbo, Aubains1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4278-653410aSummer and winter Atlantic Niño: connections with ENSO and implications  ap. 2939-2956.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe teleconnection between the Atlantic Niño and the Pacific El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is revisited using observational and reanalysis data for the 1905–2014 period. Two types of Atlantic Niño are significantly negatively correlated with ENSO, with Atlantic leading ENSO by 6-month to 1-year. The first one is the already well-known connection between the boreal summer Atlantic Niño (ATL3: 3° N–3° S, 20° W–0°) and the subsequent winter ENSO (Niño3: 5° N–5° S, 150° W–90° W). This relationship is strong in the first and last decades of the study period. It is shown that a second Atlantic Niño in boreal fall/early winter (October–December, hereinafter called winter Atlantic Niño) is also significantly correlated with the following year ENSO. This winter Atlantic Niño leads to an early development of ENSO from boreal summer onwards, with a marked multidecadal modulation of the lead time. A nearly 1-year leading connection between winter Atlantic Niño and the following ENSO is generally observed in the mid-twentieth century, mostly when the summer Atlantic Niño teleconnection with the subsequent winter ENSO is weak. The same mechanism of the Atlantic–Pacific Niño connection, which involves the Walker circulation, operates for the two types of Atlantic Niño. Our analysis supports the leading influence of the summer and winter Atlantic equatorial modes on climate variability in South America. These results suggest the relevance of different types of Atlantic Niño for the 6-month to 1-year predictability of ENSO and its climatic impacts.  aPublisher supplied data  a565054/2010-4cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a8936/2011cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a465634/2014-1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a01.13.0353-00cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a817578cHorizon 2020 Framework Programme  a8361892016cAgência Nacional de Águas  a863.189/2016cAgência Nacional de Águas  a863.189/2016cAgência Nacional de Águas  a0012016cFundação Cearense de Meteorologia e Recursos Hídricos (BR)  a0012016cFundação Cearense de Meteorologia e Recursos Hídricos (BR)  a0012016cFundação Cearense de Meteorologia e Recursos Hídricos (BR)  a001/2016cFundação Cearense de Meteorologia e Recursos Hídricos (BR) 3aEl Nino 3aclimate 3adynamics 3aearly development 3asummer 3awinter 3aSouth America1 aServain, Jacques1 aVasconcelos Junior, Francisco das Chagas1 aMartins, Eduardo Sávio P.

Roadside N deposition could be substantial in areas with high visitation and traffic volume such as GCNP, although inputs of roadside pollution have not been quantified in GCNP. We used three potential indicators of N enrichment to evaluate impacts of vehicle emissions on roadside ecosystems in GCNP: 1) concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx) captured by passive air samplers, 2) natural δ15N abundance in the foliage of mature Piñon pine trees and soil N, and 3) concentrations of available inorganic N (NO3− and NH4+) in soil. Over an eight-month period, N enrichment was assessed at ten sites located across hypothesized gradients of vehicular N deposition based on distance from primary roadways and traffic levels in GCNP. Ogawa passive air samplers indicated that NOx levels were on average 52% higher at roadside locations compared to 30 m away, and were highest at the most heavily trafficked sites in the park. Natural abundance δ15N of foliage was significantly higher (F = 16.04, p = 0.007, n = 237) at roadside locations than at 15, and 30 m distances: a pattern that is consistent with local N inputs from vehicle emissions. Available inorganic soil N was significantly higher (F = 3.46, p = 0.013, n = 8) at the South Entrance roadside compared to areas with lower traffic densities. The direct measurement of atmospheric NOx using Ogawa samplers and δ15N of Piñon pine needle tissues were the best indicators of roadside N deposition. Our results also suggest that vehicular emissions on the South Rim of GCNP were incorporated in the plant nutrient pools near roadside environments. Although N emissions in GCNP comply with current annual air quality standards as specified by the Clean Air Act, it remains unclear whether the standards are low enough to sustain ecological integrity of native ecological communities along roadsides. Coupled with information on N-pollution tipping points and other ecological indicators, the metrics used here may prove to be a cost effective approach for monitoring roadside N-deposition and informing management decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3aair 3aair quality 3aammonium compounds 3aconifer needles 3aconservation areas 3acost effectiveness 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3amonitoring 3anational parks 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen oxides 3apollution 3aroads 3asamplers 3asoil 3astable isotopes 3atissues 3atraffic 0aNitrogen deposition 0aRoadside 0aδ15N 0aSemi-arid vegetation 0aGrand Canyon National Park1 aSisk, Thomas D.1 aHultine, Kevin R.1 aSesnie, Steven E.1 aBowker, Matthew A.1 aJohnson, Nancy Collins0 tJournal of arid environments.g2016 Nov., v. 134 p.150-159dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245012300207300001800330500001900348520179200367592002802159596004902187596004902236596005902285596010002344650001202444650001102456650001202467650001302479650001502492650002902507650001602536650002202552650001102574651001702585651002202602700001802624700002002642773012802662856008202790852000902872655001202881IND60714506820221119201148.0201024e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071450682DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-020-05435-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenamiel, Cléa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5099-114310aFar future climate (2060–2100) of the northern Adriatic air–sea heat transfers associated with extreme bora events  ap. 3043-3066.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe northernmost part of the Mediterranean Sea, the northern Adriatic shelf, is a complex area where the intensity of dense water formation and the consequent Adriatic-Ionian thermohaline circulation are shaped by a combination of extreme wintertime bora winds and substantial freshwater loads. To better understand the impact of global warming on extreme bora dynamics and the associated sea surface cooling, this study applies the Adriatic Sea and Coast (AdriSC) kilometer-scale modelling suite to the far future climate (2060–2100) period. Under both Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 greenhouse emission scenarios, the AdriSC simulations are carried out via the combination of a statistical approach—consisting of an ensemble of 3-day simulations for 22 extreme bora events, and a pseudo-global warning (PGW) methodology—imposing a climatological change to the forcing used to produce the evaluation (present climate) runs. Despite a noteworthy decrease in intensity of the bora winds (by up to 3 m/s), the latent heat losses are simulated to increase (by up to 150 W/m²) due to the reduction in relative humidity in the northern Adriatic (by up to 3%). Consequently, the sea surface cooling associated with severe bora events and preconditioning the dense shelf water formation in the northern Adriatic is projected to not significantly change compared to present climate. Although these results need to be further confirmed, this study thus provides a new view on the future of processes driven by sea surface cooling, such as the dense shelf water formation or the Adriatic-Ionian thermohaline circulation, that were projected to decrease in the future climate by regional climate models an order of magnitude coarser than the AdriSC simulations.  aPublisher supplied data  aIP-2016-06-1955cHrvatska Zaklada za Znanost  aIP-2019-04-8542cHrvatska Zaklada za Znanost  aCHANGE WE CAREcInterreg Italy-Croatia Programme Grant  aSpecial Project: The Adriatic decadal and inter-annual oscillations: modelling componentcECMWF 3aclimate 3acoasts 3acooling 3adynamics 3afreshwater 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alatent heat 3arelative humidity 3awinter 3aAdriatic Sea 3aMediterranean Sea1 aTojčić, Iva1 aVilibić, Ivica0 tClimate dynamics.g2020 Dec., v. 55, no. 11-12 p.3043-3066dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05435-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245009200180300001800272520110600290592002801396650002401424650001401448650001501462650001501477650001401492650001301506650001601519650002601535650008201561650002301643650003201666650003701698650001001735650008101745650002701826700001501853700001201868700001701880700001301897773011601910856004802026852000902074655001202083IND4474175720221122034915.0121003e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447417572DNAL7 a224343542pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-012-9628-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, J.

The results are: adenosine accumulation proved to be significantly selenium dependent (R 2 = 0.9403) and cordycepin contents were determined to be not significantly selenium dependent (R 2 = 0.3845) but significantly enhanced by selenium except for 20 ppm; there were significant differences in cordycepin contents, adenosine contents, and mycelium growth caused by light wavelengths: cordycepin, blue light > pink light > daylight, darkness, red light; adenosine, red light > pink light, darkness, daylight, blue light; and mycelium growth, red light > pink light, darkness, daylight > blue light. In conclusion, light wavelength had a significant influence on production of mycelia, adenosine, and cordycepin, so lightening wavelength should be changed according to target products in the liquid culture of C. militaris.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCordyceps militaris 3aadenosine 3ablue light 3acordycepin 3ared light 3aselenium 3awavelengths 2aAdenosinexmetabolism 2aCordycepsxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aCulture Techniques 2aDeoxyadenosinesxmetabolism 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aLight 2aMyceliumxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aSeleniumxpharmacology1 aLiu, M.

However, a wealth of knowledge about the variant biological function/disease impact is buried in unstructured literature data. Previous studies have attempted to harvest and unlock such information with text-mining techniques but are of limited use because their mutation extraction results are not standardized or integrated with curated data. We propose an automatic method to extract and normalize variant mentions to unique identifiers (dbSNP RSIDs). Our method, in benchmarking results, demonstrates a high F-measure of ∼90% and compared favorably to the state of the art. Next, we applied our approach to the entire PubMed and validated the results by verifying that each extracted variant-gene pair matched the dbSNP annotation based on mapped genomic position, and by analyzing variants curated in ClinVar. We then determined which text-mined variants and genes constituted novel discoveries. Our analysis reveals 41 889 RS numbers (associated with 9151 genes) not found in ClinVar. Moreover, we obtained a rich set worth further review: 12 462 rare variants (MAF ≤ 0.01) in 3849 genes which are presumed to be deleterious and not frequently found in the general population. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to analyze and integrate text-mined variant data with curated knowledge in existing databases. Our results suggest that databases can be significantly enriched by text mining and that the combined information can greatly assist human efforts in evaluating/prioritizing variants in genomic research.

And we observed the combined therapeutic effects of PheoA-SN38-HC NPs against HEY-T30 human ovarian cancer (OC) model. Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) data showed that the expression of cancer stem cell (CSC) markers (CD44, ALDH1A1, and CD117) is highly associated with poor clinical outcomes in OC patients. We proved that HEY-T30 cells overexpress CSC markers and much more invasive than other cancer cells. Flow cytometry (FACS) and microscopic analysis revealed the active targeting property of PheoA-SN38-HC NPs to CD44+ HEY-T30 cells. Moreover, the combination therapeutic effect of PheoA-SN38-HC NPs was clearly demonstrated against in vitro HEY-T30 cells and an in vivo xenograft mouse model. In particular, the paracrine cytotoxic effect of SN38 probably compensates the locoregional therapeutic limitation of photodynamic therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytotoxicity 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3ahyaluronic acid 3amice 3aovarian neoplasms 3aphotochemotherapy 3aproteomics 3areactive oxygen species 3astem cells 3axenotransplantation 0aHyaluronan-cholesterol conjugate 0aCombination chemotherapy 0aCancer stem cell (CSC) makers 0aPhotodynamic therapy 0aSN38 0aHyaluronan nanoparticles 0aChemo-resistant ovarian cancer 0aThioketal drug conjugate 0aCD44-targeting1 aDavaa, Enkhzaya1 aJiang, Yixin1 aShin, Kyung-Ju1 aKim, Min-hye,1 aAn, Hyunsu1 aKim, Jinho1 aCho, Steve K.1 aYang, Su-Geun0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 289 p.119455-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1194553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024004200133040001800175100001500193245009700208300001800305520101900323592002801342596008301370596004501453650001901498650001501517650002201532651001201554653001901566653002401585653002101609653001301630653001201643700001801655773012201673856008601795852000901881655001201890IND60580606420221118022058.0170923e20171202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058060642DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2017.12832982doi7 a10.1080/09640568.2017.12832982chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Mark12aA question of ‘fit’: local perspectives on top-down flood mitigation policies in Vermont  ap. 2217-2233.  aDespite consensus on the need to adapt to climate change, who should adapt, and how, remain open questions. While local-level actions are essential to adaptation, state and federal governments can play a substantial role in adaptation. In this paper, we investigate local perspectives on state-level flood mitigation policies in Vermont as a means of analysing what leads top-down adaptations to be effective in mobilizing local action. Drawing on interviews with town officials, we delineate local-level perspectives on Vermont's top-down policies and use those perspectives to develop a conceptual framework that presents the ‘fit’ between top-down policies and the local-level context as comprised of three components: Receptivity , Ease of Participation , and Design . We explain how these components and their interactions influence local-level action. This analysis points to how careful consideration of the components of ‘fit’ may lead to greater local-level uptake of top-down adaptation policies.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSGSdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000203 3aclimate change 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aVermont 0aclimate change 0atop-down adaptation 0aflood mitigation 0aplanning 0aVermont1 aMilman, Anita0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2017 Dec. 2, v. 60, no. 12 p.2217-2233dRoutledgex1360-05597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2017.12832983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245009500152300002000247520121800267592002801485650001701513650001401530650002101544650001501565650002401580650001501604650000901619650000901628650001801637650001501655650001101670650002201681700001401703700001201717700001701729773014401746856007401890852000901964655001201973IND60642678320221118004621.0190507e20171128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064267832DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta08826d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hao10aHigh-efficient electrocatalysts by unconventional acid-etching for overall water splitting  ap. 24153-24158.  aRecent advances in doping and heterostructuring based on earth-abundant two-dimensional nanoframeworks provide new possibilities in electrocatalysis. In this study, a novel, unconventional, one-step self-regulating acid-etching strategy was developed to prepare two-tiered hierarchical Fe-doped and Pt-decorated nickel hydroxide nanosheets selectively for efficient oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. The combinatorial hydrolysis of Ni ions in a self-limiting acidic environment induces selective growth of disparate dimension nanosheets. The proposed strategy, avoiding multifold structural design challenges, delivers highly exposed active sites and robust catalyst/support interfaces. Moreover, the exquisite structure and synergetic heterostructure modulation afford kinetically favorable electrolyte mass transport, and gas bubble release. Consequently, the structurally well-designed and hetero-coordinated electrodes attest highly efficient oxygen evolution with a low Tafel slope of 70.6 mV dec⁻¹ and overpotential of 300 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm⁻², while it 30.4 mV dec⁻¹ and 37 mV for hydrogen evolution, which rival performances of state-of-the-art electrocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrolysis 3aions 3airon 3amass transfer 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aoxygen production1 aZhu, Ting1 aLu, Xin1 aHo, Ghim Wei0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Nov. 28, v. 5, no. 46 p.24153-24158dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta08826d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04131naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100006400192245007800256300001600334506007600350520175600426592002802182596008702210596007002297596007202367596009202439596007202531506003702603650001902640650002002659650001402679650001002693650001302703650001902716650001102735650001502746700002002761700007102781700002502852700002202877700002402899700002202923700002102945700002202966700002202988700001803010700003803028700002403066700002103090700002103111700002503132700001903157700001703176710003903193710003603232773011803268856008603386852000903472655001203481IND60624904920221207083837.0191017e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062490492DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btx5422doi7 aPMC58601992pmcid7 a289688572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForslund, Kristoffer1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4285-699310aGearing up to handle the mosaic nature of life in the quest for orthologs  ap. 323-329.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSummary: The Quest for Orthologs (QfO) is an open collaboration framework for experts in comparative phylogenomics and related research areas who have an interest in highly accurate orthology predictions and their applications. We here report highlights and discussion points from the QfO meeting 2015 held in Barcelona. Achievements in recent years have established a basis to support developments for improved orthology prediction and to explore new approaches. Central to the QfO effort is proper benchmarking of methods and services, as well as design of standardized datasets and standardized formats to allow sharing and comparison of results. Simultaneously, analysis pipelines have been improved, evaluated and adapted to handle large datasets. All this would not have occurred without the long-term collaboration of Consortium members. Meeting regularly to review and coordinate complementary activities from a broad spectrum of innovative researchers clearly benefits the community. Highlights of the meeting include addressing sources of and legitimacy of disagreements between orthology calls, the context dependency of orthology definitions, special challenges encountered when analyzing very anciently rooted orthologies, orthology in the light of whole-genome duplications, and the concept of orthologous versus paralogous relationships at different levels, including domain-level orthology. Furthermore, particular needs for different applications (e.g. plant genomics, ancient gene families and others) and the infrastructure for making orthology inferences available (e.g. interfaces with model organism databases) were discussed, with several ongoing efforts that are expected to be reported on during the upcoming 2017 QfO meeting.  aPublisher supplied data  aERC-2012-StG-310325cEuropean Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010663  cNational Institutes of Healthdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  aR24 OD011883aU41 HG002273cNIHdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  aPP00P3_150654cSwiss National Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001711  aWT108749/Z/15/ZcWellcome Trustdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000044400 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioinformatics 3adata collection 3adatabases 3agenes 3agenomics 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3aprediction1 aPereira, Cecile1 aCapella-Gutierrez, Salvador1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0309-604X1 ada Silva, Alan Sousa1 aAltenhoff, Adrian1 aHuerta-Cepas, Jaime1 aMuffato, Matthieu1 aPatricio, Mateus1 aVandepoele, Klaas1 aEbersberger, Ingo1 aBlake, Judith1 aFernández Breis, Jesualdo Tomás1 aBoeckmann, Brigitte1 aGabaldón, Toni,1 aSonnhammer, Erik1 aDessimoz, Christophe1 aLewis, Suzanna1 aKelso, Janet2 aThe Quest for Orthologs Consortium2 aQuest for Orthologs Consortium 0 tBioinformatics.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 34, no. 2 p.323-329dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl56649x1460-20597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx5423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245015800166300001800324520174300342592002802085650002702113650000902140650002602149650002302175650001402198650002402212650002602236650001502262650000902277650001802286651001002304653001702314653001302331653002202344653001902366653002402385653000802409700005202417700001902469700002502488700001702513700002802530773012102558856008802679852000902767655001202776IND60581583120221123014314.0201111e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058158312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.1852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Shi10aLeachate breakthrough mechanism and key pollutant indicator of municipal solid waste landfill barrier systems: Centrifuge and numerical modeling approach  ap. 1123-1131.  aGroundwater pollution by leachate leakage is one of the most common environmental hazards associated with municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill sites. However, landfill leachate contains a large variety of pollutants with widely different concentrations and biotoxicity. Thus, selecting leachate pollutant indicators and levels for identifying breakthrough of barrier systems are key factors in assessing their breakthrough times. This study investigated the transport behavior of leachate pollutants through landfill barrier systems using centrifuge tests and numerical modeling. The overall objective of this study is to investigate breakthrough mechanism to facilitate the establishment of a consistent pollutant threshold concentration for use as a groundwater pollution alert. The specific objective of the study is to identify which pollutant and breakthrough threshold concentration should be used as an indicator in the transport of multiple pollutants through a landfill barrier system. The threshold concentration from the Chinese groundwater quality standards was used in the analysis of the properties of leachates from many landfill sites in China. The time for the chemical oxygen demand (COD) to reach the breakthrough threshold concentration at the bottom of a 2m compacted clay liner was 1.51years according to centrifuge tests, and 1.81years according to numerical modeling. The COD breakthrough times for single and double composite liners were within the range of 16 and 36.58years. Of all the pollutants, COD was found to consistently reach the breakthrough threshold first. Therefore, COD can be selected as the key indicator for pollution alerts and used to assess the environmental risk posed by MSW landfill sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical oxygen demand 3aclay 3aenvironmental hazards 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3amathematical models 3amunicipal solid waste 3apollutants 3arisk 3awater quality 3aChina 0aMSW landfill 0aLeachate 0aBreakthrough time 0aBarrier system 0aPollutant indicator 0aCOD1 aZhu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2907-60201 aWang, Shengwei1 aNg, Charles Wang Wai1 aChen, Yunmin1 aChiu, Abraham Chung Fai0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 612 p.1123-1131dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.1853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011800171300001400289520134300303592002801646650002301674650002201697650002401719650001401743650001101757650001701768650001901785650003301804650001501837650001801852650001501870650001101885650001601896650001401912650001501926650001501941650001001956650001001966650001701976651001301993653002202006653001202028653003002040653001302070653002902083653002302112700002102135700001802156700005902174700006602233773011002299856008702409852000902496655001202505IND60562484420221120201649.0190318e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056248442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2017.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmiru Birhane,10aCan rangelands gain from bush encroachment? Carbon stocks of communal grazing lands invaded by Prosopis juliflora  ap. 60-67.  aRangeland ecosystems are rapidly declining due to overgrazing and bush encroachment. Little is known about how important bush encroachment is for climate change mitigation. We estimated woody plant biomass at different Prosopis juliflora cover to quantify above- and below-ground carbon (C) stocks in Afar, northern Ethiopia. We developed allometric models to estimate aboveground biomass (agB) through destructive harvesting based on crown diameter (CrD), diameter at stump height (DSH), and tree height (H) for twenty P. juliflora and 18 Acacia senegal trees. DSH showed the best model fit in predicting above ground biomass compared to H, CrD, and the combination of those predictor parameters, respectively. Models were highly significant for all agB components. Total C stocks of the entire woody species community were about 40% higher (86 Mg C ha−1) at high than at low (50 Mg C ha−1) P. juliflora encroachment categories. We conclude that allometric models using simple dendrometric parameters are highly valuable for assessing P. juliflora biomass. While in lightly invaded areas, eradication and prevention of further spread might be possible, we propose that the high C stocks of rangelands densely invaded by P. juliflora, where eradication attempts have failed, should be considered for potential C trade measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProsopis juliflora 3aSenegalia senegal 3aaboveground biomass 3aallometry 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3agrazing lands 3aharvesting 3amodels 3aovergrazing 3aphytomass 3aprediction 3arangelands 3atrade 3atrees 3awoody plants 3aEthiopia 0aAllometric models 0aBiomass 0aClimate change mitigation 0aEthiopia 0aSemi-arid grazing system 0aWoody encroachment1 aTreydte, Anna C.1 aEshete, Abeje1 aSolomon, Negasi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0767-158X1 aHailemariam, Mengsteab1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1448-78950 tJournal of arid environments.g2017 June, v. 141 p.60-67dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2017.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245008500179300001800264520131800282592002801600650001901628650001201647650001601659650002901675650002801704650001101732650001201743650002301755650002201778650001301800650002601813650001501839650001501854650001701869650001701886650001301903650001801916653002301934653002301957653001301980653002901993653002402022700002602046700002502072773013102097856008502228852000902313655001202322IND60580606720180531000000.0170923e20171110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058060672DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2017.13084912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChahal, Shaminder Singh10aOrganic amendments decomposability influences microbial activity in saline soils  ap. 1875-1888.  aOrganic amendments with contrasting biochemical properties were investigated by conducting an incubation experiment in soils irrigated with different levels of saline water. Soil samples were taken from a long-term experimental field plots irrigated with normal water and saline water having electrical conductivity (EC) 6 and 12 dS m ⁻¹, respectively. Finely ground biochar, rice straw (RS), farm yard manure (FYM) and glucose were added at two rates (1% and 2.5% carbon basis) and incubated for 8 weeks at 25°C. Cumulative respiration (CR), microbial biomass carbon and available nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) were negatively correlated with EC, irrespective of the source and amount of added carbon (C). Compared with non-saline soil, at EC 12, relative decrease in CR was lowest with glucose (21.0%) followed by RS (32.0%), FYM (46.0%) and biochar (55.0%). Dissolved organic carbon was positively correlated with salinity and its concentration was higher in treatments with higher rate of C addition (2.5% C). This study showed decomposability of organic amendments and their rate of addition determines microbial activity in saline soils. Further, lower nitrogen (N) release from amendments under saline conditions limits microbial ability to utilize available C for satisfying their energy needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3abiochar 3acorrelation 3adissolved organic carbon 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy 3aglucose 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aphosphorus 3arice straw 3asaline soils 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asoil sampling 0aMicrobial activity 0aorganic amendments 0asalinity 0adissolved organic carbon 0amicrobial biomass C1 aChoudhary, Om Parkash1 aMavi, Manpreet Singh0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2017 Nov. 10, v. 63, no. 13 p.1875-1888dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2017.13084913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01917naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245013000164300001800294500001400312520064300326592002800969650001600997650002701013650001801040650001001058650001901068650001401087650001401101653002801115653001401143653001701157653001701174653002101191700001601212700002301228773018401251856007501435852000901510655001201519IND60691991120221123011704.0200502e20030101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069199112DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.67.17322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimizu, Nobuhiro,10aSimple Synthesis of Mite Pheromone β-Acaridial and Its Analogs in the Secretion of Caloglyphus polyphyllae (Acari: Acaridae)  ap. 1732-1736.  aNAL-light  aA simple synthesis of β-acaridial [(E)-1], the active principle of the sex, alarm and aggregation pheromone among astigmatid mites, was achieved in 5 steps from 1,2,4-butanetriol 2 in a 19% overall yield.

The vermifilter was evaluated using different natural ingredients viz river bed material, wood coal, glass balls, mud balls and employing Eisenia fetida as an earthworm species. The complete study was carried out for 90 days. The average COD removal for different material i.e. river bed material, wood coal, glass balls and mud balls was found as 72.3, 64.6, 61.5 and 59.8% while average BOD removal was observed as 81.2, 74.5, 72.7 and 70.9%, for respective filter media. Similarly, the total suspended solid removal was observed as 75, 64, 59 and 55%, respectively for above mentioned different media. The river bed material revealed maximum reduction of indicator organisms like total coliform (3.6±0.90 log unit), fecal coliform (3.4±0.67 log unit), fecal streptococci and Escherichia coli (2.5±0.51 log unit). At the end of the run vermicompost obtained through vermifiltration process as a byproduct were found to be rich in nitrate (31.2±5.9mg/L), phosphate (18.1±4.6mg/L) which could be exploited in sewage farming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEisenia fetida 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptococcus 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abyproducts 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoal 3acoliform bacteria 3aearthworms 3afarming systems 3aglass 3aindicator species 3aingredients 3anitrates 3aphosphates 3asewage 3astream channels 3atotal suspended solids 3avermicomposts 3avermifiltration 3awastewater treatment 3awood 0aVermifiltration 0aEisenia fetida 0aFilter media 0aOnsite wastewater treatment 0aIndicator organisms1 aBhargava, Renu1 aPrasad, K.S.

Detailed understanding is lacking, however, about interactions among locally variable hydrogeologic conditions, compositional control of groundwater on vadose zone and surface salts, and dust composition. Chemical and physical data from groundwater, sediments, and salts reveal compositional controls on saline-surface crusts across a wet playa, Mojave Desert, with bearing on similar settings elsewhere. The compositions of chemically and isotopically distinctive shallow (<3 m) water masses are recorded in the composition of associated salts. In areas with deeper and more saline groundwater, however, not all ions are transported through the vadose zone. Retention of arsenic and other elements in the vadose zone diminishes the concentrations of potentially toxic elements in surface salts, but creates a reservoir of these elements that may be brought to the surface during wetter conditions or by human disturbance. Selective wind-erosion loss of sulfate salts was identified by the compositional contrast between surface salt crusts and underlying groundwater. At the sub-basin scale, compositional links exist among groundwater, salt crusts, and dust from wet playas. Across the study basin, however, lateral variations in groundwater and solid-salt compositions are produced by hydrogeologic heterogeneity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3aarsenic 3abasins 3achemical composition 3adry environmental conditions 3adrying 3adust 3agroundwater 3aions 3alakes 3aplayas 3asediments 3asulfates 3atoxic substances 3avadose zone 3awind erosion 3aMojave Desert 3aUnited States 0aPlaya 0aGroundwater 0aSalt crusts 0aGeochemistry 0aTrace elements 0aDust1 aBreit, George N.1 aReynolds, Richard L.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2017 May, v. 140 p.50-66dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2017.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245009500180300001800275500001500293520134600308592002801654650002001682650001501702650002201717650002401739650001701763650001901780650001301799650001701812650001801829650002401847650001901871650002001890651000901910653002401919653001901943653002001962653002001982653002502002653002802027700002102055700003002076700001902106773013102125856008502256852000902341655001202350IND60580606820180531000000.0170923e20171110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058060682DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2017.13084922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaranian Kabir, Eftekhar10aSoil aggregate stability and organic matter as affected by land-use change in central Iran  ap. 1823-1837.  a2019-12-06  aThis study aimed to evaluate the soil aggregate stability and selected soil quality indicators in various land uses in a semiarid region in central Iran. Random soil sampling was used to collect soil samples from surface (0–5 cm) and subsurface (5–25 cm) soil layers in rangelands of different condition classes, dry farmland and abandoned land. The aggregate size distribution indices including mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD) and median diameter (D ₅₀) of water-stable aggregates in the collected soil samples were measured. Our findings showed that percent of macroaggregates (>0.25 mm) of the surface and subsurface layers in rangelands of different condition classes were significantly higher than dry farmlands and abandoned lands (P < 0.05). Results showed that the trend of changes in soil organic matter was similar to soil aggregate stability in different land uses in both soil layers as follows: rangeland with good condition > rangeland with poor condition > abandoned land > dry farmlands. The structural stability indices (i.e. MWD, GMD and D ₅₀) of rangelands with good condition were significantly greater than other land uses (P < 0.05). This highlights the importance of maintaining native rangeland to prevent organic matter loss, structure deterioration and soil erosion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland use change 3arangelands 3aagricultural land 3asoil organic matter 3asoil quality 3asemiarid zones 3ageometry 3asoil erosion 3asoil sampling 3aaggregate stability 3aabandoned land 3asoil aggregates 3aIran 0aAggregate stability 0aorganic matter 0amedian diameter 0aland-use change 0amean weight diameter 0ageometric mean diameter1 aBashari, Hossein1 aMosaddeghi, Mohammad Reza1 aBassiri, Mehdi0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2017 Nov. 10, v. 63, no. 13 p.1823-1837dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2017.13084923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008700168520122600255592002801481650001501509650001501524650001401539650001901553650003001572650001901602650000901621650002201630650000701652650001301659653002001672653002101692653002901713653001601742653002001758700006101778700001901839700001701858700005601875700006101931773011401992856008602106852000902192655001202201IND60670320420221121030147.0200809e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067032042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1212692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Min Sik10aReduction of chlorendic acid by zero-valent iron: Kinetics, products, and pathways  aChlorendic acid (CA) is a recalcitrant groundwater contaminant for which an effective treatment technology does not currently exist. In this study, a series of batch experiments were conducted to investigate the treatment of CA by zero-valent iron (ZVI) under various water chemistry conditions. It was observed that CA was removed by ZVI via both adsorption and degradation, with the degradation rate being proportional to the fraction of CA adsorbed onto ZVI. The rate of CA degradation decreased as pH increased, presumably due to the passivation of ZVI and diminishing CA adsorption. Chloride (Cl⁻) did not appreciably affect CA adsorption and degradation, while sulfate (SO₄²⁻) significantly inhibited both processes because SO₄²⁻ competed with CA for ZVI adsorptive sites. The rate of CA degradation was significantly accelerated by ZVI-associated Fe(II). Nine byproducts of CA transformation were identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The formation and subsequent degradation of these products revealed that the transformation of CA by ZVI occurred via a step-wise reductive dechlorination pathway. Overall, this study suggests that ZVI may be effective at remediating CA-contaminated sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abyproducts 3achlorides 3adechlorination 3agroundwater contamination 3ahydrochemistry 3airon 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3asulfates 0aChlorendic acid 0aZero-valent iron 0aReductive dechlorination 0aRemediation 0aHazardous waste1 aLe-Tuan Pham, Anh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5661-62801 aPiggott, Emily1 aZrinyi, Nick1 aLee, Changha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0404-94051 aPham, Anh Le-Tuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5661-62800 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 384 p.121269-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1212693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011900164300002000283520093300303592002801236596009701264596009201361596008001453650001101533650002101544650001101565650001501576650001501591650002401606650002201630700006301652700007201715773013701787856008001924852000902004655001202013IND60793434720221121093338.0220916e20220907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079343472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.2c012882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTosi, Eleonora10aAmine Activation: “Inverse” Dipeptide Synthesis and Amide Function Formation through Activated Amino Compounds  ap. 12148-12163.  aA copper(II)/HOBt-catalyzed procedure for the synthesis of dipeptides and “general” amides has been developed using microwave irradiation to considerably hasten the reaction. As an alternative to using traditional carboxylic acid activation, the method relies on the use of N-acyl imidazoles as activated amino partners. By doing so, a nonconventional way to reach dipeptides and amides has been proposed through the challenging and less studied N → C direction synthesis. A series of dipeptides and “general” amides have been successfully synthesized, and the applicability of the method has been illustrated in gram-scale syntheses. The mild reaction conditions proposed are completely adequate for couplings in the presence of sensitive amino acids, affording the products without detectable racemization. Furthermore, experimental observations prompted us to propose a plausible reaction pathway for the couplings.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-18-CE07-0038-01cAgence Nationale de la Recherchedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001665  aNAcCentre National de la Recherche Scientifiquedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004794  aNAc?cole Nationale Sup?rieure de Chimie de Montpellierdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aamides 3acarboxylic acids 3acopper 3adipeptides 3aimidazoles 3amicrowave radiation 3aorganic chemistry1 aCampagne, Jean-Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4943-047X1 ade Figueiredo, Renata Marcia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5336-60710 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2022 Sept. 07, v. 87, no. 18 p.12148-12163dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.2c012883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005400152245009200206300001400298520139300312592002801705650001701733650002701750650001301777650003301790650001001823650002301833650001901856650001601875650001101891650001501902650002201917650001301939653002001952653002801972653002302000653002302023653002502046653003102071700002002102773011002122856008702232852000902319655001202328IND60562484620221120201728.0190318e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056248462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2017.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurdon, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5963-374010aWater provisioning in Kruger National Park alters elephant spatial utilisation patterns  ap. 45-51.  aWater provisioning is a controversial yet common practice and its consequences for wildlife and vegetation have fuelled well-worn debates. Contradictory opinions exist on the effect of water provisioning on elephant abundance and distribution. Here, we evaluated how water utilisation patterns, water source type, and availability affect the spatial utilisation patterns of elephants in Kruger National Park. We segmented the seasonal movement paths of 26 elephant breeding herds into trips, defined as segments of the trajectory that occur between two consecutive visits to water sources. We classified the trips as natural or artificial depending on the start and end water source. Elephants visited rivers more often than artificial waterholes. The probability of visiting water was highest during the hot afternoon and most trips lasted less than 36 h. Artificial waterholes made trips further from rivers potentially less costly, and for a third of the total area traversed by elephants, they visited waterholes instead of rivers. Additionally, artificial waterholes may increase the intensity of use in some areas. Water provisioning in Kruger alters elephant spatial utilisation patterns. Removing artificial waterholes in Kruger might reduce the area traversed and educe spatio-temporal variability in how elephants utilise space, a desirable outcome for conservation management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephantidae 3aattitudes and opinions 3abreeding 3adry environmental conditions 3aherds 3amigratory behavior 3anational parks 3aprobability 3arivers 3avegetation 3awater utilization 3awildlife 0aBrownian bridge 0aConservation management 0aLoxodonta africana 0aSavanna ecosystems 0aSpatial distribution 0aSurface-water manipulation1 avan Aarde, R.J.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2017 June, v. 141 p.45-51dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2017.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245006700213300001700280506007600297520195400373592002802327506003702355650000902392650001102401650001002412650001002422650001202432650002802444650002002472650001702492650002202509650002502531650002502556650002902581650000902610650001002619650001902629650001102648650001602659650001102675650002202686650002302708651001802731653001302749653001302762653001102775653001402786700002202800700001602822700002402838700001702862700002102879773014402900856008303044852000903127655001203136IND60623839220221207132550.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062383922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jand.2018.11.0112doi7 aPMC68000742pmcid7 a306836172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnufrak, Stephen J.10aFoods and Beverages Obtained at Worksites in the United States  ap. 999-1008.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNutrition interventions are a common component of worksite wellness programs and have been recognized as an effective strategy to change employee dietary behaviors. However, little is known about worksite food behaviors or the foods that are obtained at workplaces at the national level.The aims were to examine the frequency of and the amount of money spent obtaining foods at work among employed US adults, to determine the foods most commonly obtained at work, and to assess the dietary quality of these foods.This is a cross-sectional analysis of data from the US Department of Agriculture Food Acquisition and Purchasing Survey, a nationally representative household survey conducted from April 2012 through January 2013 on food purchases and acquisitions during a 7-day study period.The study included 5,222 employed adult Americans.The study assessed the prevalence of obtaining any foods at work overall and according to sociodemographic subgroups, number of acquisitions and calories obtained, most commonly obtained foods and leading food sources of calories, and 2010 Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores that represent dietary quality.Prevalence estimates of obtaining ≥1 foods at work were compared according to sociodemographic characteristic using χ2 tests.Nearly a quarter (23.4%) of working adults obtained foods at work during the week, and the foods they obtained averaged 1,292 kcal per person per week. The leading food types obtained included foods typically high in solid fat, added sugars, or sodium, such as pizza, regular soft drinks, cookies or brownies, cakes and pies, and candy. HEI scores suggest that work foods are high in empty calories, sodium, and refined grains and low in whole grains and fruit.Working adults commonly obtain foods at work, and the foods they obtain have limited dietary quality. Future research should examine the role worksites can play to help ensure access to and promote healthier options.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUSDA 3aadults 3acakes 3acandy 3acookies 3across-sectional studies 3afood purchasing 3ahealthy diet 3ahousehold surveys 3anutritional adequacy 3anutritional behavior 3anutritional intervention 3apies 3apizza 3arefined grains 3asodium 3asoft drinks 3asugars 3awhole grain foods 3aworking conditions 3aUnited States 0aWorksite 0aWellness 0aAdults 0aNutrition1 aZaganjor, Hatidza1 aPan, Liping1 aLee-Kwan, Seung Hee1 aPark, Sohyun1 aHarris, Diane M.0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2019 June, v. 119, no. 6 p.999-1008dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2018.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010800168300001600276520193600292592002802228650001402256650001202270650001002282650001902292650002002311650001902331650001202350650002402362650002202386650001202408650000902420650001202429650001402441650001902455650000902474650003502483650003002518650001302548650001002561651001102571653001802582653002702600653003002627653001202657653001202669653000902681653001202690700002102702700001802723700002302741700002302764700001502787773008902802856008402891852000902975655001202984IND60544868620221117223955.0160901e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054486862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2015.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Shari10aMetals exposure and risk of small-for-gestational age birth in a Canadian birth cohort: The MIREC study  ap. 430-439.  aLead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic are some of the most common toxic metals to which Canadians are exposed. The effect of exposure to current low levels of toxic metals on fetal growth restriction is unknown.Objective: The aim of this study was to examine relationships between exposure to lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic during pregnancy, and risk of small for gestational age (SGA) birth.Methods: Lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic levels were measured in blood samples from the first and third trimesters in 1835 pregnant women from across Canada. Arsenic species in first trimester urine were also assessed. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using log binomial multivariate regression. Important covariates including maternal age, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI, and smoking, were considered in the analysis. An exploratory analysis was performed to examine potential effect modification of these relationships by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GSTP1 and GSTO1 genes.No association was found between blood lead, cadmium or arsenic and risk for SGA. We observed an increased risk for SGA for the highest compared to the lowest tertile of exposure for mercury (>1.6µg/L, RR=1.56.; 95% CI=1.04–2.58) and arsenobetaine (>2.25µg/L, RR=1.65; 95% CI=1.10–2.47) after adjustment for the effects of parity and smoking. A statistically significant interaction was observed in the relationship between dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) levels in urinary arsenic and SGA between strata of GSTO1 A104A (p for interaction=0.02). A marginally significant interaction was observed in the relationship between blood lead and SGA between strata of GSTP1 A114V (p for interaction=0.06).These results suggest a small increase in risk for SGA in infants born to women exposed to mercury and arsenic. Given the conflicting evidence in the literature this warrants further investigation in other pregnant populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanadians 3aarsenic 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3abody mass index 3acacodylic acid 3acadmium 3aconfidence interval 3afetal development 3ainfants 3alead 3amercury 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asmall for gestational age 3atoxicity 3aurine 3aCanada 0aBiomonitoring 0aPregnancy cohort study 0aSmall for gestational age 0aMercury 0aCadmium 0aLead 0aArsenic1 aArbuckle, Tye E.1 aFisher, Mandy1 aFraser, William D.1 aEttinger, Adrienne1 aKing, Will0 tEnvironmental Research.g2015 July, v. 140 p.430-439dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2015.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011000175300001600285520132600301592002801627650001301655650001101668650002001679653002601699653002601725653004201751653002101793653002501814653002401839700002201863773010501885856008601990852000902076655001202085IND60565089820221120122154.0190318e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056508982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaroney, Cynthia L.10aStream depletion rate for a radial collector well in an unconfined aquifer near a fully penetrating river  ap. 732-741.  aThe stream depletion rate (SDR) is computed for a radial collector well installed in a semi-infinite, anisotropic, homogeneous, unconfined aquifer near a fully penetrating stream with a streambed with reduced conductivity. For small pumping rates dimensional analysis and other arguments allow the SDR to be expressed as a function of eight parameters that describe the effect of properties of the aquifer and streambed as well as the configuration and placement of the well. The calculations employ some results from Huang et al. (2012, J. Hydrol.), who expressed the SDR as a quintuple integral, but by computing four of the integrals analytically, the present solution requires less computational effort. Analytical calculation shows that the SDR in steady state does not depend on the streambed properties (or any other parameters): Given enough time, the flow through the streambed will equal the pumping rate of the well. Values of SDR are supported by comparing to previous solutions for special cases corresponding to appropriate limiting values of the parameters. Effects of the eight dimensionless parameters are studied systematically: The properties of the streambed, anisotropy of the aquifer, and the position of the well affect the SDR more strongly than the orientation, length, and depth of the laterals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3arivers 3astream channels 0aStream depletion rate 0aRadial collector well 0aGroundwater-surface water interaction 0aGravity drainage 0aRiverbank filtration 0aAnalytical solution1 aRehmann, Chris R.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2017 Apr., v. 547 p.732-741dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013600167520134200303592002801645650001501673650001301688650001801701650001501719650001301734650002501747650001301772653001001785653000901795653000801804653000701812653002501819653001001844653002901854653001701883700001501900700001901915700001501934700001401949700001801963700001501981773010601996856008702102852000902189655001202198IND60750941120221119182021.0220531e20211205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075094112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1275492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Boqiu10aSystematic investigating on the broadband solar absorption and photo-thermal conversion performance of TiN@rGO plasmonic nanofluids  aStrong solar capture and high heat transfer are extremely vital for designing solar-to-heat absorber to improve photo-thermal conversion efficiency in direct absorption solar collectors (DASCs). In this paper, the plasmonic nanofluids containing reduced graphene oxides (rGO) decorated with titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticles were prepared. Their superior solar-thermal conversion efficiency and heat transfer property was based on the synergy between the Localized Surface Plasmon Resonances (LSPR) effect of TiN and the high thermal conductivity of rGO. The optical properties of plasmonic nanofluids were investigated with the concentration and penetration depth, which indicated that the existence of TiN on graphene could improve the light-capture ability. The results indicated that the TiN@rGO plasmonic nanofluids could be used for DASCs applications, even under the low mass concentrations. Specifically, the maximum photo-thermal conversion efficiency of the plasmonic nanofluids was 66.74% at 40 ppm concentration, which was about 23% higher than that of pure water. And, the experimental results show that the photothermal conversion efficiency will be reduced if the nanofluid concentration is higher than the optimal concentration. This work exhibited the potential application of plasmonic-graphene nanofluids in DASCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3agraphene 3aheat transfer 3ananofluids 3anitrides 3athermal conductivity 3atitanium 0aDASCs 0aLSPR 0avol 0awt 0aPlasmonic nanofluids 0aDASCs 0aPhoto-thermal conversion 0aSolar energy1 aHan, Yiran1 aYang, Tingting1 aLi, Junyou1 aWang, Hao1 aChen, Wenjing1 aLi, Xiaoke0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Dec. 05, v. 630 p.127549-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1275493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03738naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245010500165500001400270520210000284592002802384650002402412650002502436650002102461650002602482650002202508650001802530650002502548650001402573650001402587650001802601650001802619650001902637650001202656650002202668651001202690651001002702651001102712651001202723651001602735651000902751651001702760651001002777700002402787700003102811700002202842700002202864700002502886700002302911700003302934773012102967856007503088852000903163655001203172IND60721552220221119105219.0201224e20201209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072155222DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101223422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Md  Mazharul10aHelminth Parasites among Rodents in the Middle East Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  aNAL-light  aRodents can be a source of zoonotic helminths in the Middle East and also in other parts of the world. The current systematic review aimed to provide baseline data on rodent helminths to recognize the threats of helminth parasites on public health in the Middle East region. Following a systematic search on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, a total of 65 research studies on rodent cestodes, nematodes, and trematodes, which were conducted in the countries of the Middle East, were analyzed. The study identified 44 rodent species from which Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Rattus rattus were most common (63%) and recognized as the primary rodent hosts for helminth infestation in this region. Cestodes were the most frequently reported (n = 50), followed by nematodes (49), and trematodes (14). The random effect meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of cestode (57.66%, 95%CI: 34.63–80.70, l²% = 85.6, p < 0.001) was higher in Saudi Arabia, followed by nematode (56.24%, 95%CI: 11.40–101.1, l²% = 96.7, p < 0.001) in Turkey, and trematode (15.83%, 95%CI: 6.25–25.1, l²% = 98.5, p < 0.001) in Egypt. According to the overall prevalence estimates of individual studies, nematodes were higher (32.71%, 95%CI: 24.89–40.54, l²% = 98.6, p < 0.001) followed by cestodes (24.88%, 95%CI: 19.99–29.77, l²% = 94.9, p < 0.001) and trematodes (10.17%, 95%CI: 6.7–13.65, l²% = 98.3, p < 0.001) in the rodents of the Middle East countries. The review detected 22 species of helminths, which have zoonotic importance. The most frequent helminths were Capillaria hepatica, Hymenolepis diminuta, Hymenolepis nana, and Cysticercus fasciolaris. There was no report of rodent-helminths from Bahrain, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Furthermore, there is an information gap on rodent helminths at the humans-animal interface level in Middle East countries. Through the One Health approach and countrywide detailed studies on rodent-related helminths along with their impact on public health, the rodent control program should be conducted in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapillaria hepatica 3aHymenolepis diminuta 3aHymenolepis nana 3aOne Health initiative 3aRattus norvegicus 3aRattus rattus 3aTaenia taeniaeformis 3aTrematoda 3ahelminths 3ameta-analysis 3apublic health 3arodent control 3arodents 3asystematic review 3aBahrain 3aEgypt 3aJordan 3aLebanon 3aMiddle East 3aOman 3aSaudi Arabia 3aYemen1 aFarag, Elmoubashar 1 aHassan, Mohammad  Mahmudul1 aBansal, Devendra 1 aAwaidy, Salah  Al1 aAbubakar, Abdinasir 1 aAl-Romaihi, Hamad 1 aMkhize-Kwitshana, Zilungile 0 tAnimals.g2020 Dec. 09, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101223423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014700206300001600353520176600369592002802135596005502163650001402218650001202232650001602244650001502260650001602275650001102291650002002302650001602322650002002338650002302358650001802381651001902399700002402418773011402442856008302556852000902639655001202648IND60734249220221120042621.0210731e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073424922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-021-04898-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarkin, Claire1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4106-038X10aDifferential outcomes of novel plant-herbivore associations between an invading planthopper and native and invasive Spartina cordgrass species  ap. 983-994.  aNon-native plants may benefit, briefly or permanently, from natural enemy release in their invaded range, or may form novel interactions with native enemy species. Likewise, newly arrived herbivores may develop novel associations with native plants or, where their hosts have arrived ahead of them, re-establish interactions that existed previously in their ancestral ranges. Predicting outcomes from this diversity of novel and re-established interactions between plants and their herbivores presents a major challenge for invasion biology. We report on interactions between the recently arrived invasive planthopper Prokelisia marginata, and the multi-ploidy Spartina complex of four native and introduced species in Britain, each representing a different level of shared evolutionary history with the herbivore. As predicted, S. alterniflora, the ancestral host, was least impacted by planthopper herbivory, with the previously unexposed native S. maritima, a nationally threatened species, suffering the greatest impacts on leaf length gain, new leaf growth and relative water content. Contrary to expectations, glasshouse trials showed P. marginata to preferentially oviposit on the invasive allododecaploid S. anglica, on which it achieved earlier egg hatch, faster nymphal development, larger female body size and greatest final population size. We suggest P. marginata is in the process of rapid adaptation to maximise its performance on what is now the most abundant and widespread host in Britain. The diversity of novel and re-established interactions of the herbivore with this multi-ploidy complex makes this a highly valuable system for the study of the evolutionary ecology of plant–insect interactions and their influence on invasion dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/J500446/1cNatural Environment Research Council 3abody size 3afemales 3agreenhouses 3aherbivores 3aleaf length 3aleaves 3anatural enemies 3aoviposition 3apopulation size 3athreatened species 3awater content 3aUnited Kingdom1 aStewart, Alan J.

In this study, methanol and dichloromethane extracts of S. fruticosa were explored for phytochemical, biological and toxicological parameters. Total phenolic and flavonoid constituents were determined by using standard aluminum chloride and Folin-Ciocalteu methods, and UHPLC-MS analysis of methanol extract was performed for tentative identification of secondary metabolites. Different standard methods like DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, CUPRAC, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and metal chelation assays were utilized to find out the antioxidant potential of extracts. Enzyme inhibition studies of extracts against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, tyrosinase, α-amylase and, α-glucosidase enzymes were also studied. Likewise, the cytotoxicity was also assessed against MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and DU-145 cell lines. The higher phenolic and flavonoids contents were observed in methanol extracts which can be correlated to its higher radical scavenging potential. Similarly, 11 different secondary metabolites were tentatively identified by UHPLC profiling. Both the extract showed significant inhibition against all the enzymes except for α-glucosidase. Moreover, docking studies were also performed against the tested enzymes. In the case of cytotoxicity, both the samples were found moderately toxic against the tested cell lines. This plant can be explored further for its potential therapeutic and edible uses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuaeda vera 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aalpha-amylase 3aaluminum chloride 3aantioxidant activity 3achelation 3acholinesterase 3acytotoxicity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aflavonoids 3ahalophytes 3amedicinal plants 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3asecondary metabolites 3atherapeutics 3atoxicology 0aSuaeda fruticose 0aPhytochemicals 0aAntioxidant 0aDocking1 aKhurshid, Umair1 aSarfraz, Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0516-49661 aTousif, Muhammad Imran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5777-61121 aAlamri, Abdulwahab1 aAnwar, Sirajudheen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0926-27901 aAlamri, Abdulhakeem1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3174-04341 aAhmad, Irshad1 aAbdallah, Hassan H.1 aMahomoodally, Fawzi M.1 aAhemad, Nafees1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5164-19700 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2021 Aug., v. 154 p.112348-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2021.1123483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010900165300001400274500001500288520138500303592002801688650001901716650002101735650001301756650001101769650000901780650002601789650002401815650001301839650001601852650001601868650001701884653002101901700001701922700001701939700001301956773009101969856008402060852000902144655001202153IND60098853520221121064848.0141105e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009885352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2012.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, ZhiYi10aThermogravimetric analysis of the thermal decomposition of MSW in N₂, CO₂ and CO₂/N₂ atmospheres  ap. 18-23.  a2019-12-06  aThe thermal decomposition of municipal solid waste (MSW) from Huizhou under N₂, CO₂ and CO₂/N₂ atmospheres was analyzed using a thermogravimetric instrument. The results revealed that the higher the heating rate, the more the residual mass and the higher the weight loss rates of the peaks. Under CO₂ atmosphere, the volatile release from 160°C to 650°C, with a pronounced peak and a small shoulder in the DTG curve. The weight loss below 650°C changed with atmosphere indistinctively except in the 80%N₂/20%CO₂ atmosphere. Low CO₂ concentration influenced the residual mass, while when CO₂ concentration was over 60%, the residual mass almost remained the same (32.2%). Replacement of N₂ by CO₂ promoted the char gasification in high temperature range. In 100%N₂ atmosphere, the peak above 650°C was only shaped by the degradation of minerals and the residues were char and ash. As the CO₂ concentration increased, this peak shifted to a higher temperature range, and char gasification played the principal role. Above 650°C, the DTG curve showed two peaks in 80%N₂/20%CO₂ atmosphere obviously, whereas only an obvious peak in other atmospheres. The residues were almost ash in 100%CO₂ atmosphere. The nth order reaction model of several independent fractions was applied to evaluate the kinetic parameters and it fitted the weight loss well.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3athermogravimetry 3anitrogen 3amodels 3aheat 3amunicipal solid waste 3athermal degradation 3aminerals 3atemperature 3aweight loss 3agasification 0athermal analysis1 aMa, XiaoQian1 aTang, YuTing1 aLin, Hai0 tFuel processing technology.g2012 Oct., v. 102 p.18-23dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2012.04.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245015500164300001600319520180800335592002802143650002202171650002102193650001602214650001302230650001802243650001302261650001902274650002302293650002402316650001502340650001202355650001402367650001102381650002702392650001202419650001402431650000902445650002002454650001602474650001202490650001602502650001402518700002402532700002202556700002302578773011302601856004802714852000902762655001202771IND4467555220221120025929.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446755522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-011-9975-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRihan, Hail Z.10aEncapsulation of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var botrytis) microshoots as artificial seeds and their conversion and growth in commercial substrates  ap. 243-250.  aAn effective protocol for the mass production of cauliflower microshoots was refined using the meristematic layer of cauliflower curd. After the meristematic layer was surface sterilized and shaved off, a commercial blender was used for homogenization and several blending treatments were tested in the range 15–120 s and 30 s was found to be optimal in terms of the amount explants produced and their subsequent growth ability. Explants were cultivated in S23 liquid medium (4.4 g L−1 MS (Murashige and Skoog) and 3% v/w sucrose) supplemented with several combinations of plant growth regulators (PGRs) including 1 and 2 mg L−1 of Kinetin in combination with three types of auxins (indole butyric acid (IBA), Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)), each at 1 and 2 mg L−1 concentration. The use of 2 mg L−1 Kinetin and 1 mg L−1 IBA gave the best results in terms of its effects on explant induction. Microshoots of different sizes were encapsulated in a sodium alginate matrix and the optimal stage suitable for the production of artificial seeds was assessed in terms of both subsequent conversion and plantlet viability. The feasibility of cultivating cauliflower artificial seeds in commercial substrates (compost, vermiculite, perlite and sand) irrigated with different solution mixtures including sterilized distilled water (SDW), PGRs-free S23 medium and S23 medium supplemented with Kinetin (1 and 2 mg L−1) and IBA or NAA at (1 and 2 mg L−1) was investigated. The use of 2 mg L−1 Kinetin and 2 mg L−1 NAA applied with S23 gave the optimal response with both perlite and compost.

ATCH, ATC30 and ATC120 showed also individual characteristic IR and NIR spectra, respectively. ATCH contained 3 mol of crystal water, but ATC30 and ATC120 contained weakly binding adsorbed water in the amorphous solids, respectively. The result of the dissolution kinetic analysis based on the dissolution model including the phase transition showed that the dissolution behaviors of ATCH, ATC30 and ATC120 were significantly different, respectively, reflecting their intermolecular interaction in the solids. THz was able to indicate a difference between the chemical structure of amorphous solids ATC30 and ATC120, which were not able to discriminate by the XRD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatorvastatin 3achemical interactions 3achemical structure 3akinetics 3amodels 3aphase transition 3athermal analysis 0aPolyamorphism 0aAtorvastatin calcium 0aTerahertz spectroscopy 0aDissolution kinetics 0aX-ray powder diffractometry 0aInfrared spectroscopy 0aNear-infrared spectroscopy1 aHattori, Yusuke1 aSasaki, Tetsuo1 aNishizawa, Jun-ichi1 aOtsuka, Makoto0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Dec. 05, v. 630 p.127551-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1275513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008700165520104900252592002801301650004401329650003701373650001201410650001701422650001301439650001301452650002001465650002101485650000901506650002501515650001101540650001801551650003301569650001001602653001601612653002001628653000901648700001501657700001601672700001401688700001501702700001501717773010801732856008601840852000901926655001201935IND60697800520221123003948.0200726e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069780052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1165302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Rui10aSynthesis of chitosan-based flame retardant and its fire resistance in epoxy resin  aA novel flame retardant CCD was synthesized by the condensation between cinnamalde and chitosan, followed by the addition reaction with 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide(DOPO), and CCD was named from the initials of the three raw materials.

To date, their control relies on synthetic insecticides and repellents aimed to control the competent mosquito vectors. However, their use is hampered by their high economic, environmental, and human health impacts. Natural products may represent a valid eco-friendly alternative to chemical pesticides to control mosquitoes, and mosquito-borne parasitic diseases. The aim of this work was to combine the chemical and sensorial profiles with the bioactivity data of Salvia spp. essential oils (EOs) to select the most suitable EO to be used as a repellent and insecticide against the invasive mosquito Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae), vector of pathogens and parasites, and to describe the EOs smell profile. To do this, the EOs of four Salvia species, namely S. dolomitica, S. dorisiana, S. sclarea, and S. somalensis were extracted, chemically analyzed and tested for their bioactivity as larvicides and repellents against Ae. albopictus. Then, the smell profiles of the EOs were described by a panel of assessors. The LC₅₀ of the EOs ranged from 71.08 to 559.77 μL L⁻¹ for S. dorisiana and S. sclarea, respectively. S. sclarea EO showed the highest repellence among the tested EOs against Ae. albopictus females (RD₉₅ = 12.65 nL cm⁻²), while the most long-lasting, at the dose of 20 nL cm⁻², was S. dorisiana (Complete Protection Time = 43.28 ± 3.43 min). S. sclarea EO showed the best smell profile, while S. dolomitica EO the worst one with a high number of off-flavors. Overall, all the EOs, with the exception of the S. dolomitica one, were indicated as suitable for “environmental protection”, while S. dorisiana and S. sclarea were indicated as suitable also for “Body care”.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes albopictus 3aSalvia 3aarboviruses 3abioactive properties 3adosage 3aenvironmental protection 3aessential oils 3afemales 3ahuman health 3ainsect vectors 3ainsecticides 3alarvicides 3amosquito control 3aoff flavors 3aparasites 3aparasitoses 3apathogens 3apublic health 3arepellents 3asmell1 aPistelli, Luisa 1 aVenturi, Francesca 1 aFerroni, Giuseppe 1 aGiovanelli, Silvia 1 aCervelli, C.q(Claudio),1 aBedini, Stefano 1 aConti, Barbara 0 tBiology.g2020 Aug. 04, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology90802063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002000182245008600202300001600288506007600304520136200380592002801742506003701770650002501807650003201832650002501864650002301889650001501912650002301927650001201950650001801962650001101980650002201991650002102013650002602034650001302060650002202073650002502095650001202120650003002132650002102162650002502183650002602208650003602234650003702270700001902307700002202326700001802348700002202366700001702388700002302405700002002428700001802448773011302466856008102579852000902660655001202669IND4469088720221207144154.0120502e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446908872DNAL7 a222098732pmid7 aPMC32717732pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.111.1878312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasmann, Sergio10aHerbivory in the Previous Generation Primes Plants for Enhanced Insect Resistance  ap. 854-863.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInducible defenses, which provide enhanced resistance after initial attack, are nearly universal in plants. This defense signaling cascade is mediated by the synthesis, movement, and perception of jasmonic acid and related plant metabolites. To characterize the long-term persistence of plant immunity, we challenged Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) with caterpillar herbivory, application of methyl jasmonate, or mechanical damage during vegetative growth and assessed plant resistance in subsequent generations. Here, we show that induced resistance was associated with transgenerational priming of jasmonic acid-dependent defense responses in both species, caused caterpillars to grow up to 50% smaller than on control plants, and persisted for two generations in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis mutants that are deficient in jasmonate perception (coronatine insensitive1) or in the biogenesis of small interfering RNA (dicer-like2 dicer-like3 dicer-like4 and nuclear RNA polymerase d2a nuclear RNA polymerase d2b) do not exhibit inherited resistance. The observation of inherited resistance in both the Brassicaceae and Solanaceae suggests that this trait may be more widely distributed in plants. Epigenetic resistance to herbivory thus represents a phenotypically plastic mechanism for enhanced defense across generations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3adefense mechanisms 3aherbivores 3ainduced resistance 3ainsects 3ajasmonic acid 3alarvae 3amechanical damage 3amethyl jasmonate 3asmall interfering RNA 3atomatoes 3avegetative growth 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aFeeding Behavior 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aOxylipinsxmetabolism 2aPlantsxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgenetics1 aDe Vos, Martin1 aCasteel, Clare L.1 aTian, Donglan1 aHalitschke, Rayko1 aSun, Joel Y.1 aAgrawal, Anurag A.1 aFelton, Gary W.1 aJander, Georg0 tPlant physiology.g2012 Feb., v. 158, no. 2 p.854-863dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.111.1878313Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012100164300001800285520165200303592002801955650001601983650001701999650002502016650001802041650001302059650001502072650001902087650001902106650001302125650001602138700001602154700005202170700001602222700001402238700005702252700006102309700005902370773012202429856008302551852000902634655001202643IND60770272720221116151456.0220314e20220120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077027272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.1c015202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jialin10aDesign of a UCST Polymer with Strong Hydrogen Bonds and Reactive Moieties for Facile Polymer–Protein Hybridization  ap. 1291-1301.  aPolymer–protein hybrids have been extensively used in biomedical fields. Polymers with upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behaviors can form a hydrated coacervate phase below the cloud point (Tcₚ), providing themselves the opportunity to directly capture hydrophilic proteins and form hybrids in aqueous solutions. However, it is always a challenge to obtain a UCST polymer that could aggregate at a high temperature at a relatively low concentration and also efficiently bind with proteins. In this work, a UCST polymer reactive with proteins was designed, and its temperature responsiveness and protein-capture ability were investigated in detail. The polymer was synthesized by the reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of acrylamide (AAm) and N-acryloxysuccinimide (NAS). Interestingly, taking advantage of the partial hydrolysis of NAS into acrylic acid (AAc), the obtained P(AAm-co-NAS-co-AAc) polymer exhibited an excellent UCST behavior and possessed good protein-capture ability. It showed a relatively higher Tcₚ (81 °C) at a lower concentration (0.1 wt %) and quickly formed polymer–protein hybrids with high protein loading and without losing protein bioactivity, and both the polymer and polymer–protein nanoparticles showed good cytocompatibility. All the findings are attributed to the unique structure of the polymer, which provided not only the strong and stable hydrogen bonds but also the quick and mild reactivity. The work offers an easy and mild strategy for polymer–protein hybridization directly in aqueous solutions, which may find applications in biomedical fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aacrylic acid 3abioactive properties 3ahybridization 3ahydrogen 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophilicity 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aLu, Jianlei1 aLi, Chen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8444-87391 aTian, Yueyi1 aLiu, Kang1 aLiu, Lingrong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9152-77371 aZhao, Chuanzhuang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5899-31431 aZhang, Mingming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8286-61980 tBiomacromolecules.g2022 Jan. 20, v. 23, no. 3 p.1291-1301dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c015203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245011400157500001400271520143500285592002801720650002101748650002601769650002601795650001701821650001001838650002201848650001501870650001401885650001401899650001401913651002101927700002001948700002001968700001901988773012102007856007502128852000902203655001202212IND60721552520221119105116.0201224e20201209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072155252DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101223462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Koeun 10aVirulence Variation of Salmonella Gallinarum Isolates through SpvB by CRISPR Sequence Subtyping, 2014 to 2018  aNAL-light  aSalmonella Gallinarum is a Gram-negative bacteria that causes fowl typhoid, a septicemic disease with high morbidity and mortality that affects all ages of chickens. Although vaccines and antimicrobials have been used nationwide to eradicate the disease, the malady is still prevalent in Korea. In this study, we investigated the virulence and genetic variation of 116 S. Gallinarum isolates from laying hens between 2014 and 2018. A total of 116 isolates were divided into five Gallinarum Sequence Types (GST) through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) subtyping method. The GSTs displayed changes over time. The 116 isolates showed no difference in virulence gene distribution, but the polyproline linker (PPL) length of the SpvB, one of the virulence factors of Salmonella spp., served as an indicator of S. Gallinarum pathogenicity. The most prevalent PPL length was 22 prolines (37.9%). The shortest PPL length (19 prolines) was found only in isolates from 2014 and 2015. However, the longest PPL length of 24 prolines appeared in 2018. This study indicates that PPLs of S. Gallinarum in Korea tend to lengthen over time, so the pathogenic potency of the bacteria is increasing. Moreover, the transition of GST was associated with PPL length extension over time. These results indicate that surveillance of changing GST and PPL length are necessary in the monitoring of S. Gallinarum isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR sequences 3aSalmonella Gallinarum 3aanti-infective agents 3afowl typhoid 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3amonitoring 3amorbidity 3amortality 3avirulence 3aKorean Peninsula1 aYoon, Sunghyun 1 aKim, Yeong  Bin1 aLee, Young  Ju0 tAnimals.g2020 Dec. 09, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101223463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008900169520112000258592002801378650001501406650001401421650001401435650002601449650001801475650001301493650001501506650000901521650001601530650001701546650001301563650001601576653002501592653002901617653002801646653003501674653002501709700001701734700001401751700001701765700001401782700001501796773010801811856008601919852000902005655001202014IND60697800620221122232925.0200726e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069780062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1165312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Weihong10aFe3O4/carbonized cellulose micro-nano hybrid for high-performance microwave absorber  aA novel microwave absorber of Fe₃O₄/carbonized cellulose micro-nano hybrid with self-assembly porous structure has been fabricated through a facile process of loading of hydrolyzed Fe³⁺ polymers, freeze drying and annealing. Annealing temperature has effect on the microstructural defects and growth of Fe₃O₄ and graphite nanocrystals, and further affects the dielectric properties of Fe₃O₄/carbonized cellulose micro-nano hybrid. The Fe₃O₄/carbonized cellulose micro-nano hybrid annealed at 700 ℃ (FC-700) presents the most excellent microwave absorption properties. The effective adsorption bandwidth of FC-700 reaches up to 6.72 GHz with the thickness of 2.3 mm. The minimum reflection loss of FC-700 reaches −42.25 dB in frequency of 12.27 GHz. The delta-function method proves the Fe₃O₄/carbonized cellulose micro-nano hybrid has good impedance match with the free space. Cole-Cole plots validate the polarization relaxation.

Three blocks of synthetic cortical bone were used for osteotomy procedures. Three groups were created: control group 1 (Con1), where a conical multiple drill system with a conventional external irrigation system was used; control group 2 (Con2), where a single bur with a conventional external irrigation system was used; and, test group (Test), where the new single bur (turbo drill) with a new irrigation system was used. Twenty osteotomies were made without irrigation and with intense irrigation, for each group. A thermocouple was used to measure the temperature produced during the osteotomies. The measured temperature were: 28.9 ± 1.68 °C for group Con1; 27.5 ± 1.32 °C for group Con2; 26.3 ± 1.28 °C for group Test. Whereas, the measured temperatures with irrigation were: 23.1 ± 1.27 °C for group Con1; 21.7 ± 1.36 °C for group Con2; 19.4 ± 1.29 °C for group Test.

Hollow and porous NMNSs possess generally prominent advantages over their solid counterparts due to their unordinary structural features. In this work, we describe a facial one-pot synthesis of hollow and porous Pd–Cu alloy nanospheres (Pd–Cu HPANSs) through a polyethylenimine (PEI)-assisted oxidation–dissolution mechanism. The strong coordination interaction between Cuᴵᴵ and PEI facilitates the oxidation–dissolution of the Cu₂O nanospheres template under air conditions, which is responsible for the generation of the Pd–Cu alloy and the convenient removal of the Cu₂O nanospheres template at room temperature. Compared to the commercial Pd black, the Pd–Cu HPANSs show remarkably improved catalytic activity for the reduction of K₂Cr₂O₇ by HCOOH at room temperature, attributing to the enhanced catalytic activity of the Pd–Cu HPANSs for the dehydrogenation decomposition of HCOOH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aambient temperature 3acatalytic activity 3achromium 3acuprous oxide 3adehydrogenation 3aformic acid 3ananospheres 3apolyethyleneimine 3asynthesis 0aPd−Cu alloy 0ahollow and porous nanospheres 0acatalysis 0aformic acid decomposition 0aCr(VI) reduction1 aBai, Juan1 aLiu, Huimin,1 aZeng, Jing-Hui1 aJiang, Jia-Xing1 aChen, Yu1 aLee, Jong Min,0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Nov. 16, v. 8, no. 45 p.30948-30955dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b103433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03660naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012700175300001600302500001500318520184700333592002802180650002002208650001202228650002302240650002402263650001002287650001202297650001602309650001602325650001502341650001002356650002602366650002002392650002902412650000802441650001102449650001402460650001402474650001902488650001802507651001702525653003702542653001502579653000902594653001702603653003702620653001302657700002202670700002302692700002202715700002102737700001702758700002302775700002402798700001802822773008902840856008402929852000903013655001203022IND60544869120221117223846.0160901e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054486912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2015.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlghamdi, Mansour A.10aUrinary metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Saudi Arabian schoolchildren in relation to sources of exposure  ap. 495-501.  a2019-12-06  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contain a number of known carcinogenic compounds, and urinary biomarkers have been widely used as a measure of exposure but quantitative relationships with exposure variables have proved elusive. This study aimed to quantify the relationship between exposures to phenanthrene and pyrene from atmospheric and dietary sources with the excretion of 1-hydroxypyrene and hydroxyphenanthrenes in urine as biomarkers of exposure. The study population consisted of 204 male schoolchildren attending three schools in different parts of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia who provided urine samples on each of three consecutive days. Outdoor air measurements of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were made at the schools and the children provided information on diet, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and incense, and various lifestyle factors through a questionnaire. Mixed models with random effects for subjects nested within site were fitted in order to examine the relationship between exposure variables and urinary PAH metabolites. A unit increase (1ngm−3) in ambient pyrene (particulate plus gaseous phase) was associated with a 3.5% (95% CI: 1.01%, 5.13%) increase in urinary 1-hydroxypyrene concentration. A unit increase in ambient phenanthrene was associated with a 1.01% (95% CI: 0.03%, 2.02%) increase in total hydroxyphenanthrene concentrations. Consumption of chargrilled food increased the 1-hydroxypyrene and hydroxyphenanthrene concentrations by 24% (95% CI: 11%, 37%) and 17% (95% CI: 8%, 26%) respectively. We did not find evidence of association for environmental tobacco smoke exposure or incense burning. It is concluded that both respiratory exposure and consumption of chargrilled food are considerable sources of PAH exposure in this population as reflected by concentrations of urinary biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aschool children 3aschools 3aat-risk population 3ainhalation exposure 3aurine 3aburning 3acarcinogens 3ametabolites 3abiomarkers 3amales 3anutrition information 3asmoking (habit) 3adietary nutrient sources 3aair 3amodels 3alifestyle 3aexcretion 3aquestionnaires 3aphenanthrenes 3aSaudi Arabia 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aAtmosphere 0aDiet 0aphenanthrene 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aExposure1 aAlam, Mohammed S.1 aStark, Christopher1 aMohammed, Nuredin1 aHarrison, Roy M.1 aShamy, Magdy1 aKhoder, Mamdouh I.1 aShabbaj, Ibrahim I.1 aGöen, Thomas0 tEnvironmental Research.g2015 July, v. 140 p.495-501dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2015.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011100173300001600284520128700300592002801587650003401615650001901649650002501668650001701693650001701710650001401727650001501741650001601756650001501772650002001787650001401807650001501821650001801836653002501854653000901879653002101888653002201909653004801931700001901979700001601998700002102014700002802035700002002063700002302083700002402106700001902130773010102149856008602250852000902336655001202345IND60782839720221121042123.0220830e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078283972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2022.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThi, Tran Thi Van10aPhenolic content and antioxidant activity of Ophiocordyceps Sobolifera extract for renal injury prevention  ap. 322-329.  aIn vitro and in vivo antioxidant activities of the Vietnam-grown Ophiocordyceps sobolifera were investigated for the first time.

The conventional biodiesel process involves oil extraction, refining and transesterification. Alternatively, transesterification can actually be performed directly from the oil-bearing materials without prior extraction. This route which is often termed “reactive extraction” or “in situ transesterification” has the advantages of simplifying the biodiesel production process as well as potentially reducing production cost. In this study, the reactive extraction of rapeseed with methanol has been characterised. The effects of process parameters on the yield, conversion and reaction rate differ substantially from conventional transesterification due to the dependence on both extraction and reaction. The rate of ester formation is mainly affected by the catalyst concentration, temperature and particle size while the equilibrium yield largely depends on the solvent to oil molar ratio. A high yield of ester (>85%) can only be achieved at high solvent to oil molar ratios (>475:1). Parametric studies and light microscope images of reactively extracted seed suggested that reactive extraction occurs by transesterification of the oil inside the seed, followed by diffusion of the products into the bulk solvent.  aPublisher supplied data 3amethanol 3acooking fats and oils 3arefining 3acatalysts 3atransesterification 3aparticle size 3aproduction costs 3asolvents 3abiodiesel 3atemperature 3arapeseed 0aAlgae1 aHarvey, Adam P.0 tFuel processing technology.g2012 Oct., v. 102 p.53-60dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2012.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008900164300001800253520206000271592002802331650002202359650002102381650002702402650002602429650002902455650002202484650002802506650002002534650002702554650001502581650001602596650001302612650001802625650001102643650003702654700001802691700001702709700001302726700005102739773012202790856008302912852000902995655001203004IND60770272920221116151414.0220314e20220213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077027292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.1c015322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Zhiyuan10aNano-Antimicrobial Peptides Based on Constitutional Isomerism-Dictated Self-Assembly  ap. 1302-1313.  aSelf-assembly has been identified as an innovative strategy for improving the antimicrobial efficacy and bioavailability of short peptides. However, the detailed molecular information of short peptides linking to the self-assembly structures and antimicrobial activity remains to be more clearly understood. This work reported that the constitutional isomeric sequences of cationic peptides showed a significant impact on their antimicrobial activity. We investigated the self-assembly structures of two constitutional isomeric peptides Ac-RFSFSFR-NH₂ and Ac-SFRFRFS-NH₂, which contained the same serine, alkaline, and phenylalanine residues but in a different order. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that the constitutional isomers self-assembled into different morphologies in an aqueous solution. The sequence with alkaline residues located at both termini of the peptide favored the formation of β-sheet conformation and nanofibers, while irregular nanospheres were observed when positioning the alkaline residues at the center of the isomeric peptide. The ζ-potential measurements showed that the Ac-RFSFSFR-NH₂ nanofibers had a net potential of +17.4 mV, whereas the apparent potential of Ac-SFRFRFS-NH₂ nanospheres dropped steeply to +1.0 mV. These differences of the constitutional isomeric peptides were directly reflected in their antimicrobial activities. In comparison with the peptide Ac-SFRFRFS-NH₂, the constitutional isomer Ac-RFSFSFR-NH₂ exhibited much higher antimicrobial efficacy against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis and Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, several pairs of constitutional isomeric peptides with a similar sequence layout yielded the same outcome. These collective results not only highlight the importance of the isomeric sequence on the antimicrobial efficacy of short peptides but also increase further potential in optimizing the design of self-assembled nano-antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantimicrobial properties 3aaqueous solutions 3aatomic force microscopy 3abioavailability 3aconstitutional isomers 3ananofibers 3ananospheres 3apeptides 3aphenylalanine 3aserine 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLiu, Xiaohuan1 aNie, Junlian1 aZhao, He1 aLi, Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1032-41270 tBiomacromolecules.g2022 Feb. 13, v. 23, no. 3 p.1302-1313dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c015323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03501naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016000168300001600328520171700344592002802061650001302089650001302102650002002115650001502135650001202150650001902162650001802181650001802199650001102217650001102228650001702239650001402256650001502270653000902285653000802294653001002302653000902312653000702321653001102328653000802339653006402347653002302411653001902434653001202453653002002465653001902485700001602504700002002520700002102540700001802561700001802579700001702597700001502614700002102629700001302650773010502663856008602768852000902854655001202863IND60565090120221121021700.0190318e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056509012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.02.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDewandel, B.10aRespective roles of the weathering profile and the tectonic fractures in the structure and functioning of crystalline thermo-mineral carbo-gaseous aquifers  ap. 690-707.  aCrystalline thermo-mineral and carbo-gaseous (CTMCG) hydrosystems are well known for their economic importance in fields such as thermal, spa activities and natural mineral water (NMW) bottling. Such systems are usually associated with strong structural complexity, which is rarely characterised in detail or robustly. This research focuses on a CTMCG hydrosystem associated with a peri-alpine graben. A multidisciplinary approach with a very large set of data and methods – geological modelling with geophysics and geological data from outcrops and several boreholes, hydrodynamic data, hydrochemistry, hydrogeological and geochemical modelling – reveals very novel results and allows a robust conceptual model to be constructed. The aquifer at the origin of the carbo-gaseous natural mineral water is the 100–125m-thick fractured stratiform layer of the weathering profile of the crystalline rock (granite). It forms a rather large and thick inertial aquifer that can be numerically modelled, in a similar fashion to a porous medium. The majority of tectonic faults length act as impervious boundaries that divide this aquifer into around ten elongated compartments that were precisely delineated. These tectonic faults are permeable only along two small areas that were also precisely located. These permeable zones feed some aquifer compartments with deep, highly mineralised carbo-gaseous water, which mixes with “fresher” water and forms the exploited NMW. These results can be generalised and in particular show a strong opposition between low-inertia CTMCG hydrosystems without a subsurface reservoir, as the weathering profile was eroded, and high-inertia hydrosystems such as the one studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abottling 3adata collection 3ageophysics 3agranite 3ahydrochemistry 3ahydrodynamics 3amineral water 3amixing 3amodels 3aporous media 3atectonics 3aweathering 0aBRGM 0aCGG 0aCTMCG 0aEMMA 0aGW 0aMARTHE 0aPCA 0aCrystalline rocks thermo-mineral and carbo-gaseous aquifers 0aWeathering profile 0aDeep fractures 0aGeology 0aHydraulic tests 0aHydrochemistry1 aAlazard, M.1 aLachassagne, P.1 aBailly-Comte, V.1 aCouëffé, R.1 aGrataloup, S.1 aLadouche, B.1 aLanini, S.1 aMaréchal, J.-C.1 aWyns, R.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2017 Apr., v. 547 p.690-707dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.02.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008600176300001600262520114800278536009601426592002801522596008901550650001101639650001301650650002801663650001901691650002901710650001401739650003101753650001701784650001101801650000801812650001801820650000901838650001801847650003701865650002301902650001001925651000901935653001301944653001901957653002001976653001201996700001902008700001702027700002102044700002602065700002402091700001902115773012902134856008602263852000902349655001202358IND60647838520221117224534.0191110e20190519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064783852DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2018.14532972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhaderpoori, Mansour10aHealth risk assessment of fluoride in water distribution network of Mashhad, Iran  ap. 851-862.  aHigh and low levels of fluoride in drinking waters have been considered as a major public health issue in recent years. This cross-sectional study was conducted over five consecutive years (from 2012 to 2016) in the water distribution network of Mashhad city, Iran with the objectives of determining levels of fluoride and to perform health risk assessment among residents in the study area. Water samples were taken from 30 stations and were analyzed using UV-visible spectrophotometer. The mean annual concentrations of fluoride in all stations during five years of consecutive study were lower than the respective maximum permissible limits (1.5 mg/L) in water as regulated by the WHO. The human health risk assessment was performed by calculating the chronic daily intake and hazard quotient (HQ) of fluoride through human oral intake for adults (men and women) and children for each year during a five-year study. Health risk analysis in this study presented that the non-carcinogenic risk associated with fluoride exposure through drinking water in Mashhad was mostly acceptable because the mean HQ values of fluoride were lower than 1.  aThe present work is funded by the Mashhad University of Medical Science, Iran (No. 941370).  aPublisher supplied data  a941370cMashhad University of Medical Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004748 3aadults 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3adrinking water 3aenvironmental assessment 3afluorides 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amen 3apublic health 3arisk 3arisk analysis 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awater distribution 3awomen 3aIran 0afluoride 0adrinking water 0arisk assessment 0aMashhad1 aPaydar, Maryam1 aZarei, Ahmad1 aAlidadi, Hossein1 aNajafpoor, Ali Asghar1 aGohary, Abdol Hamid1 aShams, Mahmoud0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2019 May 19, v. 25, no. 4 p.851-862dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12198x1549-78607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2018.14532973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012500206300001600331520175100347592002802098596004502126650001502171650002202186650001002208650001202218650001102230650001902241650001802260650002202278650001502300650001102315650001902326651002002345700002302365700006302388700007002451700005802521773011402579856008302693852000902776655001202785IND60734249820221121205624.0210731e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073424982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-021-04896-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, W.

Whether such interactions have also resulted in the diversification of the invertebrate fauna, independently of direct associations with plants is, however, not clear. One candidate where this may be the case is the unusually diverse Collembola genus Seira. Including 89 species in the CFR, many of which are localised habitat specialists, this genus includes many species inhabiting the warm, dry fynbos shrubland—a habitat atypical of usually desiccation-sensitive Collembola. Here, we investigate whether desiccation tolerance may have contributed to the considerable diversity of Seira in the CFR. First, we demonstrate, by measuring vapour pressure deficits (VPD) of the species’ microhabitats (fynbos shrubland and moister Afrotemperate Forests), that the fynbos shrublands are dry environments (mean ± S.E. maximum VPD 5.2 ± 0.1 kPa) compared with the Afrotemperate Forest patches (0.3 ± 0.02 kPa) during the summer activity period of Seira. Then we show that Seira species living in these shrublands are more desiccation tolerant (mean ± S.E. survival time at 76% relative humidity: 74.3 ± 3.3 h) than their congeners in the cooler, moister Afrotemperate Forests (34.3 ± 2.8 h), and compared with Collembola species globally (3.7 ± 0.2 h). These results, and a previous demonstration of pronounced thermal tolerance in the fynbos shrubland species, suggest that the diversity of Seira in the CFR is at least partly due to pronounced desiccation and thermal tolerance, which has enabled species in the genus to exploit the hot and dry habitats of the CFR.  aPublisher supplied data  aDP190100341cAustralian Research Council 3aCollembola 3adrought tolerance 3afauna 3aforests 3afynbos 3aheat tolerance 3ainvertebrates 3arelative humidity 3ashrublands 3asummer 3avapor pressure 3aSouthern Africa1 aPhillips, Laura M.1 aTerblanche, John S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9665-94051 aJanion-Scheepers, Charlene1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5942-79121 aChown, Steven,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6069-51050 tOecologia.g2021 Apr., v. 195, no. 4 p.873-885dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-04896-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007900171300001800250520144600268592002801714650001201742650002201754650002501776650001201801650002601813650002201839650001301861650001101874650001601885650000901901650001201910651001001922651001801932700002201950700002301972773012101995856005102116852000902167655001202176IND50087967120221120153452.0140412e20111210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008796712DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2010.5454482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandrasekar, N.10aInvestigation of heavy-mineral deposits using multispectral satellite data  ap. 8641-8655.  aMineral deposit mapping is essential for sustainable and eco-friendly exploitation of natural resources. The south Tamil Nadu coast of India is rich in minerals. Currently the beach sands are extracted for export entirely in raw form without any value addition. Due to unsustainable sand mining, there are negative environment impacts, which lead to various coastal hazards such as erosion, salinization and sea-water intrusion. In order to initiate the focus on mapping of mineral deposits along this area, standardized hyperspectral analysis has been carried out using Landsat satellite data and Environment for Visualising Images (ENVI) software. The selected endmembers are identified by comparing the spectral signatures with predefined spectral plots from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) spectral library. Finally the endmembers are mapped with ENVI's spectral angle mapper (SAM). The minerals which show significant variation in reflectance at different spectral bands can be effectively mapped by using multispectral data. Ground verifications performed to assess the accuracy of classification were mostly in agreement with the obtained results. This study has opened up new areas for inland heavy mineral exploitation and leads to eco-friendly exploitation of natural resources along the study area. It also illustrates the high potential of multispectral satellite data for exploration and mapping of mineral resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental impact 3aexports 3ahyperspectral imagery 3amineral resources 3aminerals 3amining 3areflectance 3asand 3asurveys 3aIndia 3aUnited States1 aMujabar, P.

It has been found that the oxidative reforming of methane is inexpensive alternative route to the conventional steam reforming of methane processes. Also, the potential application of in situ heat integration in the CFFBR is very promising for energy savings. A comparison between co-feed and oxygen distribution configurations is investigated. The performance of the CFFBR with co-feed configuration is profoundly affected by the development of hot spot temperatures along the length of the reactor. The distribution of oxygen mitigates the temperature along the length of the reactor and eliminates the development of hot spot temperatures and reactor thermal runaway. The results show that the combination of oxygen distribution with part of oxygen directly fed into the reactor is efficient configuration for production of hydrogen and produces almost 100% conversion of methane and high yield of hydrogen up to 2.351 at 70% of the dimensionless reactor length. The sensitivity analysis shows that careful selection of the operation conditions is necessary for best reactor performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conservation 3afluidized beds 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amathematical models 3amethane 3aoxygen 3asteam 3atemperature0 tFuel processing technology.g2012 Oct., v. 102 p.73-84dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2012.04.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009300167300001600260520104900276592002801325650001701353650001801370650002301388650001401411650001201425650001501437650002001452651001201472700001901484700001801503700002101521700001601542700002601558700003001584773008401614856008101698852000901779655001201788IND60549780820221123035321.0160908e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054978082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10745-016-9839-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoeliono, Moira10aLocal Governance, Social Networks and REDD+: Lessons from Swidden Communities in Vietnam  ap. 435-448.  aSwidden is often blamed for deforestation but research has shown that these traditional systems can have a role in maintaining and enhancing carbon stocks and therefore could be compatible with efforts such as payments for environmental services (PES) and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) schemes in Vietnam. This would require that PES and REDD+ project developers build on existing local governance structures. In this paper we attempt to understand such structures though analysis of information and resource exchange in two communities in Vietnam, focusing on traditional local governance guiding swidden practices, and mass organisations.Results show a high diversity of formal (government-formed networks) and informal (traditional) swidden governance structures that can be embedded in REDD+ and PES schemes, where geographical accessibility, socio-cultural practices, and capacities of government will also determine which structure will work best for swidden communities to participate in REDD+/PES.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sinks 3adeforestation 3aecosystem services 3aemissions 3aforests 3agovernance 3asocial networks 3aVietnam1 aPham, Thu Thuy1 aLe, Ngoc Dung1 aBrockhaus, Maria1 aWong, Grace1 aKallio, A.

However, little is known about their intestinal microbiota, which might play an indispensable role in shaping the health of their hosts. The aim of this study was to investigate the intestinal bacterial community structure between the two sexes and among three male morphs of O. fallaciosa from China using high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). The gut bacterial community structure was significantly different between males and females, suggesting that sex appeared to be the crucial factor shaping the intestinal bacterial community. Females had higher bacterial alpha-diversity than males. There was little difference in gut bacterial community structure among the three male morphs. However, compared to medium and small males, large individuals were associated with the higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and Firmicutes/Bacteroides (F/B) ratio, which might contribute to nutritional efficiency. Overall, these results might help to further our understanding of beetle–bacterial interactions of O. fallaciosa between the two sexes, and among the three male morphs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aFirmicutes 3aLucanidae 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3afemales 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amales 3asexual dimorphism 3aspecies diversity 3aChina1 aJiang, Yu 1 aCao, Yuyan 1 aSun, Binghua 1 aXiang, Xingjia 0 tAnimals.g2020 Dec. 09, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101223523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245013100170300001600301520166700317592002801984650002302012650003402035650001502069650002502084650001202109650001402121650001302135650001402148650000702162650002302169653001702192653001302209653001402222653001402236653002502250700001502275700001902290700001702309700001402326700001402340700001802354773009002372856009002462852000902552655001202561IND60630135720221121024047.0190325e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063013572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ying10aAdsorption and transformation of thioarsenite at hematite/water interface under anaerobic condition in the presence of sulfide  ap. 422-430.  aThe adsorption behavior of thioarsenite (TAsIII) on the surface of hematite (α-Fe2O3) is unknown at present. In the present study, we have investigated the transformation and reactions of TAsIII [monothioarsenite (MTAsIII) and dithioarsneite (DTAsIII)] on the surface of α-Fe2O3 in the presence of sulfide at S/As = 1 and 3 by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Raman spectroscopy. The adsorption envelopes reveal that the adsorption of TAsIII on α-Fe2O3 is significantly less than that of arsenite (AsIII) in the pH range from 7 to 11 with the initial As concentration of 25 mg L−1. However, at the initial As concentration of 135 mg L−1, the uptake of TAsIII by α-Fe2O3 is higher at pH 7 but lower at pH 8–11 than that of AsIII. The adsorption isotherms show that the adsorption of As on α-Fe2O3 is largely inhibited by the presence of aqueous sulfide at pH 7 with low As equilibrium concentration (<40 mg L−1). Whereas the uptake of As by α-Fe2O3 is highly elevated compared with the value predicted by Langmuir model at pH 7 with high As equilibrium concentration (>40 mg L−1), implying the formation of As-bearing (surface) precipitate. The As and S K-edge XAS as well as Raman spectroscopy confirm the formation of As sulfide precipitate on the surface of α-Fe2O3 in MTAsIII system. It is worth to note that the oxidation of (thio)AsIII occurs on the surface of α-Fe2O3 in DTAsIII system under strictly anaerobic conditions. These results shed new light on the understanding of the interfacial behavior of As and point to the potential implication in immobilization and removal of arsenic in sulfidic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aanaerobic conditions 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3ahematite 3aoxidation 3apH 3asorption isotherms 0aThioarsenite 0aHematite 0aReactions 0aOxidation 0aSulfidic environment1 aLin, Jinru1 aWang, Shaofeng1 aZhang, Danni1 aXiao, Fan1 aWang, Xin1 aJia, Yongfeng0 tChemosphere.g2019 May, v. 222 p.422-430dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.1573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03725naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014400171506011700315506007600432520136600508592002801874506003701902650002701939650003001966650002501996650001702021650001102038650002002049650002402069650001502093650001402108650001702122650000902139653000802148653001002156653001002166653001002176653000702186653000802193653000802201653000802209653000902217653000902226653001002235653000802245653000702253653000902260653000902269653000802278653000802286653000902294653000902303653000802312653000902320653000902329653000802338653000802346653000802354653000802362653000802370653000802378653000802386653000902394653001102403653001402414653000802428653002002436653000902456653002302465653001402488653001702502700002802519700002002547700001802567700002802585700001802613773011302631856008202744852000902826655001202835IND60782840220221207052148.0220809e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078284022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2022.1085342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-Ríos, David10aTuning of fed-batch cultivation of Streptomyces clavuligerus for enhanced Clavulanic Acid production based on genome-scale dynamic modeling  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStreptomyces clavuligerus (S. clavuligerus) is a filamentous Gram-positive bacterial producer of the β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid (CA). Antibiotics biosynthesis and secretion in the Streptomyces genus are closely related with nutritional and environmental perturbations. In this study, the low productivity of CA in wild-type S. clavuligerus was analyzed by implementing a dynamic flux balance approach (dFBA) coupled to a validated genome-scale metabolic network of the organism. The dynamic analysis of fluxes evidenced the key role of the central metabolism (glycolysis, TCA and urea cycles) in regulating the carbon fluxes of the CA biosynthesis. CA production was favored by the fed-batch operation under high shear stress conditions that stimulates the growth rate and the carbon fluxes along the central metabolism. Dynamic experiments in silico allowed to identify potential scenarios of enhanced CA production (up to 2.5-fold higher) by maintaining the conversion rates within the central and secondary metabolism through fed-batch operation. The experimental validation of the most feasible production scenario as identified in silico showed 2.2-fold increase of CA production (equivalent to 0.382 mmol gDCW⁻¹) by using the feeding condition as a mechanism to stimulate the carbon fluxes along the central metabolism and CA biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStreptomyces clavuligerus 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3aclavulanic acid 3acomputer simulation 3aglycolysis 3asecretion 3ashear stress 3aurea 0aARG 0aARGSL 0aARGSS 0aASPTA 0aCA 0aCAR 0aCAR 0aCAS 0aCAsp 0aCEAS 0aCephC 0aCPS 0aCS 0adFBA 0aDHAP 0aFBA 0aFUM 0aG3PD 0aG6PD 0aGAP 0aGAPD 0agDCW 0aGDH 0aIDH 0aMDH 0aODE 0aOTC 0aPDH 0aPYK 0aSUCD 0aSUCOAS 0aTCA cycle 0aTPI 0aClavulanic acid 0aDFBA 0aGenome-scale model 0aFed-batch 0aStreptomyces1 aRamírez-Malule, Howard1 aNeubauer, Peter1 aJunne, Stefan1 aRíos-Estepa, Rigoberto1 aOchoa, Silvia0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2022 July, v. 185 p.108534-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2022.1085343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014000167520099700307592002801304650002101332650002801353650001001381650001401391650002901405650002301434650001701457650001301474650001101487650001801498650001501516650001901531650000901550650002001559650001601579653002001595653002701615700002001642700002001662700001801682700002001700700001801720700001901738700001901757700001701776773010801793856008601901852000901987655001201996IND60697801220221123021833.0200726e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069780122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1165472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYugay, Y.A.10aSynthesis of bioactive silver nanoparticles using alginate, fucoidan and laminaran from brown algae as a reducing and stabilizing agent  aIn this report, polysaccharides – alginate, fucoidan, laminaran – were isolated from marine algae Saccharina cichorioides and Fucus evanescens and their activity as a reducing and stabilizing agents in the biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles was evaluated.

In this study, an efficient and environmentally friendly flocculant was synthesized using a graft copolymerization reaction of dextran and [2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride (METAC). The reaction conditions were optimized at 3 mol/mol METAC/dextran, 60 g/L dextran concentration, 3 h reaction time, 60 ℃ and pH 7. The results of elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, NMR hydrogen spectroscopy (¹H NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and viscosity measurement confirmed that the graft copolymerization reaction was successful. When flocculating a kaolin suspension used as synthetic wastewater, the flocculant showed effective flocculation performance at a low dosage. The results indicate that this cationic polysaccharide flocculant removed 98.2% of the kaolin solid suspended particles. Investigation of the flocculation mechanism showed that the flocculation process consisted of charge neutralization, charge patching and adsorption bridging mechanisms. When flocculating an E. coli culture medium, this flocculant showed high efficiency under acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions. In addition, this flocculant can be easily biodegraded by the enzymatic method. As a biomaterial, this cationic dextran derivative can contribute to future treatment of industrial wastewater and harvesting of microbial cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3abiocompatible materials 3achlorides 3acopolymerization 3aculture media 3adextran 3aenzymatic treatment 3aflocculants 3aflocculation 3ahydrogen 3aindustrial wastewater 3akaolin 3aneutralization 3apH 3athermogravimetry 3aviscosity 3awastewater treatment 0aCationic dextran derivative 0aGraft copolymerization 0aFlocculant 0aFlocculation performance1 aLu, Qi-meng1 aZeng, Tao1 aYang, Jing-wen1 aHu, Xue-qin1 aZhang, Hong-bin0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2022 July, v. 185 p.108535-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2022.1085353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245007500171520113300246592002801379650001301407650001701420650003401437650001801471650001201489650001001501651001201511653001901523653002401542653002601566653003301592653002601625653002901651700006201680700001901742700006201761700002101823773009501844856008401939852000902023655001202032IND60741826420221121130526.0211213e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074182642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1123352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeinrich, Carsten12aA local flexibility market mechanism with capacity limitation services  aLocal flexibility markets have a substantial potential to unlock the flexibility of distributed energy resources in the distribution level. Capacity limitation services have been perceived as one of the most appealing products to be traded in these markets. This work argues why classical market-clearing and pricing mechanisms such as pay-as-bid, uniform pricing and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) are not compatible with a market that trades capacity limitations. As a solution, we propose a local flexibility market mechanism which is built upon an adapted VCG-based auction. The mechanism achieves a trade-off among various desirable economic properties, including budget-balancedness, incentive-compatibility and stability. The suitability of the proposed mechanism is illustrated using a case study which is based on a real medium voltage feeder, located on the Danish island of Bornholm. Results show that aggregators and the distribution system operator benefit from the trade of capacity limitation services. We eventually conclude by providing a set of policy recommendations for the real-life operation of such a market.  aPublisher supplied data 3aauctions 3acase studies 3aelectric potential difference 3aenergy policy 3amarkets 3atrade 3aDenmark 0aAuction design 0aCapacity limitation 0aCongestion management 0aDistributed energy resources 0aDistribution networks 0aLocal flexibility market1 aZiras, Charalampos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1288-091X1 aJensen, Tue V.1 aBindner, Henrik W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1545-69941 aKazempour, Jalal0 tEnergy policy.g2021 Sept., v. 156 p.112335-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1123353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003300144245007600177300002000253520087200273592002801145650001201173650002301185650001401208650001501222650001301237650001301250650001101263653002601274653003301300653002901333653002901362653003001391700001501421700002201436700002201458700001801480700002001498700002101518700002001539773012601559856008001685852000901765655001201774IND60558768620221120113629.0161116e20161116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055876862DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b105702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasikala, Suchithra
Padmajan10aSimultaneous Graphite Exfoliation and N Doping in Supercritical Ammonia  ap. 30964-30971.  aWe report the exfoliation of graphite and simultaneous N doping of graphene by two methods: supercritical ammonia treatment and liquid-phase exfoliation with NH₄OH. While the supercritical ammonia allowed N doping at a level of 6.4 atom % in 2 h, the liquid-phase exfoliation with NH₄OH allowed N doping at a level of 2.7 atom % in 6 h. The N doped graphene obtained via the supercritical ammonia route had few layers (<5) and showed large lateral flake size (∼8 μm) and low defect density (ID/IG < 0.6) in spite of their high level of N doping. This work is the first demonstration of supercritical ammonia as an exfoliation agent and N doping precursor for graphene. Notably, the N doped graphene showed electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction with high durability and good methanol tolerance compared to those of commercial Pt/C catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aammonium hydroxide 3acatalysts 3adurability 3agraphene 3amethanol 3aoxygen 0asupercritical ammonia 0ain situ N doping of graphene 0aliquid-phase exfoliation 0aelectrochemical catalyst 0aoxygen reduction reaction1 aHuang, Kai1 aGiroire, Baptiste1 aPrabhakaran, Prem1 aHenry, Lucile1 aPenicaud, Alain1 aPoulin, Philippe1 aAymonier, Cyril0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Nov. 16, v. 8, no. 45 p.30964-30971dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b105703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245010600208300001600314520167600330592002802006650001002034650002002044650002402064650001502088650002902103650002102132650002202153650001802175650001802193650001502211653001102226653001402237653001502251653001502266653002702281653002102308700001402329700001502343700005502358773010002413856008602513852000902599655001202608IND60527125320221120034526.0190412e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052712532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.01.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVermeiren, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3541-594610aHierarchical toolbox: Ensuring scientific accuracy of citizen science for tropical coastal ecosystems  ap. 242-250.  aIncreased human population growth threatens the ecological functioning and goods and services provided by tropical coastal ecosystems. However, a lack of scientific baselines and resources hamper efforts to develop and monitor ecological indicators of environmental change. Citizen science can provide a cost and time effective solution, but needs considerable context specific development to ensure it provides valid information of the quality level required for acceptance by the scientific community. We reviewed the use of sampling methods for shore crabs as an example of an abundant tropical coastal organism with high citizen science suitability and ecological indicator capacity. We propose a hierarchical toolbox based on the distinction between rapid methods, allowing fast, noninvasive sampling by independent citizens, and medium speed methods allowing detailed but more invasive sampling requiring trained citizens working in close interaction with professionals. The hierarchical structure enables full use of the large scale data collection ability of citizen scientists at lower levels, while ensuring validation of errors at higher levels. Additionally, at each level, bias reduction and data validation measures can be employed. We conclude that citizen science methodologies can provide accurate large scale data to develop the ecological baselines urgently needed to monitor and manage environmental change in many tropical coastal ecosystems. We discuss a stepwise implementation of the toolbox leading to accuracy metadata which can be independently reviewed as an ultimate accuracy assessment and data integration mechanism among multiple projects.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrabs 3adata collection 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental indicators 3ahuman population 3apopulation growth 3aprofessionals 3arapid methods 3ascientists 0aReview 0aFramework 0aMonitoring 0aIndicators 0aParticipatory research 0aSampling methods1 aMunoz, C.1 aZimmer, M.1 aSheaves, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0662-34390 tEcological indicators.g2016 July, v. 66 p.242-250dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.01.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002100146245015500167300001400322520176800336592002802104650001102132650001802143650001802161650002702179650001102206650001502217650001202232650002902244650001302273650002102286650000902307650002202316650001102338650001002349650001002359650001102369700001702380700001502397700002002412700001602432773010302448856008202551852000902633655001202642IND4471502120221121041235.0150812e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447150212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2012.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Connor, P.J.14aThe effect of the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) on herbage production when applied at different times and rates in the autumn and winter  ap. 79-89.  aThe high rate of urine excreted during animal grazing in late autumn provides a source of nitrogen (N) to the growing sward and also provides the potential for losses of N over the winter months. This study was established to evaluate the potential of applying a nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), to urine patches to increase N use efficiency in grassland. Four simulated grazing plot experiments were undertaken across two experimental sites, one a free-draining acid brown earth (Experiments 1 and 3) and the other a moderate to heavy brown earth soil (Experiments 2 and 4). Experiments 1 and 2 received no fertiliser N application, and Experiments 3 and 4 received a split application of 350kgN fertiliser ha⁻¹year⁻¹. The effect of applying the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) at 5 or 10kgDCDha⁻¹ in autumn and winter to plots receiving synthetic urine or zero urine on spring and annual herbage production was examined in all experiments. The application of DCD did not increase spring herbage production in any of the experiments. Over the two years, the application of 5 or 10kgDCDha⁻¹ increased annual herbage production in Experiment 1 when applied to October and November deposited urine patches. Urine application increased herbage production in spring and annually in Experiments 1 and 2, and increased herbage crude protein content and herbage N uptake in all experiments. The application of urine increased soil ammonium and TON content in the 0–100mm horizon at both sites. The application of 10kgDCDha⁻¹ reduced surplus N in Experiment 1 when applied to October and November deposited urine. Overall the effects of DCD on herbage production, surplus N and other parameters in this study were not consistent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3acrude protein 3adicyandiamide 3afertilizer application 3aforage 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3asoil 3asplit application 3aspring 3asward 3aurine 3awinter1 aHennessy, D.1 aBrophy, C.1 aO’Donovan, M.1 aLynch, M.B.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2012 May 1, v. 152 p.79-89dElsevier B.V.x0167-88097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2012.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04871naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010300164300001600267520299400283592002803277650001103305650002303316650000903339650001603348650001603364650002103380650001903401650001603420650000903436650002203445650002103467650001803488650002203506650001303528650001703541650001403558650001103572650002903583650002103612650001303633650002003646650002303666650001203689650001303701650002603714650001903740650001003759650001103769650001603780650001603796651001003812700001703822700001703839700001503856700001903871700001703890700001603907700001803923700001703941773013603958856008204094852000904176655001204185IND60516028720221117160115.0190727e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051602872DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596140002402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aARIAS, R. A.10aEstimating enteric methane emissions from Chilean beef fattening systems using a mechanistic model  ap. 114-123.  aA mechanistic model (COWPOLL) was used to estimate enteric methane (CH₄) emissions from beef production systems in Chile. The results expressed as a proportion of gross energy intake (GEI) were compared with enteric fermentation data reported in the last Chilean greenhouse gases inventory, which utilized an earlier the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 2 approach. The simulation analysis was based on information from feedstuffs, dry matter intake (DMI), body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) of steers raised and finished at two research facilities located in Central and Southern Chile, as well as three simulated scenarios for grass-based finishing systems in Southern Chile. Data for feedlot production systems in the central region were assessed by considering steers fed a forage : concentrate ratio of 23 : 77 using maize silage and wheat straw as roughage sources during the stages of backgrounding and fattening. Average DMI were 7·3±0·62 and 9·2±0·55 kg/day per steer for backgrounding and fattening, respectively, whereas ADG were 1·1±0·22 and 1·3±0·37 kg/day for backgrounding and fattening. For the Southern Chilean fattening production systems, the forage : concentrate ratio was 56 : 44 with ryegrass pasture as the sole forage source. In this case, average DMI was 9·97±0·51 and ADG was 1·1±0·24 kg/day per steer. Two of the grass-based scenarios used the same initial BW information as that used for the Central and Southern Chilean systems, but feedlot diets were replaced by ryegrass pasture. The third grass-based scenario used an initial BW of 390 kg. In all the grass-based scenarios an ADG of 0·90 kg/day, with maximum DMI estimated as a proportion of BW (0·01 of NDF, kg/kg BW), was assumed. The results of the simulation analysis showed that emission factors (Y ₘ; fraction of GEI) ranged from 0·062 to 0·079 of GEI. Smaller values were associated with finishing systems that included a lower proportion of forage in the diet due to higher propionate production, which serves as a sink for hydrogen in the rumen. Cattle finished in feedlot systems had an average of 0·062 of GEI lost as CH₄, whereas grass-based cattle had losses of 0·079 of GEI. Enteric CH₄ emissions for the systems using grass-based and concentrate diets were 261 and 159 g/kg weight gain, respectively. The Chilean CH₄ inventory employs a fixed Y ₘ of 0·060 to estimate enteric fermentation for all cattle. This value is lower than the average Y ₘ obtained in the current simulation analysis (0·071 of GEI), which results in underestimation of enteric CH₄ emissions from beef cattle. However, these results need to be checked against field measurements of CH₄ emissions. Implementation of mechanistic models in the preparation of national greenhouse gas inventories is feasible if appropriate information is provided, allowing dietary characteristics and regional particularities to be taken into consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium 3aaverage daily gain 3abeef 3abeef cattle 3abody weight 3acarbon footprint 3aclimate change 3acorn silage 3adiet 3adry matter intake 3aemissions factor 3aenergy intake 3afeed concentrates 3afeedlots 3afermentation 3afinishing 3aforage 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrogen 3ameat production 3amechanistic models 3amethane 3apastures 3aproduction technology 3apropionic acid 3arumen 3asteers 3aweight gain 3awheat straw 3aChile1 aCATRILEO, A.1 aLARRAÍN, R.1 aVéra, R.,1 aVELÁSQUEZ, A.1 aTONEATTI, M.1 aFrance, J.,1 aDijkstra, J.,1 aKebreab, E.,0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2015 Jan., v. 153, no. 1 p.114-123dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46135x1469-51467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596140002403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013800169300001600307520114400323592002801467650002601495650001101521650001701532650001001549650001001559650000901569650003201578651001901610653002001629653001701649653001001666653003201676653000801708653001301716700002201729700002101751700001701772700001501789700002201804773009601826856008301922852000902005655001202014IND60480004120221118053921.0160124e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048000412DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.41.2012.3.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠťástková, Z.10aDetection of enterotoxigenic genes in <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> isolated from bulk tank cow’s milk samples in the Czech Republic  ap. 327-333.  aMilk and dairy products can be frequently contaminated with enterotoxigenic <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> which is often involved in staphylococcal food poisoning. The aims of this study were to study the occurrence of <i>S. aureus</i> in bulk tank milk samples and to test their potential to produce staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs). A total of 511 bulk tank milk samples were collected from 305 farms in 9 different regions of the Czech Republic. <i>S. aureus</i> was detected in 199 (38.9%) samples. The <i>S. aureus</i> positivity rates varied with sample origin (farm) and ranged from 0 to 67%. The potential to produce enterotoxins A-J was confirmed in 89 (44.7%) of 199 <i>S. aureus</i> isolates. The most commonly detected genes were <i>seg</i> (35.2%) and <i>sei</i> (31.7%). Both genes were detected in 23% of the isolates. Other genes detected were <i>seb</i> (in 5.0% of enterotoxin-positive isolates), <i>seh</i> (5.0%), <i>sed</i> (4.0%), <i>sec</i> (2.5%) and <i>sej</i> (0.5%). The variation in the rates of toxigenic isolates can be attributed primarily to the colonization of farms by specific clones of <i>S. aureus</i>.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aclones 3aenterotoxins 3afarms 3agenes 3amilk 3astaphylococcal intoxication 3aCzech Republic 0aprevalence rate 0adairy plants 0afarms 0astaphylococcal intoxication 0aPCR 0agenotype1 aKarpíšková, R.1 aGelbíčová, T.1 aVaňáč, V.1 aTůma, Š.1 aSvětlíková, B.0 tActa alimentaria.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 41, no. 3 p.327-333dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.41.2012.3.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01629naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245004600182300001800228520051700246592002800763650001900791650001400810650002300824650002300847653001900870653002000889653001300909653002700922653003000949700005700979700006201036773008801098856008401186852000901270655001201279IND60529304120221120135212.0161019e20160518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052930412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia Barrantes, Pedro M.,10aTotal synthesis of actinophenanthroline A  ap. 2194-2196.  aIn this Letter, we describe the first total synthesis of actinophenanthroline A, an alkaloid from a marine actinobacterium with an unprecedented 1,7-phenanthroline core, that has been achieved.

We assessed the arm growth response of the echinopluteus larva of Heliocidaris tuberculata to simultaneous exposure to these stressors in cross-factorial experiments involving ambient and near future temperatures (control −20°C; +4°C: 24°C) and pHNIST levels (control: pH8.1; −3–7pH units: pH7.6–7.8). The more extreme pH treatment, pH7.4, not a near-future condition, was used to assess tolerance levels. Experiments were designed with respect to present day conditions determined for the habitat of H. tuberculata and future (2100+) conditions for the southeast Australia global warming hot spot. Across near future warming-acidification treatments (24°C/pH7.6–7.8) there was a 5–25% decrease in normal development and, at pH7.4, this increased to 11–33%. Increased temperature facilitated larval growth across all pH treatments with a 20–50% increase in arm length at +4°C across all pH levels. Larval growth was strongly reduced by acidification with a 15–25% decrease in arm length at pH7.4–7.6 at control temperature. Warming mitigated the effect of pH on growth. Both stressors increased larval abnormality and asymmetry. The stunting effect of decreased pH on larval growth is typical of echinoplutei, indicating that similar mechanisms operate across species. The large proportion of normal and larger larvae in the +4°C/pH7.8 treatments indicate that H. tuberculata may tolerate near-future ocean change and this may be facilitated by acclimatization or adaption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinoidea 3aacclimation 3aacidification 3aglobal warming 3agrowth retardation 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3alarvae 3alarval development 3apH 3atemperature 3aAustralia 0aCalcifying larvae 0aEchinopluteus 0aGlobal change 0aOcean acidification 0aOcean warming1 aFoo, Shawna1 aSoars, Natalie A.1 aWolfe, Kennedy D.L.1 aNguyen, Hong D.1 aHardy, Natasha1 aDworjanyn, Symon A.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2013 Oct., v. 448 p.250-257dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2013.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010900173300001400282520110800296592002801404650001201432650001101444650001801455650001001473650001601483650004401499650001301543653001701556653002101573653002201594653002201616653002001638700002601658700002001684700002101704700002401725700002101749773010601770856008601876852000901962655001201971IND60540910120221116204137.0190318e20151020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054091012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.05.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriotti, Josefina10aFirst solid-state NMR spectroscopy evaluation of complexes of benznidazole with cyclodextrin derivatives  ap. 90-97.  aComplexation of benznidazole (BZL), a drug of choice for the treatment of Chagas’neglected disease, with cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives was analyzed by solid-state NMR. 13C cross polarization/magic angle spinning spectra were recorded from BZL and from BZL:β-CD, BZL:methyl β-CD and BZL:hydroxypropyl β-CD complexes, which were obtained by the solvent evaporation technique. No significant evidence was obtained on BZL inclusion complexes involving either β-CD or hydroxypropyl β-CD. Conversely, BZL:methyl β-CD displayed BZL resonances characteristic of an amorphous drug and data analysis confirmed the presence of stable BZL:methyl β-CD inclusion complexes, with benzene encapsulated into the host cavity. Further evidences on complex structure and dynamics were obtained from proton and carbon spin–lattice relaxation times in the rotating frame. These data are consistent with a common guest–host spin reservoir. The BZL interaction with methyl β-CD provided a route to stabilize amorphous BZL. Physical mixtures with identical BZL and CD compositions were also studied for comparison.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3acarbon 3acyclodextrins 3adrugs 3aevaporation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolvents 0aBenznidazole 0aβ-Cyclodextrins 0aInclusion complex 0aChagas’ disease 0aSolid-state NMR1 aFerreira, M.

Direct occupational livestock contact is the principal risk factor for human MRSA CC398 infection. Nonetheless, in recent years, an increasing number of MRSA CC398 cases has been observed in persons without known pig contact. Such cases, referred to as MRSA CC398 of unknown origin (MUO CC398), have, like livestock‐onset (LO) MRSA CC398 cases, been found concentrated in rural, livestock‐producing areas. The presence of MUO CC398 cases indicates alternative and unknown MRSA CC398 transmission pathways into the community. We performed a nationwide study in Denmark of the geographic distributions of MRSA cases in general and persons with MUO CC398 or LO MRSA CC398 infections (1 January 2006–11 February 2015), with the Danish population as background population. Place of living of study persons was mapped using the ArcGIS software, and information on pig farms was retrieved from the Central Husbandry Register. The incidence of MUO CC398 infections was clearly higher in rural than in urban areas, and such cases lived on average closer to pig farms than the general population. However, within three pig‐farming‐dense municipalities, patients with MUO CC398 infections did not live closer to pig farms than population controls. This shows that direct environmental spread from neighbouring pig farms of MRSA CC398 is unlikely. Instead, community spread through other means of transmission than direct spread from farms may more likely explain the clustering of MUO CC398 in livestock‐dense areas.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomputer software 3afarms 3ageographic information systems 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3alivestock and meat industry 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3apatients 3arisk factors 3aswine 3aurban areas 3aDenmark1 aKoch, A.1 aEthelberg, S.1 aMølbak, K.1 aLarsen, J.1 aJepsen, M.

The solar dryer evaluated has the option of working as an indirect-direct dryer (mixed solar dryer, MSD) or in indirect solar dryer mode (ISD), since the drying chamber has a mobile opaque cover. The energy efficiency, drying efficiency, and the drying kinetics were the evaluation criteria for thermal performance of the dryer during the drying of tomato. During the experiments, the temperature inside the drying chamber at solar noon was in a range of 65˚C-70 °C operating in MSD and 55˚C-60 °C in ISD. The results showed that drying the tomato in ISD (26 h) took longer than the MSD (17 h). The efficiency of the solar collector was between 52.30% and 55.45%. The overall dryer efficiency in MSD and ISD mode were between 10.66% and 8.80% respectively, while the drying efficiency was in a range of 5.47% and 4.48%, respectively. The experimental data of the tomato drying kinetics were adjusted to five different mathematical models; the Modified Henderson & Pabis model showed the better fit with an r2 of 0.9888 and 0.9996 and an RMSE of 0.0027 and 0.008 for the MSD and ISD respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3adrying 3aenergy efficiency 3amathematical models 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar collectors 3atemperature 3atomatoes 0aSolar energy 0aSolar drying 0aThermal performance 0aDrying efficiency 0aDrying kinetics 0aTomato1 aAna Lilia, César-Munguía1 aOctavio, García-Valladares1 aIsaac, Pilatowsky Figueroa1 aRogelio, Brito Orosco0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Mar., v. 147 p.845-855dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245012200197300001600319500001400335500002000349520131800369592002801687650002601715650002401741650000901765650001301774650001601787650001601803650001401819700006601833700006601899700001701965700002601982700002002008773013502028856007302163852000902236655001202245IND60700660120221118224021.0200702e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070066012DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.125532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalinas, Paulo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2273-090410aAnatomy, Morphometry and Radiography in the thoracic limb bones of the Patagonian Huemul Deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus)  ap. 494-501.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this study was to provide morphometric, anatomic and radiographic data of the thoracic limb bones of the Patagonian Huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) including a functional interpretation of this, as a reference for clinical use, biomedical research and teaching purposes. Currently, the Patagonian huemul deer is in danger of becoming extinct due to multiple causes. Research carried out for its conservation has focused mainly on its ecology and pathology, leaving gaps in biological knowledge, which is basic and important for its comprehension. This study was conducted to reveal the gross osteology and radiology features of the thoracic limb bones of the Patagonian huemul deer. The osteological findings suggest the presence of powerful flexor muscles in the scapulohumeral and elbow joints, useful to cushion the jumps. Also, the principal nutrient foramen of Patagonian huemul differs in position with respect to domestic ungulates, which may be important to consider during surgical procedures. Finally, the radiographic data can provide new information about the tissue loading conditions in Patagonian huemul, so that this new knowledge can be of great importance for a better understanding of mechanically induced or adaptive changes in bone produced by habitat or other ecological phenomena.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHippocamelus bisulcus 3abiomedical research 3adeer 3ahabitats 3amorphometry 3aradiography 3aradiology1 aNúñez‐Cook, Samuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3778-68121 aArenas‐Caro, Abigail1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1268-87331 aMoreno, Luis1 aCurihuentro, Escarlet1 aVidal, Fernando0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2020 July, v. 49, no. 4 p.494-501dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.125533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008600176300001600262520105900278592002801337650002701365650001701392650001201409650001401421650002101435650001301456650001301469650000901482650002501491650001901516653001201535653000901547653001401556653001501570653001301585700001901598700002501617773012201642856008501764852000901849655001201858IND60586534620221120053307.0171213e20171002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058653462DNAL7 a10.1080/00288233.2017.13630582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelliher, Francis M.10aSuperphosphate fertiliser application and cadmium accumulation in a pastoral soil  ap. 404-422.  aAt Winchmore, single superphosphate fertiliser has been applied annually to grazed pasture plots since 1949. To determine whether or not cadmium (Cd) in the fertiliser had accumulated in the soil, samples were collected at intervals (0–0.075, 0.075–0.15, 0.15–0.25, 0.25–0.50, 0.50–0.75 and 0.75 –1.00 m) to a depth of 1 m, the Cd concentration and bulk density measured and Cd density calculated. The relationship between Cd density and depth was curvilinear and the slope or curvature increased with increasing fertiliser application rate. Nearly 100% of the Cd stock was located in a depth of 0–0.5 m and 36% in the uppermost 0.075 m depth. Leaching calculations using Burn’s equation accurately estimated the measured Cd stock’s vertical distribution. Estimating the inputs to soils from fertiliser and atmospheric deposition and the loss by leaching and outwash accounted for the measured Cd stock. We concluded Cd accumulated in these soils at a rate determined by the fertiliser’s Cd concentration and application rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3abulk density 3acadmium 3aequations 3afertilizer rates 3aleaching 3apastures 3asoil 3aspatial distribution 3asuperphosphate 0aCadmium 0asoil 0aphosphate 0afertiliser 0aleaching1 aGray, Colin W.1 aNoble, Alasdair D.L.0 tNew Zealand journal of agricultural research.g2017 Oct. 2, v. 60, no. 4 p.404-422dTaylor & Francisx1175-87757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288233.2017.13630583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01416naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245007600166300001800242520043800260592002800698650002200726650002700748650001100775650004400786700002400830700002000854700002200874773013400896856007501030852000901105655001201114IND60767633720221118225342.0220220e20220217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076763372DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc07060f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZurakowski, Joseph A.10aBis(1-bora-4-phosphorinane) ring closure at Cp*M (M = Fe, Co) complexes  ap. 2500-2503.  aBis(1-bora-4-phosphorinane) metal complexes have been synthesized using a Cp*M-protecting (M = FeᴵᴵCl, Coᴵ, Cp* = C₅Me₅⁻) strategy and structurally authenticated by NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction.

Thiol-derivatization was confirmed by Fourier-transformed infra-red spectroscopy. Xanthan–mercaptopropionic acid conjugate and xanthan–thioglycolic acid conjugate were found to possess 432.68mM and 465.02mM of thiol groups as determined by Ellman's method respectively. Comparative evaluation of mucoadhesive property of metronidazole loaded buccal pellets of xanthan and thiolated xanthan gum using chicken buccal pouch membrane revealed higher ex vivo bioadhesion time of thiolated xanthan gum as compared to xanthan gum. Improved mucoadhesive property of thiolated xanthan gum over the xanthan gum can be attributed to the formation of disulfide bond between mucus and thiolated xanthan gum. In vitro release study conducted using phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) revealed a sustained release profile of metronidazole from thiolated xanthan pellets as compared to xanthan pellets. In conclusion, thiolation of xanthan improves its mucoadhesive property and sustained the release of metronidazole over a prolonged period.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffers 3achickens 3aderivatization 3adisulfide bonds 3aesterification 3ametronidazole 3amucus 3apH 3apellets 3aphosphates 3apolymers 3aspectroscopy 3athiols 3axanthan gum 0aXanthan gum 0aThiolation 0aMucoadhesion 0aBuccal pellets1 aAhuja, Munish1 aMehta, Heena0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Oct. 20, v. 131 p.119-124dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.05.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01415naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245006900164300001800233520035800251592002800609650001400637650001600651650002700667700002800694700002300722700002100745700002400766700001800790700002200808700002900830773013400859856007500993852000901068655001201077IND60767633820221118225308.0220220e20220217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076763382DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc07075d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogucka-Kocka, Anna10aNematicidal activity of naphthalimide–boron cluster conjugates  ap. 2528-2531.  aThis study presents the activity of a series of 1,8-naphthalimide–carborane/metallacarborane conjugates against Rhabditis sp.

This study examined the characterization of original metal-free peat humin (HM), and HM treated with varying concentrations of H₂O₂ and L-ascorbic acid (VC) (assigned as H₂O₂-HM and VC-HM). The concentration of PFRs in HM increased with the addition of VC/H₂O₂ at concentrations less than 0.08 mol/L. The evolution of PFRs in HM under different environmental conditions (e.g., oxic/anoxic and humidity) was investigated. Two types of PFRs were detected in HM: a relatively stable radical existed in the original sample, and the other type, which was generated by redox treatments, was relatively unstable. The spin densities of VC/H₂O₂-HM readily returned to the original value under relatively high humidity and oxic conditions. During this process, the HM-associated “unstable” free radicals released an electron to O₂, inducing the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS, i.e., ⦁OH and ⦁O₂⁻). The generated ROS promoted the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons based on the radical quenching measurements. The transformation rates followed the order naphthalene>phenanthrene>anthracene>benzo[a]pyrene. Our results provide valuable insight into the HM-induced transformation of organic contaminants under natural conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthracenes 3aascorbic acid 3aenvironmental science 3aevolution 3ahumidity 3ahumin 3anaphthalene 3apeat 3aphenanthrenes1 aShi, Yafang1 aNie, Xiaofeng1 aZhao, Song1 aWang, Tiecheng1 aSharma, Virender K.0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2020 Aug., v. 14, no. 4 p.73-73dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-020-1252-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245011100196300001600307500001400323500002000337520152700357592002801884650001401912650001901926650001601945650001701961650001101978650001501989650001402004650001202018650001502030650000902045650000902054650001302063700003102076773013502107856007302242852000902315655001202324IND60700660420221118223926.0200702e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070066042DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.125522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNemiri, Naima1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7022-115710aAnatomical, histological and biochemical studies of desert rodent Gerbillus tarabuli (Thomas, 1902) kidney  ap. 486-493.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present work aimed to study the anatomy, histology, cytology and some biochemical parameters (urea, osmolality, haematocrit, serum natrium, serum kalium) of the kidney of Gerbillus tarabuli.

Our previous research has focused on the morphological characteristics of MMs, as well as on the molecular mechanisms involved in the development and tissue positioning of these cells. However, the postnatal development of MMs has not been sufficiently studied. In the present study, we investigated the positioning of MMs in the rat thymus between postnatal day 0 (P0) and P30. On P0, MMs were evenly distributed all over the thymic tissue—that is, the cortex, cortico‐medullary zone and medulla. From P0 to P15, the number of MMs in the thymic cortex significantly decreased, and after P15, this number did not change. Thus, the present study shows that on P15, MMs almost completely disappear from the thymic cortex and show their adult position in the cortico‐medullary zone and in the medulla.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEU 1033146cAlexander von Humboldt‐Foundation, Bonn, Germany (Institutional Academic Cooperation between Beograd and Lübeck)  a175005cMinistry for Education, Science and Technological Development of Republic of Serbia 3aadults 3acortex 3amacrophages 3apostnatal development 3arats1 aMiljković, Miloš1 aLabudović‐Borović, Milica1 aMilić, Nataša1 aMilićević, Novica M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6661-66580 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2020 July, v. 49, no. 4 p.433-439dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.125453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245014000186300001800326520158300344592002801927650002001955650002701975650001402002650002202016650002502038650001102063650002402074650001202098650001202110650004002122650005502162650001302217650002402230650003602254650002602290650001002316650002602326650004702352650003102399650001702430650003302447700001802480700002202498700002302520700002402543773009902567856004802666852000902714655001202723IND50060948420221116183720.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006094842DNAL7 a229152702pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-012-3079-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerdushy, Tania10aAscaridia galli in chickens: intestinal localization and comparison of methods to isolate the larvae within the first week of infection  ap. 2273-2279.  aThis study was conducted to observe the localization and to compare methods for isolation of minute Ascaridia galli larvae in chicken intestine. Firstly, six 7-week-old layer pullets were orally infected with 2,000 embryonated A. galli eggs and necropsied either at 3, 5 or 7 days post infection (dpi). More than 95 % of the recovered larvae were obtained from the anterior half of the jejunoileum, suggesting this part as the initial predilection site for A. galli larvae. Secondly, the intestinal wall of one layer pullet infected with 20,000 A. galli eggs 3 days earlier was digested in pepsin–HCl for 90 min. The initial 10 min of digestion released 51 % of the totally recovered larvae and the last 30 min of continuous digestion yielded only 5 %. This indicates that the majority of larvae were located superficially in the intestinal mucosa. Thirdly, 48 7-week-old layer pullets were infected with 500 A. galli eggs and necropsied at 3 dpi to compare three different larval isolation methods from the intestinal wall, viz., EDTA incubation, agar-gel incubation and pepsin–HCl digestion, resulting in mean percentages of the recovered larvae: 14.4, 18.2 and 20.0 %, respectively (P = 0.15). As conclusion, we recommended Pepsin–HCl digestion as the method of choice for larval recovery from the intestinal wall in future population dynamics study due to high efficiency and quick and simple detection. The agar-gel method was considered to be a prerequisite for molecular and immunological investigations as the larvae were more active and fully intact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscaridia galli 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3adigestion 3aintestinal mucosa 3aisolation techniques 3alarvae 3apopulation dynamics 3apullets 2aAnimals 2aAscaridiaxisolation & purification 2aAscaridiasisxdiagnosisxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aChickens 2aIleumxparasitology 2aIntestinal Mucosaxparasitology 2aJejunumxparasitology 2aLarva 2aParasitologyxmethods 2aPoultry Diseasesxdiagnosisxparasitology. 2aSpecimen Handlingxmethods 2aTime Factors 2aVeterinary Medicinexmethods1 aNejsum, Peter1 aRoepstorff, Allan1 aThamsborg, Stig M.1 aKyvsgaard, Niels C.0 tParasitology research.g2012 Dec., v. 111, no. 6 p.2273-2279dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-012-3079-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013300166300001600299520146500315592002801780596005701808650001601865650002701881650002801908650001101936650001901947650003001966650001601996650000902012650001202021650001602033650001502049650002302064650002202087650002102109650002302130650001102153650001102164650002202175650001802197651001002215700002202225700001602247700002302263700005802286773012802344856008202472852000902554655001202563IND60700029220221118033453.0200625e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070002922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-020-09764-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkamoto, Uchu10aHost range expansion of a Polygonaceae-associated leaf beetle to an invasive aquatic plant Myriophyllum aquaticum (Haloragaceae)  ap. 491-497.  aThe expansion of available resources leads organisms to adapt to novel niches and create new biological interactions. Galerucella grisescens (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is usually associated with Polygonaceae in Japan but a population feeding on an invasive plant species Myriophyllum aquaticum (Haloragaceae) was found in Chiba Prefecture, Honshu. To infer the process of host range expansion and possible rapid adaptations of G. grisescens to M. aquaticum, we studied larval host plant suitability and female oviposition site preference by G. grisescens in different strains. In laboratory rearing experiments, adult body weight and egg mass size of G. grisescens were smaller on M. aquaticum than on the native host Persicaria lapathifolia (Polygonaceae), suggesting that Polygonaceae are more suitable hosts for G. grisescens than M. aquaticum. On M. aquaticum, the larval survival rate was significantly higher in the Chiba strain collected from M. aquaticum than in the Saga strain originating from Polygonaceae. This raises the possibility that the Chiba strain rapidly adapted to M. aquaticum and improved survival rate on the plant. Oviposition site preference of G. grisescens females was slightly different between individuals reared on Polygonaceae and M. aquaticum. These results suggest that G. grisescens represents early stages of ecological adaptation to the introduced plant and it is a possible biological control agent against M. aquaticum.  aPublisher supplied data  a26870435cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aGalerucella 3aMyriophyllum aquaticum 3aPersicaria lapathifolia 3aadults 3aaquatic plants 3abiological control agents 3abody weight 3aeggs 3afemales 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3alaboratory rearing 3alarvae 3aniches 3aoviposition sites 3asurvival rate 3aJapan1 aShirahama, Shohei1 aNasu, Shota1 aMiyauchi, Hiroyuki1 aTokuda, Makoto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7162-07150 tArthropod-plant interactions.g2020 Aug., v. 14, no. 4 p.491-497dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl4130426x1872-88557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-020-09764-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013100166300001600297520114800313592002801461650001501489650002501504650001101529650001901540650002301559650001401582650001301596650002101609650001401630650001301644650002401657650001301681650000901694700001701703700001701720700001601737700001201753700001601765700001601781700001301797700001701810773008601827856008401913852000901997655001202006IND60602946520221118075605.0180712e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060294652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2014.09.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Ruizhu12aA new nanoporous nitrogen-doped highly-efficient carbonaceous CO2 sorbent synthesized with inexpensive urea and petroleum coke  ap. 465-473.  aThe objective of this research is to develop a cost-effective carbonaceous CO2 sorbent. Highly nanoporous N-doped carbons were synthesized by KOH activation of urea-modified petroleum coke. The resulting carbons show highly developed porosity and different amounts of nitrogen, depending on preparation conditions. This series of carbons exhibits high CO2 adsorption capacities ranging from 3.69 to 4.40mmol/g and 5.69 to 6.75mmol/g at 25°C and 0°C under atmospheric pressure, respectively. Specifically, the sample UC-650-2 prepared at 650°C with KOH/precursor ratio of 2 shows the highest CO2 uptake of 4.40mmol/g at 25°C, which is among the best of the known nitrogen-doped porous carbons. This high CO2 capture capacity is due to the synergy of the sorbent’s high microporosity and nitrogen content. In addition, the CO2/N2 selectivity of the sorbent is 17, higher than that of many reported CO2 sorbents. The multi advantages of the sorbent including its easy synthesis, low cost, high CO2 uptake capacity and selectivity as well as regenerability demonstrates that the nanoporous nitrogen-doped carbon is promising for CO2 capture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aatmospheric pressure 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acost effectiveness 3ananopores 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apetroleum 3aporosity 3apotassium hydroxide 3asorbents 3aurea1 aYang, Mingli1 aHu, Gengshen1 aXu, Leqiong1 aHu, Xin1 aLi, Zhiming1 aWang, Sunli1 aDai, Wei1 aFan, Maohong0 tCarbon.g2015 Jan., v. 81 p.465-473dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2014.09.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03596naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245009500187300001800282520157100300592002801871650001301899650001401912650001701926650002201943650002301965650002501988650001402013650001202027650002302039650002602062650001202088650001802100650003702118650001602155650002002171650001102191650001402202650001302216650003302229650004802262650002902310650003902339650003702378650003902415650003702454650003302491650003702524650003502561650003302596650004102629651001002670651001002680700001602690700001202706700001702718700001702735773008902752856008402841852000902925655001202934IND60088215020221118082352.0141102e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008821502DNAL7 a216218102pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2011.04.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Jianping10aIdentification of estrogen receptor agonists in sediments from Wenyu River, Beijing, China  ap. 3908-3914.  aAssignment of ecological impacts of contamination to specific classes of contaminants is a prerequisite for risk assessment and remediation. In this study, the combination of polarity-based fractionation, two-hybrid yeast bioassay, and chemical analysis were used to evaluate and identify estrogen receptor agonists (ER-agonists) in sediments from Wenyu River, Beijing, China. By bioassay, organic raw sediment extracts could induce significant estrogenicity and the bioassay-derived 17β-estradiol equivalents (EEQs) of raw extracts (EEQᵣₐws) ranged from 0.8 to 19.8 ng/g dry weight. By polarity-based fractionation, the raw extracts were separated into three fractions, i.e. non-polar, moderately polar, and polar fractions, which were subjected to bioassay and chemical analysis. The highest estrogenicity was observed in the polar fraction, which accounted for more than 78% of the total. The medium polar fraction contains PAHs and OCPs, and the estrogenic activities in this fraction contributed 3%–12% of the total in raw extract. An estrogenic activity of non-polarity fraction was negligible in compare to other two fractions. By chemical analysis and toxic equivalent calculation, major part of the estrogenicity in polar fraction could be attributed to six natural/synthetic estrogens (16%–63%), i.e. 17β-estradiol, estrone, estriol, 17α-ethynylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol, and β-estradiol-17-valerate, and to nonylphenols (26%–55%). The proposed approach has been successfully used for characterization of ER-agonists in this case study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3abioassays 3acase studies 3achemical analysis 3adiethylstilbestrol 3aenvironmental impact 3aestradiol 3aestriol 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrogenic properties 3aestrone 3afractionation 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aremediation 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asediments 3atoxicity 3atwo hybrid system techniques 2aDiethylstilbestrolxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEstradiolxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aEstriolxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aEstrogensxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aEstronexanalysisxpharmacology. 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysis 2aPhenolsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aReceptors, Estrogenxagonists. 2aTwo-Hybrid System Techniques 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aChina 0aChina1 aLei, Bingli1 aMa, Mei1 aZha, Jinmiao1 aWang, Zijian0 tWater research.g2011 July, v. 45, no. 13 p.3908-3914dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2011.04.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01295naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245009100206300001800297520022400315592002800539650002300567650002300590650001100613653001900624653002500643653001800668653002100686653001500707700001300722700001300735700001600748773008800764856008400852852000900936655001200945IND60529304820221120171520.0161019e20160518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052930482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Longying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1053-396210aIron-catalyzed allylic substitution reactions of allylic ethers with Grignard reagents  ap. 2211-2214.  aIron-catalyzed allylic substitution of allylic ethers with Grignard reagents is reported.

Ovine oocyte and zygote selection, based on their morphology, is often influenced by personal preference and the lack of universal standards. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify a colorimetric assay associated in evaluating zygote developmental competence – with selection based on the use of the Brilliant Cresyl Blue (BCB) test. The BCB test allows researchers to determine the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), an enzyme synthesized by fertilized oocytes. After in vitro fertilization (IVF), presumptive zygotes were exposed to BCB, diluted in mDPBS (DPBS with 0.4% BSA) for 10min at 38.5°C in a humidified air atmosphere. Zygotes were categorized into 3 categories, according to whether they were stained (category 1), moderately stained (category 2) or unstained (category 3). Category 1, 2 and 3 zygotes were considered to have a low, mid or high G6PDH activity, respectively. Control zygotes were incubated directly after IVF (without exposure to BCB). After BCB categorization, zygotes were maintained in the culture medium for 7 days. The category 3 zygotes yielded a higher blastocyst developmental rate (31.1%), than the control (not tested; 18.8%; P<0.01), category 2 (17.1%; P<0.01) and category 1 (11.6%; P<0.01) zygotes. In addition, the total number of cells per blastocyst obtained from the category 3 zygotes was higher, compared to the other groups. In conclusion, it would seem as if the BCB staining, facilitates sheep zygote categorization for high developmental potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aoocytes 3asheep 3ablastocyst 3azygote 3aair 3abovine serum albumin 3aculture media 3aresearchers 3ain vitro fertilization 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase 0aatmosphere1 aShabankareh, H.

Physicochemical properties and antioxidant activities of FMPS were investigated. FMPS had an average molecular weight of 7.2×105Da and was composed of glucose. On the basis of FT-IR, NMR and methylation analysis, the repeating unit of FMPS was established as (1→3)-linked β-d-glucopyranosyl backbone with 1-linked β-d-glucopyranosyl branches substituted at O-6 position of (1→3)-linked β-d-glucopyranosyl residues. The advanced structure studies indicated that FMPS was a triple-helical polysaccharide. The main hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of FMPS was 23.4nm and it could form a stable system with water in 1.2×10−2g/mL solutions. In addition, FMPS exhibited high DPPH radical scavenging activities (79.46% at 5mg/mL) and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities (74.18% at 5mg/mL), as well as Fe2+chelating activities and ABTS radical scavenging activities to some extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantioxidant activity 3afree radical scavengers 3aglucose 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amethylation 3amolecular weight 3amushrooms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolysaccharides 0aFloral mushroom 0aPolysaccharides 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aAntioxidant activities1 aXu, Jin-Long1 aZhang, Jing-Cheng1 aLiu, Yong1 aSun, Han-Ju1 aZha, Xueqiang0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Oct. 20, v. 131 p.240-247dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.05.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01863naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245008300159300001600242520092600258592002801184650001501212650002001227650001101247651001001258700001301268700001601281700001401297700001101311773013601322856008201458852000901540655001201549IND60516029420221120201022.0190727e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051602942DNAL7 a10.1017/S002185961400001X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLIU, L.10aNew optimized grey derivative models for grain production forecasting in China  ap. 257-269.  aAlthough the grey forecasting model has been successfully employed in various fields and demonstrates promising results, the literature shows that its performance could still be improved. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to continue the investigation and derive three hybrid models to predict grain production in China by combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the grey linear power index model, the grey logarithm power model and the grey parabola power model. In grey modelling, the use of PSO had the ability to search optimum grey parameters to construct three improved derivative grey models. The results concluded that the improved optimization models with high precision were superior to the traditional models, and PSO contributed more to precision improvement of the three grey models. Furthermore, results from the experiments demonstrated that the optimized models were reliable and valid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acrop production 3amodels 3aChina1 aWANG, Y.1 aWu-O, Jess,1 aWang, J.,1 aXI, C.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2015 Mar., v. 153, no. 2 p.257-269dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46135x1469-51467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S002185961400001X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245008800193300001600281500001400297500002000311520141000331592002801741596024501769650002002014650001102034650001002045650002202055650001302077650001202090650001002102650002502112650001202137650001702149650001702166650002602183650001202209650001102221700001702232700001502249700005402264773013502318856007302453852000902526655001202535IND60700660720221118223913.0200702e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070066072DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.125622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Haiji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3958-471210aComparative study of the distribution of NOS‐positive neurons in pigeon intestine  ap. 563-570.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in regulating gut motility, mucosal barrier function and secretions in the enteric nervous system. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH‐d) staining has been used to identify nitrergic neurons of the enteric nervous system in different species. However, NADPH‐d staining lacks specificity because it also reflects the presence of enzymes other than nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Therefore, NOS immunohistochemistry techniques are needed to test for nitrergic neurons in the avian gut. In the present work, the morphology, density and size of NOS‐positive neurons in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and rectum myenteric plexus of adult pigeons were investigated using NOS immunohistochemistry and whole‐mount preparations techniques. The density of NOS‐positive ganglion was highest in the ileum, similar to the caecum and rectum, and the lowest staining levels were observed in the duodenum. The staining intensity of NOS‐positive neurons in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum was dark, followed by the rectal regions, with weak staining in the caecum. These results suggested that NOS immunohistochemistry and whole‐mount preparation techniques provide an effective assessment method of the ganglia in the pigeon intestinal myenteric nerve plexus and are more accurate for cell counting compared with conventional sections.  aPublisher supplied data  a31672286, S201910445084 and 2019GSF108082. cNational Natural Science Foundation of China, Innovation and entrepreneurship training program for College Students of China, and Key research and development Foundation of Shandong Province. 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aadults 3acecum 3acomparative study 3aduodenum 3aganglia 3aileum 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ajejunum 3anerve tissue 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3apigeons 3arectum1 aGao, Wenting1 aLi, Huimin1 aMa, Xiaoli1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0279-83540 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2020 July, v. 49, no. 4 p.563-570dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.125623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012500157300001800282500002000300520132200320592002801642650001801670650002401688650002101712650001101733650001601744650002001760650002701780650002401807650002001831650001601851650002101867650001001888650002001898650001801918650002101936700002001957700003701977700002002014700002002034700002402054700001902078773012902097856007302226852000902299655001202308IND60592845120221123040255.0180413e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059284512DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.125412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIjiri, Daichi10aSingle injection of clenbuterol into newly hatched chicks decreases abdominal fat pad weight in growing broiler chickens  ap. 1298-1303.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of the current study was to examine the effects of clenbuterol injection into newly hatched chicks on both the abdominal fat pad tissue weight and the skeletal muscle weight during subsequent growth. Twenty‐seven 1‐day‐old chicks were divided into two groups, receiving either a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of clenbuterol (0.1 mg/kg body weight) or phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS). Body weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were not affected by clenbuterol injection during the 5‐week experimental period, while the abdominal fat pad tissue weight of the clenbuterol‐injected chicks was lower than that of the control chicks at 5 weeks post‐injection. Plasma non‐esterified fatty acid concentrations were significantly increased in the clenbuterol‐injected chicks, while plasma triacylglycerol concentrations did not differ. Additionally, the enzymatic activity of fatty acid synthase was lower in the liver of the clenbuterol‐injected chicks. Conversely, the skeletal muscle weights were not affected by clenbuterol injection.

However, no such studies have been conducted in National Hunt (NH) horses. Aim: To determine whether exercise undertaken during training is associated with racing performance in NH racehorses. Methods: Data were collected as part of a larger study investigating injury occurrence in NH racehorses. Race records and daily exercise data were obtained from NH racehorses at 14 training yards. Canter, gallop and race distances accumulated in the 30 days preceding a ‘case race’ were calculated. Associations between exercise‐, horse‐ and race‐level variables and the odds of winning, winning prize money, being pulled up and falling were identified using mixed effects logistic regression. Results: Data from 4444 races run by 858 horses were included in analyses. Horses accumulating longer canter distances in the preceding 30 days were more likely to win or win prize money and less likely to be pulled‐up. Horses accumulating longer race distances in a 30 day period were more likely to win, whilst those accumulating longer gallop distances in a 30 day period were more likely to win prize money. Horses that had jump‐schooled in the preceding 30 days were more likely to fall during the race than those that had not. Trainer and horse were associated with racing performance after adjusting for exercise. Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that NH race performance may be improved through modification of exercise regimens. After controlling for the abilities of individual trainers and horses and conditions of the case race, horses accumulating longer exercise distances in the 30 days preceding a race were more likely to be successful. However, horses that had jump‐schooled in the 30 days preceding a race were more likely to fall.  aPublisher supplied data 3araces 3aexercise 3aregression analysis 3aracehorses 3aracing performance 0arecords1 aPrice, J.

The reversibility is probably due to the cellular structure of exfoliated graphite. The elastomeric character is independent of the maximum load and essentially unchanged upon reloading. The total and reversible engineering shear strains of the cell wall (∼60 graphite layers, ∼20nm thick) are up to 40 and 35 respectively during instrumented indentation (in the compaction direction) without fracture of the layers, compared to corresponding values of 12 and 8 for flexible graphite (38vol.% solid). The fraction of displacement that is irreversible is as low as 12%, compared to 29% for flexible graphite. The modulus is as low as 83kPa, compared to 790kPa for flexible graphite. The greater the degree of compaction, the lower are the shear strain and reversibility, and the higher are the modulus and the displacement load. The ease of interlayer sliding is inadequate in flexible graphite or highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite (prior work) for substantial elastomeric behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell structures 3aengineering 3agraphene1 aChung, D.D.L.0 tCarbon.g2015 Jan., v. 81 p.505-513dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2014.09.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100008000139245012600219300001600345500001400361500002000375520155800395592002801953650001501981650001601996650001002012650001002022650000902032650001802041650002002059650001502079650001102094650001402105650001702119650001202136650002302148650002002171650001202191650001502203651001102218700003502229700002302264700003402287700003302321700003202354700003702386773013502423856007302558852000902631655001202640IND60700660920221118224141.0200702e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070066092DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.125552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuimarães‐Lopes, Vanessa de Paula1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0978-406X10aAnatomical parameters of the body and the digestive tract of Callithrix sp. marmosets under the influence of seasonality  ap. 511-520.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDue to the ecological importance and given the scarcity of studies on the digestive morphology of primates, anatomical aspects of the body and digestive tract, as well as food content were analysed for marmosets Callithrix sp. (hybrids of exotic species) captured in forest fragments in Minas Gerais ‐ Brazil, during the dry and rainy seasons, considering that seasonal variations affect the availability of food and quality of diet. Data such as body weight and length, and thoracic and abdominal perimeters were analysed, and no significant difference was found between dry and rainy seasons. In relation to the digestive tract, length, weight and diameter of the oesophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine were measured, in addition to the isolated caecum. There was a significant difference in the diameter of the ascending colon, which was larger in the animals in the dry season than in the rainy season. The difference found may be related to diet, and through analysis of the gastric and caecal contents, it was observed that gum was the main food item for the dry season marmosets, while in the rainy season the animals consumed mainly arthropods. Thus, the characteristic observed in the digestive tract of dry season marmosets is a reflection of an adaptive response to gum intake, since this food item is of low digestibility, necessitating that the food content be retained for a long time in this segment of the large intestine, helping the process of microbial fermentation and better energy utilization for these animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallithrix 3abody weight 3acecum 3acolon 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestive tract 3adry season 3aenergy 3aesophagus 3afermentation 3aforests 3aintroduced species 3asmall intestine 3astomach 3awet season 3aBrazil1 aGomes, Maria Raquel Varino Sá1 aKagueyama, Mislene1 aFaria, Rita de Cássia Vieira1 aRibeiro Filho, Oswaldo Pinto1 aMelo, Fabiano Rodrigues de,1 aSartori, Sirlene Souza Rodrigues0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2020 July, v. 49, no. 4 p.511-520dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.125553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245009900214300001600313520193500329592002802264650002002292650002902312650001202341650001002353650001302363650001402376650002302390651001202413653002802425653001502453653001402468653001402482653003602496700002402532700006502556700006302621700002302684773010002707856008602807852000902893655001202902IND60527126820221120034529.0190412e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052712682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.01.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Olde, Evelien M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5520-751410aAssessing sustainability at farm-level: Lessons learned from a comparison of tools in practice  ap. 391-404.  aIn the past decades a wide variety of tools have been developed to assess the sustainability performance of farms. Although multiple studies have compared tools on a theoretical basis, little attention has been paid to the comparing tools in practice. This research compared indicator-based sustainability assessment tools to gain insight in practical requirements, procedures and complexity involved in applying sustainability assessment tools. In addition, the relevance of the tools, as perceived by farmers, was evaluated. An overview of 48 indicator-based sustainability assessment tools was developed to, subsequently, select tools that address the environmental, social and economic dimension of sustainability, are issued in a scientific publication and suitable for assessing the sustainability performance of livestock and arable farms in Denmark. Only four tools (RISE, SAFA, PG and IDEA) complied with the selection criteria and were used to assess the sustainability performance of five Danish farms. The tools vary widely in their scoring and aggregation method, time requirement and data input. The farmers perceived RISE as the most relevant tool to gain insight in the sustainability performance of their farm. The findings emphasize the importance of context specificity, user-friendliness, complexity of the tool, language use, and a match between value judgements of tool developers and farmers. Even though RISE was considered as the most relevant tool, the farmers expressed a hesitation to apply the outcomes of the four tools in their decision making and management. Furthermore, they identified limitations in their options to improve their sustainability performance. Additional efforts are needed to support farmers in using the outcomes in their decision making. The outcomes of sustainability assessment tools should therefore be considered as a starting point for discussion, reflection and learning.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3afarmers 3afarms 3alearning 3alivestock 3aselection criteria 3aDenmark 0aAgricultural production 0aFarm level 0aLivestock 0aRelevance 0aSustainability assessment tools1 aOudshoorn, Frank W.1 aSørensen, Claus A.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6340-77781 aBokkers, Eddie A.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2000-76001 ade Boer, Imke J.M.0 tEcological indicators.g2016 July, v. 66 p.391-404dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.01.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100004200154245010600196300001400302500002000316520175900336592002802095650001702123650001602140650000902156650001302165650001602178650001602194650001102210650002502221650002402246650001202270700001802282700002002300700002502320773011002345856008802455852000902543655001202552IND60579115720221121233158.0170815e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057911572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.2042-3306.2010.00268.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a
            De GRAAF‐ROELFSEMA, E.14aThe incidence and severity of gastric ulceration does not increase in overtrained Standardbred horses  ap. 58-61.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aReasons for performing study: Gastric ulceration can be caused by different pathophysiological mechanisms including dietary factors, psychological stress and exercise. Overtraining is a medical syndrome in performance horses associated with altered hormone levels, altered feed intake, altered behaviour and decreased performance. These components might lead to a higher incidence of gastric ulceration in overtrained horses. Objectives: To investigate whether the incidence of gastric ulceration is increased in overtrained compared to control horses. Methods: A longitudinal training study with twelve 1.5 years old Standardbred horses was performed on a treadmill for a total of 32 weeks. Training was divided into 4 periods: (1) acclimatisation (2) training (3) intensified training, and (4) detraining. In period 3, the horses were randomly divided into 2 groups: control (C) and intensified trained group (IT). At the end of each period, gastroscopy was performed in conscious horses after withholding feed for 12 h and water for 6 h using a 3.5 m video gastroendoscope. Lesion scores were assigned to areas of the stomach and graded 1–4. Logistic regression was used for statistical calculations. Results: Evaluation of the stomach revealed only minor changes (grades 1 or 2) on each occasion. There were no significant differences in gastric lesion scores between groups or periods. Most lesions (70%) were found around the minor curvature. After detraining no lesions (0%) were found in contrast to periods 1 (40%, P = 0.056), 2 (30%) and 3 (30%).

The PROBA-V space segment is based on a three-axis stabilized PROBA small-satellite platform of about 140 kg equipped with a state-of-the-art compact 4-band multi-spectral imager with a large field of view. The instrument’s optomechanics is based on three very compact TMA (three mirror anastigmat) telescopes placed on an optical bench. At an altitude of 820 km, the instrument is able to provide daily coverage of the Earth in three VNIR (visible and near-infrared) bands and one SWIR (short-wave infrared) spectral band, with a spatial resolution of up to 100 m × 100 m at nadir for the VNIR. The instrument raw data will be downlinked with an X-band transmitter to the ground reception station in Kiruna, Sweden. The mission control centre is located in Redu, Belgium. The image processing centre, the so-called ‘user segment’, automatically accesses the raw data and is responsible for the processing and the dissemination of the data products towards the user community. The PROBA-V spacecraft was launched on board the new European launcher Vega on 7 May 2013. It is designed for a nominal mission lifetime of 2.5 years with a possible extension to 5 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aimage analysis 3aremote sensing 3avegetation 3aBelgium 3aSweden1 aSantandrea, Stefano1 aMellab, Karim1 aVrancken, Davy1 aVersluys, Jorg0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 35, no. 7 p.2548-2564dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.8830983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009600171300001600267520135000283592002801633650001401661650002901675650001901704650002801723650001301751650000901764700002001773700002001793700001801813773011801831856008501949852000902034655001202043IND60586535320221120144607.0171213e20180117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058653532DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2017.13827462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTbarki, Khaoula10aCovariance-guided landmine detection and discrimination using ground-penetrating radar data  ap. 289-314.  aGround penetrating Radar (GPR) can detect and deliver the response signal from any buried kind of object like plastic or metallic landmines, stones, and wood sticks. It delivers three kinds of data: Ascan, Bscan, and Cscan. However, it cannot discriminate between landmines and inoffensive objects or ‘clutter.’ One-class classification is an alternative to detect landmines, especially, as landmines features data are unbalanced. In this article, we investigate the effectiveness of the Covariance-guided One-Class Support Vector Machine (COSVM) to detect, discriminate, and locate landmines efficiently. In fact, compared to existing one-class classifiers, the COSVM has the advantage of emphasizing low variance directions. Moreover, we will compare the one-class classification to multiclass classification to tease out the advantage of the former over the latter as data are unbalanced. Our method consists of extracting Ascan GPR data. Extracted features are used as an input for COSVM to discriminate between landmines and clutter. We provide an extensive evaluation of our detection method compared to other methods based on relevant state of the art one-class and multiclass classifiers, on the well-known MACADAM database. Our experimental results show clearly the superiority of using COSVM in landmine detection and localization.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aground-penetrating radar 3aremote sensing 3asupport vector machines 3avariance 3awood1 aBen Said, Salma1 aKsantini, Riadh1 aLachiri, Zied0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2018 Jan. 17, v. 39, no. 2 p.289-314dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2017.13827463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011200167300001400279520082200293536044101115592002801556650001401584650001001598650001301608650001101621650003001632650001301662650001501675650001101690650001401701650001601715650001901731650002801750650002301778650001401801651001001815653001201825653001001837653002001847653001401867653001901881653003201900700001401932700001701946700001701963700001201980700001701992700001602009700001302025773009602038856008402134852000902218655001202227IND60698805420221121091431.0210531e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069880542DNAL7 a10.3897/phytokeys.139.470552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ren-Bo10aParaphlomis kuankuoshuiensis (Lamiaceae), a new species from the limestone areas of northern Guizhou, China  ap. 13-20.  aParaphlomis kuankuoshuiensis (Lamiaceae), a new species found in the limestone areas of northern Guizhou, China, is described and illustrated in this paper.

(‘YOY plaice’) at beaches on the western side of the British Isles at small alongshore (100–500m), temporal (days to weeks), depth (0.5–2m below waterline) and inter-individual scales. We compared variations in these nucleic-acid-based metrics of condition and growth with a null metric (total length) considered to be less responsive to short-term changes in environmental conditions. All four metrics varied at small spatial and temporal scales, particularly RNA-based metrics of short-term condition and growth. A decline in condition and growth during summer was the most important source of temporal variation. Condition and growth also increased with depth below waterline. Alongshore variations within a beach were relatively small, but variance among stations on the same beach (500m scale) was similar in magnitude to variance among beaches separated by 100km. High variance in nucleic acid concentrations among samples resulted not only from technical error but also from inter-individual variation. Our application of high-resolution biochemical indices therefore demonstrates that functional roles of sandy beaches can be structured at remarkably small spatial (500m) and temporal (days) scales, within a single beach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPleuronectes platessa 3aRNA 3abeaches 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3ajuveniles 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3avariance 3aBritish Isles 0aFlatfish nursery 0aHabitat heterogeneity 0aIndividual growth 0aRNA:DNA 0aSandy beach 0aScale dependence1 aTargett, Timothy E.1 aNash, Richard D.M.1 aBurrows, Michael T.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2013 Oct., v. 448 p.346-359dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2013.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03672naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001400182245012500196300001800321506007600339520174500415592002802160506003702188650001002225650001102235650001002246650002102256650001102277650001202288650001402300650007702314650004802391650002502439650002002464650004802484650003502532650001302567650003802580650001402618650004002632650006602672650003302738650006302771700001202834700001402846700001402860700001502874700001202889773011502901856008103016852000903097655001203106IND4470195120221207115246.0120502e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447019512DNAL7 a220030852pmid7 aPMC33271742pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.111.1863952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei10aYUCCA Genes Are Expressed in Response to Leaf Adaxial-Abaxial Juxtaposition and Are Required for Leaf Margin Development  ap. 1805-1819.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring leaf development, the formation of leaf adaxial-abaxial polarity at the primordium stage is crucial for subsequent leaf expansion. However, little is known about the genetic control from polarity establishment to blade outgrowth. The leaf margin, comprising elongated margin cells and hydathodes, is thought to affect leaf expansion. Here, we show that mutants with defective leaf polarity or with loss of function in the multiple auxin-biosynthetic YUCCA (YUC) genes exhibited a similar abnormal leaf margin and less-expanded leaves. Leaf margins of these mutants contained fewer hydathodes and an increased number of cell patches in which the patterns of epidermal cells resembled those of hydathodes. The previously characterized leaf-abaxialized asymmetric leaves2 (as2) revoluta (rev) and leaf-adaxialized kanadi1 (kan1) kan2 double mutants both produce finger-shaped, hydathode-like protrusions on adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces, respectively. YUCs are required for formation of the protrusions, as those produced by as2 rev and kan1 kan2 were absent in the yuc1 yuc2 yuc4 triple mutant background. Expressions of YUC1, YUC2, and YUC4 were spatially regulated in the leaf, being associated with hydathodes in wild-type leaves and protrusions on as2 rev and kan1 kan2 leaves. In addition, inhibition of auxin transport by treatment of seedlings with N-(1-naphtyl) phtalamic acid or disruption of the auxin gradient by transforming plants with the 35S:YUC1 construct also blocked leaf margin development. Collectively, our data show that expressions of YUCs in the leaf respond to the adaxial-abaxial juxtaposition, and that the activities of auxin mediate leaf margin development, which subsequently promotes blade outgrowth.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacids 3aauxins 3agenes 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3amutants 3aseedlings 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiological Transport 2aBody Patterning 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aMutation 2aOxygenasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSeedlingsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure.1 aXu, Ben1 aWang, Hua1 aLi, Jiqin1 aHuang, Hai1 aXu, Lin0 tPlant physiology.g2011 Dec., v. 157, no. 4 p.1805-1819dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.111.1863953Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012000169300001800289520140800307592002801715650006701743650001101810650001001821651001001831700001901841700001801860700001301878700001901891700001701910700001801927700001701945773012101962856005102083852000902134655001202143IND50087963920221123033107.0140412e20111210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008796392DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2010.5321762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shangmin10aAccuracy assessment of the ASTER GDEM and SRTM3 DEM: an example in the Loess Plateau and North China Plain of China  ap. 8081-8093.  aThe digital elevation model (DEM) produced by the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) has provided important fundamental data for topographic analysis in many fields. The recently released global digital elevation model (GDEM) produced by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) has higher spatial resolution and wider coverage than the SRTM3 DEM, and thus may be of more value to researchers. Taking two typical study areas—the Loess Plateau and the North China Plain of China—as an example, this article assesses the accuracy of the SRTM3 DEM and ASTER GDEM by collecting ground control points from topographical maps. It is found that both the SRTM3 DEM and the ASTER GDEM are far more accurate for the North China Plain than for the Loess Plateau. For the Loess Plateau, the accuracy of the ASTER GDEM is similar to that of the SRTM3 DEM; whereas for the North China Plain, it is much worse than that of the SRTM3 DEM. Considering the negative bias of the ASTER GDEM for flat or gentle regions, we improve its accuracy by adding the difference of the mean value between the SRTM3 DEM and ASTER GDEM for the North China Plain; then, the root mean square error (RMSE) of ±7.95 m from the original ASTER GDEM is improved to ±5.26 m, which demonstrates that it is a simple but useful way to improve the accuracy of the ASTER GDEM in flat or gentle regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3amodels 3aradar 3aChina1 aCheng, Weiming1 aZhou, Chenghu1 aChen, Xi1 aZhang, Shifang1 aZhou, Zengpo1 aLiu, Haijiang1 aChai, Huixia0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2011 Dec. 10, v. 32, no. 23 p.8081-8093dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2010.532176  aDNAL 7aarticle01502naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245003300158300001400191500001900205520045900224592002800683650003400711650001800745650001500763650001200778650001000790650002000800650001200820653001800832653001600850653001400866653002000880653001900900700001300919773009800932856007701030852000901107655001201116IND60647835820221117224623.0200306e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064783582DNAL7 a10.2478/sg-2019-00092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRastogi, S.10aB-Chromosomes in Gymnosperms  ap. 51-54.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aB-chromosomes show a non-random distribution in different taxa of gymnosperms.

We developed an approach to understand land-use change in relation to ecosystem services synergies and trade-offs at a national level. We test the proposed approach for Spain by mapping the spatial distribution of 14 high-resolution indicators with the aim to (a) facilitate a greater understanding of the spatial interactions among ecosystem services; (b) identify the hotspots of ecosystem service synergies and trade-offs; and (c) explain the ecosystem service synergies and trade-offs in relation to a land-use intensity gradient. Our results show how current land-use management in Spain is creating a landscape-level dichotomy between land-use intensification and protection (through the declaration of protected areas), which is having a clear negative effect on the conservation of essential ecosystem services. For example, we spatially identify where agricultural intensification is presenting a major trade-off with other ecosystem services. Finally, we discuss the urgent need for a new comprehensive model of landscape planning at a national scale that takes into account the complex interactions among ecosystem services and the establishment of a new governance body at national level regarding the management and conservation of ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3aecosystem services 3agovernance 3aintensive farming 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aplanning 3aSpain 0aEcosystem services 0aSynergies and trade-offs 0aLand-use intensity 0aProtected areas 0aLandscape planning 0aSpain1 aZorrilla-Miras, P.1 aPalomo, I.1 aMontes, C.1 aBenayas, J.1 aMaes, J.0 tEcosystem services.g2019 Feb., v. 35 p.43-51dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2018.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002200169245008300191300001800274520099300292592002801285650001601313650001001329650002001339650001501359650001601374650001901390650002401409650002601433650002101459650003101480650001001511650002401521650002101545650002601566700002801592700002901620773009701649856008601746852000901832655001201841IND4447406420221117224802.0141110e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444740642DNAL7 a210744172pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.10.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrindley, Celeste10aAnalysis of light regime in continuous light distributions in photobioreactors  ap. 3138-3148.  aMaximum photobioreactor (PBR) efficiency is a must in applications such as the obtention of microalgae-derived fuels. Improving PBR performance requires a better understanding of the “light regime”, the varying irradiance that microalgal cells moving in a dense culture are exposed to. We propose a definition of light regime that can be used consistently to describe the continuously varying light patterns in PBRs as well as in light/dark cycles. Equivalent continuous and light/dark regimes have been experimentally compared and the results show that continuous variations are not well represented by light/dark cycles, as had been widely accepted. It has been shown that a correct light regime allows obtaining photosynthetic rates higher than the corresponding to continuous light, the so-called “flashing light effect” and that this is possible in commercial PBRs. A correct PBR operation could result in photosynthetic efficiency close to the optimum eight quanta per O₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioreactors 3afuels 3alight intensity 3amicroalgae 3aphotoperiod 3aphotosynthesis 2aComputer Simulation 2aComputer-Aided Design 2aEquipment Design 2aEquipment Failure Analysis 2aLight 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPhotobioreactors 2aScattering, Radiation1 aAcién Fernández, F.G.1 aFernández-Sevilla, J.M.0 tBioresource technology.g2011 Feb., v. 102, no. 3 p.3138-3148dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.10.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245006000166300001400226500001900240520072300259592002800982650001801010650002101028650000801049650001301057650000901070653001301079653001801092653000901110653000801119700002301127700002601150700002901176700002501205700004101230773009801271856007701369852000901446655001201455IND60647835920221117224639.0200306e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064783592DNAL7 a10.2478/sg-2019-00102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMéndez-Cea, Belén10aDNA extraction and amplification from Pinaceae dry wood  ap. 55-57.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWood constitutes the unique source of DNA in dead trees, but extraction of adequate quality DNA from dry wood is usually challenging.

To reach their target sites, nanocarriers (NCs) need to circulate in the bloodstream for prolonged periods without aggregation, degradation, or cargo loss. However, it is very difficult to identify and monitor small-sized NCs and their cargo in the dense and highly complex blood environment. Here, we present a new fluorescence correlation spectroscopy-based method that allows the precise characterization of fluorescently labeled NCs in samples of less than 50 μL of whole blood. The NC size, concentration, and loading efficiency can be measured to evaluate circulation times, stability, or premature drug release. We apply the new method to follow the fate of pH-degradable fluorescent cargo-loaded nanogels in the blood of live mice for periods of up to 72 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ablood flow 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3afluorescence correlation spectroscopy 3amedicinal properties 3ananocarriers 3ananogels1 aHuppertsberg, Anne1 aKlefenz, Adrian1 aKaps, Leonard1 aMailänder, Volker1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6583-81361 aSchuppan, Detlef1 aButt, Hans-Jürgen,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5391-26181 aNuhn, Lutz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0761-11061 aKoynov, Kaloian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4062-88340 tBiomacromolecules.g2022 Jan. 21, v. 23, no. 3 p.1065-1074dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c014073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010400170300001800274520197800292592002802270650001502298650002402313650001302337650001902350650005002369650002402419650001602443773012102459856005102580852000902631655001202640IND50087964220221123043402.0140412e20111210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008796422DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2010.5328242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorgan, John A.10aComparison of Bayesian land surface temperature algorithm performance with Terra MODIS observations  ap. 8139-8159.  aAn approach to land surface temperature (LST) estimation that relies upon Bayesian inference has been tested against multiband infrared radiometric imagery from the Terra MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument. The algorithm employed requires minimal knowledge of surface emissivity, starting from a parsimoniously chosen (hence, uninformative) range of prior band emissivity knowledge. Two estimation methods have been tested. The first is the iterative contraction mapping of joint expectation values for LST and surface emissivity described in a previous paper. In the second method, the Bayesian algorithm is reformulated as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) search for the maximum joint a posteriori probability for LST, given observed sensor aperture radiances and a priori probabilities for LST and emissivity.Two MODIS data granules each for daytime and night-time were used for the comparison. The granules were chosen to be largely cloud-free, with limited vertical relief in those portions of the granules for which the sensor zenith angle . Level 1b radiances were used to obtain 500 LST estimates per granule for comparison with the Level 2 MODIS LST product.The Bayesian LST estimators accurately reproduce standard MODIS product LST values. In particular, the mean discrepancy for the MAP retrievals is , and its standard deviation does not exceed 1K. The ±68% confidence intervals for individual LST estimates associated with assumed uncertainty in surface emissivity are of order 0.8K.The appendix presents a proof of convergence of the iterative contraction mapping algorithm. The expectation values of surface temperature in multiple bands, and jointly in all bands, converge to a fixed point, within a stipulated convergence criterion. Provided the support for the calculation of the expectation value brackets the maximum in the joint posterior probability for LST, the fixed point converges to the MAP LST estimate in the limit .  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aconfidence interval 3agranules 3aimage analysis 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3asurface temperature 3auncertainty0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2011 Dec. 10, v. 32, no. 23 p.8139-8159dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2010.532824  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009800165300001600263520088100279592002801160596003701188650001201225650002001237650001101257650001901268650001601287650001401303650002401317650001201341650001201353650001501365651001001380700001801390700001901408700001801427700001401445700001601459700001601475700005801491773014301549856008301692852000901775655001201784IND60734247320221120131009.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073424732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-021-03168-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Shuhui10aQuantitative Relationship Between Paddy Soil Properties and Cadmium Content in Tobacco leaves  ap. 878-883.  aTobacco readily accumulates cadmium (Cd), an unnecessary and poisonous element.

The results showed that 86.9% of the total sampling points had soil cadmium in excess of standard value, and the ratio of active Cd content to total soil Cd content was 24.0%. The enrichment factor of tobacco Cd was 3.43. There was a significant positive correlation between Cd concentration in tobacco leaves and soil Cd content. Soil pH, organic matter and cation exchange amount were negatively correlated with the Cd enrichment factor of tobacco. This present study has provided a regression model of tobacco Cd content based on soil factors, which could accurately predict Cd content in different parts of tobacco.  aPublisher supplied data  a16-19Aa04cHunan Tobacco Company 3acadmium 3acation exchange 3aleaves 3aorganic matter 3apaddy soils 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3asoil pH 3atobacco 3atoxicology 3aChina1 aYang, Jiashuo1 aZhou, Zhicheng1 aXiao, Yansong1 aLi, Sijun1 aZeng, Weiai1 aZeng, Huiyu1 aRong, Xiangmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5680-47190 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2021 May, v. 106, no. 5 p.878-883dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03168-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100002300169245011700192500002000309506002800329506003000357520194600387592002802333596004402361596004502405506003702450650001902487650001402506650002602520650002402546650001302570650002702583650002002610700002002630700002602650700003102676773009802707856007302805903002202878852000902900655001202909IND60549778220221207142037.0160908e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054977822DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.14112doi7 a10.1002/ecs2.14112chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpellman, Katie V.10aMetacognitive learning in the ecology classroom: A tool for preparing problem solvers in a time of rapid change?  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aBuilding communities that are resilient and adaptive to climate change requires the development of education strategies that train community members in higher order thinking skills that can be used to solve complex environmental problems. This study provides an empirical test of hypotheses within social‐ecological systems resilience theory that have suggested metacognitive learning strategies could increase resilience thinking skills such as scenarios thinking, systems thinking, and the ability to interpret and apply ecological data in complex problem solving. During a 6‐week long ecology unit with 108 seventh‐grade students, we taught half the students using standard inquiry teaching methods and the other half using the same method, with the addition of a daily metacognitive learning intervention. We investigated the short‐term (after six weeks of intervention) and long‐term (1 yr after the intervention ended) effects of the intervention on student's metacognitive ability and resilience thinking skills. Over the long term, we found a modest increase in the metacognitive ability of students who received the daily metacognitive journaling exercise. Interview data suggest that the structured metacognitive practice did most to improve the resilience thinking level of students who had low resilience thinking ability prior to the intervention period. However, the interaction between pre‐treatment ability level and the treatment group was not detected in the written assessment data. These data suggest that the metacognitive learning intervention we used can benefit metacognitive ability over the long term, but has limited transferability to resilience thinking skills for most students. We suggest additional instructional practices for implementing metacognitive teaching approaches that could enhance the generalizability of their benefits across resilience thinking skills and student's ability levels.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate change 3acognition 3aecological resilience 3aeducational methods 3alearning 3amiddle school students 3aproblem solving1 aDeutsch, Andrea1 aMulder, Christa P.

The current study was carried out to determine bacterial endosymbiont diversity in the different populations of this pest. Ten date palm hopper populations were collected from the main date palm growing regions in Iran and an additional four samples from Pakistan, Oman, Egypt and Tunisia for detection of primary and secondary endosymbionts using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay with their specific primers. The PCR products were directly sequenced and edited using SeqMan software. The consensus sequences were subjected to a BLAST similarity search. The results revealed the presence of ‘Candidatus Sulcia muelleri’ (primary endosymbiont) and Wolbachia, Arsenophonus and Enterobacter (secondary endosymbionts) in all populations. This assay failed to detect ‘Candidatus Nasuia deltocephalinicola’ and Serratia in these populations. ‘Ca. S. muelleri’ exhibited a 100% infection frequency in populations and Wolbachia, Arsenophonus and Enterobacter demonstrated 100, 93.04 and 97.39% infection frequencies, respectively. The infection rate of Arsenophonus and Enterobacter ranged from 75 to 100% and 62.5 to 100%, respectively, in different populations of the insect. The results demonstrated multiple infections by ‘Ca. Sulcia muelleri’, Wolbachia, Arsenophonus and Enterobacter in the populations and may suggest significant roles for these endosymbionts on date palm hopper population fitness. This study provides an insight to endosymbiont variation in the date palm hopper populations; however, further investigation is needed to examine how these endosymbionts may affect host fitness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArsenophonus 3aEnterobacter 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aSerratia 3aWolbachia 3aallopatry 3acomputer software 3aendosymbionts 3ainsects 3amicrosymbionts 3apests 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aEgypt 3aIran 3aOman 3aPakistan 3aTunisia 0abacterial endosymbiont 0aOmmatissus lybicus 0aSulcia1 aIzadi, H.1 aAskari Seyahooei, M.1 aBagheri, A.1 aKhodaygan, P.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2018 Apr., v. 108, no. 2 p.271-281dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853170006333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03974naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010700157500002000264520238000284592002802664650002402692650001002716650002002726650001102746650001402757650001502771650001502786650001902801650001802820650001402838650001302852650002002865650001402885650001502899650001502914650001402929650001102943650001102954650002302965650002002988650001403008650001903022650001103041651002303052700001503075700001603090700001803106700001903124700001903143700001603162700001903178700001303197773008003210856007303290852000903363655001203372IND60549778320221118113314.0160908e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054977832DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.14222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorley, S. A.10aSeasonal variation exceeds effects of salmon carcass additions on benthic food webs in the Elwha River  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDam removal and other fish barrier removal projects in western North America are assumed to boost freshwater productivity via the transport of marine‐derived nutrients from recolonizing Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). In anticipation of the removal of two hydroelectric dams on the Elwha River in Washington State, we tested this hypothesis with a salmon carcass addition experiment. Our study was designed to examine how background nutrient dynamics and benthic food webs vary seasonally, and how these features respond to salmon subsidies. We conducted our experiment in six side channels of the Elwha River, each with a spatially paired reference and treatment reach. Each reach was sampled on multiple occasions from October 2007 to August 2008, before and after carcass placement. We evaluated nutrient limitation status; measured water chemistry, periphyton, benthic invertebrates, and juvenile rainbow trout (O. mykiss) response; and traced salmon‐derived nutrient uptake using stable isotopes. Outside of winter, algal accrual was limited by both nitrogen and phosphorous and remained so even in the presence of salmon carcasses. One month after salmon addition, dissolved inorganic nitrogen levels doubled in treatment reaches. Two months after addition, benthic algal accrual was significantly elevated. We detected no changes in invertebrate or fish metrics, with the exception of ¹⁵N enrichment. Natural seasonal variability was greater than salmon effects for the majority of our response metrics. Yet seasonality and synchronicity of nutrient supply and demand are often overlooked in nutrient enhancement studies. Timing and magnitude of salmon‐derived nitrogen utilization suggest that uptake of dissolved nutrients was favored over direct consumption of carcasses. The highest proportion of salmon‐derived nitrogen was incorporated by herbivores (18–30%) and peaked 1–2 months after carcass addition. Peak nitrogen enrichment in predators (11–16%) occurred 2–3 months after addition. All taxa returned to background δ¹⁵N levels by 7 months. Since this study was conducted, both dams on the Elwha River were removed over 2011–2014 to open over 90% of the basin to anadromous fishes. We anticipate that as the full portfolio of salmon species expands through the basin, nutrient supply and demand will come into better balance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aalgae 3aanadromous fish 3abasins 3afood webs 3afreshwater 3aherbivores 3ahydrochemistry 3ainvertebrates 3ajuveniles 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3aperiphyton 3aphosphorus 3apredators 3arivers 3asalmon 3aseasonal variation 3astable isotopes 3asubsidies 3asupply balance 3awinter 3aWashington (state)1 aCoe, H.

This study aimed to develop a low-cost UAV-based system for CH₄ monitoring over oil fields. The system consisted of an airborne sensor node, a ground station, and a laptop. The sensor node was comprised of low-cost gas sensors, a microcontroller, a LoRa wireless transceiver, a GPS module, and an SD card reader. The ground station included a microcontroller and a LoRa transceiver. Both the sensor node and the ground station were programmed using Arduino. A graphic user interface was created using LabVIEW for data logging and visualization on the laptop. A preliminary test showed that the system was capable of measuring CH₄ concentrations, along with temperature, humidity, and GPS location; while sending the real-time data to the ground station up to ∼1 km away without any loss. The system was further tested at two oil production sites in North Dakota. The results revealed a heterogeneous distribution of CH₄ over the sites due to flares and road traffic, demonstrating a potential application of the system for air quality survey and gas leakage detection. The advantage of this system lies in its light weight (∼540 g), low cost (∼$300), expandability, ease of deployment and operation. Data quality collected by the system depended on the gas sensors chosen. With advancement in sensor technologies, it is expected that the quality of monitoring data can be considerably improved in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3adata quality 3aenvironmental technology 3ahumidity 3aindustry 3aoils 3apetroleum 3asurveys 3atemperature 3atraffic 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3auser interface 3aNorth Dakota 0aAir quality monitoring 0amethane 0aoil fields 0aunmanned aerial vehicle 0aLoRa1 aYang, Xufei1 aZhou, Xiaobing0 tEnvironmental technology.g2021 Sept. 6, v. 42, no. 20 p.3154-3163dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2020.17241993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245015500184300001600339520166700355592002802022650001802050650002102068650001302089650000902102650001102111650001302122650001102135650001902146650003102165650002402196650001402220650001102234650001802245650001002263650001202273650001002285650001002295650001002305650001802315651003202333651001002365653001602375653001202391653001902403653001502422653001602437700001702453700001802470773013902488856008102627852000902708655001202717IND60650468420221119033521.0190710e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065046842DNAL7 a287706952pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853170006452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShriram, A.N.10aSpatial distribution of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in relation to geo-ecological features in South Andaman, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India  ap. 166-174.  aThe study was undertaken in South Andaman district, comprising three tehsils, viz. Port Blair, Ferrargunj and Little Andaman Tehsils, respectively. Intensive pupal infestation surveys were carried out along the National Highway (NH 223), the main passenger and trade route, referred to as Great Andaman Trunk Road. Sampling locations at every 3 km were geo-referenced with global positioning system unit. A total of 17314 water collections were examined from 29 locations across the South Andaman district, among which 1021 (5.9%) were colonized by immature stages of Aedes albopictus, Aedes aegypti and other mosquito species. Ae. aegypti were found in 12 locations, showing higher infestation in the densely built Aberdeen Bazaar. Breeding populations of Ae. albopictus were observed in 27 sampling locations. Both the species were not recorded in two Northern localities. In the areas where both the species are present, they were often found in the same developmental sites, suggesting convergent habitat selection. The most frequently encountered man-made, artificial and natural developmental sites were fixed cement tanks, plastic drums, plastic cans, metal drums, metal pots, discarded tires, coconut shells, leaf axils and tree holes. Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were observed in varying proportions in Port Blair and Ferrargunj Tehsils, while the former species appeared to be absent in Little Andaman. This study elucidates the spatial distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus with preponderance of the latter species, pointing towards arboviral transmission and assumes public health importance in South Andaman district, endemic for dengue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aAedes albopictus 3abreeding 3acans 3acement 3acoconuts 3adengue 3ageoreferencing 3aglobal positioning systems 3ahabitat preferences 3aimmatures 3aleaves 3apublic health 3apupae 3asurveys 3atanks 3atires 3atrade 3atree cavities 3aAndaman and Nicobar Islands 3aIndia 0aarboviruses 0avectors 0alarval ecology 0atopography 0aA&N islands1 aSiṿan, A.,1 aSugunan, A.P.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2018 Apr., v. 108, no. 2 p.166-174dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853170006453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245014000175300001400315520108400329592002801413650002601441650001901467650002601486650002001512650003101532650002101563650002701584650001501611650002201626650002001648650001801668650001901686653001701705653002901722653001901751653002001770653002101790700002401811700002301835700001801858700002301876700001401899700002501913773009401938856008502032852000902117655001202126IND60630133420221120085425.0190516e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063013342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2019.01.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaudevire, Elisabeth10aFate and removal of trace pollutants from an anion exchange spent brine during the recovery process of natural organic matter and salts  ap. 34-44.  aThe results of this sampling campaign on pilot scale processes aim to evaluate the occurrence and behavior of trace organic micro-pollutants and metal elements during anion exchange treatment of surface water and the subsequent treatment of generated spent brine with two types of electrodialysis membrane pairs. This knowledge is relevant to assess the quality and reusability of secondary products created during brine treatment; specifically the excess of sodium chloride to be recycled onsite and the natural organic matter, mostly consisting of humic substances, which find multiple applications in the agricultural industry. This study highlights that (1) the attachment mechanism of organic micro-pollutants to anion exchange resin occurs through electrostatic interaction and the subsequent transfer through ion exchange membranes is restricted by size exclusion; and (2) the complexation of trace metals compounds with the natural organic matter partly explains their removal by anion exchange. Complexes remain stable during treatment of the brine with electrodialysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aanion exchange 3aanion exchange resins 3aelectrodialysis 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahumic substances 3aion-exchange membranes 3apollutants 3apollution control 3asodium chloride 3asurface water 3atrace elements 0aMetal traces 0aOrganic micro-pollutants 0aAnion exchange 0aElectrodialysis 0aHumic substances1 aRadmanesh, Farzaneh1 aKolkman, Annemieke1 aVughs, Dennis1 aCornelissen, Emile1 aPost, Jan1 avan der Meer, Walter0 tWater research.g2019 May 01, v. 154 p.34-44dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.01.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008400166300001800250500001500268520122700283592002801510650001401538650002501552650001101577650001801588650001501606650002301621650001201644650001101656650001401667651000901681651002101690651001501711651001101726651001501737700002301752700001501775700002101790773009701811856004801908852000901956655001201965IND4469065220221117224849.0120515e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446906522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-011-0151-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChapman, John W.12aAnintroduced Asian parasite threatens northeastern Pacific estuarine ecosystems  ap. 1221-1236.  a2019-12-06  aThe introduced Asian parasitic bopyrid isopod, Orthione griffenis, was first discovered on the Pacific coast of North America in Washington in 1988 and next in California in 1992. The range of Orthione presently extends from British Columbia to Baja California, where it infests at least two species of the native estuary mud shrimp, Upogebia. Intense Orthione infestations are associated with the apparent demise of many local populations of Upogebia pugettensis yet nonindigenous origins of Orthione in North America and thus the ecological significance of its impacts have remained in doubt. Six criteria reveal that Orthione is introduced to North America: its conspecificity with disjunct Asian populations, its earliest (1950s) collections in Asia, its late discovery among symbiotic species associated with Upogebia, its historical absence, and its appearance in North America coincident with extensive new ballast water traffic from Asia. Orthione is the first recognized bopyrid isopod invasion globally. Coexistence of U. pugettensis, which are ecosystem engineers, with its newly acquired parasite cannot be assumed. Orthione threatens eastern Pacific estuary ecosystems where Upogebia were previously abundant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparasites 3aenvironmental impact 3acoasts 3aballast water 3aecosystems 3aindigenous species 3atraffic 3ashrimp 3aestuaries 3aAsia 3aBritish Columbia 3aCalifornia 3aMexico 0aWashington1 aDumbauld, Brett R.1 aItani, Gyo1 aMarkham, John C.0 tBiological invasions.g2012 June, v. 14, no. 6 p.1221-1236dSpringer-Verlagx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-011-0151-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009200169300001400261520135000275592002801625650001901653650000901672650003101681650001201712650001301724650001301737650001001750700002101760700002401781773009101805856008401896852000901980655001201989IND60098851220221121054417.0141105e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009885122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2011.12.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDutka, Barbara10aPore pressure changes accompanying exchange sorption of CO₂/CH₄ in a coal briquette  ap. 30-34.  aThe paper presents the study of CO₂/CH₄ exchange sorption in a coal briquette. The briquette was formed inside a heavy-walled steel pipe that served the purpose of a measuring chamber. The briquette with a porosity of 8.3%, a diameter of 0.096m and a length of 0.280m was used. Three laboratory experiments were conducted. The experiments consisted in CO₂ injecting onto the input of the briquette previously saturated with CH₄. In each experiment, during the exchange sorption process, the input CO₂ pressure and output gas mixture pressure were stabilized at the level of 11, 12 and 13bar at the input and 10bar at the output of the briquette. Pressure changes along the briquette and concentration of the gas mixture flowing out of the briquette were analyzed. It was observed that a pore pressure depression moving along the briquette accompanies the exchange sorption. The presence of the pore pressure depression indicated existence of a separated zone where exchange sorption takes place. It was also observed that from the moment that CO₂ appeared at the output of the briquette, sudden changes of its concentration were recorded. This phenomenon confirms the thesis of the exchange zone occurrence accompanying the CO₂/CH₄ exchange sorption in the briquette. A description method of the observed phenomenon was proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3alaboratory experimentation 3amethane 3aporosity 3asorption 3asteel1 aKudasik, Mateusz1 aTopolnicki, Juliusz0 tFuel processing technology.g2012 Aug., v. 100 p.30-34dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2011.12.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03458naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245008200204300001800286520190700304592002802211650002102239650002602260650001202286650001602298650002902314650002102343650001902364650002102383650001402404650001302418650001702431650001102448650002302459650001302482650001402495650002202509650001102531650001902542700001702561700001502578700001702593700001902610700005502629700005402684773012202738856008302860852000902943655001202952IND60770270920221116150908.0220314e20220216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077027092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.1c014282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jianzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5999-719710aVersatile Bilayer Hydrogel for Wound Dressing through PET-RAFT Polymerization  ap. 1112-1123.  aMultifunctional hydrogel-based wound dressings have been explored for decades due to their huge potential in multifaceted medical intervention to wound healing. However, it is usually not easy to fabricate a single hydrogel with all of the desirable functions at one time. Herein, a bilayer model with an outer layer for hydrogel wound dressing was proposed. The inner layer (Hₘ-PNₙ) was a hybrid hydrogel prepared by N-isopropylacrylamide and chitosan-N-2-hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride (HACC), and the outer layer (PVAₒ-PAmₚ) was prepared by polyvinyl alcohols and acrylamide. The two hydrogel layers of the bilayer model were covalently connected with excellent interfacial strength by photoinduced electron/energy transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization. The outer layer exposed to the ambient environment exhibited good stretchability and toughness, while the inner-layer hydrogel adhered to the skin exhibited excellent softness, antibacterial activity, thermoresponsivity, and biocompatibility. In particular, the inner layer of a hydrogel demonstrated excellent antibacterial capability toward both Staphylococcus aureus as Gram-positive bacteria and Escherichia coli as Gram-negative bacteria. Cell cytotoxicity showed that the cell viability of all Hₘ-PNₙ layer hydrogels exceeds 80%, confirming that the hydrogels bear excellent biocompatibility. In vivo experimental results indicated that the Hₘ-PNₙ/PVAₒ-PAmₚ bilayer hydrogel has a significant effect on the acceleration of wound healing, which was demonstrated in a full-thickness skin defect model showing improved collagen disposition and granulation tissue thickness. With these results, the established multifunctional bilayer hydrogel exhibits potential as an excellent wound dressing for wound healing applications, especially for open and infected traumas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aUrsidae 3aacrylamides 3aantibacterial properties 3abiocompatibility 3acell viability 3achemical bonding 3achlorides 3acollagen 3acytotoxicity 3aenergy 3agranulation tissue 3ahardness 3ahydrogels 3amedical treatment 3amodels 3apolymerization1 aMiao, Junkui1 aZhao, Ling1 aLiu, Zhibang1 aLeng, Kailiang1 aXie, Wancui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7010-12911 aYu, Yueqin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0564-21790 tBiomacromolecules.g2022 Feb. 16, v. 23, no. 3 p.1112-1123dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c014283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03898naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245015000165300001600315520171300331536051202044592002802556650002002584650001502604650001302619650002902632650002602661650002402687650001502711650001702726650001502743650001202758650001802770650003102788650001002819650001002829651001602839653001102855653002902866653002502895653002902920653002602949653002202975653001902997700002503016700002903041700002603070700001903096700002203115773011803137856008003255852000903335655001203344IND60647836420221117223401.0190621e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064783642DNAL7 a10.1177/03795721198338532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoyena, Eva A.10aAcceptance and Compliance With Micronutrient Powder and Complementary Food Blend Use by Filipino Mothers and Their Promotion by Community Workers  ap. 202-220.  aDespite the nationwide micronutrient powder (MNP) supplementation, the Philippines only saw limited success in reducing the prevalence of anemia—a condition that has remained a public health concern among young children. To assess and explore the acceptability and compliance to MNP and Bigas-Mongo (BigMo) complementary food blend among mothers/caregivers of children aged 6 to 23 months and the promotion of these products by community health workers (CHWs). This study was part of the randomized controlled trial involving 3 methods of data collection: (1) bimonthly visits to mothers and caregivers for 6 months to determine the level of acceptability and compliance of the 4 intervention groups; (2) initial and final interviews with mothers/caregivers (initial = 141; final = 130) to gather their experiences and difficulties in MNP and BigMo preparation and feeding; and (3) focus group discussion (n = 4) among CHWs (n = 13) to understand their perceptions and difficulties in promoting MNP and BigMo. The overall compliance to MNP consumption was 74.7%, with some difference between the groups. Analysis of the information received from mothers/caregivers showed that maternal adaptive strategies in preparing and feeding MNP to their children could affect MNP use, while nonreceptiveness of mothers to integrating MNP into the child’s feeding routine, perceived side effects, and perceived unfavorable taste and smell were key factors considered to limit MNP use. This study provides insights into MNP and BigMo acceptability and compliance by mothers and their promotion by CHWs, which may be useful in improving MNP program and complementary feeding projects and programs in similar settings.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research and/or authorship of this article: The study was funded by various organizations: Neys van Hoogstraten Foundation (NHF) of The Hague, The Netherlands; Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA); and the Department of Science and Technology through the Human Resource Development Program (HRDP) and the Science and Technology Human Resource Development Program (ASTHRDP).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acaregivers 3achildren 3acommunity health workers 3acomplementary feeding 3acomplementary foods 3acompliance 3afocus groups 3ainterviews 3amothers 3apublic health 3arandomized clinical trials 3asmell 3ataste 3aPhilippines 0aanemia 0amicronutrient deficiency 0amicronutrient powder 0acomplementary food blend 0acomplementary feeding 0aMNP acceptability 0aMNP compliance1 aBarba, Corazon V.

Specifically, essential oils (EO) are natural, complex liquids presenting various biological activities, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial and antifungal. Flavonoids are natural compounds with multiple pharmaceutical properties. The hydrophobicity and sensitivity of flavonoids and EOs, along with the high volatility of EOs impede their pharmaceutic, cosmetic and food applications, Thus, their encapsulation in a variety of carriers, in an effort to increase their bioavailability and stability is being sought out as a solution to the above problems. Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs) and Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLCs) are very promising drug delivery systems used for the controlled release and the effective protection of bioactive substances from external conditions, while presenting low toxicity and excellent biodegradability. This review covers the latest research on the encapsulation of essential oils and 10 different flavonoids in SLNs and NLCs, focused on the improvement of their biological responses and their potent applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3abiodegradability 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aflavonoids 3ahydrophobicity 3alipids 3atoxicity 0aSolid Lipid Nanoparticles 0aNanostructured Lipid Carriers 0aEssential oils1 aDetsi, Anastasia0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Dec. 05, v. 630 p.127529-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1275293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007400166300001400240520124000254592002801494650001501522650002101537650001501558650001401573650001101587650001501598650001001613650002101623650001801644650001201662650001101674650001401685700001501699700001801714773009101732856008401823852000901907655001201916IND60098851320221121054317.0141105e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009885132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2012.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarelli, L.10aH₂S absorption on activated carbons NoritRB1: CFD model development  ap. 35-42.  aMicro-CHP technologies based on fuel cells appear to be a good answer to growing worldwide demand for less polluting forms of energy.

In particular this paper deals issues relative to the clean-up system. Considering as powering system the methane gas distribution, in fact, a high degree of desulphurization is requested to avoid poisoning of the reformer and stack catalyst. Therefore, a parametric CFD model of a typical desulphurization reactor has been developed using experimental data obtained by the FClab of the University of Perugia. Particular attention has been devoted to the kinetic of the adsorption process of the hydrogen sulphide on activated carbons Norit RB1, used in the test session. The H₂S adsorption process has been modelled as a mass transfer process between the gas phase mix and the solid phase. The model has been developed and validated by means of further experimental data not used for the model development. This tool will allow, in future studies, to optimize the geometry of an innovative desulphurization system for residential application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3agases 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amass transfer 3amethane 3amodels 3apoisoning1 aBidini, G.1 aGallorini, F.0 tFuel processing technology.g2012 Aug., v. 100 p.35-42dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2012.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015700163300001600320520138200336592002801718596012401746596007101870650002501941650001801966650002501984650002302009650000902032650001202041650001102053650001102064650002102075650001302096650002002109650001102129650002402140650001102164650001402175650001302189650001302202650001502215650002502230700001502255700005502270700001302325773014302338856008302481852000902564655001202573IND60734247820221120032221.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073424782DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-021-03156-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Wei10aAssessment on the Coupling Effects of Drip Irrigation and Se-Enriched Organic Fertilization in Tomato Based on Improved Entropy Weight Coefficient Model  ap. 884-891.  aSelenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for human beings and plants are the current main sources of Se element in Asian diet. Therefore a feasible way to increase people’s Se intake is to increase Se content in plants. In this paper, we focus on how the tomato (Solanum Lycopersicum) yield and quality are influenced by the effect of irrigation amount, Se-enriched and high-calcium organic fertilizer and compound fertilizer amount respectively. The results from a two-year experiment show that the combination of Se-enriched organic fertilizer and compound fertilizer can significantly increase the tomato yield comparing with the use of NPK organic or compound fertilizer. It is also shown that by applying more Se-enriched and high-calcium organic fertilizer the contents of Se, Lycopene, Vitamin C (Vc) and soluble sugar in tomato fruit can be increased considerably. It was found that the highest Se content was achieved using 100% Se-enriched organic fertilizer combined with irrigation at 100% in 2016 and 100% Se-enriched organic fertilizer with irrigation at 80% in 2017. Deficit irrigation (80%) can help to increase Water Use Efficiency (WUE) and the Se and VC contents in tomato yield. Therefore in order to improve the Se-enriched tomato yield and quality, it is suggested to apply 100% Se-enriched organic fertilizer and adopt the deficit irrigation at 80%.  aPublisher supplied data  aGuiKe AA17202037, GuiKe AD19245169, GuiKe AD18281072cScientific Research and Technology Development Program of Guangxi  aYushikeneng 20194301cYulin Science and Technology Program Project 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aascorbic acid 3acompound fertilizers 3adeficit irrigation 3adiet 3aentropy 3afruits 3ahumans 3airrigation rates 3alycopene 3amicroirrigation 3amodels 3aorganic fertilizers 3apeople 3apollution 3aselenium 3atomatoes 3atoxicology 3awater use efficiency1 aZhu, Yulin1 aWang, Daobo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6512-66621 aWu, Ning0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2021 May, v. 106, no. 5 p.884-891dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03156-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03717naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245012900161300001800290520228300308592002802591650001302619650001902632650001602651650000902667650001802676650000902694650001802703650001002721650001202731650002802743650001602771650002602787650001302813650002502826650001302851650002902864650001102893653001802904653001802922653002102940700002002961773015302981856007903134961001303213852000903226655001203235IND60565088720221120132527.0190318e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056508872DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-120372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZanton, G.I.10aShort communication: Glucose kinetics in dairy heifers limit-fed a low- or high-forage ration at 4 levels of nitrogen intake  ap. 3718-3724.  aThe objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of level of forage and N intake on glucose kinetics in growing dairy heifers. Eight Holstein heifers (beginning at 362 ± 7 kg of body weight and 12.3 ± 0.4 mo of age) were fed 8 rations according to a split-plot, 4 × 4 Latin square design with rations containing either high (75% forage dry matter) or low (25% forage dry matter) levels of forage and 4 levels of N intake (0.94, 1.62, 2.30, 2.96 g of N/kg of metabolic body weight per day). Diets were limit-fed to maintain equal predicted metabolizable energy intake over the four 28-d periods; dietary N was increased through the substitution of high-N ingredients for corn. Blood samples were collected from all heifers at times throughout d 18 to 19 to characterize glucose concentration over the course of a day, and glucose tolerance tests were conducted over the last 8 d of each period (1 heifer/d) at 4 h before feeding. Glucose concentration transiently declined after feeding for all dietary groups, but we found no evidence of a differential response over time that could be attributed to diet. When averaged over a day, glucose concentration was affected by an interaction between level of forage and N intake; however, this response appeared related more to the level of starch in the diet than to the effects of either forage or N intake per se. Early-phase kinetic response of glucose disposal after an intravenous glucose bolus was not affected by dietary treatment, which is consistent with no difference in area under the curve through 30 min. Area under the curve through 120 min tended to linearly decrease with decreasing dietary N intake. This response corresponded to the kinetic analysis, in which heifers consuming higher N intake had an attenuated return to baseline glucose levels. Additionally, heifers consuming lower N intake maintained a period of glucose concentration below baseline before returning to baseline. We concluded that the response to an intravenous glucose bolus differs in dairy heifers fed diets differing in N intake, whereas forage level did not affect this response. This should be considered when formulating rations for low N intake by replacing high-N for high-starch feedstuffs when limit-feeding dairy heifers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3ablood sampling 3abody weight 3acorn 3adairy heifers 3adiet 3aenergy intake 3afeeds 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance tests 3aingredients 3aintravenous injection 3akinetics 3ametabolizable energy 3anitrogen 3anutritional intervention 3astarch 0adairy heifers 0alimit feeding 0aglucose kinetics1 aHeinrichs, A.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 May, v. 100, no. 5 p.3718-3724dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-120373Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245013400183300001600317520162700333592002801960650001501988650001202003650001302015650001502028650001402043650001302057650001102070650001402081650000902095650001102104650001402115650001502129650001802144650001502162650002202177650002902199650001102228650004102239650001802280651001002298651001002308700001402318700001602332700001502348700001702363773011202380856008102492852000902573655001202582IND50073519220221122015915.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007351922DNAL7 a239901272pmid7 a10.1007/s10653-013-9566-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrdoñez, A.10aArsenic input into the catchment of the River Caudal (Northwestern Spain) from abandoned Hg mining works: effect on water quality  ap. 271-284.  aIn Asturias (NW Spain) there are many abandoned mines, of which Hg mines are of particular significance from an environmental point of view, due to the presence of Hg and particularly As, which is found either in the form of specific (orpiment and realgar) or non-specific minerals (As-rich pyrite). The instability of these minerals leads to the presence of As-rich mine drainage and spoils heap leachates that enter surface waters or groundwaters. A study including the three most important Hg mines in the region (La Soterraña, Los Rueldos and El Terronal) has been conducted. Watercourses flowing through these mining areas are tributaries of the River Caudal, one of the most important rivers in the area. High concentrations of As were found in some of these waters, which were monitored over a period of three hydrological years and classified according to a water quality index. Those waters sampled close to the mines are generally of poor-to-bad quality, with low alkalinity and in some cases high metal content, but the quality of these waters improves with distance from the mines. The average mass load of As entering the River Caudal has been evaluated as: 200, 12 and 9,800 kg year⁻¹from La Soterraña, Los Rueldos and El Terronal mine sites, respectively. Despite the constant input of about 10 tonnes of As per year, the total As concentration remains below analytical detection thresholds on account of the river’s high water flow. Nevertheless, an important part of this As load is presumably retained in the river sediments, representing a potential risk of pollution of the aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3aarsenic 3adrainage 3aecosystems 3aleachates 3aminerals 3amining 3apollution 3arisk 3arivers 3asediments 3awater flow 3awater quality 3awatersheds 2aArsenicxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aMining 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Quality 3aSpain 0aSpain1 aSilva, V.1 aGalán, P.,1 aLoredo, J.1 aRucandio, I.0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2014 Apr., v. 36, no. 2 p.271-284dSpringer-Verlagx0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-013-9566-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002600171242016200197245017100359300001800530500002000548520168900568592002802257650002102285650002002306650001302326650002202339650001102361650001502372650002402387650001602411650002302427650002502450650001402475650001202489650004702501650001402548650002802562650002302590650002402613700002202637700001802659700002402677773010602701852000902807856008802816655001202904IND4408666020221118035203.0170712e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440866602DNAL7 a184770232pmid7 a10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00934.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouthwell, Darren M.,13aLa Sensibilidad del Análisis de Viabilidad Poblacional a la Incertidumbre sobre Requerimientos de Hábitat: Implicaciones para el Manejo de Isoodon obesulus10aThe Sensitivity of Population Viability Analysis to Uncertainty about Habitat Requirements: Implications for the Management of the Endangered Southern Brown Bandicoot  ap. 1045-1054.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhenever population viability analysis (PVA) models are built to help guide decisions about the management of rare and threatened species, an important component of model building is the specification of a habitat model describing how a species is related to landscape or bioclimatic variables. Model‐selection uncertainty may arise because there is often a great deal of ambiguity about which habitat model structure best approximates the true underlying biological processes. The standard approach to incorporate habitat models into PVA is to assume the best habitat model is correct, ignoring habitat‐model uncertainty and alternative model structures that may lead to quantitatively different conclusions and management recommendations. Here we provide the first detailed examination of the influence of habitat‐model uncertainty on the ranking of management scenarios from a PVA model. We evaluated and ranked 6 management scenarios for the endangered southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) with PVA models, each derived from plausible competing habitat models developed with logistic regression. The ranking of management scenarios was sensitive to the choice of the habitat model used in PVA predictions. Our results demonstrate the need to incorporate methods into PVA that better account for model uncertainty and highlight the sensitivity of PVA to decisions made during model building. We recommend that researchers search for and consider a range of habitat models when undertaking model‐based decision making and suggest that routine sensitivity analyses should be expanded to include an analysis of the impact of habitat‐model uncertainty and assumptions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsoodon obesulus 3adecision making 3ahabitats 3amodel uncertainty 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aresearchers 3athreatened species 3auncertainty analysis 3aviability 2aAnimals 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aEcosystem 2aMarsupialiaxphysiology 2aModels, Biological 2aPopulation Dynamics1 aLechner, Alex M.,1 aCOATES, TERRY1 aWintle, Brendan A.,0 tConservation biology.g2008 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.1045-1054dBlackwell Publishing Incx0888-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00934.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03785naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245011700168300001600285520181300301592002802114650001802142650001702160650001002177650001602187650001302203650002002216650001402236650002002250650001602270650002002286650001102306650001002317650001702327650003802344650001902382650002202401650001802423650002302441650002602464650001002490650002402500650001802524650002102542650000902563650001302572650003202585653003202617653003402649653002902683653002802712653000802740700001602748700001602764700001702780700001502797700001502812700001802827700001902845700001602864700001802880773009002898856009002988852000903078655001203087IND60634566220221119075725.0200210e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063456622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Li10aCardiovascular toxicity of decabrominated diphenyl ethers (BDE-209) and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) in rats  ap. 675-685.  aRecent reports indicated that decabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-209) and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) exist extensively in the environment. The toxicity of BDE-209 has been reported in quite a few studies, whereas the data of DBDPE are relatively rare. However, databases regarding cardiovascular toxicities of both BDE-209 and DBDPE are lacking. In this study, we investigated the vascular/cardiac trauma induced by DBDPE after oral exposure and compared the results with those of BDE-209 using rat model. Male rats were orally administered with corn oil containing DBDPE or BDE-209 (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) for 28 days, then oxidative stress, morphological and ultrastructural changes of the heart and abdominal aorta, levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), inflammatory cytokines, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the serum were monitored. Results showed that BDE-209 and DBDPE caused heart and abdominal aorta morphological and ultrastructural damage, serum CK and LDH elevation, and antioxidant enzyme activity changes. BDE-209 and DBDPE-induced inflammation was characterized by the upregulation of key inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Additionally, BDE-209 and DBDPE led to endothelial dysfunction, as evidenced by the ET-1 and ICAM-1 elevation. Our findings demonstrated that BDE-209 and DBDPE could induce oxidative stress, inflammation, and eventually lead to endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular injury. Compared to DBDPE, these toxic responses were stronger in the hearts and abdominal aorta of Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to BDE-209. Our findings indicated a potential deleterious effect of BDE-209 and DBDPE on the cardiovascular system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantioxidants 3aaorta 3ablood serum 3acorn oil 3acreatine kinase 3adatabases 3adiphenyl ethers 3aendothelins 3aenzyme activity 3aethane 3aheart 3ainflammation 3aintercellular adhesion molecule-1 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alaboratory animals 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amales 3aoral administration 3aoral exposure 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3atoxicity 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aBrominated flame retardants 0aDecabrominated diphenyl ether 0aDecabromodiphenyl ethane 0aCardiovascular toxicity 0aRat1 aSun, Yanmin1 aWang, Yuwei1 aLiang, Baolu1 aChen, Tian1 aZheng, Dan1 aZhao, Xuezhen1 aZhou, Xianqing1 aSun, Zhiwei1 aShi, Zhixiong0 tChemosphere.g2019 May, v. 223 p.675-685dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015100173300001600324520143100340592002801771650001501799650002501814650002601839650001001865650001801875650000901893650001301902650002101915650001101936650002001947650001501967650001601982700001901998773007802017856008402095852000902179655001202188IND60095310720221120115603.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009531072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2010.09.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVudumu, Shravan K.10aComputational modeling, validation, and utilization for predicting the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of hydrogen IC engines  ap. 647-655.  aHydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines are considered to be more efficient and cleaner alternatives to their fossil-fueled counterparts. Reasonably fast and accurate predictive computational tools are essential for practical design, control and optimization of hydrogen engines. To serve for this broader purpose, a computational model, which has been widely used for gasoline and diesel engines, is investigated for its capability to simulate hydrogen engines. Specifically, fuel-specific sub-models are first incorporated by properly accounting for hydrogen’s distinct properties such as flame speed and burn rate. The accuracy of the model is then assessed by validating it in comparison to independent experimental data. Finally, it is utilized to quantify the environmental impact of exhaust gas recirculation. With these improvements, the present predictive model is shown to capture the measured engine performance and emission data well under different operating conditions. In particular, the variations of peak in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, brake power, brake thermal efficiency, exhaust temperature, and NOₓ emissions are predicted close to the measured values. With the addition of a proportional-integral-derivative controller to the engine model, exhaust gas recirculation level is varied, resulting in nearly an order of magnitude reduction in NOₓ emissions during the present simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3aenvironmental impact 3aequipment performance 3afuels 3agas emissions 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3amodel validation 3amodels 3anitrogen oxides 3aprediction 3atemperature1 aKoylu, Umit O.0 tEnergy.g2011 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.647-655dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2010.09.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03735naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245011800176300001600294520181900310592002802129650001402157650001402171650001402185650001302199650001702212650001802229650001002247650002802257650001002285650003102295650001602326650002102342650001102363650002602374650002302400650001002423650003102433650002302464650001802487650002702505650001802532650001902550650001402569650001102583650002102594650002802615650002702643653003302670653001702703653002202720653002302742653001702765653002102782700002302803700002402826700002202850700002502872773007802897856008902975852000903064655001203073IND60545440320221119200554.0160902e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054544032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.03.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhamed, Maqusood10aComparative cytotoxic response of nickel ferrite nanoparticles in human liver HepG2 and breast MFC-7 cancer cells  ap. 278-288.  aNickel ferrite nanoparticles (NPs) have received much attention for their potential applications in biomedical fields such as magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery and cancer hyperthermia. However, little is known about the toxicity of nickel ferrite NPs at the cellular and molecular levels. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic responses of nickel ferrite NPs in two different types of human cells (i.e., liver HepG2 and breast MCF-7). Nickel ferrite NPs induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity in both types of cells, which was demonstrated by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT), neutral red uptake (NRU) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Nickel ferrite NPs were also found to induce oxidative stress, which was evident by the depletion of glutathione and the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. The mitochondrial membrane potential due to nickel ferrite NP exposure was also observed. The mRNA levels for the tumor suppressor gene p53 and the apoptotic genes bax, CASP3 and CASP9 were up-regulated, while the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 was down-regulated following nickel ferrite NP exposure. Furthermore, the activities of apoptotic enzymes (caspase-3 and caspase-9) were also higher in both types of cells treated with nickel ferrite NPs. Cytotoxicity induced by nickel ferrite was efficiently prevented by N-acetyl cysteine (ROS scavenger) treatment, which suggested that oxidative stress might be one of the possible mechanisms of nickel ferrite NP toxicity. We also observed that MCF-7 cells were slightly more susceptible to nickel ferrite NP exposure than HepG2 cells. This study warrants further investigation to explore the potential mechanisms of different cytotoxic responses of nickel ferrite NPs in different cell lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-9 3acysteine 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3adrugs 3aferrimagnetic materials 3afever 3agene expression regulation 3aglutathione 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amembrane potential 3amessenger RNA 3amitochondrial membrane 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anickel 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3atumor suppressor genes 0aNickel ferrite nanoparticles 0aHuman health 0aHuman liver cells 0aHuman breast cells 0aCytotoxicity 0aOxidative stress1 aAkhtar, Mohd Javed1 aAlhadlaq, Hisham A.1 aKhan, M.A. Majeed1 aAlrokayan, Salman A.0 tChemosphere.g2015 Sept., v. 135 p.278-288dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.03.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011600169300001800285520124700303592002801550650001701578650002301595650002101618650001601639650002101655650001301676650002101689650001301710650001301723650002501736650002401761650002901785650001801814650001701832650001701849653002301866653001701889653002101906653001901927653001601946700002001962700002301982700002502005773014802030856008602178852000902264655001202273IND60661102820221118141237.0210119e20190908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066110282DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2019.16486592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJehan, Sarvet10aEffect of Deficit Irrigation and Dairy Manure on Winter Wheat Yield, Soil Physical Health, and Nitrate Leaching  ap. 2003-2012.  aThe effect of deficit irrigation (DI) on wheat crop yield, soil physical parameters and on nitrate nitrogen movement in soil profile was evaluated under application of dairy manure and nitrogen fertilizer. Two levels of DI were taken as I₀.₆ (60% FC) and I₀.₈ (80% FC) along with two dairy manure levels (20 and 25 Mg ha⁻¹) and three nitrogen levels (80, 100, and 120 kg ha⁻¹). The grain yield was high under I₀.₈ than I₀.₆, whereas the irrigation level has no significant effect on soil organic carbon contents. Dairy manure, irrigation, and nitrogen indicated strong interaction with each other for all yield-related parameters during both years of study, however, results for 2nd year were highly positive. Soil nitrate nitrogen movement was significantly affected under I₀.₈ with high rate of dairy manure (25 Mg ha⁻¹) and nitrogen fertilizer (120 kg ha⁻¹). Results concluded that combined application of dairy manure (25 Mg ha⁻¹) and nitrogen fertilizer (120 kg ha⁻¹) under DI level I₀.₈ resulted in high grain yield. To overcome water scarce conditions, further experiments can be designed by addition of various organic matters in different combination that enhances the yield and soil health.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy manure 3adeficit irrigation 3afertilizer rates 3agrain yield 3airrigation rates 3aleaching 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil physical properties 3asoil profiles 3asoil quality 3awinter wheat 0aDeficit irrigation 0adairy manure 0anitrate nitrogen 0afield capacity 0asoil health1 aIqbal, Muhammad1 aZahir, Zahir Ahmed1 aFārūq, Muḥammad,0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2019 Sept. 8, v. 50, no. 16 p.2003-2012dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2019.16486593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012300166300001400289520108100303592002801384650002201412650002001434650001301454650001201467650002501479650001701504650002301521650000901544650001601553650002201569650002601591650001801617650000901635651001301644653001801657653002101675653001801696653001301714653002101727653001601748653002301764653002201787700001801809700002201827700002001849700002001869700001901889700001801908773012101926856008202047852000902129655001202138IND60577004820221118001633.0190405e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057700482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2017.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabaza, Molly10aTraditional fermentation and cooking of finger millet: Implications on mineral binders and subsequent bioaccessibility  ap. 87-94.  aThe aim of the present study was to explore the effect of traditional fermentation and cooking on mineral binders and subsequent bioaccessible iron and zinc contents of finger millet sour porridge consumed in Ushe communal area in Zimbabwe. Porridge products prepared from four traditional varieties of finger millet were collected and analyzed for proximate composition, mineral binders and subsequently in vitro iron and zinc bioaccessibility. Compared to the raw materials, phenolic compounds and condensed tannins were reduced by up to 41% and 35% respectively while phytic acid was reduced by 22–54% in one variety only. Iron and zinc bioaccessibility was 6% and 13% respectively, in the porridges and no improvement in bioaccessibility was observed as a result of processing as such bioaccessible iron and zinc contents only met less than 50% of the recommended daily intakes for children aged 9–11 months. A multidisciplinary approach is urgently needed to improve the iron and zinc contents and bioaccessibility of cereal based porridges from developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleusine coracana 3abioavailability 3achildren 3acooking 3adeveloping countries 3afermentation 3aheirloom varieties 3airon 3aphytic acid 3aproanthocyanidins 3aproximate composition 3araw materials 3azinc 3aZimbabwe 0aFood analysis 0aFood composition 0aFinger millet 0aMinerals 0aBioaccessibility 0aPhytic acid 0aPhenolic compounds 0aCondensed tannins1 aShumoy, Habtu1 aLouwagie, Lindsey1 aMuchuweti, Maud1 aVandamme, Peter1 aDu Laing, Gijs1 aRaes, Katleen0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2018 May, v. 68 p.87-94dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2017.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02112naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001900192245003900211300001400250506007600264520089900340592002801239506003701267650001401304650002601318650001601344650002501360650001801385650001301403650001101416650001301427650001501440650002301455650001801478700001901496773009301515856008501608852000901693655001201702IND60113449620221207131122.0141111e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011344962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.10.0052doi7 aPMC35349182pmcid7 a232604392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTasoglu, Savas10aBioprinting for stem cell research  ap. 10-19.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecently, there has been growing interest in applying bioprinting techniques to stem cell research.

However, in the other polymer system, when Kaolin/AA ratio reached 0.30, the highest water absorbency was obtained, 1941g/g in distilled water and 93g/g in physiological saline. That indicates kaolin is a potential material to enhance water absorbency of FP products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmorphophallus 3aacrylamides 3akaolin 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aJi, Jie1 aXia, Jun1 aLi, Bin0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 Jan. 4, v. 87, no. 1 p.757-763dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.08.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01740naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008500174300001400259520079900273592002801072650001401100650001601114650001101130650002301141650001701164650001301181650002501194700002001219773009301239856008501332852000901417655001201426IND60113449820221121053527.0141111e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011344982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClomburg, James M.10aAnaerobic fermentation of glycerol: a platform for renewable fuels and chemicals  ap. 20-28.  aTo ensure the long-term viability of biorefineries, it is essential to go beyond the carbohydrate-based platform and develop complementing technologies capable of producing fuels and chemicals from a wide array of available materials.

Here, we develop a new method for freshwater use based on the safe operating space (SOS) at watershed-level. The SOS is based on the concept of environmental flow requirements, which is the share of mean monthly flow that should be reserved to achieve or maintain “fair conditions” of aquatic ecosystems. The method is composed of two steps. First, water consumption is multiplied by a characterization factor, which converts it to an environmental impact, expressed as an area-equivalent of a watershed’s mean monthly flow. Second, the environmental impact is compared to an assigned share of SOS to determine if the activity causing it can be considered environmentally sustainable, with respect to a chosen principle for sharing the SOS.The method is demonstrated for a case study on water consumed for irrigation in open-field tomato production in 27 watersheds, spanning 10 countries and 5 continents, based on data for 316 farms in the year 2014. Water consumption was modelled from crop characteristics, climatic data and the assumed type of irrigation system. Two principles, “status quo” and “gross value added”, were illustratively applied for the assignment of SOS to 1 tonne of tomatoes.The characterization factors developed span two orders of magnitude from 10th to 90th percentile, which shows the relevance of a spatially and temporally explicit assessment. In the case study, the characterization factors largely determine the high variability in the resulting environmental impacts between watersheds, which ranged from 400 m² to 50,000 m² per tonne of tomatoes. The analysis would suggest that the freshwater use by current tomato farming is environmentally sustainable in all months in a maximum of 2 of the 27 watersheds with respect to the two principles applied for sharing the SOS.The method can be used as a basis to identify potential “planetary boundary hotspots” in the life cycle of products and to inform appropriate interventions. Two key challenges are the lack of appropriate spatial and temporal data in current life cycle inventories and the choice of sharing principle for assigning the SOS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acase studies 3acrop production 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental indicators 3afarming systems 3afarms 3afreshwater 3airrigation systems 3alife cycle inventory 3aproduct life cycle 3atomatoes 3avalue added 3awatersheds 0aAbsolute environmental sustainability assessment 0aEnvironmental flow requirements 0aSafe operating space 0aSharing principle 0aDecision support 0aPlanetary boundary hotspots1 aSim, Sarah1 aBoulay, Anne-Marie1 aKing, Henry1 aClavreul, Julie1 aLam, Wan Yee1 aBarbarossa, Valerio1 aBulle, Cécile1 aMargni, Manuele0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Mar., v. 110 p.105865-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.1058653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012200166300001600288520148000304592002801784596004501812650002201857650001001879650001801889650001901907650001201926650002001938653001701958653002101975653001801996653002602014653001902040700001602059700001502075700001702090700002002107773012602127856008302253852000902336655001202345IND60714162220221121040708.0210311e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071416222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japr.2020.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSellers, R.B.10aImpact of feed system augering on physical segregation of pelleted feed throughout an entire commercial broiler house  ap. 886-894.  aResearch using a commercial broiler house demonstrated physical/nutrient feed segregation as feed varying in percent pellets (PP) and manufacturing technique was augered throughout a feed line (FL); these factors impacted bird performance and uniformity. The current objective was to investigate feed flow and segregation of pellets and fines as a bin of feed is augered throughout a commercial feed system. Over 1.5 wk, feed manufactured at a commercial mill was delivered (n = 4) to an empty feed bin at a commercial broiler house; feeds averaged 84 PP. Within the house, there were 6 FL (feft and right for each front, middle, and back line) and on each FL, 3 feed pan locations (0, 25, and 50 m) from which samples were obtained. Augering time (AT; n = 9; 56 h) was represented by the 6.5-h period between sampling. A FL × feed pan location interaction demonstrated PP at 0 m was higher for the entire right FL; at 25 m, PP increased for all FL except for back FL; at 50 m, all PP decreased, with feed pan locations at right front and back FL decreasing by the greatest magnitude. For AT, there were slight fluctuations in PP from AT 1–7 and a stepwise increase occurred from AT 7–9; PP was highest at AT 9. Data demonstrate that PP can be affected by AT because of feed segregation within the feed bin. In addition, beginning PP and mechanical equipment variations among FL may have affected pellet attrition and ultimately physical segregation of feed.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199 3abins (containers) 3abirds 3amanufacturing 3apelleted feeds 3apellets 3apoultry housing 0afeed quality 0afeed segregation 0afeed augering 0acommercial production 0apellet quality1 aBrown, A.T.1 aTabler, T.1 aMcDaniel, C.1 aWamsley, K.G.S.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2020 Dec., v. 29, no. 4 p.886-894dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japr.2020.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01532naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014600156300001800302520031100320592002800631650001300659650002400672650002300696650002700719650001400746650001400760650002100774650001400795650000700809650001400816700001600830700001700846700002000863700001800883700001700901773013200918856007501050852000901125655001201134IND60659143120221121031651.0190827e20120104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065914312DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc15860k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zongmin10aCatalytic reactions of chlorite with a polypyridylruthenium(ii) complex: disproportionation, chlorine dioxide formation and alcohol oxidation  ap. 1102-1104.  acis-[Ru(2,9-Me₂phen)₂(OH₂)₂]²⁺ reacts readily with chlorite at room temperature at pH 4.9 and 6.8.

Mathews & L. Bolus  ap. 294-295.  aNAL-light  aWatsonia fourcadei is one of the widespread geophyte species of the fire-prone fynbos vegetation of South Africa that flowers profusely in the first year after a fire. Although much has been researched on fire-stimulated seed germination, the effect of wildfire on flower elicitation in fynbos geophytes is less well researched. Hence, a study was undertaken to investigate the role of gibberellic acid in stimulating flowering of W. fourcadei. The hypothesis tested was that the plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA₃₎ stimulates W. fourcadei plants to flower in situ. Unburned plants were injected with 2 ml of a solution of 50 µg GA₃/ml distilled water in early spring and their flowering percentage was three times higher than those of control plants that were injected with 2 ml of water, and the untreated plants. The flowering percentage of plants treated with GA₃ was equal to those of the plants found in the adjacent burned area.

The recombinant enzyme exhibited optimal activity at pH 4.5 and 55 °C, and retained more than 90% of the original activity after incubation at 50 °C for 60 min. The determined apparent K ₘ and V ₘₐₓ values using beechwood xylan were 10.43 mg/ml and 3246.75 IU/mg, respectively. The modes of action of recombinant HoXyn11B on xylo-oligosaccharides (XOSs) and beechwood xylan were investigated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), which indicated that the modes of action of HoXyn11B are different from HoXyn11A since it is able to release a significant amount of xylose from various substrates. This study provides an opportunity to better understand the hydrolysis mechanisms of xylan by xylanases from Trichoderma.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016A030310124cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China  a31600475cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a201707010241cProject of Guangzhou Science and Technology  a14GZP59HJ29cResearch fund from the Xiamen Southern Oceanographic center  a2015-27cFujian Provincial Department of Ocean and Fisheries  a20720150090cPresident Fund of Xiamen University 3amechanism of action 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3axylooligosaccharides 3aKomagataella pastoris 3axylan 3axylanases 3aTrichoderma 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3axylose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3agenes 3apH 3ahydrolysis 3aheterologous gene expression 3aenzyme activity 3athin layer chromatography 3adesorption1 aWu, Hongli1 aJiang, Fengjiao1 aWu, Jinlian1 aXue, Yong1 aGan, Lihui1 aLiu, Jian1 aLong, Minnan0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2018 Jan., v. 184, no. 1 p.228-238dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-017-2532-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04065naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245020500204300001800409520211700427592002802544596010402572596012702676596009302803650001602896650001502912650002602927650001502953650001802968650001202986650000902998650001403007650002703021650002303048650001703071650003003088650001503118650002003133650002003153650001603173650001703189650002503206650001003231700001603241700001803257700001703275700001703292773013403309856008303443852000903526655001203535IND60758730420221118071431.0220226e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075873042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10695-021-01004-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Weijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1008-658410aDietary sodium butyrate supplementation attenuates intestinal inflammatory response and improves gut microbiota composition in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) fed with a high soybean meal diet  ap. 1805-1819.  aThe study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary sodium butyrate (NaBT) supplementation on the gut health of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) fed with a high soybean meal diet. Three isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were formulated: a high fishmeal group (Control); a high soybean meal group (SBM), in which the 30% fishmeal protein in the Control diet was replaced by soy protein; and an NaBT group, in which 0.2% NaBT was added to the SBM diet. Each diet was fed to triplicate tanks (20 fish in each tank). After 8 weeks of feeding trial, the distal intestine and intestinal digesta of the fish in each treatment were sampled. The results showed that fishmeal replacement and NaBT supplementation did not affect fish growth performance. Dietary 0.2% NaBT supplementation improved intestinal morphology, increasing the villus width and villus height and reducing the width of lamina propria. The distal intestine of fish in the control and NaBT groups demonstrated lower activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and a lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content, compared with the fish in the SBM group. Moreover, the addition of 0.2% NaBT in the feed significantly decreased the expression of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) compared to the SBM diet. PCoA and UPGMA analyses based on weighted UniFrac distances demonstrated that intestinal microbial communities in the NaBT group were closer to those in the control group than to those in the SBM group. In addition, dietary 0.2% NaBT supplementation significantly increased the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and decreased the abundance of Tenericutes at the phylum level. Furthermore, the abundance of Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae_unclassified, and Lachnospiraceae_uncultured was significantly increased, while that of Mycoplasma was significantly decreased in fish intestine at NaBT group at the genus level. In conclusion, dietary NaBT supplementation had beneficial roles in protecting the gut health of largemouth bass from the impairments caused by soybean meal.  aPublisher supplied data  a13480088cthe Doctoral Scientific Research Foundation of Henan University of Science and Technology  a212102110368cthe Key Research and Development and Promotion of Special (Science and Technology) Project of Henan Province  a202110464058cNational College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program 3aBacteroides 3aFirmicutes 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aMycoplasma 3aanimal growth 3adigesta 3afish 3afish meal 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth performance 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amalondialdehyde 3asodium butyrate 3asoy protein 3asoybean meal 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avilli1 aZhang, Guo,1 aChen, Jialong1 aZhao, Xiaoyu1 aGao, Shiyang0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2021 Dec., v. 47, no. 6 p.1805-1819dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870056x0920-17427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-021-01004-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245014300213300001600356506007600372520138000448592002801828506003701856650001401893650002801907650002701935650001501962650002801977650001202005650002002017650002302037650001202060650001202072650001902084650001202103650001802115650001902133650002202152650001702174700002102191700002302212700001802235700002302253700003402276700002102310773009802331856008502429852000902514655001202523IND60566869520221207131240.0170413e20170519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056686952DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2017.12961692doi7 aPMC55002102pmcid7 a283234862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChikara, Shireen10aEnterolactone Induces G1-phase Cell Cycle Arrest in Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer Cells by Downregulating Cyclins and Cyclin-dependent Kinases  ap. 652-662.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFlaxseed is a rich source of the plant lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), which is metabolized into mammalian lignans enterodiol (ED) and enterolactone (EL) in the digestive tract. The anticancer properties of these lignans have been demonstrated for various cancer types, but have not been studied for lung cancer. In this study, we investigated the anticancer effects of EL for several nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines of various genetic backgrounds. EL inhibited the growth of A549, H441, and H520 lung cancer cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners. The antiproliferative effects of EL for lung cancer cells were not due to enhanced cell death, but rather due to G ₁-phase cell cycle arrest. Molecular studies revealed that EL decreased mRNA or protein expression levels of the G ₁-phase promoters cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)-2, -4, and -6, and p-cdc25A; decreased phosphorylated retinoblastoma (p-pRb) protein levels; and simultaneously increased levels of p21 ᵂᴬF¹/Cᴵᴾ¹, a negative regulator of the G ₁ phase. The results suggest that EL inhibits the growth of NSCLC cell lines by downregulating G ₁-phase cyclins and CDKs, and upregulating p21 ᵂᴬF¹/Cᴵᴾ¹, which leads to G ₁-phase cell cycle arrest. Therefore, EL may hold promise as an adjuvant treatment for lung cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadjuvants 3aantineoplastic activity 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell death 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acyclins 3adigestive tract 3agenetic background 3alignans 3alinseed 3alung neoplasms 3amammals 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasm cells 3aprotein synthesis 3atherapeutics1 aLindsey, Kaitlin1 aDhillon, Harsharan1 aMamidi, Sujan1 aKittilson, Jeffrey1 aChristofidou-Solomidou, Melpo1 aReindl, Katie M.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2017 May 19, v. 69, no. 4 p.652-662dTaylor & Francisx1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2017.12961693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009300164300001600257520129300273592002801566650002101594650001001615650001201625650001101637650002601648650002201674650002501696650002301721650002101744650002201765650001601787650004101803650001301844650001601857650001201873650001101885650001201896650001901908650001701927650001301944650001501957650003001972650001002002700002102012700001802033700001802051700002002069700001702089773010902106856008102215852000902296655001202305IND60579547120221120041417.0170822e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057954712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-017-0728-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzer, Nuray10aInvestigations on the role of cuticular wax in resistance to powdery mildew in grapevine  ap. 316-328.  aCuticular wax on the plant epidermis inhibits or enhances prepenetration events of powdery mildew (Erysiphe necator Schwein). We examined the role of cuticular leaf and berry waxes as a resistance mechanism in four grapevine genotypes (Italia × Mercan-174, Gürcü, Isabella, Özer Karası) resistant to powdery mildew after natural infection and inoculation. To understand cuticular wax properties, we determined the amount of wax and antifungal effects of thin layer chromatography (TLC) fractions from cuticular leaf and berry waxes, then assessed the chemical composition of fractions with different antifungal activities using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Susceptible genotypes Cabernet Sauvignon and Italia were used for comparison. Resistant and sensitive genotypes did not differ significantly in the total amount of wax on leaves and berries; however, 27 fatty acids, 26 alkanes, 6 terpenes, 4 indole derivatives and 4 ketones, and 3 amides, 3 phenols and 3 steroids were detected in fractions with high antifungal activity (≥75% inhibition of germination) in leaf and/or berry cuticular waxes of resistant genotypes only. These compounds may be evaluated as markers for powdery mildew resistance during genotype selection in a grapevine breeding program.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUncinula necator 3aVitis 3aalkanes 3aamides 3aantifungal properties 3abreeding programs 3achemical composition 3adisease resistance 3aepicuticular wax 3aepidermis (plant) 3afatty acids 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agenotype 3agermination 3aketones 3aleaves 3aphenols 3apowdery mildew 3asmall fruits 3asteroids 3aterpenoids 3athin layer chromatography 3awaxes1 aŞabudak, Temine1 aÖzer, Cengiz1 aGindro, Katia1 aSchnee, Sylvain1 aSolak, Erhan0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2017 Sept., v. 83, no. 5 p.316-328dSpringer Japanx1345-26307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-017-0728-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01632naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016600159300001800325520051500343592002800858650002400886650001400910650002300924650002700947650002000974650001800994650001301012650001201025700002401037700001701061773013201078856007501210852000901285655001201294IND60659143220221121052704.0190827e20120104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065914322DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc15864c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarahan, Senem12aA facile one-step synthesis of polymer supported rhodium nanoparticles in organic medium and their catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane  ap. 1180-1182.  aA new type of supported rhodium nanoparticles were reproducibly prepared from N₂H₄BH₃ reduction of [Rh(μ-Cl)(1,5-cod)]₂ without using any solid support and pre-treatment technique.

Therefore, accurate determination of Cre activity is critical to the interpretation of experiments using smooth muscle specific Cre. Methods and results: Two lines of smooth muscle protein 22 α-Cre (SM22α-Cre) mice were bred to floxed mice in order to define Cre transgene expression. Southern blotting demonstrated that SM22α-Cre was expressed not only in tissues abundant of smooth muscle, but also in spleen, which consists largely of immune cells including myeloid and lymphoid cells. PCR detected SM22α-Cre expression in peripheral blood and peritoneal macrophages. Analysis of SM22α-Cre mice crossed with a recombination detector GFP mouse revealed GFP expression, and hence recombination, in circulating neutrophils and monocytes by flow cytometry. Conclusions: SM22α-Cre mediates recombination not only in smooth muscle cells, but also in myeloid cells including neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. Given the known contributions of myeloid cells to cardiovascular phenotypes, caution should be taken when interpreting data using SM22α-Cre mice to investigate smooth muscle specific functions. Strategies such as bone marrow transplantation may be necessary when SM22α-Cre is used to differentiate the contribution of smooth muscle cells versus myeloid cells to observed phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSouthern blotting 3abone marrow transplant 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3amacrophages 3amice 3amonocytes 3amuscle protein 3amyocytes 3aneutrophils 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asmooth muscle 3aspleen1 aLi, Chao1 aFrieler, Ryan A.1 aGerasimova, Alena S.1 aLee, Soo-jung,1 aWu, Jing1 aWang, Michael M.1 aLumeng, Carey N.1 aBrosius, Frank C., IIIcIII1 aDuan, Sheng Zhong1 aMortensen, Richard M.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 June 15, v. 422, no. 4 p.639-642dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.05.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245011000204300001800314520120700332592002801539596007501567596007001642596007401712650002101786650001401807650001801821650002701839650001701866650001001883650001601893650002901909650001601938650002001954650002201974650001401996650001502010650001702025700001102042700001702053700001702070700001302087700001802100700001602118700001702134700001602151700001702167700005202184773012402236856008302360852000902443655001202452IND60782531620221121022834.0220710e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078253162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-022-07497-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Chuchu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4390-011910aArsenic trioxide increases apoptosis of SK-N-BE (2) cells partially by inducing GPX4-mediated ferroptosis  ap. 6573-6580.  aBACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial tumor in central nervous system threatening children’s health with limited therapeutic options. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been identified the cytotoxicity in NB cells but the potential mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we attempted to obtain some insight into the mechanisms of cell death induced by ATO in NB cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Proteomic analyses found that ATO can affect the signaling pathway associated with ferroptosis, including the upregulation of iron absorption (FTL, FTH1, HO-1), ferritinophagy (LC3, P62, ATG7, NCOA4) and modifier of glutathione synthesis (GCLM); downregulation of glutamine synthetase (GS) and GPX4, which was the critical inhibitor of ferroptosis. Western blot analysis revealing GPX4 expression in SK-N-BE (2) cells decreased after treatment with ATO (7.3 µM), resulting in a loss of GPX4 activity. Furthermore, Ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 partially blocked ATO-induced cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that ATO may induce ferroptosis in neuroblastoma cell SK-N-BE (2) by facilitating the downregulation of GPX4, ultimately resulting in iron-dependent oxidative death.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant 2017A030313806cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province  a2020A1515010127cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province  aGrant SYS-C-202007cSun Yat-Sen Clinical Research Cultivating Program 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3aarsenic oxide 3acentral nervous system 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3aferroptosis 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aglutathione 3airon absorption 3amolecular biology 3aneoplasms 3aproteomics 3atherapeutics1 aWu, Yu1 aChen, Yantao1 aXiong, Xilin1 aLi, Peng1 aPeng, Xiaomin1 aLi, Chunmou1 aWeng, Wenjun1 aZhu, Yafeng1 aZhou, Dunhua1 aLi, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1756-58470 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 July, v. 49, no. 7 p.6573-6580dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07497-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012300166300001800289520164700307592002801954596005801982596006302040596008402103596006202187650002302249650003202272650002102304650002302325650001202348650001802360650001002378650002202388650004302410650001402453700001302467700001502480700001702495700001502512773012402527856008302651852000902734655001202743IND60782531720221121022708.0220710e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078253172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-022-07501-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, ShangLe10aGene identification and functional analysis of a D-type cyclin (CCND2) in freshwater pearl mussel (Hyriopsis cumingii)  ap. 6601-6611.  aBACKGROUND: Cyclin D (CCND) plays an important role in the cell cycle and is a rate-limiting factor that facilitates the G1/S transition. METHODS: In this study, the full-length cDNA of Hc-CCND2 was isolated from freshwater pearl mussel (Hyriopsis cumingii; Hc) and amplified using the 3´/5´ RACE system. The Hc-CCND2 expression profiles were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR. Functional analysis of the Hc-CCND2 genes was examined by both RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression in H. cumingii. RESULTS: Hc-CCND2 protein sequences were 295 amino acids long, possessed D-type cyclin signature motifs and contained conserved cyclin box domains. Hc-CCND2 was expressed in all examined tissues (adductor, foot, visceral mass, gill, outer mantle, inner mantle and gonad), with the highest expression levels found in the gill (P < 0.05). During the different developmental periods of the embryo, the relative expression of Hc-CCND2 increased with embryonic development, peaking at the blastula stage and decreasing significantly in the gastrula stage. After knockdown of Hc-CCND2 by RNAi, a significant decrease in CDK6 expression levels was found, while the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase significantly increased. Overexpression of Hc-CCND2 in mantle cells led to increased proliferation of cultured cells (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that Hc-CCND2 may promote cell cycle progression in H. cumingii, and that overexpression of Hc-CCND2 promotes mantle cell proliferation. These findings may provide a novel approach for improving the slow proliferation rate of shellfish cells in in vitro cultures.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0901406cThe National Key R&D Program of China  a31872565cThe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aCARS-49cThe Earmarked Fund for Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System  a19XD1421500cProgram of Shanghai Academic Research Leader 3aHyriopsis cumingii 3aMargaritifera margaritifera 3aRNA interference 3acell proliferation 3acyclins 3aembryogenesis 3agenes 3amolecular biology 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ashellfish1 aWang, He1 aLi, XueNan1 aLi, Wenjuan,1 aBai, ZhiYi0 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 July, v. 49, no. 7 p.6601-6611dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07501-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04622naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245009700160300001700257520267500274592002802949650001302977650001302990650001203003650002503015650002303040650001003063650001903073650001603092650001403108650002203122650001903144650002003163650001603183650001303199650001203212650001803224650001403242650001603256650002003272650001303292650002103305650000703326650001903333650000903352650002303361650001703384650002103401650002303422650001103445650002403456650001203480650001803492650002503510650001003535650001103545653001303556653001803569653001303587653001603600700001303616700001703629700001503646773015203661856007803813852000903891655001203900IND60539460920221118160409.0201104e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053946092DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2013-71662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolder, H.M.10aEffects of feed additives on rumen and blood profiles during a starch and fructose challenge  ap. 985-1004.  aWe evaluated the effect of feed additives on the risk of ruminal acidosis in Holstein heifers (n=40) fed starch and fructose in a challenge study. Heifers were randomly allocated to feed additive groups (n=8 heifers/group): (1) control (no additives); (2) virginiamycin (VM); (3) monensin + tylosin (MT); (4) monensin + live yeast (MLY); and (5) sodium bicarbonate + magnesium oxide (BUF). Heifers were fed 2.5% of body weight (BW) dry matter intake (DMI) per day of a total mixed ration (62:38 forage:concentrate) and feed additives for a 20-d adaptation period. Fructose (0.1% of BW/d) was included for the last 10d of the adaptation period. On d 21, heifers were fed to target a DMI of 1.0% of BW of wheat, fructose at 0.2% of BW, and their feed additives. Rumen fluid samples obtained by stomach tube and blood samples were collected weekly as well as during a 3.6-h period on challenge day (d 21). Virginiamycin and BUF groups maintained a consistently high DMI across the 20-d adaptation period. The MLY heifers had low DMI of the challenge ration. Average daily gain and feed conversion ratio were not affected by feed additives. All rumen and plasma measures changed weekly over adaptation and over the challenge sampling period with the exception of rumen total lactate and histamine concentrations, plasma oxidative stress index, and ceruloplasmin. Substantial within- and between-group variation was observed in rumen and plasma profiles at challenge sampling. No significant group changes were observed in rumen total volatile fatty acids, propionate, acetate-to-propionate ratio, isobutyrate, caproate, isovalerate, total lactate, d- and l-lactate, and pH measures on challenge day. Acetate concentration was increased in the BUF and control groups on challenge day. Butyrate concentration was lower in the MLY and MT groups compared with other groups at challenge. Valerate concentrations were lowest in the control, VM, and BUF groups and lactate concentrations were numerically lower in the MLY, VM, and BUF groups. Total lactate concentrations were >10mM for each group throughout the challenge. Ammonia concentrations were lower in the MLY and MT groups. Histamine concentrations were decreased in MLY and increased in the VM and BUF groups. Plasma oxidative stress measures were not influenced by feed additives weekly or on challenge day, except for an increase in biological antioxidant potential in the control, VM, and MT groups on challenge day. Despite the large within-animal variation, all feed additives modified rumen function and may influence the risk of acidosis by different mechanisms; however, none stabilized the rumen in all heifers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aacetates 3aammonia 3aantioxidant activity 3aaverage daily gain 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3abody weight 3abutyrates 3adry matter intake 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3aferroxidase 3afructose 3aheifers 3ahexanoic acid 3ahistamine 3alactic acid 3amagnesium oxide 3amonensin 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3apropionic acid 3arisk 3arumen fermentation 3arumen fluids 3aruminal acidosis 3asodium bicarbonate 3astarch 3atotal mixed rations 3atylosin 3avirginiamycin 3avolatile fatty acids 3awheat 3ayeasts 0aacidosis 0afeed additive 0afructose 0alactic acid1 aCeli, P.1 aRabiee, A.R.1 aLean, I.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 Feb., v. 97, no. 2 p.985-1004dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-71663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03723naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001900192245011200211300001800323506007600341520166800417592002802085596013302113596002202246596001002268596009802278596003302376596005902409596009802468596005002566596008402616596003102700506003702731650001902768650001002787650001302797650002402810700001502834700001702849700001802866700002402884700002302908700001302931700001602944710001702960773012202977856008503099852000903184655001203193IND60672653120221207113511.0191017e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067265312DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty5572doi7 aPMC61292762pmcid7 a304231012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoqian10aQuantitative trait loci identification for brain endophenotypes via new additive model with random networks  ap. i866-i874.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) is critical to the study of causal relationships between genetic variations and disease abnormalities. We focus on identifying the QTLs associated to the brain endophenotypes in imaging genomics study for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Existing research works mainly depict the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the brain endophenotypes via the linear methods, which may introduce high bias due to the simplicity of the models. Since the influence of QTLs on brain endophenotypes is quite complex, it is desired to design the appropriate non-linear models to investigate the associations of genotypes and endophenotypes. In this paper, we propose a new additive model to learn the non-linear associations between SNPs and brain endophenotypes in Alzheimer’s disease. Our model can be flexibly employed to explain the non-linear influence of QTLs, thus is more adaptive for the complex distribution of the high-throughput biological data. Meanwhile, as an important computational learning theory contribution, we provide the generalization error analysis for the proposed approach. Unlike most previous theoretical analysis under independent and identically distributed samples assumption, our error bound is based on m-dependent observations, which is more appropriate for the high-throughput and noisy biological data. Experiments on the data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort demonstrate the promising performance of our approach for identifying biological meaningful SNPs.

Toxic contaminants in water pose a serious health threat to both humans and aquatic life. In terms of cost and performance, current remediation technologies are inadequate for eliminating low-concentration contaminants. Nanomaterials have unique advantages in this regard, including precisely adjustable surface areas, durability, and biocompatibility. Also, the surface functionalization of the nanoparticles can facilely be carried out to increase their selectivity and specificity towards a variety of pollutants. Among various nanomaterials the magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are promising class of nanomaterials due to their biocompatible, target-specific, easily regenerable, and reusable characters. They also feature simple separation techniques, high surface-to-volume ratios, and high adsorption rates. Based on these features their implication in wastewater treatment has dragged an enhanced amount of attention for the researchers. Therefore, MNPs provide a simple, low-maintenance alternative to traditional adsorbents for extracting contaminants from wastewater. Magnetic separation can reduce the environmental impact of MNPs in final effluents by managing the concentration of nanoadsorbents. MNPs are now in the development stage, however they are a promising treatment alternative for large-scale water treatment plants. The main objective of the present review is to focus on the efforts being carried out in the application of MNPs for the remediation of hazardous pollutants including organics, heavy metal ions, pharmaceutics, dyes, radioactive elements, and pathogens. Furthermore, the review present critical assessment and overview of a variety of magnetic nanomaterials and their applications to water and wastewater treatment.

Here, we identified climate and topographic controls on soil organic carbon storage along the Catalina Critical Zone Observatory that spans a significant range in mean annual temperature (>10 °C) and mean annual precipitation (>50 cm year⁻¹). Granitic soils were collected from divergent summit and convergent footslope positions in desert scrub, pine, and mixed conifer systems. Physical soil carbon distribution was quantified using a density and sonication technique to obtain the “free,” “occluded,” and heavy “mineral” soil carbon pools. We examined bulk soil (<2 mm) and density fractions using total carbon (%), stable isotopic composition (δ¹³C), and radiocarbon analyses (Δ¹⁴C). Desert scrub soils stored minimal soil carbon (<1% by weight) that was partitioned to the heavy mineral pool. Surprisingly, we identified depleted ∆¹⁴C in the bulk soil (−9 to −66‰) and mineral C fractions (−72 to −90‰) from subsurface weathered granite in the desert system. The transition to the productive P. pine ecosystem was met with more soil C (>3%) that partitioned evenly between the free light and mineral fractions. Soil C in the P. pine system also reflected the impact of a moderate severity fire in 2002 that led to modern ∆¹⁴C values for bulk soil and density fractions. The mixed conifer system contained a greater proportion of passive occluded C in the subsurface soils. We observed evidence for modern fire inputs into the surface soils of the mixed conifer system in combination with buried charcoal and occluded C associated with historic fire events. Convergent landscapes contained higher soil carbon stocks and depleted ∆¹⁴C relative to adjacent divergent landscapes, suggesting a landscape-level mechanism that includes the transport, burial, and preservation of soil carbon downslope. These data sets provide insights into ecosystem- and hillslope-scale variations in soil carbon storage across semiarid to subhumid environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3atopography 3ashrublands 3aconifers 3asoil organic carbon 3alandscapes 3amineral soils 3adata collection 3agranite 3acarbon sinks 3acarbon sequestration 3acharcoal 3aecosystems 3atemperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aArizona 0acarbon1 aHeckman, Katherine1 aRasmussen, Craig0 tBiogeochemistry.g2017 Aug., v. 134, no. 3 p.261-277dSpringer International Publishingx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-017-0360-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167300001600267520163700283592002801920650002101948650002201969650001101991650001002002650001702012650001002029650001202039650001502051650001402066650001602080650001402096650001302110650000902123650002702132700001802159700002302177773013202200856008202332852000902414655001202423IND60780977820221118090825.0220623e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078097782DNAL7 a10.1134/S20751117220200962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoginova, O.

In the 20th century, reindeer could not be found in Leningrad oblast. However, several dozen of them were brought from Murmansk oblast and the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug by 2020 and introduced in at least seven private menageries. As a result of studying feces of 34 imported reindeers carried out in 2018–2021, nematode larvae were isolated, whose morphological, morphometric, physiological and biological characteristics corresponded to those of E. rangiferi. Species identification was confirmed by subsequent molecular genetic studies. The discovery of larvae in the feces of second generation reindeer (born in 2018–2020) indicated the successful completion of the full life cycle by the helminth, which requires the participation of intermediate hosts such as terrestrial or freshwater gastropods. The following facts, including (1) the occurrence of reindeer infested with E. rangiferi in Leningrad oblast; (2) the presence of wild, agricultural, and zoo-kept ruminants capable of becoming definitive hosts for Elaphostrongylus in Leningrad oblast; (3) the spread of parasite larvae as a result of reindeers roaming freely in the forest, their lease and resale, and commercial sale of non-disinfected manure; (4) the ability of larvae to stay viable in feces and infected mollusks for about 2 years, withstanding freezing and drying; (5) high lethality among infected nonspecific hosts due to parasitic encephalomyelitis, pneumonia, etc.; and (6) the lack of treatment methods, all put ruminants of Leningrad oblast at risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaphostrongylus 3aRangifer tarandus 3aRussia 3adeath 3aencephalitis 3afeces 3aforests 3afreshwater 3ahelminths 3amorphometry 3apneumonia 3areindeer 3arisk 3aspecies identification1 aBelova, L.

A traditional randomized controlled trial is the gold standard but is likely practically impossible or prohibitively expensive to use for a general evaluation of a HHMP. Generalizability may also be poor because of the dynamics of the production contexts. In this study, we demonstrate an approach for evaluating the effects of an HHMP in the field, specifying an intervention theory for an ongoing HHMP in the context of the Danish dairy industry. As an example, we suggest one coherent analytical approach for studying the possible effects on milk production of systematic postpartum examinations of vaginal discharge, which is supposed to improve detection and treatment of metritis or endometritis. This routine is one component of the HHMP. The data consisted of 121 herds and 76,953 lactations over a 15-yr period. For parity group 1, the negative effects of metritis (despite treatment) on 305-d milk production after a normal calving were reduced by 116kg of energy-corrected milk after enrollment in the HHMP. For parity group 2 and parity group >2, enrollment in the HHMP resulted in a 129-kg and an 80-kg energy-corrected milk yield increase in milk production, respectively. The results indicate that effects of the HHMP existed, which were mediated through improved metritis detection. This study demonstrates the importance of a clear-cut intervention theory, although even with a theory, the research question can be too herd and context specific. In such a case, a within-herd randomized controlled trial study design seems to be the only way to achieve a valid result for a given herd, and acquiring valid results from an observational multi-herd study will be very difficult.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanalytical methods 3acalving 3adairy herds 3adairy industry 3aendometritis 3aexperimental design 3aherd health 3amilk 3amilk yield 3arandomized clinical trials 0ametritis 0aherd health management 0aevaluation1 aEnevoldsen, C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 Jan., v. 97, no. 1 p.552-561dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-55803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245009500176300001200271500001100283520175600294592002802050596002702078596001802105650005002123650003002173650001502203650001502218650002402233650002202257650001202279650001502291650001102306650000902317650000702326650000902333650001402342650001602356650001302372650001502385650001002400700002502410700007302435700001902508773012902527856008302656852000902739655001202748IND60780978020221118090824.0220921e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078097802DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-022-01703-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhury, Imran Rahman10aRemoval of lead ions (Pb2+) from water and wastewater: a review on the low-cost adsorbents  ap. 185.  aReview  aThe presence of lead compounds in the environment is an issue. In particular, supply water consumption has been reported to be a significant source of human exposure to lead compounds, which can pose an elevated risk to humans. Due to its toxicity, the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) have classified lead (Pb) and its compounds as probable human carcinogens. The European Community Directive and World Health Organization have set the maximum acceptable lead limits in tap water as 10 µg/L. The USEPA has a guideline value of 15 µg/L in drinking water. Removal of lead ions from water and wastewater is of great importance from regulatory and health perspectives. To date, several hundred publications have been reported on the removal of lead ions from an aqueous solution. This study reviewed the research findings on the low-cost removal of lead ions using different types of adsorbents. The research achievements to date and the limitations were investigated. Different types of adsorbents were compared with respect to adsorption capacity, removal performances, sorbent dose, optimum pH, temperature, initial concentration, and contact time. The best adsorbents and the scopes of improvements were identified. The adsorption capacity of natural materials, industrial byproducts, agricultural waste, forest waste, and biotechnology-based adsorbents were in the ranges of 0.8–333.3 mg/g, 2.5–524.0 mg/g, 0.7–2079 mg/g, 0.4–769.2 mg/g, and 7.6–526.0 mg/g, respectively. The removal efficiency for these adsorbents was in the range of 13.6–100%. Future research to improve these adsorbents might assist in developing low-cost adsorbents for mass-scale applications.  aPublisher supplied data  aRG 1409 -1cDSR, KFUPM  a2cDSR, KFUPM 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aagricultural wastes 3aaqueous solutions 3aforests 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3alead 3apH 3arisk 3atap water 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awater1 aChowdhury, Shakhawat1 aJafar Mazumder, Mohammad Abu,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2241-95961 aAl-Ahmed, Amir0 tApplied water science.g2022 Aug., v. 12, no. 8 p.185-185dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22883x2190-54877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-022-01703-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013600168300001600304520106600320592002801386650001701414650001901431650001001450650000901460650001601469650000901485650002001494650001201514650001801526650001401544650000701558650000901565650002101574650002401595650001801619700001901637700001601656700001401672700001801686700001801704700001901722700002601741773009801767856008501865961001301950852000901963655001201972IND60566870020221119163820.0170413e20170519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056687002DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2017.12998752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCray, Nicole10aEffects of Dietary Resistant Starch on the Wnt Signaling Pathway and Preneoplastic Cells in the Colons of Azoxymethane-Treated Rats  ap. 632-642.  aDietary resistant starch (RS) has been suggested to reduce colonic neoplasia. To determine the effects of digestion-resistant cornstarch on colonic carcinogenesis and Wnt signaling in azoxymethane (AOM)-treated F344 rats, diets containing naturally occurring RS from corn lines derived partially from Guat209 (GUAT), AR16035 (AR), or a hybrid (ARxGUAT), containing 34.5 ± 2.0, 0.2 ± 0.1, and 1.9 ± 0.1% RS, respectively, were fed at 55% of the diet. GUAT-fed rats had increased cecal content and tissue weight and decreased cecal pH compared with AR- or ARxGUAT-fed rats. Numbers of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) were not different among diet groups. Increased numbers of crypts/focus were observed in AOM-injected rats fed GUAT compared with rats fed other diets. β -catenin mRNA expression of the crypts was significantly increased in GUAT-fed rats injected with AOM relative to those injected with saline. These findings suggest that selected dietary RSs may at some level further enhance colonocyte proliferation and differentiation in an AOM-treated colon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazoxymethane 3acarcinogenesis 3acolon 3acorn 3acorn starch 3adiet 3agene expression 3ahybrids 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasms 3apH 3arats 3aresistant starch 3asignal transduction 3atissue weight1 aZhao, Yinsheng1 aFang, Yinan1 aLiu, Peng1 aPollak, Linda1 aDuvick, Susan1 aBirt, Diane F.1 aWhitley, Elizabeth M.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2017 May 19, v. 69, no. 4 p.632-642dTaylor & Francisx1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2017.12998753Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013000164300001800294520151900312592002801831650001601859650001001875650001101885650002001896650002001916650001001936650001401946650001801960653001101978653002301989653000802012653002102020653002102041700001402062700001302076700001502089700001902104700002002123773012802143856008302271852000902354655001202363IND60714163020221121143301.0210311e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071416302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japr.2020.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirai, R.A.10aImpact of varying starter amino acid density and energy on 42 d male Cobb MV × Cobb 500 broiler performance and processing  ap. 1004-1019.  aPrevious research has shown that feeding high amino acid density (AAD) diets or increased AME improved broiler performance, though the relationship between AAD and AME on performance needs to be further explored.

A 2 × 4 factorial arrangement of treatments was used, with day 0 BW considered as a covariant. On day 0 to 14, birds receiving HAA had the lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) corrected and uncorrected for mortality (uFCR). Birds receiving VLE diets had the highest day 0 to 14 FCR when compared to birds fed other AME levels. Feeding LE diets resulted in higher day 0 to 14 FCR when compared to ME and HE diets. An AAD × AME interaction for day 0 to 14 total Lys intake/bird found that Lys intake/bird decreased when increasing dietary AME for HAA diets. An AAD × AME interaction was observed for day 0 to 28 uFCR whereas increasing starter AAD in diets formulated to ME and HE increased day 0 to 28 uFCR; no change was observed for VLE and LE diets. However, overall performance and processing was not affected by varying starter AAD and AME levels. Further research should investigate similar feeding strategies, but in other feeding phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abirds 3aenergy 3afeed conversion 3afeeding methods 3amales 3amortality 3astarter diets 0alysine 0aamino acid density 0aAME 0alive performance 0aprocessing yield1 aMejia, L.1 aCoto, C.1 aCaldas, J.1 aMcDaniel, C.D.1 aWamsley, K.G.S.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2020 Dec., v. 29, no. 4 p.1004-1019dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japr.2020.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100003000192245008400222300001800306506007600324520179400400592002802194596008202222596006902304506003702373650002102410650001802431650001502449650001902464650001602483650001802499650001402517650001602531650002602547700002502573700001802598773012202616856008502738852000902823655001202832IND60672653520221207113518.0191017e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067265352DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty5612doi7 aPMC61292902pmcid7 a304230962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Jiménez, Beatriz10aFLYCOP: metabolic modeling-based analysis and engineering microbial communities  ap. i954-i963.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSynthetic microbial communities begin to be considered as promising multicellular biocatalysts having a large potential to replace engineered single strains in biotechnology applications, in pharmaceutical, chemical and living architecture sectors. In contrast to single strain engineering, the effective and high-throughput analysis and engineering of microbial consortia face the lack of knowledge, tools and well-defined workflows. This manuscript contributes to fill this important gap with a framework, called FLYCOP (FLexible sYnthetic Consortium OPtimization), which contributes to microbial consortia modeling and engineering, while improving the knowledge about how these communities work. FLYCOP selects the best consortium configuration to optimize a given goal, among multiple and diverse configurations, in a flexible way, taking temporal changes in metabolite concentrations into account. In contrast to previous systems optimizing microbial consortia, FLYCOP has novel characteristics to face up to new problems, to represent additional features and to analyze events influencing the consortia behavior. In this manuscript, FLYCOP optimizes a Synechococcus elongatus-Pseudomonas putida consortium to produce the maximum amount of bio-plastic (PHA, polyhydroxyalkanoate), and highlights the influence of metabolites exchange dynamics in a four auxotrophic Escherichia coli consortium with parallel growth. FLYCOP can also provide an explanation about biological evolution driving evolutionary engineering endeavors by describing why and how heterogeneous populations emerge from monoclonal ones.

Proper use of these tools, such as their immersion while working, is one of the important executive points in this field; in this study, trapezoidal flumes are used to measure the intensity of input and output flow in furrow irrigation. The proper method of installing these flumes was investigated in this article. For this purpose, during 60 irrigation operations, the results showed that in order to create free flow conditions in these flumes, and not to affect the downstream and upstream current, as well as increasing the accuracy of measurements, in addition to installing flumes in all directions, trapezoidal flume should be installed at a height of at least about 4 cm above the furrow bed; according to the irrigation operations, the percentage of immersion in the installation of the flume at a height of 4 cm from the furrow bed was observed as standard (less than 70% immersion) in order to reduce the percentage of flow measurement error in different depths of water entering the flume. The results also showed that for ensuring free flow in trapezoidal flumes, the flume should be installed at a height of 4 cm or more above the furrow bed, provided the input ridges are strengthened and the end flume is measured to measure the inflow to the furrow. The output current of the furrow should be installed in the floor of the furrow along the bed to prevent the passage of current, provided that after the outflow flume, the furrow bed should be deeper in terms of free flow. Observance of the points and results obtained in this study in furrow irrigation systems prevents errors in flow measurement and consequently increases the accuracy in the design and evaluation of furrow irrigation systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3afurrow irrigation 3afurrows 3ahydraulic flumes 3awater1 aOstad-Ali-Askari, Kaveh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5637-11240 tApplied water science.g2022 Aug., v. 12, no. 8 p.187-187dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22883x2190-54877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-022-01702-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012700163300001600290520105800306592002801364650001401392650002401406650001401430653003101444653002001475653003001495653002701525653002901552700001601581773008201597856008101679852000901760655001201769IND60121542520221116153901.0170124e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012154252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-015-0752-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Gang,10aMultiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann model for binary mixtures of nonideal fluids based on the Enskog kinetic theory  ap. 634-647.  aIn this paper, a lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) model with multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operator is developed based on the Enskog theory for isothermal nonideal mixtures, which is an extension of the previous single relaxation time (SRT) LBE model (Guo and Zhao in Phys Rev E 68:035302, 2003). The present MRT-LBE model overcomes some inherent defects of the original SRT-LBE model such as the fixed Schmidt number and limited viscosity ratio. It is also interestingly shown that the widely used Shan-Chen (SC) model, which is constructed heuristically based on the pseudo-potential concept, can also be regarded as a special case of the present model, and thus putting a solid foundation for this well-accepted multiphase LBE model. A series of numerical simulations, including the static droplet and layered co-current flow, are conducted to test the applicability of the present model for immiscible fluids with different Schmidt numbers and large viscosity ratio, which may be difficult for the original SRT-LBE model and the SC model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amathematical models 3aviscosity 0aLattice Boltzmann equation 0aEnskog equation 0aBhatnagar–Gross–Krook 0aSingle relaxation time 0aMultiple-relaxation-time1 aGuo, Zhaoli0 tScience bulletin.g2015 Mar., v. 60 p.634-647dElsevier B.V.x2095-92737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-015-0752-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245010400209506010400313506007600417520154400493592002802037506003702065650001902102650001602121650001102137650001302148650001102161650001602172650001002188650001002198650001802208651000902226651001202235651001102247653002102258653003002279653002002309653002802329653003002357700005802387700006302445700005502508773011302563856008602676852000902762655001202771IND60778806220221207084615.0220628e20220820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077880622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1323472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCloete, Schalk1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9641-293910aBlue hydrogen and industrial base products: The future of fossil fuel exporters in a net-zero world  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIs there a place for today's fossil fuel exporters in a low-carbon future? This study explores trade channels between energy exporters and importers using a novel electricity-hydrogen-steel energy systems model calibrated to Norway, a major natural gas producer, and Germany, a major energy consumer. Under tight emission constraints, Norway can supply Germany with electricity, (blue) hydrogen, or natural gas with re-import of captured CO₂. Alternatively, it can use hydrogen to produce steel through direct reduction and supply it to the world market, an export route not available to other energy carriers due to high transport costs. Although results show that natural gas imports with CO₂ capture in Germany is the least-cost solution, avoiding local CO₂ handling via imports of blue hydrogen (direct or embodied in steel) involves only moderately higher costs. A robust hydrogen demand would allow Norway to profitably export all its natural gas production as blue hydrogen. However, diversification into local steel production, as one example of easy-to-export industrial base products, offers an effective hedge against the possibility of lower European blue hydrogen demand. Looking beyond Europe, the findings of this study are also relevant for the world's largest energy exporters (e.g., OPEC+) and importers (e.g., developing Asia). Thus, it is recommended that large hydrocarbon exporters consider a strategic energy export transition to a diversified mix of blue hydrogen and climate-neutral industrial base products.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3anatural gas 3asteel 3atrade 3aworld markets 3aAsia 3aGermany 3aNorway 0aHydrogen economy 0aEnergy-intensive industry 0aDecarbonization 0aCO2 capture and storage 0aVariable renewable energy1 aRuhnau, Oliver1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9772-46161 aCloete, Jan Hendrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7854-16621 aHirth, Lion1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5563-33100 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Aug. 20, v. 363 p.132347-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1323473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04002naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003600134024002300170024004000193024002500233040001800258100002000276245008400296300001300380520208900393592002802482650004502510650001602555650001202571650001102583650002602594650002602620650001002646650001202656650002302668650002202691650001302713650001502726650001502741650001802756650001102774650001702785650002102802651001802823653003702841653001502878653002302893653002902916653001402945653001202959700002102971700005902992773011803051856008303169856011403252961001303366852000903379655001203388IND60674390920221214223804.0191231e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067439092DNAL7 a3646442aris7 a10113/67439092hdl7 a10.1016/j.rama.2019.10.0062doi7 a3646442seq_no_1157 a2070-21630-003-00D2aris_project_no7 a4361672aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNafus, Aleta M.10aNative Vegetation Composition in Crested Wheatgrass in Northwestern Great Basin  ap. 9-18.  aCrested wheatgrass, an introduced perennial bunchgrass, has been seeded extensively on the rangelands of western North America. There is a perception that this species is very competitive and that it forms monoculture or low diversity stands where successfully seeded. However, there is limited information on species composition in sites previously seeded to crested wheatgrass. We measured native vegetation and environmental characteristics in areas seeded with crested wheatgrass across the northwestern Great Basin. Plant community composition within these crested wheatgrass stands was variable, from seedings that were near monocultures of crested wheatgrass to those that contained more diverse assemblages of native vegetation, especially shrubs. Environmental factors explained a range of functional group variability from 0% of annual grass density to 56% of large native bunchgrass density. Soil texture appeared to be an important environmental characteristic in explaining vegetation cover and density. Native vegetation was, for all functional groups, positively correlated with soils lower in sand content. Our results suggest environmental differences explain some of the variability of native vegetation in crested wheatgrass stands, and this information will be useful in assessing the potential for native vegetation to co-occupy sites seeded with crested wheatgrass. This research also suggests that crested wheatgrass seedings do not always remain in near monoculture vegetation states as seedings substantially varied in native vegetation composition and abundance with some seeded areas having a more diverse assemblage of native vegetation. In half the sites, there were five or more perennial herbaceous species and 63% of sites contained Wyoming big sagebrush. Although not exclusively true, species most commonly encountered in crested wheatgrass seedings are those that are able to minimize competition with crested wheatgrass via temporal (i.e., Sandberg bluegrass, annual forbs, annual grasses) or spatial (i.e., shrubs) differentiation in resource use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis 3aPoa secunda 3aannuals 3abasins 3abotanical composition 3aenvironmental factors 3aforbs 3agrasses 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3amoieties 3aperennials 3arangelands 3asand fraction 3ashrubs 3asoil texture 3avegetation cover 3aNorth America 0aAgropyron cristatum (L.)

SSR survey resulted in identification of ~ 4638 perfect SSRs, with mean marker frequency 901 SSRs/Mb and densitiy of 11,006 bp/Mb aross the eight genomes. Frequency distribution graphs revealed hexa-nucleotide repeats were more prominent fowllowed by tri-, tetra-, di- and penta-nucleotides in the analysed genomes. We desinged 2927 SSR primers that are specific to the strain LMG 859 and ePCR confirmed on seven other Xap genomes. This resulted in identification of 542 informative SSRs that are producing single amplicons, from which 66 primers were successfully validated through wet lab experiments on eight Xap isolates of pomegranate. Furthermore, utility of these SSRs were demostrated by analysing molecular diversity among 22 Xap isolates using 20 Xap_SSR primers. SSRs revealed moderate genetic diversity among Xap isolates (61%) and grouped 11 isolates that are repersenting six different states into one cluster. This proved the earlier evidence of wider spread of ST3 type Xap acoss India using Multi locus Sequence Typing (MLST) technique.

Limited knowledge exists on the interactions between avian influenza viruses (AIV) and the environmental factors associated with poultry farms. To improve our existing understanding of AIV survival in various environmental conditions, experiments were conducted to investigate the persistence of AIV in reused poultry litter. Additionally, we investigated the effects of a litter acidifier, based on sodium bisulfate, as well as different composting temperatures on the survivability of this virus. The highly pathogenic AIV was found to persist much longer than low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) in litter material, regardless of the number of cycles the litter was used. No clear association was detected between litter cycle use and viral persistence. In terms of litter acidification, the acidifier amendment immediately inactivated LPAIV when directly mixed with the virus and in the presence of broiler litter. Differing results were obtained in turkey litter where the virus persisted less than 48 h. Finally, when testing composting temperatures, LPAIV was inactivated in litter after 30 min of viral contamination but before the target temperatures were reached. In carcass material with and without litter, LPAIV survived for less than 30 min, before reaching 50°C or 60°C, showing a detrimental effect on LPAIV survivability. These studies provide information that helps improve the understanding of interactions between environmental factors and AIV.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3aacidification 3aavian influenza 3acomposting 3aenvironmental factors 3afarms 3apoultry 3apoultry industry 3apoultry manure 3asodium sulfate 3atemperature 3aviral contamination 3aviruses 0aavian influenza 0apersistence 0alitter 0acompost 0acarcass1 aDerksen, T.1 aBiswas, S.1 aNazmi, A.1 aRejmanek, D.1 aCrossley, B.1 aPandey, P.1 aGallardo, R.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4727-82560 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2021 Mar., v. 30, no. 1 p.100096-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japr.2020.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01265naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245007600168300001600244520033000260592002800590650002100618650001200639650001600651650002100667650002300688650001000711651001500721700002000736700002400756773010200780856004800882852000900930655001200939IND4465018120221116140614.0121003e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446501812DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954120600262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayisbekova, A.

The net-zero pledges announced to date across many countries and private industries are insufficient to achieve carbon neutrality, which requires implementation of far-reaching and significantly scaled-up climate-positive actions. All technology options that pertain to deep decarbonization and carbon removal must be part of the mitigation portfolio. Transformative action plans must be established in which every individual/organization around the globe is an actor of changes in relation to net-zero goals. Such plans must involve governmental policy support but also encourage voluntary efforts to boost innovations, investments, initiatives, and behavioral changes. Recognition of these efforts is made quantifiable with the concepts of carbon handprint and net positivity. This paper presents a carbon handprint perspective on characterizing the environmental benefits of hybrid energy systems (HESs)—a widely applicable solution to cleaner production leveraging the capabilities of a portfolio of low-carbon energy sources—that provide heat and electricity to industrial processes. First, the carbon handprint and net positivity concepts and their calculation approach are introduced. The state of the art of HES-enabled industrial cogeneration is then surveyed, and the greenhouse gas emission intensities of different energy sources that power HESs are compared. Next, drawing on a case study about a US chemical facility's voluntary initiative to explore replacing its fossil fuel–based cogeneration infrastructure with a clean energy–generated HES, several technically viable scenarios are evaluated—especially those with small modular nuclear reactors—to illustrate how the positive-thinking handprint approach helps encourage and inform the search for widespread influence pathways in pursuit of net-positive sustainability. Finally, current knowledge gaps in the case study are identified, and opportunities to scale up the proposed handprint-based analysis are outlined with consideration of an expanded role of HESs in fulfilling climate objectives. It is envisioned that like-minded decision makers in the industry sector and beyond will adopt this perspective and act synergistically to enhance their environmental stewardship through voluntary actions and make greater contributions to the planet's climate future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenvironmental stewardship 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3aindustry 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 0aCarbon handprint 0aNet positivity 0aIndustrial decarbonization 0aHybrid energy system 0aNuclear energy 0aRenewable energy1 aHuning, Alexander J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1494-76011 aBurek, Jasmina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0186-91491 aGuo, Fengdi1 aKropaczek, David J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9111-86821 aPointer, W.

One hundred and twenty (n = 120) day-old Cobb chicks were fed corn-soybean meal–based diet containing 0% flaxseed (control), 10% whole flaxseed (diet 1), diet 1 + 0.05% carbohydrase enzyme (diet 2), diet 1 + 100% more Cobb 500 Met requirement (diet 3), and diet 1 + 0.05% carbohydrase enzyme + 100% more Cobb 500 Met requirement (diet 4) for 42 d. The data were analyzed by ANOVA with 5 treatments with 4 replications in a completely randomized design. At day 42, BW gain was the highest in control when compared to flaxseed-containing diets (P < 0.05). Dry matter TTR was higher in diet 3 and diet 4 than that in diet 1 and diet 2 (P < 0.05), and CP TTR was highest in diet 3 compared with that in diet 1 and diet 2 (P < 0.05). Supplementing Met increased linoleic and α-linolenic acid TTR in birds fed flaxseed (P < 0.05). Total and long-chain (≥20C) n-3 FA was higher in the thigh muscle of broilers fed diet 3 and diet 4 than in those fed diet 1, diet 2, and control (P < 0.05). Lipid oxidation products in the thigh muscle was the highest in birds fed diet 4 (P < 0.05). Jejunal villous height, villous perimeter, and villous surface area were highest in birds fed diet 1 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementing Met, or its combination with carbohydrase enzyme, increased DM, CP, and essential FA TTR and thigh muscle n-3 FA in broilers fed flaxseed. However, supplementing Met or its combination reduced BW gain and negatively affected jejunal morphology in broilers fed flaxseed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3aanalysis of variance 3abroiler chickens 3acarcass yield 3achicks 3adata analysis 3adiet 3aenzymes 3agrowth performance 3ajejunum 3alinoleic acid 3alinseed 3alipid peroxidation 3amethionine 3amuscles 3anutrient retention 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3asurface area 0abroiler 0aflaxseed 0an-3 fatty acid 0atotal tract retention 0ahistomorphology1 aAziza, A.E.1 aAwadin, W.1 aCherian, G.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2020 Dec., v. 29, no. 4 p.1033-1044dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japr.2020.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015200164300001800316520167100334592002802005650002102033650001202054650001502066650002102081650001002102650001502112650001302127650001402140653001302154653002502167653001702192653002002209700001602229700001802245700001602263700002002279773012802299856008302427852000902510655001202519IND60714163420221121080838.0210311e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071416342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japr.2020.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnnis, C.E.10aPhytase and carbohydrase inclusion strategies to explore synergy within low-energy diets to optimize 56-day male broiler performance and processing  ap. 1045-1067.  aResearch is needed to maximize the use of common feed enzymes, phytase and carbohydrase in combination. The objective was to determine effects of 2 phytase doses (PD; 250 [single dose] or 1,500 [super dose] FTU/kg) and 3 carbohydrase enzymes (xylanase [XAN]; mannanase [MAN]; or their combination [XM]) on 0- to 55-d broiler performance and processing (day 45 and 56). Enzymes were applied to a negative control (NC) diet formulated to 95% of breeder recommendations; Ca and available P reduced by 0.145%, and AME by 100 kcal/kg. A positive control diet only differing in AME was also tested, as well as NC alone; results were used for preplanned contrast comparisons. For the factorial, a 0- to 14-d interaction demonstrated optimal feed conversion ratio (FCR) for 1,500 FTU/kg + XM but worst for 250 FTU/kg + XM; feeding XAN regardless of PD brought FCR comparable to 1,500 FTU/kg + XM. Inclusion of MAN resulted in similar 0- to 14-d FCR to 250 FTU/kg + XM. Significant carbohydrase enzyme effects demonstrated maximized 0- to 44-d and 55-d BW and BW gain (BWG) for XAN. Tender yields (day 45) improved with 1,500 FTU/kg PD, but no day-56 PD significance. Foot pad dermatitis scoring was only significant for PD, with increased scores of 1 for 1,500 FTU/kg. Contrasts demonstrated improved day-0 to day-44 BWG and day-45 breast and drumstick weight for XAN + 1,500 FTU/kg vs. NC. Furthermore, feeding 1,500 FTU/kg + XAN increased day-45 scores of 0 and decreased day-56 woody breast scores of 2 when individually compared to NC and positive control. Overall data demonstrate performance/processing benefits for XAN and 1,500 FTU/kg alone and combined.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-mannosidase 3abreasts 3adermatitis 3alow calorie diet 3amales 3aphosphorus 3aphytases 3axylanases 0axylanase 0aphytase super dosing 0aβ-mannanase 0acarcass quality1 aJackson, M.1 aGutierrez, O.1 aCantley, S.1 aWamsley, K.G.S.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2020 Dec., v. 29, no. 4 p.1045-1067dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japr.2020.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245009800153520131100251592002801562650001701590650001101607650001401618650001501632650001601647650001101663650001901674651001601693700001801709700001701727773012901744856007401873852000901947655001201956IND60652624320221122064527.0190713e20180928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065262432DNAL7 a10.3390/su101034622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Ning10aUsing Location Quotients to Determine Public–Natural Space Spatial Patterns: A Zurich Model  aThe layout relationship between the public space system and the natural system of cities determines the trend of urban spatial forms. From the perspective of the integration of landscape architecture and urban design discipline, this paper generalizes three restriction/dependence relationship modes between urban public space and natural landscape layout: (1) overlapping mode, (2) separation mode, and (3) the mode of edge combination. Using Zurich, Switzerland, as a case study, this paper quantitatively explores the layout relationship between public space and natural landscape using the location quotient method. The research findings reveal an obvious layer distribution trend of Zurich urban public space and natural factors: the public space and mountain layout have a clear separation relationship. The regressive equation is PQ = &minus;0.188lnMQ + 0.660, forming the mutually supplementary mechanism of the advantageous resources of public activities. The Zurich model shows that when a proper relationship is established among the natural system and the urban public space, human activities, and the public activity centers of the city, the new system provides significant ecological and social benefits. This finding provides an exemplary reference for urban construction in other countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3aequations 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3amodels 3asocial benefit 3aSwitzerland1 aCheng, Yuning1 aXu, Xiaodong0 tSustainability.g2018 Sept. 28, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101034623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245009300157300002000250520156300270592002801833650001301861650002601874650001401900650002301914650002101937700001401958700001301972700002501985700001902010700001602029700001702045700002102062700001402083700001702097700001502114773013402129856007802263852000902341655001202350IND60541676720221120151633.0160822e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054167672DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b106142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yaowen10aMultifunctional Fullerene Derivative for Interface Engineering in Perovskite Solar Cells  ap. 15540-15547.  aIn perovskite based planar heterojunction solar cells, the interface between the TiO₂ compact layer and the perovskite film is critical for high photovoltaic performance. The deep trap states on the TiO₂ surface induce several challenging issues, such as charge recombination loss and poor stability etc. To solve the problems, we synthesized a triblock fullerene derivative (PCBB-2CN-2C8) via rational molecular design for interface engineering in the perovskite solar cells. Modifying the TiO₂ surface with the compound significantly improves charge extraction from the perovskite layer. Together with its uplifted surface work function, open circuit voltage and fill factor are dramatically increased from 0.99 to 1.06 V, and from 72.2% to 79.1%, respectively, resulting in 20.7% improvement in power conversion efficiency for the best performing devices. Scrutinizing the electrical properties of this modified interfacial layer strongly suggests that PCBB-2CN-2C8 passivates the TiO₂ surface and thus reduces charge recombination loss caused by the deep trap states of TiO₂. The passivation effect is further proven by stability testing of the perovskite solar cells with shelf lifetime under ambient conditions improved by a factor of more than 4, from ∼40 h to ∼200 h, using PCBB-2CN-2C8 as the TiO₂ modification layer. This work offers not only a promising material for cathode interface engineering, but also provides a viable approach to address the challenges of deep trap states on TiO₂ surface in planar perovskite solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aelectrical properties 3afullerene 3aphotovoltaic cells 3atitanium dioxide1 aZhao, Yue1 aChen, Qi1 aYang, Yang (Michael)1 aLiu, Yongsheng1 aHong, Ziruo1 aLiu, Zonghao1 aHsieh, Yao-Tsung1 aMeng, Lei1 aLi, Yongfang1 aYang, Yang0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 137, no. 49 p.15540-15547dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b106143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01540naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002800154245008500182300001600267520055800283592002800841650002200869650001300891650001200904650001300916653001400929653001900943653001600962653001500978653001400993773011001007856008801117852000901205655001201214IND60691506320221121002137.0200430e20100901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069150632DNAL7 a10.2752/175174410X126994327008632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerndon, April Michelle10aMommy Made Me Do ItbMothering Fat Children in the Midst of the Obesity Epidemic  ap. 331-349.  aThis article examines current trends in court cases, advice manuals and political campaigns that blame parents, and mothers more specifically, for their child's weight.

The study was an attempt to answer whether these recurring cases were due to treatment failure (in which case a search would have begun for a better treatment for Strep. uberis mastitis) or due to reinfection with a different strain of Strep. uberis. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), we determined that the majority of recurrences (20 of 27) were caused by a new strain of Strep. uberis, indicating that treatment of the initial infection had been successful. A small number of recurrences (5 of 27) were caused by the initial strain, indicating persistence. The remaining 2 recurrences occurred in a new quarter but with the initial strain of Strep. uberis, indicating either spread between quarters or reactivation of a previous subclinical infection. Analysis of the PFGE profiles failed to reveal any strain-specific propensity to persist, because strains causing recurrences occurred in most of the major clusters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus uberis 3acows 3afarmers 3amastitis 3amolecular epidemiology 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 0aStreptococcus uberis 0arecurrent clinical mastitis 0apulsed-field gel electrophoresis1 aSmooker, Peter1 aMalmo, J.q(Jakob),1 aDeighton, Margaret0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 Jan., v. 97, no. 1 p.285-290dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-70743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009600166300001600262520161600278592002801894650001401922650001801936650001601954650001601970650002701986650002802013650002002041650002102061650001702082650001802099650001002117650000902127650001902136650002102155650001602176650001402192650001602206650001502222650001702237700002402254700002102278700002202299700002402321700002202345700002502367700002102392773012802413856008202541852000902623655001202632IND60089590720221122172530.0141102e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008959072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasuda, Akiko10aDietary supplementation with fructooligosaccharides attenuates allergic peritonitis in mice  ap. 546-550.  aFructooligosaccharides (FOS) are a prebiotic supplement, which can enhance immunological responses in the host to activate mucosal immunity probably through regulation of gastrointestinal microflora. Nonetheless, the therapeutic potential of prebiotics on allergic pathologies has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the preventive and therapeutic effects of dietary supplementation with FOS on a murine model of allergic peritonitis induced by ovalbumin (OVA). Male C3H/HeN mice were intraperitoneally administrated with OVA (1μg) bi-weekly (Day 0–42, total four times) and were fed a diet containing 0 or 2.5% FOS ad libitum (Day 7–43). At Day 43, mice were killed and several parameters were evaluated. As results, supplementation with FOS alleviated OVA-related peritoneal inflammation characterized by trafficking of polymorphonuclear leukocytes such as eosinophils and neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity. Also, FOS significantly suppressed the protein level of interleukin (IL)-5 and eotaxin in the peritoneal lavage fluid elicited by OVA. In addition, a FOS-supplemented diet significantly reduced the serum allergen specific-IgG₁ level, whereas it significantly increased total IgA levels in the cecal contents as compared with a control diet in the presence of OVA. These results suggest that dietary supplementation with FOS can prevent/ameliorate allergic peritoneal inflammation induced by OVA. The efficacy can at least partially be associated with the regulation of Ig class switching and inhibition of the local expression of IL-5 and eotaxin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergens 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3aeosinophils 3afructooligosaccharides 3agastrointestinal system 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin A 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-5 3amales 3amice 3amicroorganisms 3amucosal immunity 3aneutrophils 3aovalbumin 3aperitonitis 3aprebiotics 3atherapeutics1 aInoue, Ken'ichirō,1 aSanbongi, Chiaki1 aYanagisawa, Rié,1 aIchinose, Takamichi1 aTanaka, Michitaka1 aYoshikawa, Toshikazu1 aTakano, Hirohisa0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 June 15, v. 422, no. 4 p.546-550dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01251naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009600156300002000252520024400272592002800516650001200544650003600556650002300592650002700615650002300642650001400665700002000679700001800699773013600717856007500853852000900928655001200937IND60659144520221120043925.0190827e20111129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065914452DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc15897j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dan-Dan10aSynthesis of isoindolinones via palladium-catalyzed C–H activation of N-methoxybenzamides  ap. 12789-12791.  aThe synthesis of isoindolinones from N-methoxybenzamides and alkenes has been achieved by Pd-catalyzed ortho sp² C–H activation and intramolecular oxidative amidation, which involve the cleavage of four bonds and formation of two bonds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3apalladium1 aYuan, Ting-Ting1 aWang, Guan-Wu0 tChemical communications.g2011 Nov. 29, v. 47, no. 48 p.12789-12791dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc15897j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245007500205300001600280500002000296520106900316592002801385596006901413596010101482596010001583650002601683650001101709650001201720650002301732700006101755700005901816700006001875773015701935856008002092852000902172655001202181IND60773391920221119211911.0220414e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077339192DNAL7 a10.1111/1467-8489.124632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrent, Daniel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7088-862910aReducing bias in preference elicitation for environmental public goods  ap. 280-308.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe recent stated preference literature emphasises the importance of incentive compatible elicitation methods, which depend on respondent beliefs that payment can be collected if provision occurs. We investigate this condition in a randomised field experiment where stated choices are incentivised financially. The objective of the treatment was to make choices salient by making each decision financially relevant and to increase the respondents' beliefs that future payments will be enforced. Our results show that the treatment increases estimates of the marginal utility of income, with the effect being economically and statistically significant for low‐income respondents. We develop a stylised theoretical framework that allows us to quantify the bias that is implied by the observed differences between the treated and control groups. We find that failure to account for respondents' doubts about payment coercion in an otherwise well‐designed survey inflates the marginal willingness to pay among low‐income respondents by a factor of at least 1.72.  aPublisher supplied data  a20110044cCooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities  aPEN04631cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture and Hatch/Multi‐State Appropriations  a1014400cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture and Hatch/Multi‐State Appropriations 3afield experimentation 3aincome 3asurveys 3awillingness to pay1 aGangadharan, Lata1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3827-30901 aLeroux, Anke D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5572-84591 aRaschky, Paul A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8033-29580 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g2022 Apr., v. 66, no. 2 p.280-308dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl55734x1364-985X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.124633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245008800160506011700248506007600365520140000441592002801841506003701869650002001906650002401926650001401950650001301964650001401977650002201991650002002013650001602033650001602049650001002065650001902075650001502094650000902109650001202118650002102130650001902151650000902170650001902179650001802198650001402216650001402230650002002244653000902264653002802273653001402301653001602315653001202331700002202343700005502365700001702420700001302437700001802450773012602468856008302594852000902677655001202686IND60714163720221207090510.0220621e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071416372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japr.2020.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Z.10aIron requirement in the infection of Salmonella and its relevance to poultry health  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIron is essential for DNA synthesis, respiration, energy metabolism, and key metabolic reactions intrinsic to life because of its capability to accept and release electrons easily and its indispensability for most of the creatures on the earth including bacteria and poultry. Salmonella species, the gram-negative foodborne facultative anaerobes, are notorious enteric pathogens that have a wild range of animal hosts, causing the deterioration of animal health, compromised animal welfare, enormous agricultural loss and medical burden around the world. Nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica (NTS) infections in poultry are the important cause of human salmonellosis. Poultry can be infected by NTS and have no obvious symptoms and are sold, transported and slaughtered as healthy animals. However, birds may carry in their intestine this organism undetected into the abattoir at the time of slaughter, thereby representing a food-safety risk for consumers. To reduce the risk of salmonellosis, the prevention of S. enterica serovars from colonization and invasion of the gut through limiting their iron acquisition can be an effective approach. This review summarizes the biological roles of iron and iron homeostasis in both Salmonella and poultry, competition for iron between Salmonella and hosts, and potential strategies targeting iron acquisitions to control Salmonella infection in poultry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA replication 3aSalmonella enterica 3aanaerobes 3abacteria 3aelectrons 3aenergy metabolism 3aenteropathogens 3afood safety 3ahomeostasis 3ahosts 3ahuman diseases 3aintestines 3airon 3apoultry 3apoultry diseases 3apoultry health 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asalmonellosis 3aserotypes 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 0airon 0anontyphoidal Salmonella 0ainfection 0ahomeostasis 0apoultry1 aLu, Ponzy,d1942-1 aAdewole, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5519-75391 aDiarra, M.S.1 aGong, J.1 aYang, Zhunhe,0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2021 Mar., v. 30, no. 1 p.100101-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japr.2020.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03999naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001500185245013000200300001200330506007600342520193200418592002802350506003702378650001902415650001402434650001902448650001902467650001002486650001602496650001502512650000902527650002302536650001202559650001602571650002002587650001002607650002002617650001202637650001202649650001802661650001102679650001802690650001102708650001602719650001002735650003102745650001802776650002302794650000902817650001202826650001502838650001602853650001802869650000902887650001002896700002002906700001902926700002102945700002202966700002302988700002003011700001803031700002003049773009703069856007803166852000903244655001203253IND60121543220221207060421.0150808e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012154322DNAL7 a10.1186/1743-7075-12-12doi7 aPMC43502822pmcid7 a257455052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKe, Jia-Yu14aThe flavonoid, naringenin, decreases adipose tissue mass and attenuates ovariectomy-associated metabolic disturbances in mice  ap. 628.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: Adverse metabolic changes associated with loss of ovarian function increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in postmenopausal women. Naringenin improves metabolic disturbances in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we tested the effects of naringenin on metabolic disturbances resulting from estrogen deficiency in ovariectomized mice. MATERIALS/METHODS: Ovariectomized C57BL/6 J female mice were fed a control diet (10% calories from fat) for 11 weeks. Mice either continued on the control diet (n = 9) or were switched to the control diet supplemented with 3% naringenin (n = 10) for the next 11 weeks. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry and activity was monitored by infrared beam breaks. Intra-abdominal and subcutaneous adiposity was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Blood biochemical measures of metabolic response included glucose, insulin, adipokines, and lipids. Lipid content in liver and muscle and expression of relevant genes in adipose tissue, liver, and muscle were quantified. RESULTS: Ovariectomized mice fed naringenin exhibited lower fasting glucose and insulin levels compared to controls, with over 50% reduction of intra-abdominal and subcutaneous adiposity. Plasma leptin and leptin mRNA in adipose depots were also decreased in mice fed a naringenin diet. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1/Ccl2) and interleukin 6 (IL-6/Il6) mRNA expression levels were significantly lower in perigonadal adipose tissue of naringenin-supplemented mice. We also observed that mice fed a naringenin diet had less hepatic lipid accumulation with corresponding alterations of hepatic gene expression associated with de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and gluconeogenesis. CONCLUSION: Dietary naringenin attenuates many of the metabolic disturbances associated with ovariectomy in female mice.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipose tissue 3aadiposity 3aanimal ovaries 3abeta oxidation 3ablood 3acalorimetry 3achemokines 3adiet 3aenergy expenditure 3afasting 3afatty liver 3agene expression 3agenes 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3ainterleukin-6 3aleptin 3alipid content 3alipids 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolic syndrome 3amice 3amuscles 3anaringenin 3aovariectomy 3apostmenopause 3arisk 3awomen1 aKliewer, Kara L1 aHamad, Essam M1 aCole, Rachel M.,1 aPowell, Kimerly A1 aAndridge, Rebecca,1 aStraka, Shana R1 aYee, Lisa D.,1 aBelury, Martha,0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2015 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.628-628dSpringer-Verlagx1743-70757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-12-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010000165300002000265500001100285520121100296592002801507596005901535650001601594650002301610650002401633650001801657650004301675650001401718650001301732650000901745650002201754700001301776700001401789700001701803773015501820856008301975852000902058655001202067IND60758732120221118071351.0220611e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075873212DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16781-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jielin10aAntibiotic exposure and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 65052-65061.  aReview  aTo investigate the association between antibiotic exposure and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Four electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library, were searched for all relevant studies, from inception until May 2021, without restrictions. Pooled odds risk (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was applied to evaluate the effect value. Nine studies counting a total of 3,924,272 participants were assessed in the systematic review and meta-analyses. By meta-analysis using no antibiotic exposure as the reference, antibiotic exposure has a higher risk for T2DM (OR=1.16; 95% CI, 1.10–1.22). Subgroup analyses suggested that the antibiotic exposure could significantly enhance the risk of T2DM in those whose age were more than 50 (OR=1.17; 95% CI, 1.08–1.25). Further stratified analysis indicated that the association was likely attributed to the chemical structure of antibiotics, but not to antibacterial type and mechanism of action. Our results may further support the possibility that antibiotic use in recent years was associated with increased risk of T2DM. More attentions and cautions should be taken by the physicians when prescribing antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data  a81570786cnational natural science foundation of china 3aantibiotics 3achemical structure 3amechanism of action 3ameta-analysis 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk 3asystematic review1 aLin, Yan1 aLiu, Yong1 aChen, Keyang0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Dec., v. 28, no. 46 p.65052-65061dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16781-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015000169300001400319520127700333592002801610650003301638650002301671650002001694650001601714650001001730650002501740650001301765650000901778650002601787650001601813650001801829650002701847650001301874650002501887650001001912650001201922653001901934653003501953653002701988653004002015653001602055653001602071700001802087700001702105700001502122773009002137856008502227852000902312655001202321IND60603249720221118004915.0180713e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060324972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Xiaohua10aRapid analysis of ractopamine in pig tissues by dummy-template imprinted solid-phase extraction coupling with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy  ap. 40-45.  aRitodrine has similar skeleton structure to ractopamine and it was selected as the dummy-template molecule to synthesize the molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs). The MIPs exhibited better selectivity to ractopamine than to the dummy-template molecule: the imprint factor for ractopamine was 8.9, while 7.6 for ritodrine. The MIPs were used as sorbents in solid-phase extraction for selective enrichment of ractopamine, and some key parameters were optimized. After that, a rapid surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy method was developed for analysis of ractopamine and isoxuprine in pig tissue samples. Under the optimal conditions, good linearity was achieved in the range of 20.0–200.0μg/L for ractopamine and isoxsuprine at 842cm⁻¹ and 993cm⁻¹, respectively. The limits of detection were 3.1–4.3μg/L, which were lower than the maximum allowed by U. S. Food and Drug Administration. The recoveries of ractopamine and isoxsuprine were 72.4–79.7% and 71.0–78.2% for the spiked pork and pig liver, respectively, while the relative standard deviations ranging from 7.4% to 13.0%. The results suggest that the proposed method is sensitive and selective, and it has good potential on the quantitative analysis of trace amounts of β-agonists in complex samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aRaman spectroscopy 3adetection limit 3aisoxsuprine 3aliver 3amolecular imprinting 3apolymers 3apork 3aquantitative analysis 3aractopamine 3arapid methods 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 3astatistical analysis 3aswine 3atissues 0aDummy-template 0aMolecularly imprinted polymers 0aSolid-phase extraction 0aSurface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy 0aRactopamine 0aPig tissues1 aYan, Kuanglin1 aXu, Xianfang1 aLi, Gongke0 tTalanta.g2015 June 01, v. 138 p.40-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245006900209520188600278592002802164650001202192650002202204650002102226650000902247650004602256650001702302650002102319650001202340650001802352650004302370650002602413650001302439650006602452650002202518650003302540650001302573653001602586653001802602653002202620653002002642653001402662700001702676700002002693700003102713700005602744700002002800773011702820856008602937852000903023655001203032IND60654474520221119190959.0190807e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065447452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.1115992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReis, Sofia F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6817-077610aRecovery of added value compounds from cork industry by-products  aThe generated residues from cork industry are granulated and reused for the production of agglomerates, yet there is a percentage of those residues not valorised due to the small granulometry size denominated as cork powder. The extraction of high valuable compounds such as ellagitannins and condensed tannins from these cork residues were studied using different experimental approaches. For the extractions, a response surface methodology (RSM), using aqueous solutions of two green solvents such as acetone and ethanol, was used. Acetone was the best organic solvent due to the high yield of extraction achieved and less results variability. Using cork powder the extraction efficiency increased due to the increase on the yield of extraction (5.8 ± 1.0 mg ellagic acid equivalents/ g cork powder and 4.3 ± 0.8 mg proanthocyanidin fraction equivalents/ g cork powder) by using less solvent concentration (60% acetone) and extraction time (9h30). Twenty-three ellagitannins were tentatively identified by HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS in the tannin-rich extract of both corks granulate and powder, five of them being reported for the first time in cork extracts: vescalin, castalin, guajavin B/ eugenigrandinin A, vescavaloninic and castavaloninic acids. Other complex ellagitannins such as glycosylated structures up to DP3 of acutissimin A/B and guajavin B/ eugenigrandinin A, other oligomeric ellagitannins and a glycosylated dimer of gallocatechin linked to vescalagin/castalagin were tentatively identified by MALDI-TOF. These compounds recycled from undervalued cork industry residues may be further used in technological applications in different industrial fields, hence contributing for a circular economy. The results indicate that the recovery of these high valuable compounds using this methodology can add value and sustainability to this cork transformation chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aaqueous solutions 3acircular economy 3acork 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aellagic acid 3aepigallocatechin 3aethanol 3aglycosylation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindustrial byproducts 3aindustry 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3aproanthocyanidins 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolvents 0aCork powder 0aEllagitannins 0aCondensed tannins 0aHPLC-ESI/DAD-MS 0aMALDI-TOF1 aLopes, Paulo1 aRoseira, Isabel1 aCabral de Noroña, Miguel,1 aMateus, Nuno1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9318-97321 aFreitas, Victor0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 140 p.111599-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.1115993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245011100209300001600320520082000336592002801156650004401184650000901228650001601237650001301253650006601266650004401332650001101376650001901387650001201406650000901418653001101427653001601438653001701454653001201471653002401483653001501507700001401522700001901536700002101555700001601576700001601592700001701608773011201625856008601737852000901823655001201832IND60526500920221119190454.0190408e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052650092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.11.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJahanshahi, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8025-690010aMALDI-TOF, 13C NMR and FT-MIR analysis and strength characterization of glycidyl ether tannin epoxy resins  ap. 177-185.  aThe chemical modification of tannin through epoxidation is a way to develop new applications for tannins and to improve tannin resins performances.

Skye terrier hepatitis is a distinct disease entity and may be derived from a disorder of intracellular bile metabolism culminating in disturbed bile secretion and the accumulation of copper.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3ahepatitis 3acopper 3aliver 3ahistopathology 2aAnimals 2aCopperxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aDog Diseasesxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aHepatitis, Animalxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aHistocytochemistry 2aLiverxanalysisxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMale 2aNecrosis 2aPedigree1 aRutgers, H.

The hairy roots of Arnebia hispidissima were regenerated by the infection of Agrobacterium rhizogenes (ATCC 15834). These regenerated hairy roots were biotized with selected five strains of Azotobacter chroococcum. The biotization was developed for the enhancement of the yield of medicinally important alkannin and shikonin derivatives. The nitrogenase activity (96±0.381nmol C2H4 hairy root−1), fresh weight (58±0.340mghairyroot−1) and dry matter contents (21±0.349mghairyroot−1)), total nitrogen contents (24±0.635mghairyroot−1)) and concentration of phytochemicals were significantly enhanced 2–3 times more in biotized hairy roots while these contents were lower in the hairy roots of control group. The accumulation of propionylalkannin was reached its maximum peak (86±0.290mg/g fraction) at the cell density of 105CFUml−1 on the 11th day of harvesting of biotized hairy roots of A. hispidissima. The observed results provide novel approach into the application of A. chroococcum for the yield enhancement of alkannin and shikonin derivatives in hairy roots of A. hispidissima.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArnebia hispidissima 3aAzotobacter chroococcum 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3adry matter content 3aethylene 3aharvesting 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogenase 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3aroots 3ashikonin 0aArnebia hispidissima 0aAzotobacter chroococcum 0aAlkannin and shikonin derivatives 0aBiotization 0aHPLC and gas chromatography1 aSharma, Ram Avtar0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2016 Mar., v. 81 p.169-175dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.11.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010200168300001600270520095100286592002801237650002201265650001101287650002501298650002801323650000701351650001401358650001401372650001801386650001301404650001301417650001301430650001101443651001101454700002301465700001901488700001701507700001801524700001901542700002001561700001901581773009201600856008101692852000901773655001201782IND60439871320221121051120.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043987132DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617150501122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarnachuk, O.

Although this process was convincingly shown to occur in acidic waste of metal recovery, few isolates of acidophilic/acid-tolerant sulfate reducers are known. We isolated a new acidophilic sulfidogen, strain BG, from the oxidized acidic waste of the Bom-Gorkhon tungsten deposit, Transbaikalia, Russia. Phylogenetic analysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence made it possible to identify it as a member of the genus Desulfosporosinus. Unlike other known acidophilic sulfate reducers of this genus, strain BG was tolerant to high copper concentrations (up to 5 g/L), could grow on organic acids at low ambient pH, and formed crystalline copper sulfides (covellite and chalcopyrite). Molecular analysis of the phylotypes predominating in oxidized waste and in enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of various Desulfosporosinus strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfosporosinus 3amining 3anucleotide sequences 3aorganic acids and salts 3apH 3aphylogeny 3aphylotype 3aribosomal RNA 3asulfates 3asulfides 3atungsten 3awastes 3aRussia1 aKurganskaya, I.

Results obtained show that the initial deprotonation of RDX by hydroxide leads to nitrite elimination and formation of a denitrated cyclohexene intermediate. Further nucleophilic attack by hydroxide onto cyclic CN double bond results in ring opening. It was shown that the presence of hydroxide is crucial for this stage of the reaction. The dominant decomposition pathway leading to a ring-opened intermediate was found to be formation of 4-nitro-2,4-diazabutanal. Hydrolytic transformation of its byproduct (methylene nitramine) leads to end products such as formaldehyde and nitrous oxide. Computational results are in a good agreement with experimental data on hydrolysis of RDX, suggesting that 4-nitro-2,4-diazabutanal, nitrite, formaldehyde, and nitrous oxide are main products for early stages of RDX decomposition under alkaline conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3acyclohexenes 3aformaldehyde 3anitrites 3anitrous oxide 0aHexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine 0a4-Nitro-2,4-diazabutanal 0aMechanism 0aUV–VIS spectra1 aGorb, Leonid1 aHill, Frances C.1 aLeszczynska, Danuta1 aOkovytyy, Sergiy I.1 aLeszczyński, Jerzy,0 tChemosphere.g2015 Sept., v. 134 p.31-38dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.03.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245018300168300001400351520113500365592002801500650001101528650002101539650001501560650001701575650002401592650001201616650001901628700002201647700002101669700002101690700002001711773010501731856008601836990002301922852000901945655001201954IND60113213420221117082733.0141111e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011321342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yijun10aDifferential pulse techniques in weakly supported media: Changes in the kinetics and thermodynamics of electrode processes resulting from the supporting electrolyte concentration  ap. 13-23.  aSquare wave voltammetry (SWV) and differential multipulse voltammetry (DMPV) in weakly supported media are investigated. The numerical simulation procedures reported in literature (Streeter et al., J. Phys. Chem. C 112 (2008) 13716–13728; Limon-Petersen et al., J. Phys. Chem. C 114 (2010) 2227–2236) for electrochemical experiments in low conductivity solutions is applied with success. From this theory, the influence of the concentration of supporting electrolyte on the voltammograms is discussed for different redox couples and at electrodes of different size. The variation of the peak current and peak potential due to migration and ohmic drop effects are reported. The theory is applied to the experimental study of the one-electron reduction processes of cobaltocenium and cobalt (III) sepulchrate at mercury hemispherical electrodes of 25μm radius. The kinetic parameters and formal potential are obtained in a wide range of support ratio from the SWV and DMPV voltammograms. Possible changes of the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the electrode reactions are analyzed as a function of the level of support.  aPublisher supplied data 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3amathematical models 3amercury 3athermodynamics1 aBarnes, Edward O.1 aLaborda, Eduardo1 aMolina, Ángela,1 aCompton, R.

Mildly heated SlAEW (23 mg/L available chlorine, pH at 5.5) was used to treat the carrots, followed by rinsing with tap water (TW) for 2 min at 4 °C, and its effectiveness as a disinfectant was evaluated. The physicochemical properties of the carrots were determined and a comparison was made between treatments with SlAEW at room temperature (18 °C), TW at 18 °C and mildly heated TW at 45 °C. Results show that total aerobic bacteria, mold and yeast populations were significantly lower after mildly heated SlAEW treatment. Mildly heated SlAEW treatment reduced the total aerobic bacteria by 2.2 log₁₀ CFU/g and molds and yeasts by >1.9 log₁₀ CFU/g compared with TW treatment. Color indices of hue and chroma of sample surfaces were not affected by mildly heated SlAEW treatment and there were insignificant differences in hardness or the ascorbic acid and β-carotene contents of sliced carrots. The use of mildly heated SlAEW is suggested as an effective disinfection method for fresh cut carrots with low available chlorine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3abacteria 3acarrots 3achlorine 3acolor 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3ahardness 3aheat treatment 3apH 3atap water 3atemperature 3ayeasts1 aShitanda, Douglas1 aNote, Mizuho1 aCao, Wei0 tFood control.g2011 , v. 22, no. 3-4 p.452-456dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2010.09.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01510naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002100146245007300167300001600240500001500256520053300271592002800804650002200832650000900854650001800863650001200881650002000893653000900913700002000922700001700942700001600959773010600975852000901081856008201090655001201172IND8900146220221118000113.0181009e198811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890014622DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985888025006012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarpenter, J.

A model to assess the relevance of some thermal and electric factors. Application to the Spanish case study  ap. 850-863.  aDeployment of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) is already a reality for electricity supply and the debate whether distributed generation is going to replace almost totally or partially the current centralized generation paradigm is currently in place. Technical and economic advantages of DER have been addressed in the literature although regulation has also played a central role in DER deployment. This paper aims at contributing to that debate. Firstly, the advantages of both paradigms are reviewed and the cost recovery problem of the existing centralized related stranded costs discussed. Secondly, an optimization model, formulated to specifically address the discussion comparing both configuration paradigms. Main factors affecting the debate are identified and represented in the model: investment and operation costs, flexibility system requirements, demand response capabilities, building thermal demands, network investments and losses, and access-fee design, among others. Thirdly, a realistic case study, based on Spain, is presented and some qualitative conclusions extracted. Such kind of model is useful to undertake country specific studies either to perform sensitivity analysis revealing the relevance of the factors involved and the direct and indirect relationships among technologies, or to analyze the more efficient system configuration and align regulatory decisions towards it.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aelectricity 3aenergy resources 3amodels 3aSpain 0aDistributed energy resources 0aCentralized generation 0aDistributed generation 0aEnergy storage 0aDemand response1 aSánchez-Miralles, A.1 aRivier, M.1 aCalvillo, C.F.0 tEnergy.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 134 p.850-863dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013400163300001200297520161900309592002801928596005901956596009302015650002102108650002402129650001302153650001602166650001602182650001102198650001102209650002902220650002002249650001502269650001602284650001502300650001202315650002802327650001602355700001202371700001802383700001702401700005502418773012002473856008302593852000902676655001202685IND60753148320221118191849.0220521e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075314832DNAL7 a10.1186/s13068-021-02050-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Duoduo10aEngineering Escherichia coli for highly efficient production of lacto-N-triose II from N-acetylglucosamine, the monomer of chitin  ap. 198.  aBACKGROUND: Lacto-N-triose II (LNT II), an important backbone for the synthesis of different human milk oligosaccharides, such as lacto-N-neotetraose and lacto-N-tetraose, has recently received significant attention. The production of LNT II from renewable carbon sources has attracted worldwide attention from the perspective of sustainable development and green environmental protection. RESULTS: In this study, we first constructed an engineered E. coli cell factory for producing LNT II from N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) feedstock, a monomer of chitin, by introducing heterologous β-1,3-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, resulting in a LNT II titer of 0.12 g L⁻¹. Then, lacZ (lactose hydrolysis) and nanE (GlcNAc-6-P epimerization to ManNAc-6-P) were inactivated to further strengthen the synthesis of LNT II, and the titer of LNT II was increased to 0.41 g L⁻¹. To increase the supply of UDP-GlcNAc, a precursor of LNT II, related pathway enzymes including GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase, glucosamine synthase, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase, were overexpressed in combination, optimized, and modulated. Finally, a maximum titer of 15.8 g L⁻¹ of LNT II was obtained in a 3-L bioreactor with optimal enzyme expression levels and β-lactose and GlcNAc feeding strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic engineering of E. coli is an effective strategy for LNT II production from GlcNAc feedstock. The titer of LNT II could be significantly increased by modulating the gene expression strength and blocking the bypass pathway, providing a new utilization for GlcNAc to produce high value-added products.  aPublisher supplied data  a31922073cnational natural science foundation of china  a2020B020226007ckey-area research and development program of guangdong province national 3aEscherichia coli 3aN-acetylglucosamine 3abiofuels 3abioreactors 3abreast milk 3acarbon 3achitin 3aenvironmental protection 3afeeding methods 3afeedstocks 3aglucosamine 3ahydrolysis 3alactose 3asustainable development 3avalue added1 aWu, Hao1 aZhu, Yingying1 aZhang, Wenli1 aMu, Wanmeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6597-527X0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.198-198dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-021-02050-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008000159300001200239520136000251592002801611650001501639650001901654650002201673650000901695650001301704650001401717650004301731650002601774650001101800650002401811650001801835650002101853650001401874650000901888650001101897700002401908773012101932856007402053852000902127655001202136IND60548265720221117195532.0160903e199710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054826572DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029739442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Kwang-il10aGastrointestinal absorption of phenytoin from an oil-in-water microemulsion  ap. 480.  aThe absorption profile of phenytoin Na emulsion were examined compared to that of phenytoin suspension after oral administration in the rat. The corn oil-in-water emulsion, particle size of 184±57.8 nm, was prepared using a microfludizer, and phenytoin Na added by shaft homogenizer. The phenytoin emulsion or suspension, 100 mg/kg, were intubated intragastrically using oral dosing needle and blood samples were withdrawn via an indwelling cannula from the conscious rat. Plasma concentrations of phenytoin were measured with HPLC using phenacetin as an internal standard. The plasma concentration versus time data were fitted to a one compartment open model and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the computer program, Boomer. The phenytoin plasma concentrations from the emulsion at each observed time were about 1.5–2 times higher than those from the suspension, significantly at time of 5, 6 and 7 hr after administration. The absorption (kₐ) and elimination rate constant (kₑ) were not altered significantly, however the AUC increased from 65.6 to 106.7 μg·hr/ml after phenytoin suspension or emulsion oral administration, respectively. From an equilibrium dialysis study, the diffusion rate constant (kIE) was considerably higher from the phenytoin Na emulsion (0.0439 hr⁻¹) than phenytoin suspension (0.0014 hr⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ablood sampling 3acomputer software 3acorn 3adialysis 3aemulsions 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aintestinal absorption 3amodels 3aoral administration 3aparticle size 3apharmacokinetics 3aphenytoin 3arats 3asodium1 aBourne, David W.

The cells of strain ME were gram-negative motile vibrios (0.4–0.6 × 1.3–2 µm) with a single flagellum. The strain grew at 20 to 39°C (growth optimum at 34–37°C), pH 5.8 to 8.5 (pH optimum at 6.8–7.5), and salinity from 0.08 to 1.1 M Na⁺ (optimum at 0.2–0.3 M Na⁺). In the presence of sulfate, the strain grew autotrophically with hydrogen or on lactate, formate, pyruvate, fumarate, and malate. Weak growth occurred on succinate, glycerol, and fructose. In the absence of sulfate, the strain was able to ferment pyruvate, malate (weakly), but not lactate. Sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, and dimethyl sulfoxide were used as electron acceptors. Vitamins and yeast extract were not required for growth. The G + C content was 52.4 mol %. Predominant fatty acids were C18:0 (13.9%), C16:0 (9.6%), iso-C16:0 (9.5%), C18:1ω7 (8.8%), anteiso-C15:0 (8.1%), and iso-C17:1 (7.2%). The fatty acid composition was close to that of D. dechloracetivorans BO and has some similarity to that of D. portus. Based on its genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, strain ME maybe considered as a new species, for which the name Desulfovibrio hontreensis sp. nov. is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfovibrio 3abiofouling 3acoasts 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3aflagellum 3afructose 3aglycerol 3ahydrogen 3amalates 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphylogeny 3apyruvic acid 3aribosomal RNA 3asalinity 3asodium 3asuccinic acid 3asulfates 3asulfur 3athiosulfates 3avitamins 3ayeast extract 3aSouth China Sea 3aVietnam1 aOsipov, G.

This study investigated elimination of MET by UV/chlorine process systematically. The degradation of MET in the process well fitted pseudo first-order kinetics. Decreasing pH from 9 to 5 raised the rate constant from 0.0199 min−1 to 0.1485 min−1, possibly ascribed to change in species distribution and apparent quantum yields of radicals. Scavenging experiments indicated that both HO and Cl contributed to the degradation of MET, and that HO was the dominant species in the pH range studied. The second-order rate constant between Cl and MET was determined to be (5.64 ± 0.1) × 109 M−1 s−1. Three products were identified by UPLC-Q-TOF MS and degradation pathway was thus proposed. Significant amounts of chlorinated disinfection by-products (DBPs) were produced and 1,1,1-TCP was the dominant (83.6%–92.3%) in the UV/chlorine process. The kinetic model developed fitted well with experimental results, and was used to examine the effects of typical water parameters, such as chorine dosage, pH, inorganic anions, NOM and real water matrix. Furthermore, removal efficiency of MET by the UV/chlorine process were assessed in terms of electrical energy per order (EE/O).

Sensor I was developed using tetraheptylammonium bromide (THB) as an anion exchanger with 2-nitrophenyl octyl ether (2-NPOE) as a plasticizer for the determination of the anionic drug pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (PAN). To determine the cationic drug itopride hydrochloride (ITH), two electrodes (sensors II and III) were developed using potassium tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl) borate (KTCPB) as a cation exchanger with dioctyl phthalate (DOP) as a plasticizer. Selective molecular recognition components, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (2-HP βCD) and 4-tert-butylcalix[8]arene (tBC8), were used as ionophores to improve the selectivity of sensors II and III, respectively. The proposed sensors had a linear dynamic range of 1×10⁻⁵ to 1×10⁻²molL⁻¹ with Nernstian slopes of −54.83±0.451, 56.90±0.300, and 51.03±1.909mV/decade for sensors I, II and III, respectively. The Nernstian slopes were also estimated over the pH ranges of 11–13, 3.5–8 and 4–7 for the three sensors, respectively. The proposed sensors displayed useful analytical characteristics for the determination of PAN and ITH in bulk powder, in laboratory prepared mixtures and in combined dosage forms with clear discrimination from several ions, sugars and some common drug excipients. The method was validated according to ICH guidelines. Statistical comparison between the results from the proposed method and the results from the reference methods showed no significant difference regarding accuracy and precision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3aborates 3abromides 3acations 3adrug formulations 3adrugs 3aelectrodes 3aguidelines 3aionophores 3apH 3aphthalates 3aplasticizers 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apotassium 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asodium 3asugars 0aAnionic exchanger 0aIonophore 0aIon selective electrodes 0aItopride hydrochloride 0aPantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate 0aPVC1 aAbd El-Rahman, Mohamed K.1 aRamadan, Nesrin K.1 aEl-Ragehy, Nariman A.1 aEl-Zeany, Badr A.0 tTalanta.g2015 June 01, v. 138 p.28-35dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.01.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01421naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011800170300001600288520050000304592002800804650001600832650002600848650001900874650002000893650002300913700002400936773007800960856008401038852000901122655001201131IND60095308320221121055918.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009530832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2010.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarelli, Silvia10aSteady and pulsating flow efficiency of a waste-gated turbocharger radial flow turbine for automotive application  ap. 459-465.  aIn the paper the results of an experimental investigation developed on a small turbocharger turbine for automotive application are presented, including the effect of the waste-gate valve opening.

Herein, we present a polyamidoamine (PAMAM) gel with porous structure and multiple amine groups for highly efficient removal of Cr (VI) ions. The gel is prepared in a single step based on the crosslinking reaction between the PAMAM and the epichlorohydrin. The adsorption property of resulted PAMAM gel towards toxic Cr(VI) ions was evaluated systematically with respect to the solution pH, NaCl, temperature, contact time, and initial concentration of Cr(VI) ions. At relatively low concentration of Cr(VI) ions (≤200 mg/L), the PAMAM gel exhibited very high removal efficiency (≥99.32%) towards Cr(VI) ions. The adsorption rate is fast and could reach equilibrium within about 60 min. The maximum adsorption capacity of PAMAM gel could reach as high as 267.4 mg/g. Furthermore, the adsorption data fitted well with the pseudo-second order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm. After adsorption, the Cr(VI) ions-adsorbed PAMAM gel could be easily collected by filtration and the PAMAM gel presented nice desorption capability. Moreover, it still showed high adsorption capacity (202.15 mg/g) for Cr(VI) ions even after five cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3achromium 3acrosslinking 3adesorption 3aepichlorohydrins 3afiltration 3agels 3aions 3akinetics 3apH 3asodium chloride 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3atoxicity 0aCr(VI) ions 0aAdsorption 0aPAMAM dendrimer 0aGel 0aDesorption1 aDuan, Yixing1 aXu, Xu0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Oct. 20, v. 579 p.123685-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1236853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01924naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002900145245014000174300002000314520072300334592002801057650002401085650001401109650001101123650002301134650002201157650002301179650001601202650002201218650001901240650001301259650001101272700003001283700002601313773012101339856008101460852000901541655001201550IND60587128620221122020228.0171215e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058712862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b023572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRattanangkool, Eakkaphon10aOrganocatalytic Visible Light Enabled SNAr of Heterocyclic Thiols: A Metal-Free Approach to 2-Aminobenzoxazoles and 4-Aminoquinazolines  ap. 13256-13262.  aThe direct amination reaction of heterocyclic thiols has been developed in the presence of the nonhazardous photocatalyst Rose Bengal under irradiation of visible light.

High-grade thermal energy is typically recovered within processes. However, lower grade heat is often rejected to the environment. The benefits of capturing and utilising low grade thermal energy are highly dependent on the qualities and properties of the heat in the waste streams. The temperature of the low grade heat stream is the most important parameter, as the effective use of the residual heat or the efficiency of energy recovery from the low grade heat sources will mainly depend on the temperature difference between the source and a suitable sink, e.g. another process or space heating/cooling. In general, the temperatures of these waste heat sources are too low to produce electricity and direct heat use will depend on whether potential user can be found. This paper presents past and current drivers for heat recovery studies. High and low grade heat sources are defined according to the viability of recovery within the processes. Firstly, high grade heat capture within the processes is reviewed. Then, the focus is on the potential for low grade heat capture outside of the original plant. The paper addresses the potential for low grade heat recovery with regard to new incentives and technological advances. Finally, different aspects which influence the decision making for low grade heat recovery in the process industry are discussed. It is concluded that organisational, financial and economic barriers might be overcome and benefits from a holistic vision could be gained with stronger governmental policy and regulation incentives.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3adecision making 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy recovery 3aheat 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3astreams 3atemperature 3aviability 3aUnited Kingdom1 aJoyce, Sharon1 aNorman, Rosemary1 aWang, Yaodong1 aRoskilly, Anthony P.0 tApplied energy.g2012 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.3-20dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245014300177300001300320520091400333592002801247650003501275650001401310650001201324650001501336650001501351650001601366650001401382650001101396650001601407653001401423653001101437653000901448653002001457653001801477700002601495700003401521773008901555856008501644852000901729655001201738IND60603250320221120232930.0180713e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060325032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerai Ferreira, Conny10aMethyl oleate as matrix simulacrum for the simultaneous determination of metals in biodiesel samples by flame atomic emission spectroscopy  ap. 8-14.  aA measurement procedure for direct and simultaneous quantification of Na, K and Ca in biodiesel by flame atomic emission spectroscopy (FAES) was developed. A lab-made device was constructed by coupling a nebulizer/combustion system from a commercial photometer to a continuous emission detector in a spectral range of 255 to 862nm. Instrumental optimizations were carried out evaluating the most important variables, such as gas flow rates and sample introduction temperature, indicating that a temperature of 50°C enhances the analytical signals and assures good precision. The direct analysis method was properly validated and presented limits of quantification of 0.09, 0.07 and 0.43μgkg⁻¹ for Na, K and Ca, respectively. Accuracy of the proposed procedure was checked by comparing the results with those obtained by the standard procedure described in ABNT NBR 15556 and the standard addition method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abiodiesel 3acalcium 3acombustion 3aoleic acid 3aphotometers 3apotassium 3asodium 3atemperature 0aBiodiesel 0aMetals 0aFAES 0aDirect analysis 0aMethyl oleate1 aMalta Costa, Letícia1 aSanches Barbeira, Paulo Jorge0 tTalanta.g2015 June 01, v. 138 p.8-14dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010400169300002200273520111200295592002801407650002001435650001301455650001601468650002901484650002601513650001201539650001601551653000901567653001001576653001001586653002101596653002501617700002401642700002501666700002201691700002201713700001901735700002501754773010301779856008301882852000901965655001201974IND60741697120221118113706.0210904e20210708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074169712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKober, Daniel L.10aScap structures highlight key role for rotation of intertwined luminal loops in cholesterol sensing  ap. 3689-3701.e22.  aThe cholesterol-sensing protein Scap induces cholesterol synthesis by transporting membrane-bound transcription factors called sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus for proteolytic activation. Transport requires interaction between Scap’s two ER luminal loops (L1 and L7), which flank an intramembrane sterol-sensing domain (SSD). Cholesterol inhibits Scap transport by binding to L1, which triggers Scap’s binding to Insig, an ER retention protein. Here we used cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to elucidate two structures of full-length chicken Scap: (1) a wild-type free of Insigs and (2) mutant Scap bound to chicken Insig without cholesterol. Strikingly, L1 and L7 intertwine tightly to form a globular domain that acts as a luminal platform connecting the SSD to the rest of Scap. In the presence of Insig, this platform undergoes a large rotation accompanied by rearrangement of Scap’s transmembrane helices. We postulate that this conformational change halts Scap transport of SREBPs and inhibits cholesterol synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGolgi apparatus 3achickens 3acholesterol 3acryo-electron microscopy 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3amutants 3aproteolysis 0aScap 0aInsig 0aSREBP 0alipid metabolism 0amembrane homeostasis1 aRadhakrishnan, Arun1 aGoldstein, Joseph L.1 aBrown, Michael S.1 aClark, Lindsay D.1 aBai, Xiao-chen1 aRosenbaum, Daniel M.0 tCell.g2021 July 08, v. 184, no. 14 p.3689-3701.e22dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01815naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008200173300001600255520087500271592002801146650001701174650001601191650002201207650002601229650002401255650001501279650001801294700001801312773007801330856008401408852000901492655001201501IND60095308520221121050620.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009530852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2010.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuterbaugh, Martin10aParametric dependence of a morphing wind turbine blade on material elasticity  ap. 466-474.  aA few recent works have suggested a morphing blade for wind turbine energy conversion. The concept is derived from fin and wing motions that better adapt to varying load conditions. Previous research has provided the fluid mechanic justification of this new concept. This paper establishes a parametric relationship between an asymmetric wind turbine blade and constituent material modulus to predict the geometric response of the morphing blade for a given material characteristic. The airfoil’s trailing edge deflection is associated to a prescribed fluid exit angle via the Moment Area (MA) method. Subsequently, a mathematical model is derived to predict material deformation with respect to imparted aerodynamic forces. Results show that an airfoil, much like a tapered beam, can be modeled as a non-prismatic cantilevered beam using this well established method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerodynamics 3adeformation 3aenergy conversion 3aequipment performance 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3awind turbines1 aBeyene, Asfaw0 tEnergy.g2011 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.466-474dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2010.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245010700205300001600312520134700328592002801675650001501703650000901718650001401727650002601741650001601767650001501783653002901798653001401827653001301841653001401854653003001868653002801898700001601926700002501942700001901967773009101986856008502077852000902162655001202171IND60577002920221116185521.0180912e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057700292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenegas, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4016-115410aAdiabatic vs non-adiabatic membrane-based rectangular micro-absorbers for H2O-LiBr absorption chillers  ap. 757-766.  aIn this paper a microporous membrane is used in combination with rectangular microchannels in the absorber of an absorption chiller, working in two different configurations: cooled by a water flow and adiabatically. In the non-adiabatic case, the configuration of the channels allows the heat released during absorption to be extracted using a cooling water flow. The results for solution concentration, pressure potential, absorption coefficient, absorption rate, temperatures and power exchanged/stored by the working fluids along the absorption channels are presented. The ratio between the cooling power of the chiller equipped with the simulated absorber and the absorber volume, rqV, is used to characterise the absorber compactness. A parametric analysis is also performed to evaluate the influence on the ratio rqV of the inlet solution mass flow rate, the solution inlet temperature, and the height and width of the solution channels, for both absorbers. For the base case considered in this study, both absorber configurations offer rqV higher than 1 MW m⁻³. This ratio is higher than usual values found in falling film absorbers using conventional circular tubes. Moreover, the new adiabatic configuration presented has significant advantages respect to the non-adiabatic one in terms of higher rqV and fabrication simplicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aheat 3amass flow 3amicroporous membranes 3atemperature 3awater flow 0aAbsorption refrigeration 0aAdiabatic 0aAbsorber 0aMembranes 0aRectangular microchannels 0aWater–lithium bromide1 ade Vega, M.1 aGarcía-Hernando, N.1 aRuiz-Rivas, U.0 tEnergy.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 134 p.757-766dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01426naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245012300163300001200286520040700298592002800705650002300733650001100756650001200767650002400779650001400803650002400817700001800841700001800859700001900877773012100896856007401017852000901091655001201100IND60548266320221117195047.0160903e199710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054826632DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029739492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Latif, F.

Different climate projections for the future (2030–2059) and the recent conditions (1980–2009) were investigated. A hydrological model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was used to simulate water balance at the basin scale and streamflow in a number of river sections under various climate change scenarios, based on different combinations of global and regional models (global circulation models and regional climate models). The impact on water balance components was quantified at the basin and subbasin levels as deviation from the baseline (1980–2009), and the flow regime alteration under changing climate was estimated using a number of hydrological indicators. An increase in mean temperature for all months between 0.5–2.4 °C and a reduction in precipitation (by 4–7%) was predicted for the future. As a consequence, a decline of blue water (7–18%) and total water yield (11–28%) was estimated. Although the river type classification remains unvaried, the flow regime distinctly moves towards drier conditions and the divergence from the current status increases in future scenarios, especially for those reaches classified as I‐D (ie, intermittent‐dry) and E (ephemeral). Hydrological indicators showed a decrease in both high flow and low flow magnitudes for various time durations, an extension of the dry season and an exacerbation of extreme low flow conditions. A reduction of snowfall in the mountainous part of the basin and an increase in potential evapotranspiration was also estimated (4–4.4%). Finally, the paper analyses the implications of the climate change for river ecosystems and for River Basin Management Planning. The defined quantitative estimates of water balance alteration could support the identification of priorities that should be addressed in upcoming years to set water‐saving actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry season 3abasins 3aplanning 3aevapotranspiration 3arivers 3astream flow 3awater conservation 3aclimate change 3asnow 3awatersheds 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aclimate models 3aecosystems 3atemperature 3aclimate 3aItaly 0awater balance1 aBouraoui, F.1 aBuffagni, A.1 aPappagallo, G.1 aLo Porto, A.0 tRiver research and applications.g2017 Sept., v. 33, no. 7 p.1219-1232dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.31653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014200168520113000310592002801440650004401468650001501512650000801527650001501535650002201550650002301572650002201595650001501617650001901632650001401651650006601665650002501731650001801756653001101774653002001785653002101805653001401826653001501840700001601855700001801871700001201889700001701901773010601918856008702024852000902111655001202120IND60654475720221119191015.0200210e20191020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065447572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1236962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Zhifang10aComparative study on the surface activity and adsorption behavior of linear fatty alcohol ether carboxylic ester with fatty alcohol ether  aThe linear fatty alcohol ether carboxylic ester (A₁₂/₁₄EC₉E-H/A₁₂/₁₄EC₉E-Na) surfactants were successfully prepared from the raw materials fatty alcohol ether (A₁₂/₁₄EO₉) and succinic anhydride with a green and efficient one-step method.

Macroinvertebrate assemblages were sampled at 13 sites in the Mohawk River basin during August 2011, and again in October 2011, following historic floods caused by remnants of Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. The annual exceedance probabilities of floods at regional flow‐monitoring sites ranged from 0.5 to 0.001. Data from the first 2 surveys, and from additional surveys done during July and October 2014, were assessed to characterize the severity of flood impacts, effect of seasonality, and recovery. Indices of total taxa richness; Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness; Hilsenhoff's biotic index; per cent model affinity; and nutrient biotic index‐phosphorus were combined to calculate New York State Biological Assessment Profile scores. Analysis of variance tests were used to determine if the Biological Assessment Profile, its component metrics, relative abundance, and diversity differed significantly (p ≤ .05) among the four surveys. Only total taxa richness and Shannon–Wiener diversity increased significantly, and abundance decreased significantly, following the floods. No metrics differed significantly between the July and August 2014 surveys which indicates that the differences denoted between the August and October 2011 surveys were caused by the floods. Changes in taxa richness, EPT richness, and diversity were significantly correlated with flood annual exceedance probabilities.

Our study finds that authors were most likely to be male, based in North America, possess a background in science or engineering, and affiliated with a university or research institute. Articles were likely to be written by authors working within disciplinary boundaries and using research methods from an economics/engineering background. The US was the most written about country among papers that adopted a country focus and electricity was the most frequently discussed energy source. Energy markets and public policy instruments were the most popular focus areas. According to these findings, we identify five thematic areas whose further investigation could enhance the energy studies field and increase the policy-relevance of contemporary research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aengineering 3ainformation sources 3amarkets 3apublic policy 3asurveys 3auniversity research 3aUnited States1 aSovacool, Benjamin K.1 aTrott, Kirsten1 aRamos, Catherine Regalado1 aSaleem, Saleena1 aOng, Yanchun0 tEnergy.g2011 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.508-519dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2010.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010700170520075800277592002801035650004401063650003701107650001501144650002101159650001801180650001301198650001901211650001401230650001701244650001601261650001901277653001501296653002901311653001401340653001401354653001401368653001501382700001801397700005501415700001401470700005501484773010601539856008701645852000901732655001201741IND60654475820221119190756.0200210e20191020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065447582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1236982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Kaihua10aFlotation performance and adsorption mechanism of styryl phosphonate mono-iso-octyl ester to malachite  aIn this paper, a novel surfactant styryl phosphonate mono-iso-octyl ester (SPE108) was first introduced as a collector for the flotation of malachite. The flotation performance of SPE108 to malachite was investigated by micro-flotation tests, which displayed that SPE108 is a stronger collector than SPA. Solution chemistry analyses, computational calculations and contact angle measurements inferred that SPE108 exhibited stronger affinity to malachite and stronger hydrophobicity than SPA. The adsorption mechanism of SPE108 to malachite was evaluated by zeta potential measurements, FTIR and XPS analysis. Two binding geometries were suggested, one with the formation of single bond P-O-Cu, another with the formation of a four-membered ring complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3achemical bonding 3acontact angle 3ageometry 3ahydrophobicity 3amalachite 3aphosphonates 3asurfactants 3azeta potential 0aSurfactant 0aStyryl phosphonate ester 0aCollector 0aFlotation 0aMalachite 0aAdsorption1 aCao, Zhanfang1 aWang, Shuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1678-02111 aYang, Jia1 aZhong, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9536-21720 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Oct. 20, v. 579 p.123698-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1236983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007900170300001600249500001500265520123800280592002801518650001901546650001501565650001101580650001201591650001701603650002201620650002301642651001101665653001701676700002301693700002101716773008601737856008601823852000901909655001201918IND60084888520221119131147.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008488852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.07.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, Gireesh10aImplementation of energy-efficient windows in Swedish single-family houses  ap. 329-338.  a2019-12-06  aA questionnaire survey of 1010 homeowners in Jämtland and Västernorrland, which are two counties in central Sweden, was conducted to understand the factors influencing their decision to install energy-efficient windows. We complemented this survey with an interview of 12 window sellers/installers in the county Jämtland. The annual energy cost reduction, age, and condition of the windows were the most important reasons for the window replacement decision. Approximately 80% of the respondents replaced their windows with energy-efficient windows with U-value of 1.2W/m²K. Condensation problems, perceived higher prices, and lack of awareness about windows with lower U-values were important reasons for non-adoption of more energy-efficient windows. Window sellers/installers have a strong influence on homeowners’ window selection that was indicated by the 97% of homeowners who bought the windows that were recommended to them. Sellers/installers revealed that they did not recommend windows with U-value of less than 1.2W/m²K because they thought that investing in such windows was not economical and because windows with U-value less than 1.2W/m²K could cause water condensation on the external surface of window pane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquestionnaires 3ahomeowners 3aprices 3asurveys 3aenergy costs 3aenergy efficiency 3acost effectiveness 3aSweden 0acondensation1 aMahapatra, Krushna1 aGustavsson, Leif0 tApplied energy.g2012 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.329-338dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.07.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245004600177300001600223520075100239592002800990650002901018650001601047650001301063650001801076650001701094650001901111650001301130650001801143650002201161650000901183650002101192650001301213700002401226700002501250700003501275700003001310700001801340700002201358700002301380700002901403773009601432856008501528852000901613655001201622IND60113447820221120220422.0141111e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011344782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajipour, Mohammad J.10aAntibacterial properties of nanoparticles  ap. 499-511.  aAntibacterial agents are very important in the textile industry, water disinfection, medicine, and food packaging.

Dietary NO₃–, commonly found in leafy green and root vegetables, undergoes sequential reduction to nitrite and nitric oxide (NO) via the enterosalivary circulation. Importantly, NO has been shown to elicit a number of biological effects ranging from blood pressure reduction to improved exercise economy and athletic performance. However, a common absence within biological research is the lack of female participants, which is often attributed to the added complexity of hormonal fluctuations throughout the menstrual cycle. Despite mounting evidence supporting significant anthropometric, metabolic, and physiological differences between the sexes, this problem extends to the field of dietary NO₃– supplementation where women are underrepresented as research participants. This review examines the existing dietary NO₃– supplementation research with regards to dietary NO₃– pharmacokinetics, resting blood pressure, exercise economy and performance, and mechanisms of action. It also provides evidence and rationale for potential sex differences in response to dietary NO₃– supplementation and future directions for this field of research. Novelty Dietary NO₃– supplementation has been shown to have positive impacts on health and athletic performance in generally male populations. However, women are underrepresented in dietary NO₃– supplementation research. The present evidence suggests that sex differences exist in response to dietary NO₃– supplementation and this review highlights avenues for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletic performance 3abioactive properties 3ablood pressure 3aexercise 3afemales 3agender differences 3agreen leafy vegetables 3amales 3amechanism of action 3amenstrual cycle 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anitrites 3anutrition 3apharmacokinetics 3aroot vegetables 3awomen 0adietary nitrate 0asex differences 0abeetroot juice 0aexercise economy 0aperformance 0aexcitation–contraction coupling1 aSpriet, Lawrence L.0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2019, v. 44, no. 9 p.915-924dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2019-00633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015300167300001600320520081000336592002801146650002401174650001901198650002601217650001501243650001801258700001901276700002101295773007801316856008401394852000901478655001201487IND60095309020221121132927.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009530902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2010.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelício, R.10aComparative study of power converter topologies and control strategies for the harmonic performance of variable-speed wind turbine generator systems  ap. 520-529.  aPower converters play a vital role in the integration of wind power into the electrical grid. Variable-speed wind turbine generator systems have a considerable interest of application for grid connection at constant frequency. In this paper, comprehensive simulation studies are carried out with three power converter topologies: matrix, two-level and multilevel. A fractional-order control strategy is studied for the variable-speed operation of wind turbine generator systems. The studies are in order to compare power converter topologies and control strategies. The studies reveal that the multilevel converter and the proposed fractional-order control strategy enable an improvement in the power quality, in comparison with the other power converters using a classical integer-order control strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric generators 3aelectric power 3aequipment performance 3awind power 3awind turbines1 aMendes, V.M.F.1 aCatalão, J.P.S.0 tEnergy.g2011 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.520-529dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2010.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009200160300001200252520162900264592002801893650000801921650003801929650003801967650002002005650001802025650000902043650001102052650001402063650001902077650002702096650001002123700002202133773012102155856007402276852000902350655001202359IND60548266620221117195743.0160903e199710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054826662DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029739302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Soo-Young,10aStimulation of troutCYP1A gene expression in mouse HEPA-1 cells by 3-methylcholanthrene  ap. 404.  aTroutCYP1A-CAT expression construct was generated by cloning ∼3.5 Kb 5′ flanking DNA of trout liverCYP1A gene in front of CAT gene at pCAT-basic vector. Hepa 1 cells, which are known to contain a functional arylhydrocarbon receptor' were transfected with troutCYP1A-CAT using lipofectin. 3-Methylcholanthrene (1 nM) was added into hepa 1 cells in culture in order to examine if 5′ flanking DNA of troutCYP1A gene could interact with mouse transactivating factors to bring about transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase(CAT) reporter gene. The level of CAT protein was measured by CAT ELISA and the level of CAT mRNA was determined by RTPCR. The treatment of 1 nM 3-methylcholanthrene resulted in two fold increases in CAT protein as well as CAT mRNA compared to untreated control hepa 1 cells. These data indicate that arylhydrocarbon receptors of mouse hepa 1 cells are functional to activate exogenously transfected troutCYP1A-CAT construct in terms of both transcription and translation of CAT. We also examined the effect of 3-methylcholanthrene on endogeneouscyp1a1 activity in hepa 1 cell. 3-Methylcholanthrene (1 nM) treatment to hepa 1 cells transfected with troutCYP1A-CAT construct stimulated the level of cyp1a1 mRNA by two folds and the activity of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase by two fold compared to that of control cells. In this study we reported that troutCYP1A-CAT reporter gene expression construct could be expressed by 3-methylcholanthrene treatment in mouse hepa 1 cells. Thus troutCYP1A-CAT could serve as a good model to study the mechanism of regulation ofCYP1A1 gene expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3achloramphenicol acetyltransferase 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amodels 3areceptors 3areporter genes 3atranslation (genetics) 3atrout1 aSheen, Yhun Yhong0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g1997 Oct., v. 20, no. 5 p.404-404dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029739303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01948naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009400172300001600266520096700282592002801249650001501277650001101292650001501303651001001318700002101328700001501349700002301364700002601387700002801413773008601441856008601527852000901613655001201622IND60084888720221119131144.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008488872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.07.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarro-Calvo, L.10aWind speed reconstruction from synoptic pressure patterns using an evolutionary algorithm  ap. 347-354.  aThis paper presents an evolutionary algorithm for wind speed reconstruction from synoptic pressure patterns. The algorithm operates in a search space formed by grids of pressure measures, and must classify the different situations into classes, in such a way that a measure of wind speed in a given point is minimized among patterns assigned to the same class. Then, each class is assigned a mean wind speed and direction, so the wind speed reconstruction is possible for a new grid of synoptic pressures. In this paper we present the problem model and the specific description of the evolutionary algorithm proposed to solve the problem. We also show the good performance of the proposed method in the reconstruction of the average wind speed in six wind towers in Spain. The proposed method is applicable to wind speed reconstruction or reconstruction of wind missing data of wind series, specially when there is no other variable or related measure available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3amodels 3awind speed 3aSpain1 aSalcedo-Sanz, S.1 aPrieto, L.1 aKirchner-Bossi, N.1 aPortilla-Figueras, A.1 aJiménez-Fernández, S.0 tApplied energy.g2012 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.347-354dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.07.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245010800159300001600267520165200283592002801935650001601963650001101979650001901990650001202009650001202021650001102033650003102044650001802075650000902093650001602102650002402118650002302142650001802165650001102183650000902194650001402203650001802217650001602235651001002251653001502261653001902276653001302295653001502308700002102323700002502344700002102369700002302390773010902413856007602522852000902598655001202607IND60661101420221118140744.0190828s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066110142DNAL7 a10.1139/er-2017-00952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinay, Pelin10aDirect and indirect health impacts of climate change on the vulnerable elderly population in East China  ap. 295-303.  aThe latest scientific advances on the impacts of climate change on the health of the elderly in East China were reviewed consulting peer-reviewed publications from 2000 to 2017. The direct impacts of climate change result from rising temperatures, heat waves, and increases in the frequency of complex extreme weather events such as windstorms, floods, and droughts. The health and social consequences of these events are far reaching, ranging from reduced labour productivity and heat-related deaths through to direct physical injury during extreme weather events, the spread of infectious diseases, and mental health effects following widespread flooding or prolonged drought. Research has indicated that climate change will have the greatest impact on vulnerable groups of people, including the elderly population. However, there is a dearth of empirical evidence, a lack of focus on vulnerable segments of the population (especially elderly), limited understanding of how health status will change in the future, and lack of acknowledgement of how different regions in China vary in terms of the consequences of climate change. The main risk in East China that climate change may exacerbate is flooding (sea level rise, coastal and riverine, flood risk). However in some regions of East China such as in the provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shandong the biggest climate change risk is considered to be drought. Main health risks linked to climate change are evident as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (heat stroke, exhaustion, and asthma), often caused by interactions between heat wave episodes and concurrent poor air quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aasthma 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aelderly 3afloods 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahealth status 3aheat 3aheat stroke 3ainfectious diseases 3alabor productivity 3amental health 3apeople 3arisk 3asea level 3asocial impact 3atemperature 3aChina 0aEast China 0ahealth impacts 0aflooding 0aheat waves1 aMorse, Andrew P.1 aVillanueva, Elmer V.1 aMorrissey, Karyn1 aStaddon, Philip L.0 tEnvironmental reviews.g2019, v. 27, no. 3 p.295-303dNRC Research PresswJournal:18950x1208-60537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/er-2017-00953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245012100164500002900285520130000314592002801614650002801642650001401670650001501684650001601699650002001715653001201735653001501747653001601762653001201778653001501790700005401805700005701859773010401916856008402020852000902104655001202113IND60741697720221118121504.0210715e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074169772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2021.1048452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLowney, B.10aMulti-domain diffraction identification: A supervised deep learning technique for seismic diffraction classification  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aThe seismic wavefield arises from interactions of a source wavefield with subsurface heterogeneities as the wavefield propagates through the earth. In a conventional seismic processing workflow, the reflected portion of the wavefield is enhanced at the expense of the rest of the wavefield. While this is useful, considerable information which is contained outside of the reflections is lost. To alleviate this issue, we propose a deep learning technique which aims to separate the wavefield into three of the wavefield components: reflections, diffractions, and noise. This technique involves first performing several data domain transformations on the input and applying these as input classes on a pixel-by-pixel basis to guide the neural network. A simple separation is performed to remove the reflections and noise, allowing the diffractions to be processed independently. This technique, called Multi-domain diffraction identification, gives a high standard classification of the diffractions in a fraction of the time and computational cost of plane-wave destruction. These diffractions have then been removed from the data and compared with separation results from plane-wave destruction, showing similarities in the diffractions and demonstrating the denoising capability of the method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3acomputers 3ageophysics 3amethodology 3aneural networks 0aSeismic 0aProcessing 0aDiffraction 0aImaging 0aSeparation1 aLokmer, I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7009-15831 aO'Brien, G.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7345-02860 tComputers & geosciences.g2021 Oct., v. 155 p.104845-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2021.1048453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012300158300001200281520094000293592002801233650002001261650002101281650001801302650002801320650001101348650004201359650001301401650001901414650002201433650000901455650002501464700002101489700001501510700001901525700001801544700001701562700001801579700001801597700001801615773012101633856007401754852000901828655001201837IND60548266820221117195041.0160903e199710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054826682DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029739322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Tae Young10aProtective effect of DA-9601, an extract ofArtemisiae Herba, against naproxen-induced gastric damage in arthritic rats  ap. 414.  aGastrointestinal irritation is the most frequent adverse effect in patients chronically taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of arthritic conditions. Gastroprotective effect of DA-9601, a new antiulcer agent fromArtemisiae Herba extract, against NSAID was evaluated in a rat model of arthritis that is similar in many aspects to human rheumatoid arthritis. Daily oral dosing of naproxen (30 mg/kg), one of the most commonly used NSAID, induced apparent gastric lesions as well as a significant decrease in mucosal prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) and prostaglandin F₁α (PGF₁α) levels. Coadministration of DA-9601 prevents naproxen-induced mucosal injury and depletion, of prostaglandins, in a dose-related manner. DA-9601 did not alter the antiinflammatory or analgesic effect of naproxen. The present results suggest that DA-9601 may be useful as a mucoprotectant against NSAIDs in clinical practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanalgesic effect 3aanimal models 3agastrointestinal system 3ahumans 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3apatients 3aprostaglandins 3aprotective effect 3arats 3arheumatoid arthritis1 aRyu, Byong Kweon1 aKo, Jun Il1 aAhn, Byoung Ok1 aKim, Soon Hoe1 aKim, Won Bae1 aLee, Eun Bang1 aJin, Joo Hyun1 aHahm, Ki Baik0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g1997 Oct., v. 20, no. 5 p.414-414dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029739323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04128naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012000171520237000291592002802661650002202689650002002711650001902731650002502750650002202775650001102797650001602808650001802824650002302842650001302865650001202878650001202890650001902902650001502921650001802936650000902954650000702963650001702970650001602987650001403003650000903017650001103026650001603037650001903053651001703072653002003089653002703109653002003136653002603156653001703182653001703199700002003216700006103236700001503297773010603312856008703418852000903505655001203514IND60654476120221119190734.0200210e20191020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065447612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1237022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadi, Razieh10aCondensate blockage remediation in a gas reservoir through wettability alteration using natural CaCO3 nanoparticles  aWettability alteration of near-wellbore region from liquid-wetting to gas-wetting has been known as a feasible method for eliminating condensate blockage in gas condensate reservoirs. In this research, the natural CaCO₃ (Bio-Ca) nanoparticles containing chitin were used as environmentally friendly and cost-effective agents which can act as nanocomposite for wettability alteration. For this purpose, their performance was evaluated on wettability alteration of the gas/oil systems by conducting contact angle measurements and sand pack flooding tests. In addition, for evaluating the stability of nanofluids, zeta potential measurement was conducted. The Bio-Ca nanoparticles were produced using cuttlebone (Sepia Pharaonis) taken from the Persian Gulf. Also, silica nanoparticle was used as a scale for comparison of its performance with the newly synthesized nanoparticle. Four influencing factors including nanofluid concentration, gas flow rate, oil type, and nanoparticle type were investigated and the optimum conditions for improving oil recovery and gas/oil relative permeabilities were also obtained using Taguchi method. The values of zeta potential implied that both nanofluids are stable at the given pH. The results of the contact angle measurement indicated that the contact angles of condensate droplet raised from 0° to 105° after treating the rock surface by Bio-Ca nanofluid with a concentration of 0.05 wt. %. This is happened because of the increase in roughness with reduction of surface free energy of rock surface along with disjointing pressure mechanism. Analysis of variance showed the importance of considering the simultaneous effect of these parameters on oil recovery and relative permeabilities for wettability alteration purposes. Results show that the optimum conditions for increasing oil recovery using Bio-Ca nanoparticles include the nanofluid concentration of 0.05 wt. %, using normal heptane as a liquid phase, and a gas flow rate of 100 cc/min. Besides, for gas and oil relative permeability endpoints as a second response parameter, the most effective parameter is gas flow rate of 55 cc/min. Results of this work are confirmed that the Bio-Ca nanoparticles play a vital role in wettability alteration, which can alter the wettability of the medium from strongly oleophilic to oleophobic due to their biostructure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aSepia pharaonis 3aTaguchi method 3aanalysis of variance 3acalcium carbonate 3achitin 3acondensates 3acontact angle 3acost effectiveness 3adroplets 3aheptane 3aliquids 3ananocomposites 3ananofluids 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3apH 3apermeability 3aremediation 3aroughness 3asand 3asilica 3awettability 3azeta potential 3aPersian Gulf 0aNatural product 0aWettability alteration 0aGas/oil systems 0aRelative permeability 0aOil recovery 0aNanoparticle1 aFarmani, Zohreh1 aOsfouri, Shahriar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4111-83181 aAzin, Reza0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Oct. 20, v. 579 p.123702-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1237023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245018600167300001600353520135400369592002801723650004401751650002001795650002201815650001201837650001401849650002201863650002501885650001401910650002201924650001301946650001801959650004301977650001102020650001802031650001502049650003302064650002102097650002102118650002202139653000802161653000802169653000702177653000602184653000602190653000602196653000702202653001302209653001902222653002602241653001802267653002202285700002302307700001302330700001602343773011202359856008602471852000902557655001202566IND60526502220221119184648.0190408e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052650222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.11.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRambabu, N.10aProduction of nanocellulose fibers from pinecone biomass: Evaluation and optimization of chemical and mechanical treatment conditions on mechanical properties of nanocellulose films  ap. 746-754.  aNanocellulose fibers were produced from pinecone (Jack pine: Pinus banksiana Lamb) using chemical and mechanical treatments. The effects of pretreatment and mechanical grinding on the tensile strength and modulus of the cellulosic fiber sheets were studied to optimize the treatment conditions and grinding process used for the generation of high strength nanocellulose fibers. Pinecone and cellulose fibers were characterized for their chemical composition, morphology, crystallinity, and thermal properties using HPLC, FTIR, SEM, ESEM, XRD, and TGA to provide insight into the mechanism involved in the reactions. Cellulose suspensions that had different pretreatments were processed for different time periods in a Supermasscolloider to produce cellulose nanofibers. The cellulose fibers produced at the optimum chemical concentrations of 4wt% NaOH and 5wt% of acidified sodium chlorite solution contained approximately 89% of cellulose, 4% hemicellulose, and 6% lignin. About 67% of the prepared nanocellulose fibers showed a diameter range between 5 and 25nm. The tensile strength and modulus of the nano fiber films prepared at the optimized grinding condition were 273MPa and 17GPa, respectively. The high crystalline index (70%) and improved thermal stability of the nanofibers indicate their suitability for manufacturing bionanocomposites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPinus banksiana 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiomass 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3achemical composition 3achlorites 3acrystal structure 3agrinding 3ahemicellulose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alignin 3amanufacturing 3ananofibers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hydroxide 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 0aRPC 0aASC 0aBL 0aC 0aH 0aL 0aDI 0aPinecone 0aForest residue 0aChemical pretreatment 0aNanocellulose 0aBionanocomposites1 aPanthapulakkal, S.1 aSain, M.1 aDalai, A.K.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2016 May, v. 83 p.746-754dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.11.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003600155245011500191300001600306520170600322592002802028650001702056650001302073650000802086650001602094650001902110650002002129650002102149650001502170650002602185650001702211650002002228650001302248650001702261650001502278650002202293653002302315653003402338653002702372653001402399653001302413653002302426700002202449700002102471700002002492700002502512700002802537700002502565773009002590856009002680852000902770655001202779IND60634565220221119075531.0200210e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063456522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeišutovič-Akhtarieva, Marija10aImpacts of exhaled aerosol from the usage of the tobacco heating system to indoor air quality: A chamber study  ap. 474-482.  aAerosol particle, carbonyl, and nicotine concentrations were analysed as pollutants affecting indoor air quality during the usage of electrically-heated tobacco product - the Tobacco Heating System (THS). Quantitative experimental variables included THS use intensity as number of parallel users (1, 3, or 5), distance to the bystander (0.5, 1, or 2 m), as well as environmental conditions in a chamber: ventilation intensity as air changes per hour (0.2, 0.5, or 1 h⁻¹), and relative humidity (RH, 30, 50 or 70%). The real-time particle number (PNC), CO and CO₂ concentration, as well as off-line acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, nicotine, and 3-ethenylpyridine concentration was measured during and after the active usage. Use of THS resulted in a statistically significant increase of several analytes including nicotine, acetaldehyde, PM₂.₅, and PNC as compared to the background. The obtained levels were significantly lower (approximately 16, 8, 8 and 28 times for nicotine, acetaldehyde, PNC and PM₂.₅, respectively) compared to the levels resulting from conventional cigarette (CC) smoking under identical conditions. The maximum 30 min concentration of PNC (4.8 × 10⁵ #/cm³), as well as maximum concentration of PNC (9.3 × 10⁶ #/cm³) suggest that the intensive use of THS in a confined space with limited ventilation might cause substantially elevated aerosol concentrations, although these particles appeared as highly volatile ones and evaporated within seconds. Generally, the usage intensity (number of simultaneous users) prevailed as the most important factor positively affecting pollutant variations; another important factor was the distance to bystander.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair quality 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3achemical species 3acigarettes 3aenvironmental factors 3aformaldehyde 3aheating systems 3anicotine 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3arelative humidity 0aIndoor air quality 0aEnvironmental tobacco aerosol 0aTobacco heating system 0aCarbonyls 0aNicotine 0aParticulate matter1 aPrasauskas, Tadas1 aČiužas, Darius1 aKrugly, Edvinas1 aKeraitytė, Karolina1 aMartuzevičius, Dainius1 aKaunelienė, Violeta0 tChemosphere.g2019 May, v. 223 p.474-482dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.0953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03822naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245013000158300001600288520239200304592002802696650001302724650002202737650001002759650002402769650000902793650001702802650002302819650001002842650001502852650001602867650001502883650001202898653001402910653002202924653001202946653001402958700001602972700001402988700001503002700001803017700001603035700002103051700001803072773015103090856007803241852000903319655001203328IND60539459020221118155902.0190318e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053945902DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2013-68982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoulay, G.10aPreoperative cow-side lactatemia measurement predicts negative outcome in Holstein dairy cattle with right abomasal disorders  ap. 212-221.  aThe objectives of the current study were (1) to determine the gain in prognostic accuracy of preoperative l-lactate concentration (LAC) measured on farm on cows with right displaced abomasum (RDA) or abomasal volvulus (AV) for predicting negative outcome; and (2) to suggest clinically relevant thresholds for such use. A cohort of 102 cows with on-farm surgical diagnostic of RDA or AV was obtained from June 2009 through December 2011. Blood was drawn from coccygeal vessels before surgery and plasma LAC was immediately measured by using a portable clinical analyzer. Dairy producers were interviewed by phone 30d following surgery and the outcome was determined: a positive outcome if the owner was satisfied of the overall evolution 30d postoperatively, and a negative outcome if the cow was culled, died, or if the owner reported being unsatisfied 30d postoperatively. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve for LAC was 0.92 and was significantly greater than the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of heart rate (HR; 0.77), indicating that LAC, in general, performed better than HR to predict a negative outcome. Furthermore, the ability to predict a negative outcome was significantly improved when LAC measurement was considered in addition to the already available HR data (area under the curve: 0.93 and 95% confidence interval: 0.87, 0.99). Important inflection points of the misclassification cost term function were noted at thresholds of 2 and 6mmol/L, suggesting the potential utility of these cut-points. The 2 and 6mmol/L thresholds had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for predicting a negative outcome of 76.2, 82.7, 53.3, and 93.1%, and of 28.6, 97.5, 75, and 84%, respectively. In terms of clinical interpretation, LAC ≤2mmol/L appeared to be a good indicator of positive outcome and could be used to support a surgical treatment decision. The treatment decision for cows with LAC between 2 and 6mmol/L, however, would depend on the economic context and the owner’s attitude to risk in regard to potential return on its investment. Finally, performing a surgical correction on commercial cows with RDA or AV and a LAC ≥6mmol/L appeared to be unjustified and these animals should be culled based on their high probability of negative outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aabomasal volvulus 3ablood 3aconfidence interval 3acows 3adairy cattle 3adisplaced abomasum 3afarms 3aheart rate 3alactic acid 3aprediction 3asurgery 0adairy cow 0aabomasal disorder 0alactate 0aprognosis1 aFrancoz, D.1 aDoré, E.1 aDufour, S.1 aVeillette, M.1 aBadillo, M.1 aBélanger, A.-M.1 aBuczinski, S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 Jan., v. 97, no. 1 p.212-221dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-68983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01666naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245008200162300001400244500001400258520052900272592002800801650001200829650002600841650001200867650001500879650001200894650001600906650001300922650001000935651001000945653001400955653001300969653001300982653002000995653001301015700001801028700001401046773009401060856008101154852000901235655001201244IND60699208520221121222346.0210117e20120828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069920852DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.217.35082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Dandan12aA new species of Fuziidae (Insecta, Blattida) from the Inner Mongolia, China  ap. 53-61.  aNAL-light  aA new species attributed to the genus Parvifuzia Guo & Ren, 2011, Parvifuzia peregrina sp. n., is described from the Middle Jurassic Jiulongshan Formation of Daohugou Village, Inner Mongolia, China.

Traditionally, the robustness of ecological networks has been evaluated based on simulation studies where primary extinctions occur at random or as a function of species specialization, ignoring other important biological factors. Here, we estimate the robustness of a seed dispersal network from a grassland–forest mosaic in southern Brazil, simulating distinct scenarios of woody plant species extinction, including scenarios where species are eliminated based on their evolutionary and functional distinctiveness. Our results suggest that the network is more robust when species are eliminated based on their evolutionary uniqueness, followed by random extinctions, the extinction of the most specialist species, functional distinctiveness and, at last, when the most generalist species are sequentially eliminated. Our results provide important information for grassland–forest mosaic management, as they indicate that loss of generalist species and functional diversity makes the system more likely to collapse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextinction 3afunctional diversity 3aseed dispersal 3awoody plants 3aBrazil 0acoextinctions 0aecophylogenetics 0amutualistic interactions 0anetwork disassembly 0aspecies traits1 aDebastiani, Vanderlei J1 aAzambuja, Bethânia O1 aGuimarães, Paulo R1 aPillar, Valério D0 tEnvironmental conservation.g2019 Mar., v. 46, no. 1 p.52-58dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25024x1469-43877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S03768929180003343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245005800174300001600232520082600248592002801074650002101102650001701123650001701140650002701157650002501184650001101209650001101220650001901231650002101250650002101271653002701292653002401319653002101343653001601364653002201380700001901402773014501421856008401566852000901650655001201659IND60112809320221119212019.0161024e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011280932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2013.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, H.q(Hideki),10aCultured stem cells as tools for toxicological assays  ap. 647-652.  aIn the last 2 decades, cell culture techniques for both mammalian embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells have developed and improved, and are now widely available. These stem cells are either pluri- or multi-potent, which makes them favorable for use in vitro developmental toxicity assays. Recent studies have reported several applications for embryonic and adult stem cells in cytotoxicity and developmental toxicity testing. These applications have the potential to provide alternative assessment techniques for evaluating toxic substances, and possibly reveal novel toxic and developmental effects that are difficult to investigate in humans because of ethical considerations. In this review, we describe some of the new approaches that use mammalian embryonic and adult stem cells in toxicological safety testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadult stem cells 3acell culture 3acytotoxicity 3adevelopmental toxicity 3aembryonic stem cells 3aethics 3ahumans 3asafety testing 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity testing 0aDevelopmental toxicity 0aEmbryonic stem cell 0aNeural stem cell 0aHeavy metal 0aSafety assessment1 aHara, Masayuki0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2013 Dec., v. 116 p.647-652dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, Japanx1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2013.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012500174300001600299520129000315592002801605650001801633650000901651650001801660650001001678650001601688650001201704650001801716650001301734650001401747650001901761650001301780650002601793650000901819650001901828650001801847653001801865653001601883653001601899653001301915653001901928700002001947700002601967773012701993856008502120852000902205655001202214IND60468574820160411000000.0151215e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046857482DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2015.10960142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArrobas, Margarida12aA comparison of a pasture ley with a maize monoculture on the soil fertility and nutrient release in the succeeding crop  ap. 829-839.  aSpecialization within agriculture has been a key factor in increasing farm income. The production systems have become increasingly simple, since farmers only grow a small number of crops which have a favourable market price. However, monocultural systems require increasing use of agrochemicals leading to unsustainable environmental costs. In this work, the soil fertility of two plots in a crop rotation previously grown for 5 years as pasture or maize monoculture was evaluated. In the pasture, the upper 0–20 cm soil layer sequestered 17.4 Mg organic C ha ⁻¹ and accumulated 403 kg N ha ⁻¹ more than under maize monoculture. Analytical data from pot experiments showed that soil samples from the pasture plot released significantly more mineral N than soil samples from the maize monoculture. Maize dry matter (DM) yields in 2012 and 2013 were 15.3 and 10.0 Mg ha ⁻¹ in the pasture plot and 8.8 and 8.4 Mg ha ⁻¹ in the maize monoculture plot. Nitrogen recoveries by maize were 175.4 and 68.0 kg ha ⁻¹ in the pasture and 78.3 and 50.3 kg ha ⁻¹ in the maize monoculture plot. The pool of organic matter accumulated during the pasture phase immobilized important nutrients which benefited the succeeding crop as the organic substrate was mineralized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagrochemicals 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3acrops 3afarm income 3afarmers 3amarket prices 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3apastures 3aproduction technology 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3asoil sampling 0aCrop rotation 0aley-farming 0amonoculture 0aZea mays 0asoil fertility1 aAguiar, Peltier1 aRodrigues, M.

Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems with huge carbon stocks; however, information on the dynamics of submerged fine roots in mangrove soils is limited. To estimate fine root production in several sites of mangrove communities on Pohnpei Island, Micronesia, we estimated continuous inflows using a simple mass balance model to combine ingrowth core and litterbag experimental results. According to our findings, previously reported mangrove fine root production values were severely underestimated because the fine root decomposition process was disregarded during the experimental period. We estimated that annual fine root production up to 0.3 m in depth ranged from 13.8 (Bruguiera gymnorrhiza in a landward plot) to 56.3 Mg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ (B. gymnorrhiza in a seaward plot). However, comparing the fine root production with respect to the unit of stem cross‐section area increase in the sample tree, the fine root production of Rhizophora spp. was greater than that of other species. The annual fine root mortality and decomposition to annual fine root production was 70%–105% and 11%–52% of annual production, respectively. The annual fine root production estimated here was much higher than that previously reported. These findings begin to quantify the contribution and importance of highly productive mangrove fine roots for carbon sequestration in blue carbon ecosystems. Moreover, this study provides new insights into the organic carbon dynamics in mangrove soils with mangrove vegetation succession.  aPublisher supplied data  aJPMJSA1602cJapan Science and Technology Agency  a17H02034cJSPS KAKENHI  a22255009cJSPS KAKENHI  a25282084cJSPS KAKENHI 3aBruguiera gymnorhiza 3aRhizophora 3ablue carbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aecological succession 3afine roots 3amangrove forests 3amodels 3amortality 3anecromass 3aorganic carbon 3aresearch 3aMicronesia 3aPohnpei1 aFujimoto, Kiyoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2589-37361 aHirata, Yasumasa1 aTabuchi, Ryuichi1 aTaniguchi, Shingo1 aFurukawa, Keita1 aWatanabe, Shin1 aSuwa, Rempei1 aLihpai, Saimon0 tEcological research.g2022 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.33-52dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3870047x0912-38147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1440-1703.122803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245016500168300001600333500001100349520134800360592002801708650002501736650002701761650001301788650001001801650001001811650001201821650001601833700003101849700002401880773018801904856007902092852000902171655001202180IND50074242620221120061317.0150218e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007424262DNAL7 a10.1111/1574-6968.123852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrambilla, Luciano10aExpression of the Escherichia coli ompW colicin S4 receptor gene is regulated by temperature and modulated by the H‐NS and StpA nucleoid‐associated proteins  ap. 238-244.  aLETTER  aThe OmpW family consists of a ubiquitous group of small outer membrane (OM) β‐barrel proteins of Gram‐negative bacteria with proposed roles in environmental adaptation but poorly understood mechanisms of expression. We report here that Escherichia coli K‐12 OmpW contents are drastically modified by temperature changes compatible with the leap from the environment to warm‐blooded hosts and/or vice versa. Thus, while OmpW is present in the OM of bacteria grown at 37 °C, it sharply disappears at 23 °C with the concomitant acquisition of colicin S4 resistance by the cells. ompW::lacZY fusions indicated that temperature regulation operates at the level of transcription, being ompW expression almost abolished at 23 °C as compared to 37 °C. Moreover, E. coli Δhns mutants lacking H‐NS showed reductions in ompW transcription and OmpW contents at 37 °C, indicating positive modulatory roles for this nucleoid‐structuring protein in ompW expression. Also, ΔhnsΔstpA double mutants simultaneously lacking H‐NS and its paralog StpA showed more severe reductions in ompW expression at 37 °C, resulting in the complete loss of OmpW. The overall results indicate that OmpW contents in E. coli are regulated by both temperature and H‐NS and reinforce OmpW functions in bacterial adaptation to warm‐blooded hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli K12 3aGram-negative bacteria 3acolicins 3agenes 3ahosts 3amutants 3atemperature1 aMorán‐Barrio, Jorgelina1 aViale, Alejandro M.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2014 Mar., v. 352, no. 2 p.238-244dPublished by Elsevier/North Holland on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6968.123853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015400162300001800316520179700334592002802131650002402159650003002183650001802213650001002231650000902241650001902250650002002269650001502289650001202304650001202316650002502328650001402353650001202367653003202379653003002411653002002441653002402461700001102485700001502496700001702511700001702528700001402545700001902559700001802578700001702596700001402613773011502627856008202742852000902824655001202833IND60783851520221120132934.0220816e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078385152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2022.07.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xin10aCharacterization of four spliced isoforms of a transmembrane C-type lectin from Procambarus clarkii and their function in facilitating WSSV infection  ap. 1127-1138.  aC-type lectin (CTL) is an important pattern recognition receptor that play vital functions in the innate immunity. Many soluble CTLs in crustacean participate in the inhibition or promotion of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. However, whether transmembrane CTLs participate in WSSV infection in crustacean remains unknown. In the present study, four spliced isoforms of a transmembrane CTL (designated as PcTlec) from Procambarus clarkii were identified for the first time. The genome structure of PcTlec contains eight exons, six known introns, and one unknown intron. PcTlec-isoform1 is produced by intron retention, whereas PcTlec-isoform3 and PcTlec-isoform4 are produced by exon skipping. All of them contain the transmembrane domain and characteristic carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). Four PcTlec isoforms were mainly expressed in the hepatopancreas, stomach, and intestine. After WSSV challenge, the expression levels of PcTlec-isoform1-4 in the intestine were upregulated. The knockdown of the region shared by four PcTlec isoforms evidently decreased the expression of WSSV envelope protein VP28 and the copies of viral particles. A recombinant protein (rPcTlec-CRD) containing the CRD that was shared by four PcTlec isoforms was acquired by procaryotic expression system. The injection of purified rPcTlec-CRD protein evidently increased the VP28 expression and WSSV copies during viral infection. Moreover, rPcTlec-CRD could directly bind to WSSV and interact with VP28 protein. These findings indicate that new-found transmembrane CTL isoforms in P. clarkii may act as viral receptors that facilitate WSSV infection. This study contributes to the recognition and understanding of the functions of transmembrane CTLs in crustacean in the infection of host by WSSV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProcambarus clarkii 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3acarbohydrates 3aexons 3afish 3ahepatopancreas 3ainnate immunity 3aintestines 3aintrons 3alectins 3arecombinant proteins 3ashellfish 3astomach 0aTransmembrane C-Type lectin 0aWhite spot syndrome virus 0aViral infection 0aProcambarus clarkii1 aXu, Yu1 aZhao, Yuqi1 aCao, Xunyuan1 aWang, Dandan1 aYan, Jing1 aWei, Tianxiang1 aDai, Xiaoling1 aXu, Zhiqiang1 aRen, Qian0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2022 Aug., v. 127 p.1127-1138dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2022.07.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013700170300001600307520104600323592002801369650004301397650001201440650001101452650001501463650001701478650001201495650001301507650001301520650001101533653004501544653001501589653001101604653003301615653004801648700002201696700002201718700001501740700001701755700002001772773014501792856008401937852000902021655001202030IND60112809520221119211941.0161024e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011280952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2013.05.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoguchi, Takuya10aEfficient butanol production without carbon catabolite repression from mixed sugars with Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4  ap. 716-721.  aAcetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) fermentation using Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4 and mixed sugars containing cellobiose and xylose was studied to establish efficient butanol production process without carbon catabolite repression (CCR). Although batch culture with glucose and xylose exhibited apparent CCR, we achieved simultaneous consumption of cellobiose and xylose. Moreover, preculture of the N1-4 strain with xylose yielded maximum butanol and solvent concentrations (16 and 23 g/L, respectively). Thus, we succeeded in ABE fermentation with mixed sugars of hexose and pentose, without CCR, by using wild-type ABE-producing clostridia. We also investigated the effect of various ratios of cellobiose and xylose on the fermentation process and yield. Increasing initial xylose concentration improved butanol and solvent concentrations and maximum xylose consumption rate. Fed-batch culture with cellobiose and xylose showed rapid and simultaneous sugar consumption and improved maximum consumption rate of both sugars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum 3abutanol 3acarbon 3acellobiose 3afermentation 3aglucose 3apentoses 3asolvents 3axylose 0aAcetone–butanol–ethanol fermentation 0aCellobiose 0aXylose 0aCarbon catabolite repression 0aClostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-41 aTashiro, Yukihiro1 aYoshida, Tsuyoshi1 aZheng, Jin1 aSakai, Kenji1 aSonomoto, Kenji0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2013 Dec., v. 116 p.716-721dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, Japanx1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2013.05.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003100145245007700176300001400253500002000267520178200287592002802069596003202097596003202129650001602161650002402177650001602201650002402217650002502241650000902266650002102275650002502296650002002321650002202341650001102363650001302374650002702387650001902414650001702433650001302450650001502463650001402478650001402492650001502506650001802521700002802539700006002567700007202627773012002699856008002819852000902899655001202908IND60777088920221122063209.0220513e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077708892DNAL7 a10.1111/1440-1703.122722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes, Angeli Gabrielle B.10aSeagrass biomass and sediment carbon in conserved and disturbed seascape  ap. 67-79.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDespite the Philippines having one of the widest extents and most diverse seagrasses, there are limited reports on the contribution of seagrass vegetation health to organic carbon (OC). Comparative assessments of OC between conserved and disturbed seagrass meadows in a seascape are also lacking. Conservation programs (e.g., marine protected area [MPA]) contribute to the maintenance of ecosystem health and OC storage in seagrass. However, disturbances may negate the effects of MPAs. Disturbances are often due to coastal development pressures linked to the need for industry, food production, and human settlement. Here, we assessed and compared the aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and OC between conserved and disturbed seagrass meadows, then, tested its correlation with vegetation and water quality variables. The study was conducted in Oyon Bay (northwest Philippines), one of the key seascape MPAs in the Philippines. The bay experienced disturbances from a coal power plant, aquaculture, and human settlements for approximately 30 years. Results showed 7× higher AGB, 11× higher BGB, and 1.7× higher OC in conserved sites. The low biomass and OC values in the disturbed sites were correlated to poor vegetation and water quality conditions (particularly high turbidity [ρ = 0.38], high phosphates [ρ = −0.19], and low dissolved oxygen [ρ = −0.31]). Our study showed the effectiveness of MPAs in maintaining ecosystem health and OC in seagrass, but the magnitude of disturbances lessened the benefits from MPAs. Our results have implications on the over‐ or under‐estimation of carbon sequestration not just in Philippine seagrasses but also in most Southeast Asian countries facing similar coastal development pressures.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity Research Council  cAteneo de Manila University 3aPhilippines 3aaboveground biomass 3aaquaculture 3abelowground biomass 3acarbon sequestration 3acoal 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental health 3afood production 3ahuman settlements 3ahumans 3aindustry 3amarine protected areas 3aorganic carbon 3apower plants 3aresearch 3aseagrasses 3asediments 3aturbidity 3avegetation 3awater quality1 aVergara, Ma.

There are two major forms of Aβ in the brain: Aβ42 and Aβ40. Aβ42 is the major component of the amyloid plaques, but the overall abundance of Aβ40 is several times that of Aβ42. In vitro experiments show that Aβ42 and Aβ40 affect each other’s aggregation. In mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, overexpression of Aβ40 has been shown to reduce the plaque pathology, suggesting that Aβ42 and Aβ40 also interact in vivo. Here we address the question of whether Aβ42 and Aβ40 interact with each other in the formation of oligomers using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. When the Aβ42 oligomers were formed using only spin-labeled Aβ42, the dipolar interaction between spin labels that are within 20 Å range broadened the EPR spectrum and reduced its amplitude. Oligomers formed with a mixture of spin-labeled Aβ42 and wild-type Aβ42 gave an EPR spectrum with higher amplitude due to weakened spin-spin interactions, suggesting molecular mixing of labeled and wild-type Aβ42. When spin-labeled Aβ42 and wild-type Aβ40 were mixed to form oligomers, the resulting EPR spectrum also showed reduced amplitude, suggesting that wild-type Aβ40 can also form oligomers with spin-labeled Aβ42. Therefore, our results suggest that Aβ42 and Aβ40 form mixed oligomers with direct molecular interactions. Our results point to the importance of investigating Aβ42-Aβ40 interactions in the brain for a complete understanding of Alzheimer’s pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3abrain 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amice 3apathogenesis 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 0aProtein aggregation 0aAlzheimer’s disease 0aOligomers1 aGuo, Zhefeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1992-72550 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 534 p.292-296dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.11.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245012300176300001600299520146400315592002801779650003801807650001101845650002101856650001401877650003301891650002601924650001601950650002101966650002501987650003002012650004302042650001402085650001002099653002002109653001402129653001302143653001802156653002002174700002202194700001702216700001502233700002402248700002102272773010102293856008102394852000902475655001202484IND60552733320221119084511.0161021e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055273332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcp.2013.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNageswara-Rao, Madhugiri10aDevelopment of rapid, sensitive and non-radioactive tissue-blot diagnostic method for the detection of citrus greening  ap. 176-183.  aCitrus huanglongbing (HLB or citrus greening) is one of the most devastating diseases of citrus worldwide. The disease is caused by Gram-negative, phloem-limited α-proteobacterium, ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’, vectored by the psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama. Citrus plants infected by the HLB bacterium may not show visible symptoms sometimes for years following infection and non-uniform distribution within the tree makes the detection of the pathogen very difficult. Efficient management of HLB disease requires rapid and sensitive detection early in the infection followed by eradication of the source of pathogen and the vector. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method is most commonly employed for screening the infected/suspected HLB plants and psyllids. This is time consuming, cumbersome and not practical for screening large number of samples in the field. To overcome this, we developed a simple, sensitive, non-radioactive, tissue-blot diagnostic method for early detection and screening of HLB disease. Digoxigenin labeled molecular probes specific to ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ nucleotide sequences have been developed and used for the detection of the pathogen of the HLB disease. The copy number of the target genes was also assessed using real-time PCR experiments and the optimized real-time PCR protocol allowed positive ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ detection in citrus samples infected with ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ bacterium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandidatus Liberibacter asiaticus 3aCitrus 3aDiaphorina citri 3aPsyllidae 3abacterial diseases of plants 3adiagnostic techniques 3adigoxigenin 3agreening disease 3anucleotide sequences 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3atrees 0aCitrus greening 0aDNA probe 0aPsyllids 0aReal-time-PCR 0aTissue blotting1 aMiyata, Shin-ichi1 aGhosh, Dilip1 aIrey, Mike1 aGarnsey, Stephen M.1 aGowda, Siddarame0 tMolecular and cellular probes.g2013 Oct.,  Dec., v. 27 p.176-183dElsevier Ltdx0890-85087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2013.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04229naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014600164300001600310520217800326592002802504650002702532650002502559650002302584650002502607650001902632650001302651650002702664650001602691650002402707650002102731650001802752650001402770650002002784650003102804650001802835650002002853650001802873650002602891650001202917650001402929650003702943650001402980650005202994650002403046650001403070650001803084650002003102650002103122653002703143653002303170653002003193653001803213653001203231700001603243700001903259700001603278700001203294700001703306700001503323773011403338856008203452852000903534655001203543IND60783851620221120133032.0220914e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078385162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2022.07.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhicheng10aSkin transcriptomic analysis and immune-related gene expression of golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) after Amyloodinium ocellatum infection  ap. 188-195.  aAmyloodiniosis is a severe disease of marine and brackish water fish caused by Amyloodinium ocellatum. Golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) is often repeatedly infected by A. ocellatum, leading to extensive mortality. However, little is known about the immune response mechanisms of the T. ovatus following reinfection with A. ocellatum. In this study, an extensive analysis at the transcriptome level of T. ovatus skin was carried out at 24 h post-infection by A. ocellatum. During the transcriptomic analysis, 1367 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the skin of T. ovatus under A. ocellatum infection and control conditions were obtained. In Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotated analyses, the DEGs were significantly enriched in the immune-related pathways. To better understand the immune-related gene expression dynamics, a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to assess the primary and secondary infection groups of T. ovatus at different stages (3 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and, 72 h post-infection) of infection with A.ocellatum. The results showed that innate immunity-related genes [interleukin (IL-8), chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), and G-type lysosome (LZM g)] and adaptive immunity-related gene [major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alpha antigen I and MHC alpha antigen II] expression levels in the primary and secondary infection groups were significantly increased compared to the control group. The expression of MHC I and MHC II was more rapidly upregulated in the secondary infection group compared with the primary infection group after A.ocellatum infection. However, no significant differences of A.ocellatum load were observed in primary and secondary infection groups. In addition, the serum of the primary infection group had significantly higher concentrations of triglyceride (TG), higher alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities than the control group. This study contributes to understanding the defense mechanisms in fish skin against ectoparasite infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmyloodinium ocellatum 3aToll-like receptor 7 3aTrachinotus ovatus 3aalanine transaminase 3aamyloodiniosis 3aantigens 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3abrackish water fish 3adisease severity 3aectoparasites 3afish skin 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-8 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aligands 3alysosomes 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amortality 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecondary infection 3ashellfish 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atriacylglycerols 0aAmyloodinium ocellatum 0aTrachinotus ovatus 0aImmune response 0aTranscriptome 0aRT-qPCR1 aJiang, Biao1 aZhong, Zhihong1 aCao, Jizhen1 aLi, Han1 aWang, Chenxi1 aLi, Anxing0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2022 Sept., v. 128 p.188-195dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2022.07.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012500170300001600295520126100311592002801572650001301600650002101613650001701634650000901651650001901660650001601679650001801695650001201713650002601725650002301751650001801774650002501792651000901817653001101826653002701837653002501864653001001889653000901899653002501908700002301933773012701956856008502083852000902168655001202177IND60468575120160411000000.0151215e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046857512DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2015.11053602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafiee, Masoud10aEconomic water use efficiency of corn (Zea mays L.) hybrids as affected by irrigation regimes: a case study in West Iran  ap. 781-789.  aWater deficit stress is the main limiting factor in corn production in different regions of Iran. Choosing appropriate corn hybrids and well-managed irrigation practices will result in significant water savings (WS) and good outcomes. Therefore, a randomized complete block design arranged in split plots with four replications was used to evaluate the effect of irrigation regimes on some agronomic traits of corn hybrids. Three different irrigation regimes (irrigation after depleting 60%, 70%, and 80% of field capacity (FC) as water deficit stress, mild water deficit stress and well-irrigated treatment, respectively) were allocated to main plots and four grain corn hybrids (KSC 500, KSC 647, KSC 700, and KSC 704) were randomized in subplots. The results indicated that grain yield (GY), harvest index (HI), and relative water content (RWC) decreased, whereas water use efficiency (WUE), WS, and irrigation efficiency (IE) increased, with increasing water deficit stress intensity. Irrigation after depleting 70% of FC caused the highest economic WUE (1.01 kg grain m ⁻³). In addition, late maturing hybrids (KSC 700 and KSC 704) showed higher values of all measured traits, except for HI, compared to mid-maturing hybrids (KSC 647 and KSC 500).  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aagronomic traits 3acase studies 3acorn 3afield capacity 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3ahybrids 3airrigation management 3awater conservation 3awater content 3awater use efficiency 3aIran 0aHybrid 0arelative water content 0awater deficit stress 0ayield 0acorn 0awater use efficiency1 aKalhor, Manouchehr0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2016 June 2, v. 62, no. 6 p.781-789dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2015.11053603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012400171300001600295520146600311592002801777650003301805650001901838650003601857650002001893650001701913650001301930650001201943653001801955653001901973653001701992653003202009653002602041700001702067700001602084700002102100700003002121700001902151700001902170773011802189856008502307852000902392655001202401IND60536038820221120095524.0190214e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053603882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorton, Jennifer10aDetermination of the PS I content of PS II core preparations using selective emission: A new emission of PS II at 780nm  ap. 167-177.  aRoutinely prepared PS II core samples are often contaminated by a significant (~1–5%) fraction of PS I, as well as related proteins. This contamination is of little importance in many experiments, but masks the optical behaviour of the deep red state in PS II, which absorbs in the same spectral range (700–730nm) as PS I (Hughes et al. 2006). When contamination levels are less than ~1%, it becomes difficult to quantify the PS I related components by gel-based, chromatographic, circular dichroism or EPR techniques. We have developed a fluorescence-based technique, taking advantage of the distinctively different low-temperature emission characteristics of PS II and PS I when excited near 700nm. The approach has the advantage of providing the relative concentration of the two photosystems in a single spectral measurement. A sensitivity limit of 0.01% PS I (or better) can be achieved. The procedure is applied to PS II core preparations from spinach and Thermosynechococcus vulcanus. Measurements made of T. vulcanus PS II preparations prepared by re-dissolving crystallised material indicate a low but measurable PS I related content. The analysis provides strong evidence for a previously unreported fluorescence of PS II cores peaking near 780nm. The excitation dependence of this emission as well as its appearance in both low PS I cyanobacterial and plant based PS II core preparations suggests its association with the deep red state of PS II.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThermosynechococcus vulcanus 3achromatography 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acrystallization 3afluorescence 3aproteins 3aspinach 0aPhotosystem I 0aPhotosystem II 0aFluorescence 0aFluorescence line-narrowing 0aSpectral hole-burning1 aHall, Jeremy1 aSmith, Paul1 aAkita, Fusamichi1 aKoua, Faisal Hammad Mekky1 aShen, Jian-Ren1 aKrausz, Elmars0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2014 Jan., v. 1837, no. 1 p.167-177dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012900166520152400295592002801819650003201847650001601879650003501895650002501930650001501955650001501970650001801985650003402003650001902037650001302056650002102069650002802090650003102118653002102149653004702170653002802217653001802245653002202263653001002285653000802295653000802303653000802311653000902319653001102328653000802339653001002347653001202357653001102369653001102380700001402391700001902405700001402424773009802438856008202536852000902618655001202627IND60775452020221122135731.0220531e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077545202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1205672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hong-zhou10aDeficiency of NARFL increases transcription of NADPH oxidases and ROS production impairing the function of endothelial cells  aNuclear prelamin A recognition factor-like (NARFL) is involved in cytosolic iron‑sulfur (FeS) protein biogenesis and cellular defense against oxidative stress. Previous study reported that increased oxidative stress and subintestinal vessel (SIV) malformation in narfl knockout zebrafish. However, the underlying mechanism of oxidative stress caused by NARFL deficiency remains unclear. The present study was sought to investigate the function of NARFL in endothelial cells. NARFL knockdown assay was performed in two cell lines and NADPH oxidase (Nox) were measured using Western blotting. Nox inhibitors were selected for assessing the potential sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Cell migration was detected using wound healing assay and transwell assay. Cell cycle was analyzed using flow cytometry. Promoter activity assay and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay were chosen for investigating the molecular mechanism of Nox transcription. NARFL deficiency resulted in upregulated expressions of Nox2, Nox4, and p47ᵖʰᵒˣ and increased ROS levels in endothelial cells. Nox2 knockdown reversed the effects and improved endothelial dysfunctions caused by NARFL deficiency. ChIP experiments revealed that NARFL knockdown increased the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and modification of histones at the promoter sites of Nox2 and Nox4. NARFL knockdown induced the transcriptional activation of Nox2 and Nox4, which resulted in increased ROS levels and impaired endothelial functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aDanio rerio 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aabnormal development 3abiogenesis 3acell cycle 3acell movement 3achromatin immunoprecipitation 3aflow cytometry 3ahistones 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3atranscriptional activation 0aOxidative stress 0aNuclear prelamin A recognition factor-like 0aReactive oxygen species 0aNADPH oxidase 0aEndothelial cells 0aNARFL 0aNox 0aSIV 0aROS 0aChIP 0adPAVMs 0aCIA 0ashRNA 0ashNARFL 0aHUVECs 0aHPAECs1 aPeng, Jie1 aZhao, Mei-zhen1 aXu, Ying,0 tLife sciences.g2022 July 15, v. 301 p.120567-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1205673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015300157300001600310500001900326500002000345520096700365592002801332650001101360650001001371650001501381650002101396650001301417650000901430650001501439650001201454650002001466700006101486700002101547773012501568856007401693852000901767655001201776IND60705358620221117105041.0200804e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070535862DNAL7 a10.1111/jtxs.125202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDangi, Nidhi10aPasting, rheological, and dough mixing behavior of rice flour as affected by the addition of native and partially hydrolyzed β‐glucan concentrate  ap. 650-662.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study was aimed at evaluating the potential of barley β‐glucan concentrates (native and partially hydrolyzed) in modifying the techno‐functionality of rice flour dough. β‐Glucan concentrate was partially hydrolyzed to obtain a low molecular weight polymer and their influence on the pasting, rheological, and thermal properties of rice dough were assessed. Hydration, thermal, and pasting properties were significantly modified with the added β‐glucans. The rice dough supplemented with β‐glucan concentrates showed improved viscoelastic and creep behavior and the effectiveness of β‐glucans in imparting strength to rice dough depended on its molecular weight. Hydrolyzed β‐glucan concentrates having low molecular weight increased dough elasticity to the greater extent in comparison to native β‐glucan concentrates. The micrographs of supplemented dough showed a strong and dense network indicating improved structure and strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3adough 3ahydrolysis 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3arice 3arice flour 3atexture 3aviscoelasticity1 aYadav, Baljeet S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1503-34731 aYadav, Ritika B.0 tJournal of texture studies.g2020 Aug., v. 51, no. 4 p.650-662dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl372x0022-49017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jtxs.125203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245011000205300001500315500002000330520132100350592002801671650001801699650001001717650002401727650001701751650002001768650001201788650000901800650000901809650001501818650001301833650001501846650001301861650001101874650001001885773012101895856008002016852000902096655001202105IND60777089420221120081332.0220513e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077708942DNAL7 a10.1111/1440-1703.122642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakatsuki, Seiki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3108-642010aLong‐term changes in food habits of deer and habitat vegetation: 25‐year monitoring on a small island  ap. 92-101.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHow vegetation change caused by ungulates affects other ungulate species has been well studied, yet how grazing the vegetation of the habitat affects a species own food habits is not known. Long‐term studies on the effects of sika deer (Cervus nippon) on vegetation have been performed, but not in the context of the species own food habits. I monitored grassland vegetation and deer food habits on an island in northern Japan for 25 years from 1975 to 2000. During the first decade, deer grazing caused the replacement of Miscanthus sinensis tussocks by a Zoysia japonica sward. Deer diets in 1976 were composed of equal proportions of M. sinensis, Pleioblastus chino, and Z. japonica, but after the 1980s, Z. japonica became their major food source. This is because of the high productivity of Z. japonica afforded by its morphology and physiology, as well as by the warm and humid summer climate of the Japanese archipelago. Although the vegetational changes were gradual, changes in the deer food habits were abrupt and the compositions were predominated by Z. japonica after the first decade. This study showed that an ungulate changed its own diet because of its effect on the vegetation by grazing, and that the changes in vegetation and deer diet were not synchronized over a 25‐year monitoring period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus nippon 3aJapan 3aMiscanthus sinensis 3aPleioblastus 3aZoysia japonica 3aclimate 3adeer 3adiet 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aphysiology 3aresearch 3asummer 3asward0 tEcological research.g2022 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.92-101dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3870047x0912-38147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1440-1703.122643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01378naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245008500165300001400250500002900264520035500293592002800648650001500676650001400691650001600705653001300721653001500734653001100749700002700760700001700787700002200804700001800826773009400844856008100938852000901019655001201028IND60699209320221121222420.0210117e20120904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069920932DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.219.35972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTropea, Gioele12aA new species of Euscorpius Thorell, 1876 (Scorpiones, Euscorpiidae) from Turkey  ap. 63-80.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aA new species of the genus Euscorpius Thorell, 1876is described based on specimens collected from Dilek Peninsula (Davutlar, Aydın) in Turkey.

This homothallic species produced ovoid to globose sporangia, which release zoospores directly through exit pores. It grew well in a relatively wide range of salinity from 1.8 to 19.0 parts per thousand. Sequence analysis of the rRNA internal transcribed spacer region placed this new species in the Halophytophthora sensu stricto clade. Description of this new species expanded the habitat to include geographically distinct inland freshwater ecosystems for the genus Halophytophthora, challenging the notion that this genus is marine or brackish.

Aside from their economic and social impact, those who suffer from these diseases have a poor quality of life due to the lack of cures. Researchers have turned to stem cell therapies as a potential solution to this global health crisis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their paracrine agents such as conditioned medium (CM) and exosomes (Exo) have been applied to treat different retinal disorders. This study compared the therapeutic effects of human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) and their secretome on an in vivo model of sodium iodate retinal neurodegeneration. We analyzed the expression of retinal cells' specific mRNAs by RT-PCR and proteins by immunostaining as well as performing visual cliff avoidance test as a functional evaluation technique. There were four therapeutic groups in this study: hADSC, hADSC-CM, hADSC-Exo and hADSC-Exo + CM. Although all groups showed different therapeutic effects on various retinal cells, the results of hADSC-CM were most striking, especially in terms of photoreceptor regeneration and retinal function. The findings of present study demonstrated the different effects of MSC-based therapies on various retinal cells which could be helpful in designing more precise treatments that suit to each neurodegenerative disease mechanism and the cells involved. It also suggests that CM might be a better choice due to its multifactorial characteristic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexosomes 3ahumans 3aiodates 3amacular degeneration 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aphotoreceptors 3aquality of life 3aretina 3aretinitis pigmentosa 3asocial impact 3asodium 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 0aRetinal degeneration 0aPhotoreceptors 0aMesenchymal stem cell 0aConditioned-medium 0aExosome1 aSafaee, Azadeh1 aAmirpour, Noushin1 aKazemi, Mohammad1 aRamezani, Alireza1 aJafarinia, Morteza1 aDehghani, Alireza1 aSalehi, Hossein0 tLife sciences.g2022 July 01, v. 300 p.120570-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1205703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012600167300001600293520139200309592002801701650001101729650001601740650001101756650001301767650001301780650001301793650001601806650001201822650002201834650001301856650001901869650001801888650002201906650002001928653001901948653002401967653001001991653001902001653002002020700001202040700001602052700001702068700001902085700001502104700002102119700001602140700001602156700005402172773008702226856008502313852000902398655001202407IND60612926220221117170218.0200705e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061292622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Cuiping10aBiopolymer-assisted synthesis of 3D interconnected Fe3O4@carbon core@shell as anode for asymmetric lithium ion capacitors  ap. 296-305.  aLithium ion capacitor (LIC) has been regarded as a promising device to combine the merits of high-energy lithium ion battery and high-power supercapacitor. The key challenge in developing high performance LIC is to achieve synergy between the high capacity of battery anode and the fast non-Faradaic reaction rate of capacitive cathode without compromising energy density. Here, we report 3D interconnected Fe₃O₄@C core@shell nanocomposites with enhanced lithium storage reaction kinetics as an anode material of LIC. Chitosan, a renewable biopolymer with rich functional groups, has been utilized as both structural directing agent and carbon precursor to assist the synthesis of Fe₃O₄@C composites, which have small particle size and an in-situ formed carbon coating layer. The carbon coating can not only dramatically improve the electronic conductivity, but also buffer the large volume expansion/contraction of Fe₃O₄ during lithiation/delithiation. The Fe₃O₄@C composites show a reversible capacity of 1116.1 mA h g⁻¹ at 0.1 A g⁻¹ and 587.2 mA h g⁻¹ at 2 A g⁻¹, as well as stable capacity retention over cycling. Furthermore, the hybrid device based on Fe₃O₄@C composites achieves a specific energy of 110.1 Wh kg⁻¹ at a specific power of 250 W kg⁻¹, demonstrating promising application of the reported hybrid systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abiopolymers 3acarbon 3acathodes 3achitosan 3acoatings 3airon oxides 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amoieties 3ananocomposites 3aparticle size 3areaction kinetics 3aspecific energy 0aSupercapacitor 0aLithium ion battery 0aFe3O4 0aCarbon coating 0aSpecific energy1 aXu, Lei1 aLi, Hongfei1 aShi, Ruiying1 aZhang, Tengfei1 aLi, Junqin1 aWong, Ching-Ping1 aKang, Feiyu1 aLin, Zhiqun1 aLi, Baohua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4876-26590 tCarbon.g2018 Dec., v. 140 p.296-305dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245014300165300001600308500001100324520116600335592002801501650000801529650001601537650002801553650001001581650002001591650001001611650001601621650001101637650001401648650001301662650004301675650000901718650001101727700002301738700002701761700001801788700002201806700001601828700002801844700002501872773018801897856007902085852000902164655001202173IND50074243420221122131902.0150218e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007424342DNAL7 a10.1111/1574-6968.123952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNath, Vishnu S.10aRapid and sensitive detection of Phytophthora colocasiae responsible for the taro leaf blight using conventional and real‐time PCR assay  ap. 174-183.  aLETTER  aConventional and real‐time PCR assays were developed for sensitive and specific detection of Phytophthora colocasiae, an oomycete pathogen that causes leaf blight and corm rot of taro. A set of three primer pairs was designed from regions of the RAS‐related protein (Ypt1), G protein alpha‐subunit (GPA1) and phospho‐ribosylanthranilate isomerase (TRP1) genes. In conventional PCR, the lower limit of detection was 50 pg DNA, whereas in real‐time PCR, the detection limit was 12.5 fg for the primer based on Ypt1 gene. The cycle threshold values were linearly correlated with the concentration of the target DNA (range of R² = 0.911–0.999). All the primer sets were successful in detecting P. colocasie from naturally infected leaves and tubers of taro. Phytophthora colocasiae was detected from artificially infested samples after 18 and 15 h of postinoculation in conventional and real‐time PCR assay, respectively. The developed PCR assay proved to be a robust and reliable technique to detect P. colocasiae in taro planting material and for assessing the distribution of pathogen within fields, thus aid in mitigating taro leaf blight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aPhytophthora colocasiae 3acorms 3adetection limit 3agenes 3aleaf blight 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aplanting 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ataro 3atubers1 aHegde, Vinayaka M.1 aJeeva, Muthulekshmi L.1 aMisra, Raj S.1 aVeena, Syamala S.1 aRaj, Mithun1 aUnnikrishnan, Suresh K.1 aDarveekaran, Sree S.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2014 Mar., v. 352, no. 2 p.174-183dPublished by Elsevier/North Holland on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6968.123953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245012900189300001600318520127300334592002801607650002601635650003301661650001901694650001201713650001501725650001001740650001201750650001601762650001101778650001601789653001701805653002101822653002301843700001801866700001601884773010101900856011702001852000902118655001202127IND50065136720221119015304.0151127e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006513672DNAL7 a10.1658/1100-9233(2003)014[0835:CBLPAD]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichmond, D.

Endophyte infection had little or no effect on L. perenne tiller production, above- or below-ground biomass or root:shoot ratio in monoculture. However, endophyte infection significantly reduced L. perenne tiller production and above-ground biomass in mixtures with D. sanguinalis. Conversely, D. sanguinalis had significantly higher above-ground biomass and yielded more seed (g) when competing with endophyte infected L. perenne. An apparent trade-off between allocation of resources to reproductive vs root tissues was observed in D. sanguinalis –– root:shoot ratio was significantly lower when competing with endophyte infected L. perenne. Results indicate negative ecological consequences for harbouring the fungal endophyte when competing with the fast growing annual grass in newly established stands. These findings underscore the existence of a physiological cost of harbouring the fungal endophyte which is often overlooked.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDigitaria sanguinalis 3aEpichloe festucae var. lolii 3aLolium perenne 3abiomass 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agrasses 3agreenhouses 3ashoots 3awarm season 0aAnnual grass 0aFungal endophyte 0aPhysiological cost1 aGrewal, P.

On the other hand, the Mn1O5 bond in the Mn3CaO4 cubane region of the Mn4Ca cluster is significantly elongated to 2.6Å. Using a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach, we investigated factors that are responsible for distortion of the Mn3CaO4 cubane. Removal of Ca led to shortening the Mn1O5 bond by 0.2Å; however, Mn1O5 remained significantly elongated, at >2.5Å. Conversely, removal of Mn4 significantly shortens the Mn1O5 distance by 0.5Å to 2.2Å, resulting in a more symmetric cubane shape. These results suggest that Mn4, not Ca, is predominantly responsible for distortion of the Mn3CaO4 cubane. It was not the Ca component that was responsible for the existence of the two S2 conformers but two different Mn oxidation states (Mn1, Mn2, Mn3, M4)=(III, IV, IV, IV) and (IV, IV, IV, III); they were interconvertible by translocation of the O5 atom along the Mn1–O5–Mn4 axis. Depletion of Ca resulted in rearrangement of the H-bond network near TyrZ, which proceeds via a chloride ion (Cl-1 pathway). This may explain why Ca depletion inhibits the S2 to S3 transition, the same process that can also be inhibited by Cl− depletion.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3achlorides 3acrystal structure 3amanganese 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphotosystem II 0aPSII 0aQM/MM 0aCa-depleted Photosystem II 0aMn4Ca 0aDistorted Mn3CaO4 cubane 0aSr-substituted photosystem II 0aOverreduced state1 aIshikita, Hiroshi0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2014 Jan., v. 1837, no. 1 p.159-166dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010100168300001600269520135500285592002801640650001701668650002601685650001301711650002201724650001501746650003501761651001701796653002601813653002301839653001601862653001801878653001101896653001701907653003201924653002801956653002101984700002102005773013002026856008102156852000902237655001202246IND60651275420221121022807.0190711e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065127542DNAL7 a10.1017/S03768929180004982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTopp, Emmeline N10aFragmented Landscape, Fragmented Knowledge: A Synthesis of Renosterveld Ecology and Conservation  ap. 171-179.  aKnowledge of ecological patterns and processes is key to effective conservation of biodiversity hotspots under threat. Renosterveld is one of the most critically endangered habitats in the biologically unique Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. For the first time, we map and synthesize the current state of knowledge on renosterveld ecology and conservation. We investigated 132 studies for the themes, locations and taxa of renosterveld research and the fragmentation, threats, recommendations and barriers to renosterveld conservation. More studies focused on plants than any other taxa (48% of articles) and are conducted mostly in larger, intact renosterveld fragments. The most commonly identified threat to renosterveld was agricultural intensification; conservation recommendations spanned improved farming practices, formal protection and local patch management. Conservation implementation has been piecemeal and has depended largely on the goodwill of landowners, which can be constrained by costs of conservation measures and a lack of suitable restoration means. Citizen science is a promising potential solution to some barriers. Fragmented knowledge in such a transformed and relatively densely populated region highlights the scale of knowledge gaps for other biodiversity hotspots and has implications for ongoing conservation work.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3aintensive farming 3alandowners 3anatural resources conservation 3aSouth Africa 0aCape Floristic Region 0afarmland expansion 0afire regime 0afragmentation 0afynbos 0aSouth Africa 0aglobal biodiversity hotspot 0aMediterranean ecosystem 0avalue perception1 aLoos, Jacqueline0 tEnvironmental conservation.g2019 June, v. 46, no. 2 p.171-179dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25024x1469-43877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S03768929180004983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003800151245013300189300002000322520128900342592002801631650004401659650001501703650001701718650001901735650001401754650002301768650001601791650000901807650002101816650001501837650002401852650001301876650001401889650001701903650001601920650001501936650003301951650001101984650001701995650001202012650003702024650001102061653002002072653001402092653002102106653002902127653001502156653001602171700001602187700001902203700002302222700005702245773014502302856008502447852000902532655001202541IND60611660920181025000000.0180904e20180719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061166092DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b017382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemos, Ana Maria Teves Franco de,10aIntegrated Mechanochemical/Microwave-Assisted Approach for the Synthesis of Biogenic Silica-Based Catalysts from Rice Husk Waste  ap. 11555-11562.  aA template-free, simple, effective, and reproducible integrated mechanochemical/microwave promoted methodology has been designed to derive porous silica materials from rice husk waste. Microwave-assisted acid dissolution effectively removed metal ions from rice husk in order to obtain a highly pure (>95%) amorphous mesoporous silica with a surface area of 352 m² g–¹. As-synthesized silica materials were used as supports to prepare iron oxide-containing nanocatalyst via mechanochemistry employing a dry milling step in which the pore structure of silica was retained in the final materials after iron incorporation. Synthesized materials were characterized using different techniques including N₂ physisorption, powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Materials featured excellent and versatile catalytic activities in microwave-assisted oxidation and acid-catalyzed reactions. Toluene alkylation was successfully promoted in quantitative product yields with complete selectivity to monoalkylated products. The iron-containing catalyst exhibited good conversion (up to 44%) at complete benzaldehyde selectivity in the liquid-phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalkylation 3abenzaldehyde 3abenzyl alcohol 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adry milling 3airon 3amechanochemistry 3ametal ions 3amicrowave treatment 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aporous media 3areflectance 3arice hulls 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asurface area 3atoluene 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastes 0aBiogenic silica 0aRice husk 0aMechanochemistry 0aIron oxide nanoparticles 0aOxidations 0aAlkylations1 aDe, Sudipta1 aBalu, Alina M.1 aRomero, Antonio A.1 aLuque, Rafael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4190-19160 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 July 19, v. 6, no. 9 p.11555-11562dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b017383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009600170300001600266520146900282592002801751650001701779650002201796650002901818650001401847650003701861650002001898650002001918650001901938650001801957650001901975650002801994653001902022653002002041653002502061653002402086653003602110700002602146700001802172773011802190856008502308852000902393655001202402IND60536039520221120095604.0190214e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053603952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTikkanen, Mikko10aPhotosystem II photoinhibition-repair cycle protects Photosystem I from irreversible damage  ap. 210-215.  aPhotodamage of Photosystem II (PSII) has been considered as an unavoidable and harmful reaction that decreases plant productivity. PSII, however, has an efficient and dynamically regulated repair machinery, and the PSII activity becomes inhibited only when the rate of damage exceeds the rate of repair. The speed of repair is strictly regulated according to the energetic state in the chloroplast. In contrast to PSII, Photosystem I (PSI) is very rarely damaged, but when occurring, the damage is practically irreversible. While PSII damage is linearly dependent on light intensity, PSI gets damaged only when electron flow from PSII exceeds the capacity of PSI electron acceptors to cope with the electrons. When electron flow to PSI is limited, for example in the presence of DCMU, PSI is extremely tolerant against light stress. Proton gradient (ΔpH)-dependent slow-down of electron transfer from PSII to PSI, involving the PGR5 protein and the Cyt b6f complex, protects PSI from excess electrons upon sudden increase in light intensity. Here we provide evidence that in addition to the ΔpH-dependent control of electron transfer, the controlled photoinhibition of PSII is also able to protect PSI from permanent photodamage. We propose that regulation of PSII photoinhibition is the ultimate regulator of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and provides a photoprotection mechanism against formation of reactive oxygen species and photodamage in PSI.  aPublisher supplied data 3achloroplasts 3aelectron transfer 3aelectron transport chain 3aelectrons 3aequipment maintenance and repair 3alight intensity 3aphotoinhibition 3aphotostability 3aphotosystem I 3aphotosystem II 3areactive oxygen species 0aPhotosynthesis 0aPhotoprotection 0aPSII photoinhibition 0aPSI photoinhibition 0aRegulation of electron transfer1 aMekala, Nageswara Rao1 aAro, Eva-Mari0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2014 Jan., v. 1837, no. 1 p.210-215dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245009900203300001100302506007600313520136100389592002801750596010301778596007901881596007901960506003702039650001902076650001702095650001602112650002402128650001602152650001902168650001602187650001102203650001802214650001902232650002302251650001902274650002202293650001002315650001102325650001202336650000902348650001102357650002402368650000902392650001802401650002102419700001402440700001702454700001302471700001902484700001502503773010802518856008202626852000902708655001202717IND60596931920221207091044.0181230e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059693192DNAL7 a10.1186/s12986-018-0275-x2doi7 aPMC60112442pmcid7 a299511082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Chao10aAnti-obesity and Hypolipidemic effects of garlic oil and onion oil in rats fed a high-fat diet  ap. 43.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Until now, little research concerning the lipid-lowering and anti-obesity functions of garlic oil and onion oil has been performed. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of garlic oil and onion oil on serum lipid levels in hyperlipidemia model rats, to provide a scientific basis for the prevention of hyperlipidemia through a dietary approach, and to explore the potential health benefits of garlic and onion. METHOD: Ninety-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into eight groups based on their body weight and serum levels of triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC). The rats received repeated oral administration of volatile oils extracted from garlic and onion for 60 days. Serum lipids and parameters of obesity were examined. RESULTS: The volatile oils suppressed the HFD-induced body weight gain and tended to decrease adipose tissue weight. The oils decreased the levels of TG, TC and LDL-C and increased the serum level of HDL-C compared with the rats in the hyperlipidemia model groups (P < 0.05). The oils were also effective at improving the lipid profile and alleviating hepatic steatosis. CONCLUSION: Our results implied that garlic oil and onion oil have anti-obesity properties that can counteract the effects of an HFD on body weight, adipose tissue weight, and serum lipid profiles.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0400604-02cthe Key Research and Development projects of Ministry of Science and Technology  aBE2007407cScientific and Technological Project in Jiangsu Province, China  a2242016K40024cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipose tissue 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3acholesterol 3aessential oils 3afatty liver 3agarlic 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperlipidemia 3alaboratory animals 3alipemic effect 3alipid composition 3amales 3amodels 3aobesity 3aoils 3aonions 3aoral administration 3arats 3atissue weight 3atriacylglycerols1 aLi, Lihua1 aYang, Ligang1 aLu, Hui,1 aWang, Shaokang1 aSun, Guiju0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2018 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.43-43dBioMed CentralwJournal:2211x1743-70757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12986-018-0275-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03503naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100001700183245009200200300001800292506007600310520193600386592002802322506003702350650002102387650001802408650001002426650001702436650001102453650001402464650001102478650001102489650002002500650002302520650003102543650002102574650001202595650003302607650003002640650001102670650002902681650001002710650002302720650002602743650003202769650002602801773009202827856004502919852000902964655001202973IND4487125720221207070626.0120502e20120607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448712572DNAL7 a224182572pmid7 aPMC33217222pmcid7 a10.1098/rspb.2012.03242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClose, James10aAre stress responses to geomagnetic storms mediated by the cryptochrome compass system?  ap. 2081-2090.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA controversial body of literature demonstrates associations of geomagnetic storms (GMS) with numerous cardiovascular, psychiatric and behavioural outcomes. Various melatonin hypotheses of GMS have suggested that temporal variation in the geomagnetic field (GMF) may be acting as an additional zeitgeber (a temporal synchronizer) for circadian rhythms, with GMS somehow interfering with the hypothesized system. The cryptochrome genes are known primarily as key components of the circadian pacemaker, ultimately involved in controlling the expression of the hormone melatonin. Cryptochrome is identified as a clear candidate for mediating the effect of GMS on humans, demonstrating the prior existence of several crucial pieces of evidence. A distinct scientific literature demonstrates the widespread use of geomagnetic information for navigation across a range of taxa. One mechanism of magnetoreception is thought to involve a light-dependent retinal molecular system mediated by cryptochrome, acting in a distinct functionality to its established role as a circadian oscillator. There is evidence suggesting that such a magnetosense—or at least the vestiges of it—may exist in humans. This paper argues that cryptochrome is not acting as secondary geomagnetic zeitgeber to influence melatonin synthesis. Instead, it is hypothesized that the cryptochrome compass system is mediating stress responses more broadly across the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis (including alterations to circadian behaviour) in response to changes in the GMF. Two conceptual models are outlined for the existence of such responses—the first as a generalized migrational/dispersal strategy, the second as a stress response to unexpected signals to the magnetosense. It is therefore proposed that GMS lead to disorientation of hormonal systems in animals and humans, thus explaining the effects of GMS on human health and behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acircadian rhythm 3acryptochromes 3agenes 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amelatonin 3amodels 3astorms 3astress response 3atemporal variation 2aAdrenal Glandsxphysiology 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aCircadian Rhythmxphysiology 2aCryptochromesxphysiology 2aHumans 2aHypothalamusxphysiology 2aLight 2aMagnetic Phenomena 2aMelatoninxphysiology 2aPituitary Glandxphysiology 2aStress, Physiological0 tProceedings.g2012 June 7, v. 279, no. 1736 p.2081-2090dRoyal Societyx0962-84527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2012.0324  aDNAL 7aarticle01927naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003200135040001800167100002000185245016700205300001300372500001400385506007600399520070600475592002801181506003701209650001401246650001501260650001601275651001201291651001101303651001201314653001001326653001501336653001101351773009101362856007901453852000901532655001201541IND60693322720221207065222.0210117e20101104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069332272DNAL7 aPMC30884172pmcid7 a215940292pmid7 a10.3897/zookeys.66.6842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErwin, Terry L.10aAgra, arboreal beetles of Neotropical forests:pusilla group and piranha group systematics and notes on their ways of life (Coleoptera, Carabidae, Lebiini, Agrina)  ap. 1-28.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRevisions of two new species groups of the genus Agra Fabricius are presented with the following species described as new: pusilla group - Agra cruciariasp. n.

CD is a T cell-mediated, tissue-specific autoimmune disease which affects genetically susceptible individuals after dietary exposure to proline- and glutamine-rich proteins contained in certain cereal grains. Genetics, environmental factors and different immune systems, together with the presence of auto-antigens, are taken into account when identifying the pathogenesis of CD. CD pathogenesis is related to immune dysregulation, which involves the gastrointestinal system, and the extra-intestinal systems such as the nervous system, whose neurological symptoms are evidenced in CD patients. A gluten-free diet (GFD) could avoid cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, neuropathies, migraine and mild cognitive impairment. Furthermore, untreated CD patients have more symptoms and psychiatric co-morbidities than those treated with a GFD. Common psychiatric symptoms in untreated CD adult patients include depression, apathy, anxiety, and irritability and schizophrenia is also common in untreated CD. Several studies show improvement in psychiatric symptoms after the start of a GFD. The present review discusses the state of the art regarding neurological and psychiatric complications in CD and highlights the evidence supporting a role for GFD in reducing neurological and psychiatric complications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanxiety 3aataxia (disorder) 3aautoimmune diseases 3aceliac disease 3acerebellum 3acognitive disorders 3adietary exposure 3aenvironmental factors 3aepilepsy 3agastrointestinal system 3agenetics 3agluten-free diet 3aimmune system 3amigraine 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3aproline 3aproteins 3aschizophrenia 3asmall cereal grains 0aCoeliac disease 0aNeurological complications 0aCognitive impairment 0aPsychiatric disorders1 aPesce, Mirko1 aTatangelo, Raffaella1 aRizzuto, Alessia1 aLa Fratta, Irene1 aGrilli, Alfredo0 tNutrition research reviews.g2017 June, v. 30, no. 1 p.25-35dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl43438x1475-27007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09544224160002143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008000164300001600244520106300260592002801323650002101351650002501372650002301397650002501420650001701445650002201462650001401484650001301498650002601511650001201537650001301549700002801562700003001590700002101620700002201641700001801663700001701681700002001698773011201718856008101830852000901911655001201920IND50074255020221120163446.0141024e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007425502DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-013-1003-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Huaiwei10aMetabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for biosynthesis of D-galactonate  ap. 383-391.  aD-galactose is an attractive substrate for bioconversion. Herein, Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered to convert D-galactose into D-galactonate, a valuable compound in the polymer and cosmetic industries. D-galactonate productions by engineered E. coli strains were observed in shake flask cultivations containing 2 g L⁻¹ D-galactose. Engineered E. coli expressing gld coding for galactose dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas syringae was able to produce 0.17 g L⁻¹ D-galactonate. Inherent metabolic pathways for assimilating both D-galactose and D-galactonate were blocked to enhance the production of D-galactonate. This approach finally led to a 7.3-fold increase with D-galactonate concentration of 1.24 g L⁻¹ and yield of 62.0 %. Batch fermentation in 20 g L⁻¹ D-galactose of E. coli ∆galK∆dgoK mutant expressing the gld resulted in 17.6 g L⁻¹ of D-galactonate accumulation and highest yield of 88.1 %. Metabolic engineering strategy developed in this study could be useful for industrial production of D-galactonate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas syringae 3abatch fermentation 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3abiotransformation 3agalactose 3aindustry 3ametabolic engineering 3amutants 3apolymers1 aRamos, Kristine Rose M.1 aValdehuesa, Kris Niño G.1 aNisola, Grace M.1 aMalihan, Lenny B.1 aLee, Won-Keun1 aPark, Si Jae1 aChung, Wook-Jin0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2014 Mar., v. 37, no. 3 p.383-391dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-013-1003-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245014400171520136000315592002801675650001501703650001601718650000901734650002201743650001701765650002001782650002001802650002601822650001401848651001101862653002901873653002001902653002401922653001001946653001301956653001601969700002701985700001902012700002302031700002902054700001502083700002402098700002402122773012402146856008402270852000902354655001202363IND60781897720221116170229.0220906e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078189772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2022.1075602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Caitlin M.10aRecent speciation and phenotypic plasticity within a parthenogenetic lineage of levantine whip spiders (Chelicerata: Amblypygi: Charinidae)  aCaves constitute ideal study systems for investigating adaptation and speciation, as the abiotic conditions shared by aphotic habitats exert a set of environmental filters on their communities. Arachnids constitute an important component of many cave ecosystems worldwide. We investigated the population genomics of two whip spider species: Sarax ioanniticus, a widely distributed parthenogenetic species found across the eastern Mediterranean; and S. israelensis, a recently described troglomorphic species that is endemic to caves in Israel. Here, we show that S. israelensis is completely genetically distinct from S. ioanniticus and most likely also a parthenogen. Counterintuitively, despite the lack of genetic variability within S. ioanniticus and S. israelensis, we discovered considerable variation in the degree of median eye reduction, particularly in the latter species. Natural history data from captive-bred specimens of S. israelensis validated the interpretation of parthenogenesis. Our results are most consistent with a scenario of a sexual ancestral species that underwent speciation, followed by independent transitions to apomictic parthenogenesis in each of the two daughter species. Moreover, the lack of genetic variability suggests that variation in eye morphology in S. israelensis is driven exclusively by epigenetic mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCharinidae 3aepigenetics 3aeyes 3agenetic variation 3ametagenomics 3anatural history 3aparthenogenesis 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aphylogeny 3aIsrael 0aGenotyping-by-sequencing 0aMolecular clock 0aPopulation genomics 0aSarax 0aSympatry 0aTroglophile1 aBallesteros, Jesús A.1 aAharon, Shlomi1 aGainett, Guilherme1 aArmiach Steinpress, Igor1 aWizen, Gil1 aSharma, Prashant P.1 aGavish-Regev, Efrat0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2022 Oct., v. 175 p.107560-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2022.1075603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04023naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002100147245008400168300001600252520290400268592002803172650001303200650001203213650001203225650001403237650001203251650001003263650001203273650001503285650001203300650001803312650002103330650002003351650001503371650001103386650001103397650001003408651001203418773007903430856008303509852000903592655001203601IND4458114620221120153608.0141111e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445811462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2010.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPartzsch, Monika10aDoes land use change affect the interactions between two dry grassland species?  ap. 550-558.  aOver the last 20 years, a change in traditional land use practices has taken place in central Germany. Formerly species-rich dry grassland communities have been converted into communities with greatly reduced diversity in many places. Whereas grass species have expanded, several forbs have declined in abundance. For the present study, plant–plant interactions were assessed between the expanding grass Festuca rupicola and the forb Dianthus carthusianorum – two typical, companion grassland species – to ascertain any associated effects of land use change. A competition experiment was set up with replacement design, in which pots were placed in the open field and monitored over two consecutive years. In order to assess the performance of both species in monoculture (D9, F9) and mixture (D3F6, D6F3) the parameters biomass, length of flowering stems, number of flowering stems and number of flowers per individual, or length of panicles, were analyzed. Positive and negative interactions were evaluated using the “Relative Neighbour Effect” index (RNE). To simulate land use by grazing or mowing, individuals in half of the pots were clipped in the first year after sowing. At this time, performance of D. carthusianorum – in terms of length of flowering stems, number of flowering stems and number of flowers – was significantly affected: whereas the first parameter increased, both of the other parameters decreased with increasing presence of the grass species. However, RNE indicated facilitation with a low number of F. rupicola individuals, and competition with a high number of F. rupicola individuals. In contrast, F. rupicola did not show any significant differences in performance with increasing presence of D. carthusianorum, and the RNE switched from neutral interaction to facilitation. In the second year after sowing, the performance of D. carthusianorum in the various treatments did not differ, except for the length of the flowering stems. The simulation of land use practices did not affect the performance of D. carthusianorum, but F. rupicola showed significant differences in biomass and in length of the panicles, as was the case also between monocultures and mixtures. The performance of the grass species was clearly improved in the unclipped treatments. The RNE reflected competition against D. carthusianorum which became reduced in unclipped treatments, while F. rupicola became facilitated. There were no interactions between the different treatments (monocultures and mixtures) and the simulated land use change (clipped and unclipped). Our data suggest that although traditional land use practices, i.e. grazing and mowing, do not affect the development of D. carthusianorum, the abandonment of these practices has improved F. rupicola performance, which has led to the increasingly invasive character of this grass species over the last 20 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDianthus 3aFestuca 3abiomass 3aflowering 3aflowers 3aforbs 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3agrazing lands 3ainvasive species 3aland use change 3amonitoring 3amowing 3asowing 3astems 3aGermany0 tFlora.g2011 June, v. 206, no. 6 p.550-558dElsevier GmbHx0367-25307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2010.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008500164300001600249500002000265500000900285520135100294592002801645596004801673596004701721650001301768650002501781650001601806650001201822650001301834650001201847650001501859700001301874700002401887700001801911700001401929773015801943856008302101852000902184655001202193IND60668071120221120031850.0220813e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066807112DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2017.01.0034n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaemmel, T.10aDirect Observation of Wind‐Induced Pressure‐Pumping on Gas Transport in Soil  ap. 770-774.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCore Ideas We directly observed the effect of wind‐induced pressure‐pumping on gas transport in soil. Mean above‐canopy wind speeds >3 m s⁻¹ increase the soil gas transport rate by about 10%. We generally recommend considering the pressure‐pumping effect in gas flux measurements. Soil gas transport is commonly assumed to be governed by molecular diffusion. However, nondiffusive transport processes such as wind‐induced pressure‐pumping can significantly enhance soil gas transport during periods of high wind speed. During a field campaign at a forest site, we combined methods to measure soil gas transport, air pressure, and airflow characteristics. We directly observed the enhancement of gas transport due to wind‐induced air pressure fluctuations during two periods when mean above‐canopy wind speeds exceeded 3 m s–^⁹¹. Specifically, we measured an increase of the topsoil gas diffusivity of about 10%. The wind‐induced air pressure fluctuations, which were responsible for pressure‐pumping, had frequencies of 0.02 Hz and amplitudes up to 5 Pa. Overall, our results show that wind‐induced pressure‐pumping can substantially increase the commonly diffusion‐limited transport rate of soil gases. We therefore recommend considering this process in gas flux measurements in the field and in the laboratory.  aPublisher supplied data  aSCHA 1528/1‐1cGerman Research Foundation  aSCHI 868/3‐1cGerman Research Foundation 3aair flow 3aatmospheric pressure 3adiffusivity 3aforests 3asoil air 3atopsoil 3awind speed1 aMohr, M.1 aSchack-Kirchner, H.1 aSchindler, D.1 aMaier, M.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2017 July, v. 81, no. 4 p.770-774dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2017.01.0034n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011200172300001600284520139600300592002801696650002001724650001601744650001501760650001301775650001901788650001601807650001101823650001201834650001801846650001701864650001101881650001101892650001101903650002101914650001101935650001801946650002101964650001401985650000901999650001502008650001502023653001602038653002202054653001702076653001702093653001802110653001002128700001902138700001702157700001702174700001802191773011002209856008602319852000902405655001202414IND60533458520221123010418.0190319e20150922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053345852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2015.07.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiasconaro, M.L.10aStudy of fat compost from dairy industry wastewater as a new substrate for pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) crop  ap. 359-366.  aThe aim of this study was to analyze the impact of different doses of compost obtained from fats waste of dairy industry mixed with commercial peat-based substrate and with soil on pepper plants development. Furthermore, this investigation attempted to determine the effects of these mixtures on germination and composition of pepper fruits. Fat compost (FC) was obtained by aerobic composting from dairy industry wastewaters mixed with wood chips and green grass. FC extract resulted free of phytotoxicity for seed germination, obtained 99.71% the relative seed germination and 74.10% of germination index. Different growing media were prepared by mixing 0, 10, 20 and 40% of FC with commercial substrate (CS) or Soil in two different experiments. Results showed that the application of FC on CS and Soil respectively, increased plant dry matter. On pepper seedling FC 40 achieves 250mg plant−1 DM. Moreover, higher doses of FC improved yield and several characteristics of fruit as dry matter, diameter and concentrations of some carotenoids. The incorporation of FC did not increase the heavy metals concentration of pepper fruit. At leaves, the highest concentrations of N were reached shown on treatment with FC (Soil: 1.46%, FC 10: 1.92%, FC 20: 2.00%, FC 40: 2.09%). Application of FC for germination and development of pepper plants improved the seedlings, fruit yield and quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3acarotenoids 3acomposting 3acomposts 3adairy industry 3afruit yield 3afruits 3agrasses 3agrowing media 3aheavy metals 3aleaves 3alipids 3amixing 3anitrogen content 3apepper 3aphytotoxicity 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3asoil 3awastewater 3awood chips 0aFat compost 0aFruit carotenoids 0aHeavy metals 0aLeaf solutes 0aNursery trays 0aYield1 aAntolín, M.C.1 aLovato, M.E.1 aGervasio, S.1 aMartín, C.A.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2015 Sept. 22, v. 193 p.359-366dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.07.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245008400176300001400260520148600274592002801760653001501788653002201803653001601825653003301841653001401874653002101888653001701909653002301926700003001949700003601979700002902015700002702044700002302071773011702094856008202211852000902293655001202302IND60552183420221120131807.0161020e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055218342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.regg.2014.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelenguer Varea, Ángel13aEl estrés oxidativo como predictor de longevidad; estudio de casos y controles  ap. 16-21.  aHuman longevity is a complex issue influenced by genetic and environmental factors.

In the present study we compared malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized proteins (OP) plasma levels, in elderly people older than 97 years and 70-80 years old, to better understand the effects of OE on human longevity.Population-based case control study. We considered as cases patients who were born and live on la Ribera county in Valencia (Spain) older than 97 years old and who accepted to participate in the study. Controls were from the same poblational base, chosen randomly, and 70-80 years old. We made a descriptive analysis of sociodemographic, clinic and functional variables; an odds ratio (OR) estimation of being centenarian by OP and MDA quartiles; and a tendency analysis by Mantel-Haenszel test.Twenty eight cases and 31 controls were included. Functional state and robust percentage were worse in cases. MDA (1,44±0,45 vs 1,84±0,59, p=0,005), and OP (64,29±15,73 vs. 76,52±13,44, p=0,002) levels, were significantly lower in cases. The OR of being centenarian in lower/higher quartile were 3,8 for MDA and 5,7 for OP, with a Mantel-Haenszel signification of 0,029 and 0,044 respectively.In our study OE level were lower in centenarians than in younger elderly, and the lower the OE grade, the higher were the likelihood of being centenarian.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLongevidad 0aEstrés oxidativo 0aCentenarios 0aEstudio de casos y controles 0aLongevity 0aOxidative stress 0aCentenarians 0aCase-control study1 aMohamed Abdelaziz, Kheira1 aAvellana Zaragoza, Juan Antonio1 aBorrás Blasco, Consuelo1 aSanchis Aguilar, Paula1 aViña Ribes, José0 tRevista Espanola de Geriatria y Gerontologia.g2015 Jan.,  Feb., v. 50 p.16-21dElsevier Espanax0211-139X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.regg.2014.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01524naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245018500166300001400351520063000365592002800995650002301023650002301046650001101069650002201080773009901102856004801201852000901249655001201258IND50062468020221120153658.0130322e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006246802DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136130101282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmirnov, N.

In this study, we made five pairs of crosses of watermelon plants with different sex forms and grew progeny in two different seasons to investigate the inheritance of sex forms and the seasonal effect on sex expression. We showed that environmental factors have no effect on sex forms, but they affect sex expression on individual flowers as more pistillate flowers were observed in spring than in autumn. This suggests that short photoperiod and low temperatures promote formation of pistillate flowers in watermelon. In the F2 population of the cross of andromonoecious (SL3H or AKKZW)×monoecious (XHB), the segregation ratio is 9 monoecious: 3 trimonoecious: 4 andromonoecious, and the segregation ratio in BC1P1 (F1×andromonoecious parent) is 1 monoecious: 1 trimonoecious: 2 andromonoecious. The segregation ratio in the F2 population of the gynoecious (XHBGM)×monoecious (XHB) is 3 monoecious: 1 gynoecious whereas the segregation ratio in the BC1P1 (F1×gynoecious parent) is 1 monoecious: 1 gynoecious. The segregation ratio in the F2 population of gynoecious×andromonecious cross is 27 monoecious: 12 andromonoecious: 9 gynoecious: 9 trimonoecious: 4 hermaphroditic: 3 gynomonoecious. The segregation ratio in the BC1P1 population (F1×gynoecious) is 1 monoecious: 1 gynoecious whereas the segregation ratio in the BC1P2 (F1×andromonoecious) is 1 monoecious: 1 trimonoecious: 2 andromonoecious. Taken together, the results suggested that three recessive alleles, andromonoecious (a), gynoecious (gy) and trimonoecious (tm) control the sex forms in watermelon, and a allele is epistatic to the tm allele. The following phenotype-genotype relationships are proposed for each of the sex forms in watermelon: monoecious, A_Gy_Tm_; trimonoecious, A_Gy_tmtm; andromonoecious, aaGy_Tm_ or aaGy_tmtm; gynoecious, A_gygyTm_; gynomonoecious, A_gygytmtm; and hermaphroditic, aagygyTm_ or aagygytmtm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrullus lanatus 3aalleles 3aautumn 3acrossing 3aepistasis 3aflowers 3ahermaphroditism 3aphotoperiod 3aprogeny 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3atemperature 3awatermelons 0aWatermelon 0aSex forms 0aInheritance 0aEpistasis 0aF1 Hybrid 0aSex expression1 aZhang, Jie1 aGong, Guoyi1 aShi, Jianting1 aZhang, Haiying1 aRen, Yi1 aGuo, Shaogui1 aGao, Junping1 aShen, Huolin1 aXu, Yong0 tScientia horticulturae.g2015 Sept. 22, v. 193 p.367-373dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.07.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132040001800167100002800185245007500213300001600288500000900304506002800313506003000341520154500371592002801916596008301944596004502027506003702072650001002109650001302119650001102132650001102143650000902154650001802163650002602181650001202207650001502219650001402234650002402248650001102272650001402283650002602297650001802323651001302341700002202354700001602376700001902392700002302411700002002434700001902454773015802473856008202631903002202713852000902735655001202744IND60668071220221207121225.0191125e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066807122DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2015.07.02542chorus7 a10.2136/sssaj2015.07.02542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanco-Canqui, Humberto10aDoes Cattle Grazing and Baling of Corn Residue Increase Water Erosion?  ap. 168-177.  aepub  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aA better understanding of the implications of corn (Zea mays L.) residue grazing and baling on soil and environmental quality is needed to develop sustainable integrated crop–livestock production systems. We studied how corn residue grazing and baling impacted water erosion in a rainfed and an irrigated site in Nebraska after one and seven grazing seasons, respectively. Treatments were grazing (4.4 animal unit mo [AUM] ha⁻¹), baling, and control (no residue removal) in triplicate at the rainfed site on a Yutan silty clay loam (6% slope) and light grazing (2.5 AUM ha⁻¹), heavy grazing (5 AUM ha⁻¹), baling, and control in duplicate at the irrigated site on Duroc loam and Satanta loam (5.3% slope). We measured erosion under simulated rainfall for 30 min at an intensity of 6.3 ± 1.2 cm h⁻¹. Erosion did not increase after one season of grazing at the rainfed site, but it significantly increased after seven seasons of grazing at the irrigated site. At this site, both heavy and light grazing increased runoff by 3.3 mm and sediment loss by 0.26 Mg ha⁻¹. Baling had larger effects on water erosion than grazing. Across both sites, baling reduced time to runoff start by 14 min and increased runoff by 13 mm and sediment loss by 2.7 Mg ha⁻¹. While grazing after seven seasons increased nutrient loss, baling caused larger nutrient losses at both sites. Overall, grazing caused runoff losses of sediment, C, and nutrients in the long term, but baling consistently increased such losses in both short and long term.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDuroc 3aZea mays 3abaling 3acattle 3acorn 3acrop residues 3aenvironmental quality 3agrazing 3airrigation 3anutrients 3arainfall simulation 3arunoff 3asediments 3asilty clay loam soils 3awater erosion 3aNebraska1 aStalker, Aaron L.1 aRasby, Rick1 aShaver, Tim M.1 aDrewnoski, Mary E.1 avan Donk, Simon1 aKibet, Leonard0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2016 Jan., v. 80, no. 1 p.168-177dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2015.07.02543Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245005400134300001400188500001900202520138100221592002801602650000901630650001501639650000901654650001801663650001101681650001301692650001101705650001201716650001801728650001701746650001501763651001201778700002101790700002101811700002401832773014701856852000902003655001202012IND60716850320221120172010.0201107e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071685032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOogathoo, Shalini10aEvaluation of the MIKE SHE Model in a Cold Region  ap. 26-37.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGiven its rapid urbanization, the Canagagigue Creek watershed, located in Grand River Basin (Ontario, Canada), is subjected to shifting hydrological patterns. Consequently, surface runoff was simulated using a watershed-scale model MIKE SHE. The model was calibrated with four years of data and validated with another four years data. Satisfactory levels of overall correlation (R²) between monitored and model-simulated monthly runoff were: 0.87 and 0.77 for the calibration and validation periods, respectively. Corresponding values of the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, 0.86 and 0.75, were similar. The model was also used to simulate different management scenarios, urbanization, deforestation, conversion of pastureland into agriculture, diversification of corn system into cash crops, and application of tile drainage. Urbanization showed little impact on surface runoff as increase in urbanized area was a small fraction of the watershed area. Deforestation considerably increased (11%) the total flow. Change in cropping patterns and installation of drainage system had marginal impacts on the surface runoffs. Overall, the model was able to simulate surface runoff reasonably well on monthly and annual basis, although slightly poorer on daily basis. It was concluded that the model could be used to investigate hydrological behaviour of the watersheds in cold climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3acold zones 3acorn 3adeforestation 3amodels 3apastures 3arunoff 3astreams 3atile drainage 3aurbanization 3awatersheds 3aOntario1 aPrasher, Shiv O.1 aRudra, Ramesh P.1 aPatel, Ramanbhai M.0 tJournal of agricultural engineering.g2011 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.26-37dIndian Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2009x0976-24187nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009300157300001800250500002000268520097700288592002801265650001401293650002201307650000901329650002001338650001201358700002901370773014501399856007501544852000901619655001201628IND60789437620221122005151.0220820e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078943762DNAL7 a10.1002/aepp.131142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Fur, Eric10aReal Options and Reduction of Basic Risk of Index‐Based Climate Agricultural Insurance  ap. 1658-1671.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis article is a discussion of the concept of index‐based agricultural insurance and the possible role of real options to reduce the basic risk. Indeed, to address the consequences of variability of weather within climate, experiments based on indexed agricultural insurance have been implemented in recent years. However, this locally defined insurance scheme has a weak point called the basic risk, i.e., the difference between the reality of climatic shocks and the payment of compensation. Real options allow this gap to be filled by offering alternatives to farmers. This article is the first to discuss the use of real options in the basic risk management of index‐based climate agricultural insurance. The implications for farmers in developing countries, insurers, and local and institutional organizations and communities are important: better management of operating conditions, optimized financial management, and consideration of real climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainsurance 3aissues and policy 3arisk 3arisk management 3aweather1 aOutreville, J.

In this context, a specific software application for PU management has been developed and was used for assessing its acceptability, usefulness and applicability by professional nurses from three residential homes for the elderly over a period of one year.A software application is designed and evaluated. This software application allows health professionals to: Manage and monitor PUs.; to determine the risk of PUs; and perform a nutritional status screen, based on a comprehensive data collection, processing and interpretation. It also allows health professionals to exchange data between themselves and at different care levels, which could provide a new approach based on the use of ICT as a tool for an agreement to shared care. This approach has an important journey ahead in terms of its assessment, to which we attempt to contribute through this article.Three centres and 69 residents are taking part in this project.During these processes, 27 nutritional status screens and 22 PU risk assessments, as well as the monitoring of 230 PUs have been performed.Nurses professionals think that the system is useful, easy to use, and perceive that it improves patient monitoring, but not relationship between professionals. Moreover, they would like to makethe web a more powerful part of the application and to speed up the procedures.  aPublisher supplied data 0aUlceras por presión 0aTecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones 0aSoporte gestión 0aAplicabilidad 0aAceptabilidad 0aPressure ulcers 0aInformation and communication technology 0aManagement support 0aApplicability 0aAcceptability1 aRodríguez Arrieta, Jimena1 aBagüés Bafaluy, Miren I.1 aCalvo Aguirre, Juan José0 tRevista Espanola de Geriatria y Gerontologia.g2015 July,  Aug., v. 50 p.179-184dElsevier EspanaaSEGGx0211-139X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.regg.2014.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04106naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012800170520249700298592002802795650002002823650000802843650001702851650002402868650002002892650001002912650001502922650002302937650001702960650002402977650002503001650001403026650001403040650001303054650002503067650001703092653001503109653001803124653002803142653002703170653001603197700001503213700001803228700001703246700005703263700002003320700001903340773012403359856008403483852000903567655001203576IND60781898120221116170320.0220906e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078189812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2022.1075652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeiblitz, I.G.L.10aCaryophylliids (Anthozoa, Scleractinia) and mitochondrial gene order: Insights from mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenomics  aMolecularly, the family Caryophylliidae is polyphyletic and different sets of genetic data converge towards a consensus that a taxonomic review of this family is necessary. Overall, the order of genes in the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) together with DNA sequences have been used to successfully untangle evolutionary relationships in several groups of organisms. Published mitogenomes of two caryophylliid genera (Desmophyllum and Solenosmilia) present a transposition of the gene block containing cob, nad2, and nad6, which is located between nad5 5′ exon and trnW, while that of Polycyathus chaishanensis presents the same gene order as the majority of scleractinian corals. In molecular-based evolutionary reconstructions, caryophylliids that have the mitochondrial gene rearrangement were recovered as a monophyletic lineage (“true” caryophylliids), while members of the genus Polycyathus were placed in a different position. In this study, additional mitogenomes of this family were assembled and included in evolutionary reconstructions of Scleractinia in order to improve our understanding on whether the mitogenome gene rearrangement is limited to and, therefore, could be a synapomorphy of the actual members of Caryophylliidae. Specimens of Caryophyllia scobinosa, Premocyathus sp., Heterocyathus sulcatus, and Trochocyathus caryophylloides, as well as Desmophyllum pertusum and Solenosmilia variabilis from the Southwest Atlantic were sequenced using Illumina platforms. Then, mitochondrial genomes were assembled and annotated, and nuclear datasets were recovered in-silico from assembled contigs using a previously published set of baits. Evolutionary reconstructions were performed using mitochondrial and nuclear datasets and based on Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference. Obtained mitogenomes are circular and range between 15,816 and 18,225 bp in size and from 30.76% to 36.63% in GC content. The gene rearrangement is only seen in C. scobinosa, D. pertusum, Premocyathus sp., and S. variabilis, which were recovered as a monophyletic clade in both mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies. On the other hand, the “caryophylliids” with the canonical mitogenome gene order were not recovered within this clade. Differences in features of the skeleton of “true” caryophylliids in comparison to traditional members of the family were observed and offer further support that the gene rearrangement might be seen as a synapomorphy of family Caryophylliidae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aDNA 3aScleractinia 3acomputer simulation 3adata collection 3aexons 3agene order 3agene rearrangement 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genes 3amitochondrial genome 3amonophyly 3apolyphyly 3askeleton 3astatistical analysis 3asynapomorphy 0aGene order 0aMitochondrion 0aUltraconserved elements 0aAzooxanthellate corals 0aHard corals1 aVaga, C.F.1 aCapel, K.C.C.1 aCairns, S.D.1 aStolarski, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0994-68231 aQuattrini, A.M.1 aKitahara, M.V.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2022 Oct., v. 175 p.107565-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2022.1075653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01659naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245007700178300001600255500000900271520055200280592002800832650002600860650001700886650002000903650001700923650001800940650001200958650001000970650001800980651001600998651001301014700001701027773014801044856009601192852000901288655001201297IND60668071520221120024632.0191125e196607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066807152DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1966.03615995003000040032x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcFee, W.

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is known to regulate the ECM deposits. In this study, we detect the effect of adenovirus conducted CTGF (Adv-CTGF) transfection on either the expression of ECM components or aqueous humor outflow facility. Adv-CTGF was used to transfect rat trabecular meshwork cells in vivo and in vitro. Aqueous humor outflow facility was test by microbeads perfusion. Protein expression of CTGF, fibronectin, and collagen IV was determined using Western blot. In the Adv-CTGF group, the outflow facility displayed a significant decrease from baseline. It appears as though the transfection with Adv-CTGF significantly affects the aqueous humor outflow pattern. A negative correlation between IOP and PEFL indicated that a decrease in the area of bead deposition corresponded to an overall decrease of outflow, leading to an elevated IOP. Adv-CTGF can enhance the expression of CTGF, fibronectin and collagen IV. CTGF is the novel target for treatment of POAG. It is necessary to further study to test inhibition of CTGF expression for treatment of POAG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3acollagen 3aelastin 3aextracellular matrix 3afibronectins 3aglaucoma 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3atransfection1 aCheng, Jingli1 aLiu, Hongtao1 aWang, Feng1 aZhao, Shiguang0 tMolecular biology reports.g2013 Nov., v. 40, no. 11 p.6091-6096dSpringer-Verlagx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-013-2720-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245016000178300001600338500001900354520172900373592002802102650002702130650001402157650002402171650001502195650001902210650001402229650001502243650001402258650001202272650001302284651002002297700002002317700002402337700002102361700002502382773010102407856008502508852000902593655001202602IND60695625520221117174538.0200517e20010501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069562552DNAL7 a10.2216/i0031-8884-40-3-268.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKankaanpää, Harri T.10aNodularin analyses and toxicity of a Nodularia spumigena (Nostocales, Cyanobacteria) water-bloom in the western Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea, in August 1999  ap. 268-274.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDuring 2–12 August 1999, the development of a surface bloom dominated by the cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena was followed in the western Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Intense surface scums of aggregated N. spumigena existed on calm days. The low-nutrient N. spumigena-dominated water mass was separated by a front from a nutrient-rich water mass dominated by Aphanizomenon cf. flos-aquae (Nostocales, Cyanobacteria). Owing to inadequate mixing of the two water masses, it is likely that N. spumigena growth was based mainly on the use of internal phosphorus stores. Signs of cell decay were observed on 5 August, and the proportion of empty filaments in the community increased towards the end of the survey period. A high number of Nitzschia spp. (Bacillariophyceae) was recorded within the N. spumigena aggregates on 8 August, suggesting nutrient leakage from the N. spumigena filaments. Senescence of N. spumigena and a decrease in the proportion of intact N. spumigena cells in dry material resulted in decreasing concentrations of cell-bound nodularin (NODLN), from 2.1 to 0.5 g kg⁻¹ dry weight. No clear temporal trends in NODLN concentrations (< 0.5–2.6 μg l⁻¹) were observed in Gulf waters. We hypothesize that the bloom was linked to a fish kill that occurred during the same time period. Threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus, Gasterosteiformes, Gasterosteidae) were found floating on the surface during the water-bloom. The sticklebacks contained approximately 35–170 μg NODLN kg⁻¹ dry weight (microcystin-LR equivalents). Empty N. spumigena cells and trace amounts of NODLN were also found in surficial sediment, indicating that toxin-producing N. spumigena had reached the seafloor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aNitzschia 3aNodularia spumigena 3afish kills 3amicrocystin-LR 3anodularin 3aphosphorus 3asediments 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3aGulf of Finland1 aSipiä, Vesa O.1 aKuparinen, Jorma S.1 aOtt, Jennifer L.1 aCarmichael, Wayne W.0 tPhycologia.g2001 May 1, v. 40, no. 3 p.268-274dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-40-3-268.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01675naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002200161245005500183300001800238500000900256520071600265592002800981650002301009650001901032650001501051650001701066650001901083650001501102773015101117856009601268852000901364655001201373IND60668071620221120024801.0191125e198609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066807162DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1986.03615995005000050009x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmettem, K.

This analysis is appropriate in cases where the macropores fill rapidly and remain completely water filled. Under these conditions predicted macropore flow rates compared well to those obtained from measurements of flow into both “artificial” and natural macropores. The study emphasises the effect of pore continuity, with pore length exerting a dominant influence on the magnitude of macropore volume fluxes over the range of macropore diameters commonly encountered in agricultural soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3amacropore flow 3amacropores 3apermeameters 3awater analysis 3awater flow0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1986 Sept., v. 50, no. 5 p.1139-1142dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1986.03615995005000050009x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01711naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011600159300001800275500002000293520072800313592002801041650001901069650001001088650002201098650002801120650001101148700002101159773014501180856007501325852000901400655001201409IND60789438020221119013215.0220820e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078943802DNAL7 a10.1002/aepp.130842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurnhagen, Kai10aEU Regulation of New Plant Breeding Technologies and Their Possible Economic Implications for the EU and Beyond  ap. 1621-1637.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNew plant breeding technologies (NPBTs), including CRISPR gene editing, are being used widely, and they are driving the development of new crops. They are nevertheless a subject of criticism and discussion. According to a summer 2018 interpretation by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) applying an absolute interpretation of the precautionary principle, European Union (EU) law makes most NPBTs subject to regulations governing the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the EU. This contribution summarizes the status of the debate and highlights issues that have thus far not been considered—particularly with regard to the implications of EU regulations for NPBTs for countries outside the EU.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3agenes 3aissues and policy 3aprecautionary principle 3asummer1 aWesseler, Justus0 tApplied economic perspectives and policy.g2021 Dec., v. 43, no. 4 p.1621-1637dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl4430135x2040-57907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aepp.130843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02106naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013800175300001600313500001900329520093700348592002801285650003201313650001001345650001401355650002101369650001401390650001401404650001301418651001701431700002401448700002301472700002101495700002101516773010101537856008501638852000901723655001201732IND60695625620221117174603.0200517e20010501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069562562DNAL7 a10.2216/i0031-8884-40-3-275.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitaguchi, Hirotaka10aIsolation of an algicidal marine bacterium with activity against the harmful dinoflagellate Heterocapsa circularisquama (Dinophyceae)  ap. 275-279.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRed tides of a harmful dinoflagellate, Heterocapsa circularisquama, have caused mass mortality of bivalves such as oysters in western Japan since 1988. For the purpose of microbial control of the occurrence of these red tides, H. circularisquama-killing bacteria were screened. Although the frequency of H. circularisquama-killing microorganisms was low during the sampling period, a marine bacterium strain EHK-I, which had a strong algicidal activity against H. circularisquama, was isolated from the seawater of Etajima Bay, in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan. Strain EHK-1 killed H. circularisquama within 24 hours when the H. circularisquama culture in exponential phase was inoculated with this bacterium at a density of 1 × 10⁵ cells ml⁻¹. Strain EHK-1 lysed both the vegetative cells and temporary cysts of H. circularisquama. Strain EHK-1 is a novel algicidal bacterium according to 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeterocapsa circularisquama 3aJapan 3aalgicides 3aaquatic bacteria 3amortality 3aphylogeny 3aseawater 3aSea of Japan1 aHiragushi, Norihiro1 aMitsutani, Atsushi1 aYamaguchi, Mineo1 aIshida, Yuzaburo0 tPhycologia.g2001 May 1, v. 40, no. 3 p.275-279dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-40-3-275.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007700157520206100234592002802295650001602323650002002339650001102359650001302370650001002383650001702393650001002410650001502420650002202435650001102457650001102468650001802479651001002497700001702507700001702524700001802541700001302559700001902572700001702591700001602608773012002624856007302744852000902817655001202826IND60648978320221121220903.0190702e20190311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064897832DNAL7 a10.3390/f100302472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Wenjun 10aSpatiotemporal Ozone Level Variation in Urban Forests in Shenzhen, China  aThis study is among the first to investigate ozone levels in urban forests in China. It establishes that urban forest air quality in Yuanshan Forest Park (Shenzhen) is suitable for recreational activities and identifies spatial, seasonal, and diurnal O<inf>3</inf> patterns and relationships with micrometeorological parameters, suggesting the possibility of manipulating relevant forest characteristics to reduce Surface ozone (O<inf>3</inf>) levels. An understanding of O<inf>3</inf> levels of urban forest environments is needed to assess potential effects on human health and recreational activities. Such studies in China are scarce. This study investigated urban forest O<inf>3</inf> levels to improve understanding and support residents engaging in forest recreational activities. We monitored O<inf>3</inf> levels in 2015&ndash;2016 for three urban forests representing common habitats (foothill, valley, and ridge) in Yuanshan Forest Park and for an adjacent square. The overall mean daily and daily maximum 8 h mean (MDA8) O<inf>3</inf> concentrations were highest for the ridge forest and lowest for the valley forest. Each forest&rsquo;s O<inf>3</inf> concentrations were highest in summer. Diurnally, forest O<inf>3</inf> concentrations peaked between 13:00 and 17:00 and reached a minimum between 03:00 and 09:00. The correlation between forest O<inf>3</inf> concentrations and air temperature (AT) was strongly positive in summer and autumn but negative in spring. In each season, O<inf>3</inf> concentration was negatively correlated with relative humidity (RH). No MDA8 or hourly O<inf>3</inf> concentrations in the forests exceeded National Ambient Air Quality Standard Grade I thresholds (100 and 160 &mu;g m&minus;3, respectively). O<inf>3</inf> accumulation is present in ridge urban forest in all seasons. Foothill and valley urban forests have better air quality than ridge forestation. Urban forest air quality is better in spring and autumn than in summer and is better from night-time to early morning than from noon to afternoon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3ahabitats 3ahills 3ahuman health 3aozone 3arecreation 3arelative humidity 3aspring 3asummer 3aurban forests 3aChina1 aWang, Cheng 1 aPei, Nancai 1 aZhang, Chang 1 aGu, Lin 1 aJiang, Shasha 1 aHao, Zezhou 1 aXu, Xinhui 0 tForests.g2019 Mar. 11, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f100302473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011700167300001600284500001900300520128400319592002801603650003401631650002801665650002401693650002401717650001101741650003701752650002201789700001801811700001901829700001801848773010101866856008501967852000902052655001202061IND60695625720221117174534.0200517e20010501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069562572DNAL7 a10.2216/i0031-8884-40-3-280.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Jane10aBacterium-dinoflagellate interactions: investigative microscopy of Alexandrium spp. (Gonyaulacales, Dinophyceae)  ap. 280-285.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe association of bacteria with dinoflagellates has been a neglected field of study, which has gained prominence in recent years because of the possible role of bacteria in toxin synthesis. A number of dinoflagellates undergo sexual reproduction, passing through various life-cycle stages in addition to the vegetative form. The presence of bacteria within dinoflagellates has been well established, but their presence throughout the dinoflagellate life-cycle has not been investigated. Using cultures of Alexandrium (A. tamarense, A. fundyense), we investigated the association of bacteria with various vegetative growth phases (lag, log, stationary) and sexual life-cycle stages (planozygote, planomeiocyte, hypnozygote), using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and epifluorescence microscopy. Bacteria were found to be associated with the surfaces of vegetative cells, planozygotes, hypnozygotes and planomeiocytes. TEM showed bacteria to be present within all vegetative growth phases, as well as in the sexual planozygote, cyst and planomeiocyte. The presence of intra-cellular bacteria in vegetative cells was also confirmed using DAPI staining combined with epifluorescence microscopy, and lipopolysaccharide staining combined with TEM.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3afluorescence microscopy 3alipopolysaccharides 3asexual reproduction 3atoxins 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avegetative growth1 aKennaway, Gay1 aFranca, Susana1 aAlverca, Elsa0 tPhycologia.g2001 May 1, v. 40, no. 3 p.280-285dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-40-3-280.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04096naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008600175300001400261520239500275592002802670650003002698650002102728650001802749650002102767650002502788650002102813650002202834650002702856650002102883650002002904650001302924650001602937650002702953650001102980650002102991650000703012650001003019650002003029650001403049650001703063650001703080650001003097653001503107653001603122653001903138653002403157653001903181700003403200700002203234700002503256700002303281773010703304856008603411852000903497655001203506IND60533459120221122211149.0190319e20151014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053345912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2015.07.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlson, Alicain S.10aBacteria species and solution pH effect postharvest quality of cut Zinnia elegans  ap. 71-78.  aBacterial growth in vase solutions can lead to stem vasculature blockage causing petal and leaf wilt, bent neck, or similar symptoms related to water stress that reduce vase life. In these studies we isolated, identified, and evaluated the effects of several bacteria species on the vase life of cut Zinnia elegans L. ‘Benary’s Giant Wine’. Nine bacterial species were isolated during postharvest testing of cut zinnia stems: Pseudomonas fulva, Serratia ficaria, Rhizobium radiobacter, Chryseobacterium sp., Pantoea ananatis, Bacillus pumilus, Chryseobacterium daejeonense, Brevundimonas sp., and Pseudomonas marginalis and pure cultures of each species were added to the vase solution of cut zinnia stems. Escherichia coli K12, a lab adapted strain, was also included. Cut flowers inoculated with P. fulva and E. coli K12 had significantly greater vase lives of 9.5 and 9.4 d, respectively, compared to P. marginalis, P. ananatis, R. radiobacter, or the nutrient broth control (7.0, 6.9, 6.8, or 7.3 d, respectively). The vase lives of the other bacteria treatments were not statistically different from the deionized (DI) water control (8.6 d). There were no significant differences in water uptake or vase water bacteria concentrations at termination among all treatments. In further studies, sterilized and non-sterilized stems of Zinnia were used to investigate the effects of solution pH and the addition of P. marginalis and E. coli K12 on number of days to drought stress (DTDS), stem hydraulic conductivity, and bacteria concentrations inside and outside the stem. The non-sterilized stems in control solution with E. coli K12 and non-sterilized stems in preservative solution with no bacteria had the most DTDS of 8.0 d. The sterilized stems in the control solution (deionized water) with E. coli K12 and sterilized stems in basic solution with no bacteria had the least DTDS of 5.5 d and 5.8 d, respectively. The concentrations of bacteria inside and outside the stems were lowest for stems in the preservative solutions. Of the stems that were sterilized, partial percent loss of conductivity (PPLC) was significantly lower in the acidic solutions (64%) compared to the preservative (87%) and control (83%). This research shows that for Zinnia the bacteria species that has a primary effect on vase life, not necessarily the concentration of bacteria in the vase solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aBacillus pumilus 3aBrevundimonas 3aChryseobacterium 3aEscherichia coli K12 3aPantoea ananatis 3aPseudomonas fulva 3aPseudomonas marginalis 3aSerratia ficaria 3aZinnia violacea 3abacteria 3acut flowers 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aleaves 3amicrobial growth 3apH 3astems 3astorage quality 3avase life 3awater stress 3awater uptake 3awines 0aCut flower 0aPostharvest 0aPhytopathogens 0aBiocontrol bacteria 0aZinnia elegans1 aDole, John M.q(John Martin),1 aMatthysse, Ann G.1 aHoffmann, William A.1 aKornegay, Julia L.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2015 Oct. 14, v. 194 p.71-78dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.07.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007700164520106800241592002801309650004401337650002201381650001401403650002701417650002201444650001401466650001801480650002101498650001601519650001901535650001101554650002401565650000801589650002101597650001701618653002001635653001401655653002201669653002501691700001301716700001701729700001901746700001701765700001301782700001601795700001801811773009501829856008301924852000902007655001202016IND60680077220221116144854.0200228e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068007722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2019.1005232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Yangjun10aInteractions between tea products and wheat starch during retrogradation  aInteractions between tea products (tea polyphenols and catechins) and wheat starch (WS) during retrogradation were investigated. Tea product-fortified WS showed retarded retrogradation based on thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the addition of tea products led to the shift of the degradation temperature of WS toward lower temperature, indicating changes in the starch structure due to interaction with tea products. Tea product-WS mixtures had less crystallinity than controls during storage at 4°C, which was more noticeable for samples treated with tea polyphenols. In FT-IR spectra, tea product-WS complexes gave broadened O–H stretching and C–O–H bending vibrations compared with controls. Tea products presumably formed hydrogen bonds with WS, interfering with the reassociation of starch chains during storage, and thereby delaying retrogradation. Thus, tea products may be used as potential anti-retrogradation additives in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadditives 3acarbohydrate structure 3acrystal structure 3aflavanols 3afood industry 3ahydrogen bonding 3apolyphenols 3aretrogradation 3astarch 3astorage temperature 3atea 3athermogravimetry 3awheat starch 0aTea polyphenols 0aCatechins 0aCamellia sinensis 0aTriticum aestivum L.1 aLi, Ming1 aPan, Junxian1 aZhang, Shikang1 aJiang, Yulan1 aLiu, Jun1 aZhu, Yuejin1 aZhang, Haihua0 tFood bioscience.g2020 Apr., v. 34 p.100523-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2019.1005233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015400167506011700321506007600438520166700514592002802181506003702209650001102246650001502257650002302272650001702295650001502312650000902327650001002336650001302346653001702359653001102376653001302387653000802400653001402408700001602422700002402438700001502462700002202477700002602499700001602525700001402541700001402555773010202569856008302671852000902754655001202763IND60781898620221207072552.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078189862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2022.1058542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeenstra, L.R.10aEvaluation of PEG-L-asparaginase in asparagine suppression and anti-drug antibody development in healthy Beagle dogs: A multi-phase preclinical study  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aL-asparaginase is a frequently used drug in the treatment of canine malignant lymphoma.

A multi-phase clinical dose-finding study with seven healthy Beagle dogs was conducted to find the minimum effective dose and, potentially, a dosing interval for PEG-ASP in dogs. Plasma concentrations of amino acids and PEG-ASP activity were measured at various time points after administration of different doses of PEG-ASP. Anti-PEG and anti-asparaginase antibody titres were measured. Administration of 10 IU/kg PEG-ASP resulted in asparagine depletion in all dogs, albeit for various durations: for 9 days in all dogs, 15 days in five dogs, 21 days in three dogs and 29 days in one dog. Asparagine suppression occurred at PEG-ASP plasma concentrations < 25 IU/L. Subsequent administrations of a second and third dose of 20 IU/kg and 40 IU/kg PEG-ASP resulted in asparagine suppression at < 9 days in five dogs, accompanied by the development of antibodies against PEG and L-asparaginase. Two dogs with prolonged asparagine suppression after the second and third administration did not develop antibodies. Marked individual variation in the mechanism and duration of response to PEG-ASP was noted. Antibody formation against PEG-ASP was frequently observed and sometimes occurred after one injection. This study suggests that PEG-ASP doses as high as the currently used dose of 40 IU/kg might not be needed in treatment of canine malignant lymphoma.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBeagle 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3aasparaginase 3aasparagine 3adogs 3adrugs 3alymphoma 0aAsparaginase 0aCanine 0aLymphoma 0aPEG 0aTreatment1 aGehring, R.1 avan Geijswijk, I.M.1 aKönig, T.1 aPrinsen, H.C.M.T.1 aVandemeulebroecke, K.1 aLammens, T.1 aKrupa, A.1 aTeske, E.0 tveterinary journal.g2022 Aug., v. 286 p.105854-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2022.1058543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001400180245012200194300001600316506007600332520114100408592002801549506003701577650002201614650001401636650001201650650001501662650002301677650004401700650002001744650001601764700001501780700001801795700002301813773011801836856007501954852000902029655001202038IND60550741820221207085318.0160912e20120112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055074182DNAL7 a10.1021/jp208966k2doi7 aPMC32574002pmcid7 a221422352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiang10aThermal Hysteresis in the Backbone and Side-Chain Dynamics of the Elastin Mimetic Peptide [VPGVG]3 Revealed by 2H NMR  ap. 555-564.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe report on experimental measurements of the backbone and side-chain dynamics of the elastin mimetic peptide [VPGVG]₃ by ²H NMR echo spectroscopy and 2D T₁–T₂ correlation relaxometry. The T₁ and T₂ relaxation times of the Gly α-deuterons and Val α-, β-, and γ-deuterons of a hydrated sample reveal a thermal hysteresis when the temperature is raised from −10 to 45 °C and then subsequently cooled back to −10 °C. In addition, near 30 °C we observe a reduction in the slope of the T₁(T) and T₂(T) heating curves, indicating a structural change that appears to be correlated well to the known inverse temperature transition of this peptide. The thermal dependence of the correlation times of the Gly α-deuterons are well fit by an Arrhenius Law, from which we measured Eₐcₜ = (20.0 ± 3.1) kJ/mol when the sample is heated and Eₐcₜ = (10.9 ± 2.8) kJ/mol when cooled. Molecular dynamics simulations support the notion that the measured activation energy is determined largely by the extent of localized water, which is observed to decrease with increasing temperature from approximately 25 to 42 °C.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactivation energy 3adeuterium 3aelastin 3ahysteresis 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes 3atemperature1 aSun, Cheng1 aHuang, Jiaxin1 aBoutis, Gregory S.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Jan. 12, v. 116, no. 1 p.555-564dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp208966k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245021400164520162900378592002802007650002802035650001602063650001302079650001302092650002102105650001802126650001602144650002002160650001902180650002602199650001602225650001702241650003602258700002402294700002802318700002802346700002602374773012302400856007502523852000902598655001202607IND60784141620221120160000.0220726e20220714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078414162DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141428932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomejko, Katarzyna 10aSerum Osteoprotegerin Is an Independent Marker of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy, Systolic and Diastolic Dysfunction of the Left Ventricle and the Presence of Pericardial Fluid in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients  aBackground: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a molecule which belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. OPG concentration is elevated in patients with left ventricle hypertrophy, heart failure and acute myocardial infarction. OPG concentrations rise in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between OPG concentrations and cardiovascular complications, such as left ventricle hypertrophy, systolic and diastolic dysfunction of left ventricle and dysfunction of right ventricle in chronic kidney disease patients not treated with dialysis. The relation between OPG and the amount of pericardial fluid was also examined. Methods: One hundred and one men with CKD stage 3–5 not treated with dialysis were included in the study. Overhydration, body fat mass and lean body mass were measured using bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS). Echocardiography was performed to evaluate the amount of pericardial fluid and to measure the thickness of the interventricular septum (IVS), systolic and diastolic function of left ventricle, as well as systolic function of right ventricle. Results: We observed a significant positive association between OPG and the thickness of the interventricular septum, the size of the left atrium (LA) and the presence of pericardial fluid. A negative relationship was observed between OPG and ejection fraction (EF). Conclusions: Our results suggest that OPG can be an independent marker of left ventricular hypertrophy, systolic and diastolic dysfunction of left ventricle and the presence of pericardial fluid in chronic kidney disease patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioelectrical impedance 3ablood serum 3abody fat 3adialysis 3aechocardiography 3aheart failure 3ahypertrophy 3akidney diseases 3alean body mass 3amyocardial infarction 3apericardium 3aspectroscopy 3atumor necrosis factor receptors1 aRymarz, Aleksandra 1 aSzamotulska, Katarzyna 1 aBartoszewicz, Zbigniew 1 aNiemczyk, Stanisław 0 tNutrients.g2022 July 14, v. 14, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141428933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012000160300001800280520153200298592002801830650001101858650003601869650001201905650002001917650002501937650002801962650001301990650002502003650002002028650001802048650001102066650001502077650001302092650001702105700001902122773010302141856008102244852000902325655001202334IND60120714520221118103120.0150209e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012071452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-013-2721-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Lan10aAssociation between the receptor for advanced glycation end products gene polymorphisms and coronary artery disease  ap. 6097-6105.  aReceptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a cell-surface molecule member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and thought to play a critical role in diabetic atherosclerosis. A growing body of studies has been conducted to determine the extent to which the variants of RAGE gene influence the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, these have reported conflicting results. To investigate this inconsistency, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis on the associations between the RAGE −374T/A, −429T/C, and Gly82Ser polymorphisms and the risk of CAD. A total of 4,402 cases and 6,081 controls from 17 published case–control studies were included. The overall odds ratio (OR) of CAD was 0.99 (95 % CI 0.87–1.13), 1.06 (95 % CI 0.95–1.18) and 1.12 (95 % CI 0.90–1.39) for −374A, −429C, and the minor S allele of the Gly82Ser polymorphism, respectively. Similarly, no significant results were observed for these polymorphisms using dominant model. However, when stratified by diabetic/non-diabetic status of the CAD patients, we found significant association among Caucasian type two diabetic CAD patients with the −374A allele [OR 1.39, 95 % CI 1.10–1.76, P(Z) = 0.006], while no association was detected between the −374T/A polymorphism and non-diabetic CAD in Caucasians [OR 0.79, 95 % CI 0.58–1.07, P(Z) = 0.13]. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggested that possession of the −374A allele may be a risk factor in CAD among Caucasian patients with type two diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWhites 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aalleles 3aatherosclerosis 3acase-control studies 3acoronary artery disease 3adiabetes 3agenetic polymorphism 3aimmunoglobulins 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3arisk factors1 aQiu, Xing-biao0 tMolecular biology reports.g2013 Nov., v. 40, no. 11 p.6097-6105dSpringer-Verlagx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-013-2721-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011400170520140700284592002801691650002101719650003101740650001301771650001101784650001701795651001001812651001501822653002701837653001701864653002801881653002001909700001701929700002001946700001501966700001401981773010601995856008802101852000902189655001202198IND60767066020221122175634.0220328e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076706602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1134402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jianing10aInter-annual variation and comprehensive evaluation of organophosphate esters (OPEs) in the Yellow Sea, China  aConsidering the extensive production and continuous usage of organophosphate esters (OPEs) around the urbanized coasts in recent years, the inter-annual variation and the ecological risks of OPEs in the Yellow Sea (YS), China were systematically evaluated in summer 2015 and 2019. The major component of OPEs, halogenated-OPEs in 78 surface and bottom seawater samples collected from 39 locations in the YS in 2019 were compared with 62 samples at 31 sites conducted in the same periods and similar stations in 2015. The average concentration of halogenated-OPEs increased 1.57, 2.50 folds in the surface and bottom seawater, respectively, in recent 5 years. The proportion of TCPP to halogenated-OPEs exhibited an increasing trend from 56.49% in 2015 to 79.95% in 2019. The peak values of halogenated-OPEs changed from the nearshore regions (33°N-38°N) in 2015 to the nearshore and offshore regions (33°N-35°N) in 2019, implying the growing terrigenous emission sources, especially some large OPEs producers nearby the coastal zones in the northern area of Jiangsu province. The targeted halogenated-OPEs posed no significant or low ecological risks to the aquatic organisms in 2015 and 2019, however, the values of RQ showed an elevated trend in 2019. Therefore, the ecological risks of OPEs in this region still need continuous concern due to the gradually increasing OPEs usage and production.  aPublisher supplied data 3amarine pollution 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aseawater 3asummer 3aurbanization 3aChina 3aYellow Sea 0aOrganophosphate esters 0aDistribution 0aInter-annual comparison 0aEcological risk1 aZhang, Lutao1 aGuo, Changsheng1 aFeng, Song1 aGao, Teng0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2022 Mar., v. 176 p.113440-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1134403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245010300178500001900281520120800300592002801508650002301536650001501559650002001574650002301594650002401617650002001641700002201661700002401683700003301707700003601740700002101776700002601797773012201823856008101945852000902026655001202035IND60738888220221123023212.0210524e20210508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073888822DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100505702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFontana, Daniele  Cristina10aEndophytic Fungi: Biological Control and Induced Resistance to Phytopathogens and Abiotic Stresses  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlant diseases cause losses of approximately 16% globally. Thus, management measures must be implemented to mitigate losses and guarantee food production. In addition to traditional management measures, induced resistance and biological control have gained ground in agriculture due to their enormous potential. Endophytic fungi internally colonize plant tissues and have the potential to act as control agents, such as biological agents or elicitors in the process of induced resistance and in attenuating abiotic stresses. In this review, we list the mode of action of this group of microorganisms which can act in controlling plant diseases and describe several examples in which endophytes were able to reduce the damage caused by pathogens and adverse conditions. This is due to their arsenal of molecules generated during the interaction by which they form a kind of biological shield in the plant.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of the foliar spraying of abcisic acid (ABA), gibberellic acid (GA3) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) on fruit colour, concentrations of carbohydrates, ions and amino acids, plant growth and total fruit yield. Although yield was decreased by the GA3 and ABA treatments, GA3 augmented plant height and the levels of tyrosine, phosphate, sulphate, iron and phosphorus while decreasing the amounts of glucose and fructose. The foliar applications of IAA did not produce any change when compared with the control plants, while plants treated with ABA had decreased levels of sucrose but higher levels of iron. GA3, applied fortnightly, produced a significant improvement in the fruit quality of sweet pepper but did not significantly increase total yield. Further studies will be necessary to determine the best GA3 concentration and frequency of application, to obtain greater benefits for human consumption this important crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aabscisic acid 3acolor 3afoliar spraying 3afructose 3afruit quality 3afruit yield 3agibberellic acid 3aglucose 3agreenhouses 3ahumans 3aindole acetic acid 3aions 3airon 3anutrient content 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aplant response 3asucrose 3asulfates 3asweet peppers 3atyrosine 0aABA 0aFruit quality 0aGA3 0aIAA 0aPGR 0aSweet pepper1 aPazos-Navarro, María1 aLópez-Marín, Josefa1 aGálvez, Amparo1 aVaró, Plácido1 aAmor, Francisco M del0 tScientia horticulturae.g2015 Oct. 14, v. 194 p.188-193dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04389naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011800160520290700278592002803185650001303213650001103226650001903237650001203256650001403268650001403282650001603296650001803312650001503330650001103345650001503356650001403371650000903385650001903394650001103413650001603424650001003440651001003450653002003460653001603480653002903496653001503525653002603540700001703566700001503583700001503598700001503613700001403628773011403642856008203756852000903838655001203847IND60781898920221116170042.0220719e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078189892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2022.1265742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ming10aClimate warming causes changes in wheat phenological development that benefit yield in the Sichuan Basin of China  aThe effects of climate warming on wheat yields vary geographically under different warming scenarios. Such variations reflect real climatic differences and our insufficient understanding of how physiological processes respond to warming conditions. In this study, a 16-year trial comprising three crop production systems (CPSs) and a 5-year trial including seven cultivars were conducted in the Sichuan Basin of China to investigate the effects of climate warming on the phenological development, grain yield (GY), dry matter (DM) accumulation and translocation of wheat. The three CPSs included conventional rotary tillage with residue removal for both rice and wheat (CPS1), conventional rotary tillage with the wheat residue incorporated for the rice following zero tillage with residue-mulching for wheat (CPS2), and zero tillage and residue-mulching employed for both wheat and rice (CPS3). The wheat cultivars used in this study were all spring-type wheat, and the trials were planted from 26 to 30 October each year, irrigation was applied only at the seeding and topdressing stages and in amounts less than 20 mm. The results showed that mean of daily mean temperature from November to March (MTNₒᵥ₋Mₐᵣ) and November to April (MTNₒᵥ₋Aₚᵣ) significantly increased by 0.0964 °C yr⁻¹ and 0.0947 °C yr⁻¹ from 2004 to 2020, respectively. This warming caused earlier flowering and significantly decreased mean temperature from anthesis to maturity (PₒₛₜATₘₑₐₙ) by 0.091 °C yr⁻¹. However, grain number m⁻² was unaffected by this warming. Cooler and longer grain-gilling periods (GFP) lead to larger grain sinks and allow more preanthesis assimilates to be transported to the grain, resulting in increased individual grain weight and harvest index under all CPSs and all cultivars. There were no significant differences in sensitivities of GY and DM related trait responses to temperature change between CPSs or between cultivars. Averaged over all CPSs, GY increased 741.9 kg ha⁻¹ with each 1 °C increases in MTNₒᵥ₋Aₚᵣ. The increase in yield was mainly attributable to increase in grain weights while grain number m⁻² was maintained. In addition, the MTNₒᵥ₋Aₚᵣ values in the Sichuan Basin were predicted to reach 14.7 °C and 16.5 °C by the end of this century under the SSP245 and SSP585 climate change scenarios, respectively. When the CO₂ concentration was fixed at 350 ppm, the Agricultural Production Systems SIMulator (APSIM) model showed that the increasing MTNₒᵥ₋Aₚᵣ values significantly increased the GY under the SSP245 scenario, but the GY was initially positively and then negatively affected under the SSP585 scenario. These results lay the foundation for developing adaptation strategies to address future climate change in climates like that of Sichuan Basin and ensure wheat supplies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3abasins 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3acultivars 3aflowering 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3airrigation 3amodels 3ano-tillage 3aphenology 3arice 3arotary tillage 3asowing 3atemperature 3awheat 3aChina 0aClimate warming 0aWheat yield 0aPhenological development 0aDry matter 0aAdaptation strategies1 aTang, Yonglu1 aLi, Chaosu1 aWu, Xiaoli1 aTao, Xiong1 aLiu, Miao0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2022 Sept., v. 139 p.126574-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.1265743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245016100173300001300334520200100347592002802348650001602376650001702392650001002409650001202419650001402431650001202445650002702457650001802484650001702502650000902519650001002528650001702538650002202555650001102577650001402588650002002602650001202622650002102634653003002655653002902685653001802714653001702732653002102749653001702770700002102787773012002808856008402928852000903012655001203021IND60543493320221118061456.0190411e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054349332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2014.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalla, Stephanie J.10aDifferential introgression and effective size of marker type influence phylogenetic inference of a recently divergent avian group (Phasianidae: Tympanuchus)  ap. 1-13.  aLife history strategies can influence the effective population size (Ne) of loci differently based on their mode of inheritance. Recognizing how this may affect the rate of lineage sorting among marker types is important for studies focused on resolving phylogenetic relationships among recently divergent taxa. In this study, we use gene tree, coalescent-based species tree, and isolation-with-migration analyses to explore the differences between marker types (autosomal, Z-linked, and mitochondrial) in resolving phylogenetic relationships among North American prairie grouse (Tympanuchus). We found that Z-linked loci were more likely to identify monophyletic relationships among prairie grouse species compared to autosomal and mtDNA loci in both species and gene tree analyses, with species tree analyses outperforming gene trees. These results were further supported with isolation-with-migration analyses, where Z-linked loci largely followed a strict isolation model while autosomal loci were more likely to fit a model with gene flow between species following population divergence. While accounting for differences in inheritance pattern (or Ne) for marker type, results suggest that additional factors, such as strong sexual selection and sex-biased introgression (i.e., male-biased postzygotic hybrid behavioral isolation or “unsexy son”), may further explain the decreased diversity levels and increased rate of lineage sorting observed with the Z-linked loci relative to autosomal and mtDNA loci. In fact, to our knowledge no hybrid male prairie grouse have been observed breeding in the wild, yet hybrid females along with backcross females are known to produce viable offspring. Overall, this study highlights that more work is needed to determine how complex models of gene flow (i.e., sex biased introgression) and differences in the effective size among marker types based on differing life history strategies influence divergence date estimation and species delimitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTympanuchus 3abackcrossing 3abirds 3afemales 3agene flow 3ahybrids 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aintrogression 3alife history 3aloci 3amales 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3amonophyly 3apopulation size 3aprogeny 3asexual selection 0aEffective population size 0aMito-nuclear discordance 0aHybridization 0aSpecies tree 0aSexual selection 0aZ-chromosome1 aJohnson, Jeff A.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2015 Mar., v. 84 p.1-13dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2014.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03801naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245018200174520215000356592002802506650002402534650001902558650001302577650001702590650002502607650001502632650001502647650002602662650001502688650001302703650001902716650003202735650001802767650001902785650001202804651001002816653001602826653001702842653002302859653002002882653002702902653001902929700002202948700002402970700002202994700002703016700002403043773011303067856008203180852000903262655001203271IND60781899020221116165930.0220906e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078189902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2022.1265752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPantani, Ottorino-Luca10aAssessment of the impact of conventional and organic agroecosystems management options and conservation tillage on soil fertility at the Montepaldi Long Term Experiment, Tuscany  aFertility is a characteristic of an agroecosystem which is usually and promptly identified with the crop yield. Nevertheless, it can be considered the result of many processes and factors such as climatic, edaphic and agronomic which cannot be extended and generalized to all systems and crops. This study evaluates the effects on soil fertility as influenced by organic (OR) and high-input (conventional, CO) management combined with three tillage systems, i.e., plowing (plw), chisel plowing (chp) and disk harrowing (dsh) at the Montepaldi Long Term Experiment (MoLTE), Tuscany, Italy. Fertility was evaluated through the following indicators: i) chemical (Olsen P, Kjeldahl N and, OM); ii) physical (bulk density on clods and cores, pore size distribution, penetrometry, aggregate stability, soil profile assessment, VESS, i.e. visual evaluation of soil structure); iii) biological (earthworm abundance and root distribution). As regards the effect of management, CO was higher in crop yields, available P₂O₅, bulk densities (clods), aggregate stability and soil penetration resistance, while OR was higher in bulk densities (cores). Nevertheless, the effect of management was observed for root distribution as a function of depth, where roots explored larger portions of soil in OR profiles. Regarding tillage, the order plw, chp, dsh was characterized by an increase in soil penetration resistance and number of earthworms. Moreover, a relationship with time was found for earthworm abundance, where the OR system exhibited a higher and constant population. Organic management seems to achieve a long-lasting soil fertility. In the MoLTE experiment results suggest that available P₂O₅, bulk density (clods), aggregate stability, soil penetration resistance, time-related earthworm abundance, root distribution and yields are the most informative on the impact of management and tillage options. Furthermore, results of physical and biological fertility indicators support the hypothesis that significant differences between OR and CO management, even if not observed in topsoil, might be detected in deeper soil layers, below 30cm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregate stability 3aagroecosystems 3aagronomy 3abulk density 3aconservation tillage 3acrop yield 3aearthworms 3along term experiments 3aphosphorus 3aporosity 3asoil fertility 3asoil penetration resistance 3asoil profiles 3asoil structure 3atopsoil 3aItaly 0aSoil health 0aSoil quality 0aMediterranean area 0aReduced tillage 0aCompositional analysis 0aSoil structure1 aFerretti, Lorenzo1 aSantoni, Margherita1 aMassenzio, Simone1 aD’Acqui, Luigi Paolo1 aPacini, Gaio Cesare0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2022 Oct., v. 140 p.126575-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.1265753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011200167500001900279520137300298592002801671650002101699650001301720650003001733650002501763650002501788650001801813650001801831650001501849650001401864650001101878700002301889700002101912700003201933773012201965856008102087852000902168655001202177IND60738888520221122234328.0210524e20210508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073888852DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100505722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Harlei 14aThe Synthesis and Evaluation of Multivalent Glycopeptoids as Inhibitors of the Adhesion of Candida albicans  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMultivalency is a strategy commonly used by medicinal carbohydrate chemists to increase the affinity of carbohydrate-based small molecules for their protein targets. Although this approach has been very successful in enhancing binding to isolated carbohydrate-binding proteins, anticipating the multivalent presentations that will improve biological activity in cellular assays remains challenging. In this work we investigate linear molecular scaffolds for the synthesis of a low valency presentation of a divalent galactoside 1, previously identified by us as an inhibitor of the adhesion of opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans to buccal epithelial cells (BECs). Adhesion inhibition assays revealed that multivalent glycoconjugate 3 is more effective at blocking C. albicans adherence to BECs upon initial exposure to epithelial cells. Interestingly, 3 did not seem to have any effect when it was pre-incubated with yeast cells, in contrast to the original lead compound 1, which caused a 25% reduction of adhesion. In competition assays, where yeast cells and BECs were co-incubated, multivalent glycoconjugate 3 inhibited up to 49% C. albicans adherence in a dose-dependent manner. The combined effect of compound 1 towards both yeast cells and BECs allowed it to achieve over 60% inhibition of the adhesion of C. albicans to BECs in competition assays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aadhesion 3aadhesion inhibition assay 3abioactive properties 3acarbohydrate binding 3acarbohydrates 3adose response 3aepithelium 3apathogens 3ayeasts1 aMasterson, Hannah 1 aKavanagh, Kevin 1 aVelasco-Torrijos, Trinidad 0 tPathogens.g2021 May 08, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100505723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245015500184300001600339520136400355592002801719650002101747650001701768650002301785650001101808650001801819650001101837650001101848650001101859650002001870650001901890650004001909650001501949650001001964650002001974650001101994650001102005650001602016650001002032650002202042650002502064651001002089653001402099653001602113653002502129653002202154700002302176700002002199700002502219700002402244700002702268700002002295773010902315856008602424852000902510655001202519IND60533459720221122234636.0190319e20151014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053345972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2015.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía Sánchez, Francisco,10aShade screen increases the vegetative growth but not the production in ‘Fino 49’ lemon trees grafted on Citrus macrophylla and Citrus aurantium L.  ap. 175-180.  aSpain is the second-largest lemon fruit producing country in the world. Approximately 80% of the lemon production occurs in the arid southeast (Murcia and Alicante) region of Spain. For citrus fruits, 50% shade screen reduces the leaf temperature and light intensity at midday in the summer and the spring in these areas, resulting in an increase in the photosynthetic leaf water-use efficiency (WUEphy=A/Eleaf). In this experiment, the effect of shading with Aluminet-50 screen (which reduces approximately 50% of the incident photosynthetically active radiation) on agronomical responses of ‘Fino 49’ lemon trees (Citrus limon (L.) Burm. fil.) grafted on two rootstocks, Citrus macrophylla and Citrus aurantium L., were studied. This study was conducted in Santomera (Murcia) over a 4-year period (2008–2011) on 7-year-old lemon trees. Shade screen increased the height, canopy perimeter and canopy volume compared to those under full sunlight. However, shading effect reduced fruit production. Trees under full sunlight produced a total of 81 and 45kg/tree, while trees under shade produced 70 and 33kg/tree of C. macrophylla and C. aurantium L., respectively. Shading affected the physical characteristics of C. macrophylla fruits because fruits from trees under shade had lesser fresh weight and smaller width compared to those under full sunlight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus aurantium 3aCitrus limon 3aCitrus macrophylla 3acanopy 3afruit growing 3afruits 3aleaves 3alemons 3alight intensity 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3arootstocks 3ashade 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3atrees 3avegetative growth 3awater use efficiency 3aSpain 0aRootstock 0aFruit yield 0aWater-use efficiency 0aMineral nutrition1 aSimón, Inmaculada1 aLidón, Vicente1 aManera, Francisco J.1 aSimón-Grao, Silvia1 aPérez-Pérez, Juan G.1 aGimeno, Vicente0 tScientia horticulturae.g2015 Oct. 14, v. 194 p.175-180dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011500170520135000285592002801635650002201663650002601685650001301711650003001724650001101754650001501765650001101780650001001791650001601801650001501817651000901832653001501841653001101856653002701867653002801894653002101922700002001943700001801963700002001981700001702001773016602018856008402184852000902268655001202277IND60781899220221116170014.0220830e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078189922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2022.1019562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalsafi, Hossein10aForecasting the potential distribution of Spodoptera exigua and S. littoralis (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) in Iran  aThe beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hübner, 1808) and the Egyptian cotton leafworm, S. littoralis (Boisduval, 1833), are amongst the most notorious agricultural pest species in Iran. Spodoptera exigua is considered a serious pest of different crops, whereas S. littoralis is known as an important pest of cotton. In this paper, the potential distribution areas of these species in Iran and the important climatic factors affecting their distribution were predicted using the MaxEnt model and the ArcGIS. The results indicate that the main environmental variables contributing to S. exigua’s distribution were precipitation of the coldest quarter (bio19), average wind speed in April (wind4), and annual precipitation (bio12). Also, minimum temperature of the coldest month (bio6), mean temperature of coldest quarter (bio11), altitude and average wind speed in May (wind5) were dominant climatic factors that affected the potential distribution of S. littoralis. These species overlapped in most parts of coastal areas in the southern and northern parts of Iran, with an average overlapping range of 33.2%. Considering their preferred host plants in Iran, it is necessary to strengthen biosurveillance programes and management of these two species in their suitable areas to prevent further invasion, which endangers agricultural security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acotton 3aentomology 3amodels 3apests 3atemperature 3awind speed 3aIran 0aSpodoptera 0aMaxEnt 0aEcological niche model 0aEnvironmental variables 0aInvasive species1 aAlipanah, Helen1 aOstovan, Hadi1 aHesami, Shahram1 aZahiri, Reza0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2022 Sept., v. 25, no. 3 p.101956-dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied EntomologywJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2022.1019563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007800170300001600248500001900264520125700283592002801540650000801568650001701576650001401593650001601607650001701623650001901640650002801659700001501687773010201702856008501804852000901889655001201898IND60695626420221117161308.0200517e20010701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069562642DNAL7 a10.2216/i0031-8884-40-4-324.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarbary, D.

Trichoblasts, which form at the apex of each vegetative axis, undergo a series of rapid cell divisions to form colourless, branched filaments of 10–15 uninucleate cells that are c. 50 μm long upon completion of mitoses. The 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenolindole (DAPI) staining of nuclei shows that cells in trichoblasts that have just finished dividing have more DNA than apical cells of indeterminate axes. The trichoblasts do not then divide further, but undergo considerable cell elongation until they are 500–1000 μm long. They are then shed, leaving a characteristic scar cell along the branch axes. During cell elongation, nuclear DNA content in trichoblast cells decreases to c. 25% of maximal levels, with a greater than 50% decrease in nuclear volume. Many large trichoblast cells have no DAPI-stainable nuclei. Staining of trichoblast nuclei using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end in situ labelling (TUNEL)-protocol indicates that during DNA decrease there is a major increase in 3′ ends of DNA. The loss of DAPI fluorescence and the increase in 3′ ends demonstrate that these cells are apoptotic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPolysiphonia 3aapoptosis 3acell growth 3afluorescence 3anuclear genome 3anucleotidyltransferases1 aClarke, B.0 tPhycologia.g2001 July 1, v. 40, no. 4 p.324-329dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-40-4-324.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03569naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245016000164520230200324592002802626650002102654650002202675650001002697650002002707650002102727650001702748651001002765653002302775653002002798653002702818653002302845653001202868653000902880700001602889700002102905700001802926773013302944856008503077852000903162655001203171IND60767066520221121222715.0220307e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076706652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.1108782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Yuhao10aDeep-water fossil assemblages from the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition of western Hunan, South China and their biostratigraphic and evolutionary implications  aThe Ediacaran-Cambrian (E-C) transition was a critical stage for the origin and evolution of early complex life on Earth. Because studies of E-C biotas and environments are relatively fewer for deep-water than for shallow-water facies, we undertook a systematic paleontological analysis of the E-C transition in the deep-water Liuchapo Formation at Longbizui, South China. Two sequential but distinct assemblages were recovered, namely the Lower Liuchapo Assemblage (LLA) and the Upper Liuchapo Assemblage (ULA). The LLA consists mainly of soft-bodied fossils, including Longbizuiella hunanensis gen. et sp. nov., Nenoxites jishouensis sp. nov., Nenoxites irregularis sp. nov., Nenoxites sp., Helanoichnus sp., Shaanxilithes? sp. and tiny-sized spherical fossils. The ULA is dominated by skeletal organisms comprising the small shelly faunas (SSFs, mainly protoconodonts, hyoliths and Cambroscleritida), sponge spicules, and the first reported Poratusiramus xiangxiensis gen. et sp. nov. Biostratigraphic correlation support a latest Ediacaran age for the LLA, whereas the majority of the ULA belongs to the early Cambrian—thus the change from the LLA to the ULA coincided with the E-C transition. Our results suggest that, during the E-C transition, a biological revolution may have occurred in deep-water settings synchronously with the well-studied faunal turnover in shallow-water environments. At Longbizui, fossil abundance and diversity decreased gradually during the latest Ediacaran and recovered stepwise after the E-C transition. The deep-water fauna, including both benthic and pelagic members, developed a biomineralization ability during the E-C transition. As calcareous and possibly phosphatic skeletal organisms began to flourish in shallow-water environments, siliceous skeleton-forming organisms, represented by the spicule-bearing sponges, colonized the deep seafloor in great abundance. In addition, the siliceous spicules documented in this study record fast evolutionary development during the early history of sponges, one of the earliest-branching metazoan phyla. The evolution of spicules from monaxon to diaxon-triaxon and then to tetraxon and polyactinal forms, as well as their considerable increase in diameter and length, was achieved during the first SSF biozone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEdiacaran period 3abiomineralization 3afauna 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3aChina 0aEarly complex life 0aEarly metazoans 0aSkeletonized organisms 0aLiuchapo Formation 0aSponges 0aSSFs1 aChen, Fayao1 aAlgeo, Thomas J.1 aFeng, Qinglai0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 591 p.110878-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.1108783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245009100208300001200299520114200311592002801453650001201481650001201493650001501505650001501520650001501535650001401550650001401564650001301578651001201591700001901603773015101622856008101773852000901854655001201863IND60596929320221120131743.0180621e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059692932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-6794-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPomezanski, Dorian1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7654-590X10aDeveloping recommendations for monitoring wildlife underpass usage using trail cameras  ap. 413.  aThe growing rate of wildlife underpass use for the mitigation of road-induced wildlife mortality necessitates the development of low-cost monitoring tools for determination of mitigation success. Trail cameras are one such tool that can provide valuable insight into the usage patterns and effectiveness of wildlife underpasses. We deployed trail cameras in wildlife underpasses in Guelph, ON, to develop recommendations for camera monitoring protocols. The trail cameras used high interval time lapse and motion sensors from April to October of 2016 to capture crossing by a variety of species through two slotted, small animal underpasses. Daily and seasonal underpass usage patterns of 21 species and species groups suggest that to comprehensively monitor underpass usage, cameras must be active continuously and utilize high frequency time lapse and motion sensors simultaneously to capture crossing events by both endothermic and ectothermic species. Although these recommendations are dependent on the specific objectives and target conservation species, these results can be used to guide a range of underpass monitoring programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3acameras 3aectothermy 3aendothermy 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aprotocols 3awildlife 3aOntario1 aBennett, Lorne0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 July, v. 190, no. 7 p.413-413dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6794-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009600164300001400260520172000274592002801994650001302022650001602035650001302051650001002064650001002074650001202084650001802096650001302114650001802127650004302145653002302188653001002211653000902221653000902230653001502239653001802254700001602272700001502288700001402303773009202317856008102409852000902490655001202499IND60552731320221117230707.0161021e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055273132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcp.2012.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMokhtari, W.10aReal-time PCR using SYBR Green for the detection of Shigella spp. in food and stool samples  ap. 53-59.  aShigella spp are exquisitely fastidious Gram negative organisms that frequently get missed in the detection by traditional culture methods. For this reason, this work has adapted a classical PCR for detection of Shigella in food and stool specimens to real-time PCR using the SYBR Green format. This method follows a melting curve analysis to be more rapid and provide both qualitative and quantitative data about the targeted pathogen.A total of 117 stool samples with diarrhea and 102 food samples were analyzed in Public Health Regional Laboratory of Nabeul by traditional culture methods and real-time PCR. To validate the real-time PCR assay, an experiment was conducted with both spiked and naturally contaminated stool samples. All Shigella strains tested were ipaH positive and all non-Shigella strains yielded no amplification products. The melting temperature (Tm = 81.5 ± 0.5 °C) was consistently specific for the amplicon. Correlation coefficients of standard curves constructed using the quantification cycle (Cq) versus copy numbers of Shigella showed good linearity (R2 = 0.995; slope = 2.952) and the minimum level of detection was 1.5 × 103 CFU/g feces. All food samples analyzed were negative for Shigella by standard culture methods, whereas ipaH was detected in 8.8% culture negative food products. Moreover, the ipaH specific PCR system increased the detection rate over that by culture alone from 1.7% to 11.1% among patients with diarrhea.The data presented here shows that the SYBR Green I was suitable for use in the real-time PCR assay, which provided a specific, sensitive and efficient method for the detection and quantification of Shigella spp in food and stool samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aShigella 3acorrelation 3adiarrhea 3afeces 3afoods 3amelting 3amelting point 3apatients 3apublic health 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aShigella detection 0aStool 0aFood 0aipaH 0aSYBR Green 0aReal-time PCR1 aNsaibia, S.1 aGharbi, A.1 aAouni, M.0 tMolecular and cellular probes.g2013 Feb., v. 27 p.53-59dElsevier Ltdx0890-85087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2012.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010900163300001800272520171500290592002802005596008902033596012602122650001202248650001702260650001602277650001302293650002402306650002002330650002302350650004202373650001502415650002202430650001202452650001302464650001302477650001302490650001702503650001402520650002202534700001602556700001602572700001602588773015202604856008202756852000902838655001202847IND60631080820221123042323.0210724e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063108082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-3936-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLou, Juqing14aThe short- and long-term effects of nitrite on denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) organisms  ap. 4777-4790.  aThe denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) process can achieve methane oxidation and denitrification at the same time by using nitrate or nitrite as an electron acceptor. The short- and long-term effects of nitrite on DAMO organisms were studied from macro (such as denitrification) to micro (such as microbial structure and community) based on two types of DAMO microbial systems. The results showed that the inhibitory effects of nitrite on the two DAMO microbial systems increased with rising concentration and prolonged time. In the short-term inhibitory phase, nitrite with concentrations below 100 mg N L⁻¹ did not inhibit the two distinct DAMO enrichments. When nitrite concentration was increased to 950 mg N L⁻¹, the nitrogen removal performance was completely inhibited. However, in the long-term inhibition experiment, when nitrite concentration was increased to 650 mg N L⁻¹, the nitrogen removal performance was completely inhibited. In addition, in acidic conditions, the real inhibitor of nitrite is FNA (free nitrous acid), while in alkaline conditions, the real inhibitor is the ionized form of nitrite. By using high-throughput sequencing technology, the species abundance and diversity of the two DAMO microbial systems showed an apparent decrease after long-term inhibition, and the community structure also changed significantly. For the enrichment culture dominated by DAMO bacteria, the substantial drop of Methylomonas may be the internal cause of the decreased nitrogen removal rate, and for the coexistence system that hosted both DAMO bacteria and archaea, the reduction of Nitrospirae may be an internal reason for the decline of the denitrification rate.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.2014C03002cthe key project of science and technology of Zhejiang Province, China  aNo.S1701cthe central government’s specially supported funding for the development of local colleges and Universities 3aArchaea 3aMethylomonas 3aNitrospirae 3abacteria 3acommunity structure 3adenitrification 3aenrichment culture 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aionization 3along term effects 3amethane 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrous acid 3aoxidation 3aspecies abundance1 aWang, Xilei1 aLi, Jiaping1 aHan, Jingyi0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2019 Feb., v. 26, no. 5 p.4777-4790dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3936-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009600167300001600263520112400279592002801403650001901431650001201450650001801462650001601480650001501496650001001511650002501521650001801546650002201564650001501586653002401601653001201625653002301637653002401660653002401684653001901708700001901727700002201746700002001768700002001788700002201808700002101830773014501851856008401996852000902080655001202089IND60112807720221119210627.0161024e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011280772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2013.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, Kengo10aElectricity generation from cattle manure slurry by cassette-electrode microbial fuel cells  ap. 610-615.  aCassette-electrode microbial fuel cells (CE-MFCs) are efficient and scalable devices for electricity production from organic waste. Previous studies have demonstrated that CE-MFCs are capable of generating electricity from artificial wastewater at relatively high efficiencies. In this study, a single-cassette CE-MFC was constructed, and its capacity for electricity generation from cattle manure suspended in water (solid to water ratio of 1:50) was examined. The CE-MFC reactor was operated in batch mode for 49 days; electricity generation became stable 2 weeks after initiating the operation. The maximum power density was measured at 16.3 W m−3 on day 26. Sequencing analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments obtained from the original manure and from anode biofilms suggested that Chloroflexi and Geobacteraceae were abundant in the anode biofilm (29% and 18%, respectively), whereas no Geobacteraceae sequences were detected in the original manure sample. The results of this study suggest that CE-MFCs can be used to generate electricity from water-suspended cattle manure in a scalable MFC system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacteraceae 3abiofilm 3acattle manure 3aelectricity 3aelectrodes 3agenes 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3awastewater 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aBiomass 0aSustainable energy 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aMicrobial community 0aGeobacteraceae1 aIto, Toshihiro1 aKawano, Yoshihiro1 aIguchi, Atsushi1 aMiyahara, Morio1 aSuzuki, Yoshihiro1 aWatanabe, Kazuya0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2013 Nov., v. 116 p.610-615dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, Japanx1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2013.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002900165245014400194300001600338500001500354520119800369592002801567650002001595650002201615650002201637650001401659650001001673650001901683650002001702650001101722650001501733650001601748650001101764650002701775650001301802650001401815650003001829650002801859650002401887650001401911650001201925650005201937650001601989650001402005650001102019650003102030650003402061650003502095650003002130650003202160650005002192653002402242653001202266653002002278653001402298653002102312653001202333653003102345653003102376700002602407700002502433700002302458700002402481773013202505852000902637856008302646655001202729IND4413016820221119083718.0181016e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441301682DNAL7 a189872312pmid7 a10.1177/1040638708020006132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinervino, Antonio H.

Three hepatic biopsies and blood samples were performed on days 0, 45, and 105. The concentration of hepatic copper was determined by spectrophotometric atomic absorption, and the activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were analyzed. Regression analyses were done to verify the possible existing relationship between enzymatic activity and concentration of hepatic copper. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values were determined. The serum activities of AST and GGT had coefficients of determination that were excellent predictive indicators of hepatic copper accumulation in cattle, while only GGT serum activity was predictive of hepatic copper accumulation in buffalo. Elevated serum GGT activity may be indicative of increased concentrations of hepatic copper even in cattle and buffalo that appear to be clinically healthy. Thus, prophylactic measures can be implemented to prevent the onset of a hemolytic crisis that is characteristic of copper intoxication.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle diseases 3adisease diagnosis 3adisease detection 3abuffaloes 3aliver 3aliver function 3abioaccumulation 3acopper 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acattle 3aaspartate transaminase 3avalidity 3abioassays 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3ainterspecific variation 3areference standards 3apoisoning 2aAnimals 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxbloodxmetabolism. 2aBiomarkers. 2aBuffaloes 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosis 2aCopperxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aLiverxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2agamma-Glutamyltransferasexbloodxmetabolism. 0aspecies differences 0aenzymes 0aanimal diseases 0adiagnosis 0acopper poisoning 0abuffalo 0aAspartate aminotransferase 0agamma-glutamyl transferase1 aBarrêto, Raimundo A.1 aQueiroz, Genilson F.1 aHeadley, Selwyn A.1 aOrtolani, Enrico L.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 20, no. 6 p.791-795dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638708020006133Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03065naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012700165506011700292506007600409520133600485592002801821506003701849650002401886650001101910650001401921650001001935650000901945650001601954650001601970650001801986650001002004650002202014650001102036650001802047650001702065650001802082650001802100650001602118650001302134650001702147653002302164653001502187653001202202653002202214653001202236700001202248700001602260700001902276773012502295856008202420852000902502655001202511IND60775450020221207105140.0220523e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077545002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiaohong10aPotential of raw and fermented maize gluten feed in bread making: Assess of dough rheological properties and bread quality  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMaize gluten feed (MGF) is a secondary product of maize processing with rich dietary fiber content, which remains underexploited as an ingredient by the food industry. In this study, the impact of MGF and fermented MGF (FMGF) incorporation on dough properties and bread quality was investigated. The results indicated that both MGF and FMGF demonstrated beneficial effects on the water absorption, dough development time, setback value while exerting a negative impact on the dough stability time. A significant decrease in L value (extensibility) and W value (deformation energy), and a significant increase in P value (elasticity) were observed with MGF or FMGF incorporation in the dough. For fermentation properties, the maximum height of dough and the volume of the gas retained in dough during fermentation decreased with the substitution level increased. The bread incorporated MGF or FMGF decreased the specific volume, deepened the color, led to lower porosity, increased the crumb hardness and chewiness. MGF and FMGF bread showed a slight depreciation in quality with the substitution level below 10 g/100 g. Compared with MGF, FMGF displayed advantages in bread properties at below 10 g/100 g substitution level, indicating that fermentation is a promising technology for improving the processing properties of MGF.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreadmaking quality 3abreads 3achewiness 3acolor 3acorn 3acorn gluten 3adeformation 3adietary fiber 3adough 3adough development 3aenergy 3aextensibility 3afermentation 3afiber content 3afood industry 3aingredients 3aporosity 3awater uptake 0aSubstitution level 0aAlveograph 0aMixolab 0aRheofermentometer 0aTexture1 aMa, Lei1 aXue, Zhong,1 aLiang, Jianfen0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 June 01, v. 162 p.113482-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016700166300001600333520138000349592002801729650001901757650002101776650001501797650001501812650002301827650002001850650002101870650001501891650001201906650001501918650002201933650001901955650001701974653003701991653001502028653001802043653003002061700001502091700001702106700001602123700001702139700001302156773011102169856008302280852000902363655001202372IND60553521620221121144432.0180831e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055352162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.10.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Chunyong12aA switched catalysis qualified sealers capped one-step synthesis biocompatibility bimetallic scaffold film for Neu5Acα(2-6)Gal β MP Glycoside specific detection  ap. 853-859.  aIn this work, a novel label-free biosensor was designed for the sensitive and selective determination of Neu5Acα(2-6)Gal β MP Glycoside using AuPt–PPy(polypyrrole) conductive nanocomposite film as the sensor platform. The introduced AuPt–PPy nanocomposite provided a large surface area for the immobilization of Sambucus nigra agglutinis (SNA) through a coupling agent for specifically recognizing analytes and exhibited high electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an analytical signal. Subsequently, to block the non-specific sites of the modified electrode, GOx was employed instead of the usual sealers. Most importantly, in the presence of glucose, these localized GOx further enhanced the electrochemical signal, which was achieved by the efficient catalysis of glucose. This study is the first that demonstrates the specific detection of Neu5Acα(2-6)Gal β MP Glycoside using AuPt–PPy as the electrocatalytic. Under optimal conditions, the electrochemical biosensor exhibited a wide linear range of 0.01pgmL⁻¹–800ngmL⁻¹ with a low detection limit of 0.003pgmL⁻¹ (S/N=3), due to the affinity between SNA and Neu5Acα(2-6)Gal β MP Glycoside. Therefore, the co-catalysis signal amplification approach has considerable potential in clinical applications and is suitable for the quantification of other biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSambucus nigra 3abiocompatibility 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3acatalytic activity 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aglucose 3aglycosides 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananocomposites 3asurface area 0aNeu5Acα(2-6)Gal β MP Glycoside 0aAuPt–PPy 0aGlucose oxide 0aElectrochemical catalytic1 aHe, Junlin1 aYuan, Guolin1 aLi, Yuliang1 aLi, Qingying1 aYu, Chao0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 77 p.853-859dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.10.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01626naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009600171300001600267520036200283592002800645650002200673650001300695650001900708650003300727653004400760653002200804653001900826653002900845653002300874700002200897700002000919700001900939700002200958700002200980773014501002856008401147852000901231655001201240IND60112807920221119210900.0161024e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011280792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2013.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Torahiko10aDirect targeting of proteins to lipid droplets demonstrated by time-lapse live cell imaging  ap. 620-623.  aA protein that specifically targets lipid droplets (LDs) was created by connecting two domains of nonstructural protein 4B containing amphipathic helices from hepatitis C virus.

The African giant rat (AGR) has been postulated as an indigenous wild‐type model within the African context. This work thus describes oligodendrocyte morphologies and myelin components of the developing African giant rat brain using histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural techniques. Five types, precursor‐progenitor oligodendrocytes, pre‐oligodendrocytes, immature oligodendrocytes, mature non‐myelinating oligodendrocytes and mature myelinating oligodendrocytes, were identified. The first four types were observed in neonates while juvenile and adult AGR had predominantly mature myelinating oligodendrocytes with evidence of myelin sheath deposition. All cell types identified showed positive CNPase‐positive immunosignalling across all age groups. This suggests CNPase as a suitable, sensitive and reliable biomarker for studying CNS neurodegenerative/demyelinating disorders in the AGR. This baseline study has given detailed insight into the morphology of oligodendrocytes and myelin in the AGR. It may be useful for anatomical studies and detection of alterations in neurocellular profile of oligodendrocytes and myelin in the AGR in real‐life or in experimental models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCricetomys 3aadults 3abiomarkers 3abrain 3aelectron microscopy 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3amyelin sheath 3aneonates 3aoligodendroglia 3arats1 aBello, S.

This study aimed to investigate biofilm inhibitory effects and mechanisms of clove essential oil (CEO) and oregano essential oil (OEO) at different concentrations on Salmonella Derby (S. Derby). Crystal violet staining assay was employed to investigate the anti-biofilm effects of the essential oils (EOs), and the initial adhesion, bacterial metabolism, extracellular polymer (EPS) and microscopic examination were used to explore the inhibition mechanism. The results showed that EOs at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) significantly inhibited the biofilm formation of S. Derby. At 1/8 MIC, the two EOs had no significant inhibitory effect on the growth of S. Derby planktonic bacteria, but the biofilm inhibition rates of CEO and OEO were 90.29% and 48.79%, respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) analysis also confirmed distinguishable anti-biofilm effects of CEO and OEO. In addition, our results showed that CEO and OEO inhibited S. Derby biofilm formation by inhibiting metabolic activity and EPS production. This work provides a theoretical basis for the future mechanism research of EOs in the control of biofilm formation of S. Derby and supports the potential application of CEO and OEO in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella Derby 3aadhesion 3abeef 3abiochemical pathways 3abiofilm 3acloves 3adisease transmission 3afood industry 3agentian violet 3ametabolism 3aoregano 3aoregano oil 3aplankton 3apolymers 0aSalmonella derby 0aBiofilm 0aClove essential oil 0aOregano essential oil 0aInhibition mechanism1 aYan, Yuqing1 aDong, Pengcheng1 aNi, Laixue1 aLuo, Xin1 aZhang, Yimin1 aZhu, Lixian0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 June 01, v. 162 p.113486-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245012400203300001800327520153600345592002801881596014301909650001902052650001902071650002002090650001302110650001902123650001502142650001602157650002802173650002402201650001702225650001702242650001902259650001802278650001702296650001102313700002302324700002802347700002002375773015202395856008202547852000902629655001202638IND60631081520221121062922.0210724e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063108152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-3959-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelki, Mirna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1342-013810aAcute toxicities and effects on multixenobiotic resistance activity of eight pesticides to the earthworm Eisenia andrei  ap. 4821-4832.  aInvestigations of deleterious effects on non-target species, including earthworms, have been conducted for a number of pesticides, but there is a need for additional assessments of potential adverse effects. In the present study, the acute toxicity of eight pesticides to the earthworm Eisenia andrei was assessed and compared. The exposures were conducted using the filter paper contact toxicity method. Based on the 48-h LC₅₀ values, one pesticide was classified as supertoxic (combined fungicide containing difenoconazole and fludioxonil), four as extremely toxic (combined herbicide containing pethoxamide and terbuthylazine, combined fungicide containing fluopyram and tebuconazole, fungicide containing pyrimethanil, and combined fungicide containing thiram and carboxin), two as very toxic (combined fungicide containing flutriafol and thiabendazole, and herbicide containing fluroxypyr-meptyl), and one as moderately toxic (insecticide containing thiamethoxam). Additionally, effects of pesticides on the multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity were measured. Results showed that four pesticides caused significant effects with a recorded inhibition of the activity, which can consequently lead to a higher toxicity due to longer retention of the pesticides in the cells. Finally, for three chosen pesticides, gene expression of cat, sod, and gst was measured, and significant changes were observed. The obtained results show that earthworms could be significantly affected by pesticides commonly used in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data  aEffects of environmental toxicants on expression of oxidative stress related genes in earthworm and wheatcAlexander von Humboldt-Stiftung 3aEisenia andrei 3aacute toxicity 3aadverse effects 3acarboxin 3adifenoconazole 3aearthworms 3afludioxonil 3alethal concentration 50 3anontarget organisms 3apyrimethanil 3atebuconazole 3aterbuthylazine 3athiabendazole 3athiamethoxam 3athiram1 aWeltmeyer, Antonia1 aSeiler, Thomas-Benjamin1 aHollert, Henner0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2019 Feb., v. 26, no. 5 p.4821-4832dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3959-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01718naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009000167300001400257520075000271592002801021650001401049650001301063650001101076650001601087650001001103650000801113650001001121651001101131651001301142700002301155700002201178773011101200856004801311852000901359655001201368IND50074238720221120235543.0140326e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007423872DNAL7 a10.1134/S207511171401010X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafonkin, A.

By the beginning of July, coming from the areas near the industrial wheat fields, M. acuminata had dominated on those fields. M. nigrofasciata was found on wild cereals. The highest number of M. acuminata was on the wheat, less on the barley and rye. M. elongata few in number can compete with M. nigrofasciata. M. conifera was registered only on one wheat field together with M. acuminata and M. nigrofasciata. M. acuminata develops on Agropyron sp. (related genus to wheat) and easily migrates to cereal crops.

Cadmium (Cd) contamination in agricultural soils and environment is increasing due to the over-application of Cd-containing phosphate fertilizers. But few studies have been carried out on the environmental influences of K-nano-chelate fertilizers especially on Cd-polluted soils. Therefore, the effects of K-fertilizer application in different rates (0, 100 and 200 mg kg ⁻¹ soil) and forms (KCl, K ₂SO ₄ and K-nano-chelate) on Cd content and partitioning in Ocimum basilicum grown on an artificially Cd-contaminated calcareous soil (with 40 mg Cd kg ⁻¹ soil) were studied under greenhouse conditions. Cadmium decreased shoot dry weight (SDW), but did not affect root dry weight (RDW) and no consistent trend was observed with applied K. Cadmium increased shoot and root Cd concentration or uptake. KCl and K ₂SO ₄ increased shoot Cd concentration compared to that of control, whereas K-nano-chelate did not affect it. In Cd-treated soils the mean value of Cd translocation factor (ratio of Cd concentration in shoots to that of roots) decreased by 60% as compared to that of the control. Application of 100 mg K-K ₂SO ₄ and 100 and 200 mg K-nano-chelate increased the Cd translocation factor by 49, 59 and 112% in Cd-treated soils, respectively. In Cd-treated soils, greater amounts of Cd accumulated in roots. K-nano-chelate could mitigate the adverse effect of Cd on SDW and Cd accumulation in plants grown on Cd-polluted soils, so the risk of Cd entrance to the food chain is reduced (however, in Cd-untreated soils, K-nano-chelate increased the Cd translocation factor higher than other K sources). In Cd-polluted soils KCl was the most inappropriate fertilizer that may intensify Cd accumulation in plants. However, it may be useful in the phytoremediation of Cd-polluted soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcimum basilicum 3aadverse effects 3aagricultural soils 3acadmium 3acalcareous soils 3afood chain 3agreenhouses 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aphytoremediation 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3apotassium fertilizers 3apotassium sulfate 3arisk 3aroots 3ashoots 0aK-nano-chelate 0aK-sulfate 0aK-chloride 0atranslocation factor 0acadmium1 aMoosavi, Ali Akbar1 aShafigh, Mahshid1 aZarei, Zahra1 aKarimian, Fereshteh0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2016 May 3, v. 62, no. 5 p.663-673dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2015.10741873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01541naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008500171300001300256520064800269592002800917650001100945650003700956650001800993650001201011650001101023700001901034700001901053773011001072856004801182852000901230655001201239IND50074238820221120061329.0140326e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007423882DNAL7 a10.1134/S20751117140101112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinogradova, Yu.

A closed-dynamic airflow system was used to determine NH ₃ loss from treatments (20, 40, and 60 g clinoptilolite zeolite pot ⁻¹). Seed germination study was conducted to evaluate the effects of clinoptilolite zeolite on rice seed germination. A pot study was conducted to determine the effects of clinoptilolite zeolite on rice plant growth variables, nutrient uptake, nutrient recovery, and soil chemical properties. Standard procedures were used to determine NH ₃ loss, rice plant height, number of leaves, number of tillers, dry matter production, nutrient uptake, nutrient recovery, and soil chemical properties. Application of clinoptilolite zeolite (15%) increased shoot elongation of seedlings and significantly reduced NH ₃ loss (up to 26% with 60 g zeolite pot ⁻¹), and increased number of leaves, total dry matter, nutrient uptake, nutrient recovery, soil pH, CEC, and exchangeable Na ⁺. Amending acid soils with clinoptilolite zeolite can significantly minimize NH ₃ loss and improve rice plant growth variables, nutrient uptake, nutrient recovery, and soil chemical properties. These findings are being validated in our ongoing field trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3aair flow 3aammonia 3acation exchange capacity 3adry matter accumulation 3aexchangeable sodium 3afield experimentation 3aleaves 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient utilization 3aplant growth 3arice 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3asodium 3asoil pH 3atillers 3aurea 3avolatilization 3azeolites 0aclinoptilolite zeolite 0alowland rice 0anutrient uptake 0anutrient recovery 0asoil chemical properties1 aAhmed, Osumanu Haruna1 aAb Majid, Nik Muhamad0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2016 May 3, v. 62, no. 5 p.708-724dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2015.10772293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010200173300001600275520165700291592002801948650003001976650001702006650001902023653002302042653002902065653001102094653001102105653002202116653003202138700001802170700002002188700002002208773011802228856008502346852000902431655001202440IND60536036920221121061414.0190214e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053603692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Marchin, Thomas10aAnalysis of PSII antenna size heterogeneity of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii during state transitions  ap. 121-130.  aPSII antenna size heterogeneity has been intensively studied in the past. Based on DCMU fluorescence rise kinetics, multiple types of photosystems with different properties were described. However, due to the complexity of fluorescence signal analysis, multiple questions remain unanswered. The number of different types of PSII is still debated as well as their degree of connectivity. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii we found that PSIIα possesses a high degree of connectivity and an antenna 2–3 times larger than PSIIβ, as described previously. We also found some connectivity for PSIIβ in contrast with the majority of previous studies. This is in agreement with biochemical studies which describe PSII mega-, super- and core-complexes in Chlamydomonas. In these studies, the smallest unit of PSII in vivo would be a dimer of two core complexes hence allowing connectivity. We discuss the possible relationships between PSIIα and PSIIβ and the PSII mega-, super- and core-complexes. We also showed that strain and medium dependent variations in the half-time of the fluorescence rise can be explained by variations in the proportions of PSIIα and PSIIβ. When analyzing the state transition process in vivo, we found that this process induces an inter-conversion of PSIIα and PSIIβ. During a transition from state 2 to state 1, DCMU fluorescence rise kinetics are satisfactorily fitted by considering two PSII populations with constant kinetic parameters. We discuss our findings about PSII heterogeneity during state transitions in relation with recent results on the remodeling of the pigment-protein PSII architecture during this process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3afluorescence 3aphotosystem II 0aPSII heterogeneity 0aChlorophyll fluorescence 0aPSIIα 0aPSIIβ 0aState transitions 0aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 11 aGhysels, Bart1 aNicolay, Samuel1 aFranck, Fabrice0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2014 Jan., v. 1837, no. 1 p.121-130dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245015700208300002000365520168800385592002802073650001102101650002802112650002402140650002402164650001702188650001502205650001902220650001902239650001302258650001902271650001102290650001302301650000802314653001402322653001602336653001602352653001502368653003902383700001602422700001802438700001802456700001602474773014502490856008502635852000902720655001202729IND60611659120221122210527.0180904e20180723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061165912DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b013642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiufang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9614-847710aAg Clusters Anchored Conducting Polyaniline As Highly Efficient Cocatalyst for Cu2ZnSnS4 Nanocrystals toward Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation  ap. 11424-11432.  aAccelerating the photogenerated carrier separation of semiconductor photocatalysts is still a big challenge to developing highly effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) systems. Here, a novel ternary photocatalytic system of Cu₂ZnSnS₄ nanocrystals/Ag clusters/conducting polyaniline (CZTS/Ag/PANI) was successfully synthesized via a facile solvothermal and hydrothermal method for the first time. PANI, serving as the support, efficiently prevents the aggregating of the Cu₂ZnSnS₄ and Ag clusters, so CZTS nanocrystals (30–50 nm) and Ag clusters (2–5 nm) disperse equally in macromolecule PANI. PANI with an extended π-conjugated electron system and Ag clusters with a plasmon resonance effect are used as sensitizers/cocatalysts to enhance the light absorption and electrical conductivity and excite the separation of photogenerated electron and hole pairs. As expected, the CZTS/Ag/PANI heterostructured photocatalyst exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from water splitting in the presence of visible light. The optimal hydrogen evolution rate over CZTS/Ag/PANI with the apparent quantum yield (AQE) ∼ 30.5% at 450 nm is 859.6 μmol h–¹, which is also higher than previously reported for CZTS-based photocatalysts. Recycling experiments confirm that the CZTS/Ag/PANI composite exhibits remarkably stable photocatalytic performance and can be reused in four successive cycles. This research indicates that the application of Ag nanoclusters and the PANI semiconductor as a cocatalyst can provide a new approach to designing and synthesizing stable and high efficiency CZTS-based visible-light-induced photocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3aelectrical conductivity 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen production 3ananocrystals 3ananosilver 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apolymers 3asemiconductors 3asilver 3asulfides 3atin 0aCu2ZnSnS4 0aPolyaniline 0aAg clusters 0aCocatalyst 0aPhotocatalytic hydrogen production1 aRuan, Yaner1 aFeng, Shaojie1 aChen, Shaohua1 aSu, Kaixuan0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 July 23, v. 6, no. 9 p.11424-11432dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b013643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245013000213300001600343500001900359520131500378592002801693650002201721650001101743650001101754650001101765650002101776650001301797650001301810653002301823653000901846653002401855653001401879653002401893773013901917856008302056852000902139655001202148IND60719294620221119154950.0201230e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071929462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.11.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Sandipan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8759-107410aEvolutionary and structural analysis elucidates mutations on SARS-CoV2 spike protein with altered human ACE2 binding affinity  ap. 374-380.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe recognition of ACE2 by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein mediates host cell entry. The objective of the work is to identify SARS-CoV2 spike variants that emerged during the pandemic and evaluate their binding affinity with ACE2. Evolutionary analysis of 2178 SARS-CoV2 genomes identifies RBD variants that are under selection bias. The binding efficacy of these RBD variants to the ACE2 has been analyzed by using protein-protein docking and binding free energy calculations. Pan-proteomic analysis reveals 113 mutations among them 33 are parsimonious. Evolutionary analysis reveals five RBD variants A348T, V367F, G476S, V483A, and S494P are under strong positive selection bias. Variations at these sites alter the ACE2 binding affinity. A348T, G476S, and V483A variants display reduced affinity to ACE2 in comparison to the Wuhan SARS-CoV2 spike protein. While the V367F and S494P population variants display a higher binding affinity towards human ACE2. Reorientation of several crucial residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface facilitates additional hydrogen bond formation for the V367F variant which enhances the binding energy during ACE2 recognition.

Compared with Y-liangyou 1, Guiliangyou 2 had 8–10% lower biomass production but 14–18% higher harvest index. Consequently, physiological N-use efficiency was 18–20% higher in Guiliangyou 2 than in Y-liangyou 1. The higher harvest index in Guiliangyou 2 was mainly attributed to enhanced remobilization of stored reserves in the growing grain than in Y-liangyou 1. Larger panicle neck diameter and thinner leaves were partially responsible for the enhanced remobilization of stored reserves in Guiliangyou 2 as compared to Y-liangyou 1. Our results suggest that Guiliangyou 2 is a unique super-hybrid rice cultivar that achieves high grain yield by increasing harvest index and N-use efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3ainflorescences 3aleaves 3anutrient use efficiency 3arice 0aharvest index 0aphysiological N-use efficiency 0aremobilization of stored reserves 0asuper-hybrid rice1 aChen, Jiana1 aCao, Fangbo1 aJiang, Ligeng1 aZou, Yingbin1 aDeng, Guofu0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2016 May 3, v. 62, no. 5 p.725-743dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2015.10820313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01654naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003200135040001800167100002000185245010500205300001400310506007600324520041700400592002800817506003700845650001800882650001400900650001600914650001900930651001000949653001800959653001500977653001400992653001601006653001301022653001001035700001801045773009301063856007901156852000901235655001201244IND60693320520221207062748.0210117e20101229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069332052DNAL7 aPMC30884562pmcid7 a215940522pmid7 a10.3897/zookeys.73.8362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Mao-Ling12aA new genus and two new species of Phygadeuontini (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae, Cryptinae) from China  ap. 61-71.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCarinityla Sheng & Sun gen. n., Carinityla punctulata Sheng & Sun sp. n. and Carinityla pilosa Sheng & Sun sp. n. belonging to the tribe Phygadeuontini of the subfamily Cryptinae (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae), collected from Jiangxi Province, China, are described.

Two additional alternative oxidoreductases were found in this organism: an alternative NADH dehydrogenase (NDH2e) and a mitochondrial isoform of glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase (MitGPDH). These monomeric enzymes lack proton pump activity. They are located on the outer face of the inner mitochondrial membrane. NDH2e oxidizes exogenous NADH in a rotenone-insensitive, flavone-sensitive, process. AOX seems to be constitutive; nonetheless, most electrons are transferred to the cytochromic pathway. Respiratory supercomplexes containing complexes I, III and IV in different stoichiometries were detected. Dimeric complex V was also detected. In-gel activity of NADH dehydrogenase, mass spectrometry, and cytochrome c oxidase and ATPase activities led to determine the composition of the putative supercomplexes. Molecular weights were estimated by comparison with those from the yeast Y. lipolytica and they were IV2, I–IV, III2–IV4, V2, I–III2, I–III2–IV, I–III2–IV2, I–III2–IV3 and I–III2–IV4. Binding of the alternative enzymes to supercomplexes was not detected. This is the first report on the structure and organization of the mitochondrial respiratory chain from D. hansenii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aelectron transport chain 3aelectrons 3amass spectrometry 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3amolecular weight 3aproton pump 3asalt tolerance 3ayeasts 0aADP 0aAMP 0aAOX 0aBN 0aCOX 0aCRR 0aDig 0aIMM 0aLC-MS 0aLM 0aMitGPDH 0aMUC 0aMW 0aNDH 0aNDH2e 0aPAGE 0aPG 0aROS 0aSDS 0a2D 0aRespiratory chain 0aDebaryomyces hansenii 0aAlternative oxidase 0aAlternative NADH dehydrogenase 0aGlycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase 0aSupercomplexes1 aChiquete-Félix, Natalia1 aEspinasa-Jaramillo, Juan1 aRosas-Lemus, Mónica1 aGuerrero-Castillo, Sergio1 aPeña C., Antonioq(Peña Cabrera),1 aUribe-Carvajal, Salvador0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2014 Jan., v. 1837, no. 1 p.73-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245011900205300001200324520154200336592002801878650001501906650001501921650001401936650001201950650001201962650001101974650001801985650000902003650000902012650000902021650001302030650001902043650000702062650001502069650001502084650001402099650001802113650000902131650002302140650000902163650000902172700002002181700002302201700002602224773014102250856008102391852000902472655001202481IND60596930020221119202847.0180621e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059693002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-018-3860-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimón, Mariano1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2623-132810aBiochar from Different Carbonaceous Waste Materials: Ecotoxicity and Effectiveness in the Sorption of Metal(loid)s  ap. 224.  aIn this study, biochar produced by pyrolysis of urban pruning wood (Bpw) and sewage sludge (Bss) were characterized and investigated as adsorbents for the removal of Cu(II), Pb(II), Zn(II), and As(V) from contaminated solutions. Both types of biochars showed different physical-chemical properties and metal(loid) content. In Bss, Cu, Zn, and Pb concentrations exceeded the upper limit of the common ranges in soils. However, when they were tested for their effect on soil invertebrates, neither of the biochar was expected to exert negative effects as long as the dose applied as an amendment was ≤ 4.8 t ha⁻¹. For an assessment of the effectiveness of biochar in the immobilization of metal(loid)s, three contaminated solutions with acidic pH and different pollutant concentrations were added to both types of biochar. Precipitation as oxy-hydroxides and the formation of complexes with active functional groups of the organic matter were the main mechanisms of metal(loid) fixation by the biochar, with increased precipitation and a rising pH. Both types of biochar were effective at immobilizing Pb and Cu, while Zn showed less effectiveness in this regard and As the least. The high P content of the biochar from sewage sludge favored Pb fixation, presumably forming complexes with phosphates, while competition between phosphate and arsenate ions decreased As adsorption by Fe compounds. The metal(loid)s immobilized by biochar from urban pruning wood were more bioavailable than those fixed by biochar from sewage sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3abiochar 3acopper 3aecotoxicology 3aions 3airon 3alead 3amoieties 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphosphates 3apollutants 3apyrolysis 3asewage sludge 3asoil 3asoil invertebrates 3awood 3azinc1 aGarcía, Inés,1 aDiez-Ortiz, María1 aGonzález, Verónica,0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2018 July, v. 229, no. 7 p.224-224dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-018-3860-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012200169300001600291520145400307592002801761650001801789650001701807650001201824650001201836650001601848650001301864650001601877650001301893650002101906650001701927650002001944650002301964650001501987650002102002650001502023650001702038650002202055650001002077650001102087650000902098650002502107650001302132653001302145653002102158653001902179653002802198653002102226700001802247700002002265700002102285700001802306700001902324700001802343700002202361700001802383773012602401856008502527852000902612655001202621IND60468573820160411000000.0151215e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046857382DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2015.10820322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJabeen, Naila10aGlycinebetaine mediates chromium tolerance in mung bean through lowering of Cr uptake and improved antioxidant system  ap. 648-662.  aA pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the role of glycinebetaine (GB) in chromium (Cr) tolerance in mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) grown in Cr-stressed soil. Three concentrations of Cr (0, 250 and 500 µM) were tested with three (0, 50 and 100 mM) concentrations of foliar-applied GB. Cr alone led to a significant decrease in plant growth, biomass, and concentrations of chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids. Cr concentration and electrolyte leakage significantly increased in plants with increasing Cr levels in the soil. Lower Cr stress enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidases (POD) and catalase (CAT), while higher Cr concentrations decreased the activities of these enzymes. Foliar application of GB successfully alleviated toxic effects of Cr on mung bean and increased plant growth, biomass and chlorophyll contents under Cr stress. GB application reduced Cr accumulation and electrolyte leakage in plants and enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes in both shoots and roots as compared with Cr treatments alone. These findings suggest that foliar-applied GB alleviated Cr-induced oxidative stress in mung bean by reducing Cr uptake. The protective effect of GB against Cr stress varies with the concentrations of GB and Cr stress applied. Thus, further studies are still needed to specify the concentrations of GB required for detoxification of specific Cr concentrations under various climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna radiata 3aantioxidants 3abetaine 3abiomass 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3achromium 3aclimatic factors 3aelectrolytes 3aenzyme activity 3afoliar application 3amung beans 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth 3aprotective effect 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 0achromium 0aVigna radiata L. 0aglycinebetaine 0aphotosynthetic pigments 0aoxidative stress1 aAbbas, Zaheer1 aIqbal, Muhammad1 aRizwan, Muhammad1 aJabbar, Abdul1 aFarid, Mujahid1 aAli, Shafaqat1 aIbrahim, Muhammad1 aAbbas, Farhat0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2016 May 3, v. 62, no. 5 p.648-662dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2015.10820323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011200170300001800282520115700300592002801457650001501485650001501500650001001515650002001525650002601545650003001571650002401601650001301625650001401638653001801652653003001670653003001700653002301730653002701753653003001780700001701810700002101827773011301848856008301961852000902044655001202053IND60553522220221121115619.0180831e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055352222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.10.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParra-Cabrera, C.10aMultiple biomarkers biosensor with just-in-time functionalization: Application to prostate cancer detection  ap. 1192-1200.  aWe present a novel lab-on-a-chip (LOC) device for the simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers using simple voltage measurements. The biosensor functionalization is performed in-situ, immediately before its use, facilitating reagents storage and massive devices fabrication. Sensitivity, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) are tunable depending on the in-chip flown sample volumes. As a proof-of-concept, the system has been tested and adjusted to quantify two proteins found in blood that are susceptible to be used combined, as a screening tool, to diagnose prostate cancer (PCa): prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and spondin-2 (SPON2). This combination of biomarkers has been reported to be more specific for PCa diagnostics than the currently accepted but rather controversial PSA indicator. The range of detection for PSA and SPON2 could be adjusted to the clinically relevant range of 1 to 10ng/ml. The system was tested for specificity to the evaluated biomarkers. This multiplex system can be modified and adapted to detect a larger quantity of biomarkers, or different ones, of relevance to other specific diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3ablood 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3aprostate-specific antigen 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aproteins 3ascreening 0aMicrofluidics 0aProstate specific antigen 0aIn situ functionalization 0aAdjustable sensing 0aImpedance measurements 0aSelf-assembled monolayers1 aSamitier, J.1 aHoms-Corbera, A.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 77 p.1192-1200dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.10.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010000165300002000265520112200285592002801407650001501435650001001450650001101460650002101471650001501492650001701507650001101524650001901535650001001554650001301564650002401577650001901601650001101620650000901631653001101640653003101651653002201682653001901704653002001723700001501743700001201758700001601770700001501786700005701801773014501858856008502003852000902088655001202097IND60611659320221122210541.0180904e20180726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061165932DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b014352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Dong10aSynthesis of Boron and Nitrogen Codoped Porous Carbon Foam for High Performance Supercapacitors  ap. 11441-11449.  aA facile and efficient method to prepare boron and nitrogen codoped porous carbon foam (BNPC) derived from starch with urea as nitrogen source and boric acid as both boron source and templet is presented. The codoping strategy can boost the synergistically doping amounts of boron and nitrogen, which can achieve a great increase in the doping efficiency of boron (three times higher than single boron doping) and nitrogen. Due to its hierarchical pore structure with moderate specific surface and relatively high nitrogen (9.38 at. %) and boron (3.87 at. %), the BNPC electrode exhibits outstanding electrochemical performances with an ultrahigh specific capacity of 402 F g–¹ at a current density of 0.5 A g–¹ and retains 266 F g–¹ even at a current density of 20 A g–¹ in 6 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, a symmetric device based on BNPC electrodes delivers a respectable energy density of 21.9 Wh kg–¹ in 1 M Na₂SO₄ electrolyte. Therefore, this work provides a simple and efficient method to synthesize heteroatom-doped hierarchical porous carbon materials for advanced energy storage systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboric acid 3aboron 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3afoams 3anitrogen 3apotassium hydroxide 3asodium sulfate 3astarch 3aurea 0aStarch 0aHierarchical porous carbon 0aHeteroatom doping 0aEnergy density 0aSupercapacitors1 aDing, Bing1 aHu, Xin1 aWang, Yahui1 aHan, Fuqin1 aWu, Xiaoliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9297-09220 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 July 26, v. 6, no. 9 p.11441-11449dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b014353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010500173300001400278520151700292592002801809650003001837650001501867650001601882650001101898650001501909650002901924650002201953650001901975650002001994650001502014653003002029653001902059653001902078653004402097653002402141700002702165700002402192700003302216700002202249700002302271700001902294773011602313856008502429852000902514655001202523IND60536037220221121061211.0190214e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053603722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrop, Bartłomiej,10aLight-harvesting complex II (LHCII) and its supramolecular organization in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ap. 63-72.  aLHCII is the most abundant membrane protein on earth. It participates in the first steps of photosynthesis by harvesting sunlight and transferring excitation energy to the core complex. Here we have analyzed the LHCII complex of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and its association with the core of Photosystem II (PSII) to form multiprotein complexes. Several PSII supercomplexes with different antenna sizes have been purified, the largest of which contains three LHCII trimers (named S, M and N) per monomeric core. A projection map at a 13Å resolution was obtained allowing the reconstruction of the 3D structure of the supercomplex. The position and orientation of the S trimer are the same as in plants; trimer M is rotated by 45° and the additional trimer (named here as LHCII-N), which is taking the position occupied in plants by CP24, is directly associated with the core. The analysis of supercomplexes with different antenna sizes suggests that LhcbM1, LhcbM2/7 and LhcbM3 are the major components of the trimers in the PSII supercomplex, while LhcbM5 is part of the “extra” LHCII pool not directly associated with the supercomplex. It is also shown that Chlamydomonas LHCII has a slightly lower Chlorophyll a/b ratio than the complex from plants and a blue shifted absorption spectrum. Finally the data indicate that there are at least six LHCII trimers per dimeric core in the thylakoid membranes, meaning that the antenna size of PSII of C. reinhardtii is larger than that of plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aabsorption 3achlorophyll 3aenergy 3aharvesting 3alight harvesting complex 3amembrane proteins 3aphotosystem II 3asolar radiation 3athylakoids 0aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 0aPhotosynthesis 0aPhotosystem II 0aLight harvesting complexes organization 0aElectron microscopy1 aWebber-Birungi, Mariam1 aYadav, Sathish K.N.1 aFilipowicz-Szymanska, Alicja1 aFusetti, Fabrizia1 aBoekema, Egbert J.1 aCroce, Roberta0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2014 Jan., v. 1837, no. 1 p.63-72dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002300158245017200181300001800353500002400371520132700395650002601722650002001748650001501768650002201783650001801805650002101823650000901844650001101853650001101864700001901875700002101894700002101915773011601936852000902052856007902061655001202140IND4421440020221119053640.0090605e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442144002DNAL7 a216282592pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.08003792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhartyal, Shyam S.10aTemperature requirements differ for the two stages of seed dormancy break in Aegopodium podagraria (Apiaceae), a species with deep complex morphophysiological dormancy  ap. 1086-1095.  aIncludes references  aOnly a few studies have considered the possibility that low temperature requirements may vary among stages of dormancy break in seeds with morphophysiological dormancy (MPD). We show that this lack of consideration in previous studies on seed dormancy and germination of Aegopodium podagraria might explain the low germination percentages and/or the relatively long periods of incubation needed for germination. Under natural temperatures, embryos began to grow in September and were fully elongated by late December; most growth occurred when the average daily mean temperature was about 10°C. Radicles emerged under snow in late winter, and cotyledons emerged after snowmelt in early spring. In laboratory experiments, 100% of the embryos grew to full length at both 0 and 5°C, whereas 0°C was much more effective than 5°C in overcoming the physiological dormancy in seeds after embryos were fully elongated. Following radicle emergence, cotyledons emerged readily in a wide range of temperatures greater-than-or-equal5°C. GA₃ did not substitute for the low temperature requirement for dormancy break. Seed dormancy in A. podagraria fits Nikolaeva's formula for deep complex MPD, i.e., C₃B-C₃. Better germination of seeds pretreated at 0° than at 5°C has practical implications for cultivating this species. 3aAegopodium podagraria 3aair temperature 3acotyledons 3adormancy breaking 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3asnow 3aspring 3awinter1 aKondo, Tetsuya1 aBaskin, Jerry M.1 aBaskin, Carol C.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2009 June, v. 96, no. 6 p.1086-1095dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.08003793Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01630naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245007700169300001600246520068500262650000900947650002700956650002600983650001301009700002101022700002001043773011801063852000901181856009201190930003301282946001301315655001201328IND4405945220221119053647.0080523e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440594522DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-9353.2008.00400.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaw, Marc T.10aEarmarked: The Political Economy of Agricultural Research Appropriations  ap. 194-213.  aSince 1965 a significant portion of the US Department of Agriculture's extramural research budget has been earmarked by Congress for particular research projects.

Finally, we argue that this program provides an excellent illustration of path-dependence in government policy, and that an understanding of the special grants program may shed light on the decline of science at the USDA and Congress's reluctance to increase agricultural research funding. 3aUSDA 3aagricultural economics 3aagricultural research 3apolitics1 aTonon, Joseph M.1 aMiller, Gary J.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g2008 Summer, v. 30, no. 2 p.194-213dBlackwell Publishing Incx1058-71957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9353.2008.00400.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03628naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245014000178300001800318500001500336520169200351650001602043650001302059650001002072650001602082650002302098650002502121650001602146650002002162650000902182650001402191650001302205650001502218650001402233650002102247650002002268650001602288650001702304650002202321650001802343650001102361650001002372650001102382650001802393650002502411650000902436650002302445650001702468651001202485651001202497653001202509653007402521653003202595700001402627700002402641700001502665700002602680700001702706700001702723773008802740852000902828930003302837945002502870946001102895655001202906IND4405927920221119053433.0080523e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440592792DNAL7 a180349112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLibuda, L.10aPattern of beverage consumption and long-term association with body-weight status in German adolescents - results from the DONALD study  ap. 1370-1379.  a2019-12-04  aIn the present study the relationship between the consumption of different beverage groups and body-weight status in 5 years of study participation in German adolescents was investigated. We used anthropometric and dietary data from 3 d weighed records of 244 subjects between 9 and 18 years of age participating in the Dortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed (DONALD) study. Only subjects with at least four out of six possible weighed dietary records were considered. A repeated-measures regression model (PROC MIXED) was used to analyse the effect of beverage consumption on body-weight status. BMI standard deviation scores (BMI-SDS) and body fat percentage (%BF) were chosen as the dependent variables. In boys, energetic beverage consumption was not associated with BMI-SDS or %BF, neither cross-sectionally nor prospectively. In girls, baseline consumption of energetic beverages did not predict baseline BMI-SDS, baseline %BF, or change in either variable over the study period. However, an increase in energetic beverage consumption over the study period was associated with an increase in BMI-SDS (+0.070 SDS/MJ increase in energetic beverage consumption; P = 0·01). Separate consideration of regular soft drinks and fruit juices revealed that, in girls, BMI-SDS increased with increased fruit juice consumption (+0·096 SDS/MJ increase in fruit juice consumption; P = 0·01), and to a lesser extent with regular soft drink consumption (+0·055 SDS/MJ increase in regular soft drink consumption; P = 0·08). In conclusion, these results suggest that an increase in energetic beverage consumption may result in weight gain, at least in adolescent girls. 3aweight gain 3adrinking 3agirls 3abody weight 3agender differences 3aadolescent nutrition 3aadolescents 3abody mass index 3aboys 3abeverages 3abody fat 2aAdolescent 2aBeverages 2aBody Composition 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weight 2aDiet Records 2aDrinking Behavior 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aNutritional Status 2aTime Factors 3aGermany 0aGermany 0aGermans 0aDortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed study 0aanthropometric measurements1 aAlexy, U.1 aSichert-Hellert, W.1 aStehle, P.1 aKaraolis-Danckert, N.1 aBuyken, A.E.1 aKersting, M.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2008 June, v. 99, no. 6 p.1370-1379x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20080806b20080905c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/07/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02444naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010900164300001600273500001500289520095700304650002401261650001301285650001501298650002101313650001101334650002001345650003301365650001401398650001601412650002401428650001701452650001801469650001001487650001001497653002201507653001001529653002201539700002401561700002101585700002501606700002701631700002901658773011301687852000901800856008501809930003301894946001101927655001201938IND4437128420221119053413.0100514e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443712842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-009-0638-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeyran, Murat 10aPhylogeny of the pecan scab fungus Fusicladium effusum G. Winter based on the cytochrome b gene sequence  ap. 305-308.  a2019-12-04  aPecan scab, caused by the fungus Fusicladium effusum, is the most devastating disease of pecan (Carya illinoinensis) trees and is responsible for the majority of disease management efforts applied to that crop. The taxonomy of the fungus changed several times in the last decade and most recently, using ITS nrDNA data and conventional taxonomic methods, the organism was renamed F. effusum. In our study, a conserved region of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was sequenced from three isolates of F. effusum. The obtained sequences showed 95% nucleic acid and 100% amino acid homology (201-266 amino acids on exon 5 of the cytochrome b gene) with Venturia inaequalis (NCBI GenBank accession number AF047029). And in the maximum parsimony tree based on nucleotide sequences, F. effusum and V. inaequalis were clustered, with a 92% bootstrap value. The taxonomic classification of the pecan scab fungus was supported based on the cytochrome b region. 3aVenturia inaequalis 3ataxonomy 3apecan scab 3aPassalora effusa 3apecans 3adisease control 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3aamino acids 3aCarya illinoinensis 3acytochrome b 3anucleic acids 3aexons 3afungi 0aSequence analyses 0agenes 0aVenturia anamorph1 aNischwitz, Claudia 1 aLewis, Kippy J. 1 aGitaitis, Ronald D. 1 aBrenneman, Timothy B. 1 aStevenson, Katherine L. 0 tMycological progress.g2010 May, v. 9, no. 2 p.305-308dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1617-416X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-009-0638-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03399naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001700180245010200197300001800299520168500317650002202002650001302024650001202037650002202049650001402071650002002085650002002105650002602125650001802151650001302169650001902182650002502201650000902226650002202235650001902257650001102276650000902287650001702296650002202313650001802335650001102353650002202364650001102386650001502397650000902412650001402421650003202435650001702467651001202484651002702496700001402523700001702537700001702554773008802571852000902659930003302668945002502701946001102726655001202737IND4405927620221119053340.0080523e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440592762DNAL7 a180628262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHapponen, P.10aCoffee consumption and mortality in a 14-year follow-up of an elderly northern Finnish population  ap. 1354-1361.  aThe present study assessed the relationship between coffee consumption and mortality in a home-dwelling elderly population. A population-based cohort of 817 men and women born in 1920 or earlier and living in northern Finland provided complete data on daily coffee consumption and other variables at the baseline examination in 1991-1992. Deaths were monitored through to the end of 2005 by national death certificates, resulting in 6960 person-years of follow-up. Hazard rate ratios for mortality by daily coffee intake were estimated by Poisson regression models adjusted for some known predictors of mortality. During 14·5 years of follow-up, 623 deaths occurred. The total mortality rate was inversely related to the number of cups (average volume, 125 ml) of coffee consumed daily. After adjustment for age, sub-period of follow-up, sex, marital status, basic educational level, previous occupational group, current smoking, BMI, history of myocardial infarction, self-rated health and presence of diabetes, cognitive impairment or physical disability, the estimated relative risk reduction of total mortality per an increment of one more cup of coffee per d reported at baseline was 4 (95 % CI 0, 8) %. The observed associations between coffee consumption and mortality from CVD, cancer, and other or unknown causes, respectively, were qualitatively similar to that of total mortality but the estimates were less precise. The effect of coffee consumption at baseline appeared to attenuate after 10 years since the start of follow-up. The present study provides evidence for daily (caffeine-containing) coffee intake being inversely associated with mortality in the elderly. 3acoffee (beverage) 3adrinking 3aelderly 3aelderly nutrition 3amortality 3asmoking (habit) 3abody mass index 3amyocardial infarction 3ahealth status 3adiabetes 3acohort studies 3alongitudinal studies 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCause of Death 2aCoffee 2aDiet 2aDiet Surveys 2aDrinking Behavior 2aWhite People. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aMortality 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aRisk Factors 3aFinland 0aFinlandxepidemiology.1 aLaara, E.1 aHiltunen, L.1 aLuukinen, H.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2008 June, v. 99, no. 6 p.1354-1361x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20080806b20080905c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/07/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03186naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001900146245012200165300001800287500001500305520163600320650001601956650001801972650000801990650002601998650001002024650001802034650001202052650001202064650001602076650001402092650002502106650002302131650001702154650004502171650001102216650001802227650001202245650001102257650001102268650001802279650000902297650001402306650001102320653001502331653003002346700002402376700001402400700001602414773008802430852000902518930003302527945002502560946001102585655001202596IND4405927820221119053303.0080523e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440592782DNAL7 a180819462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMoorhead, S.A.14aThe level of carbonation of a sugar-sweetened beverage preload affects satiety and short-term energy and food intakes  ap. 1362-1369.  a2019-12-04  aThe consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with increased incidence of overweight and obesity, and a factor underlying this putative link could be the relatively low levels of satiety that may be induced by these beverages. Although many sugar-sweetened beverages are carbonated, little attention has been given to the potential effects of level of carbonation on satiety and subsequent intakes. We hypothesized that increasing the level of carbonation in a sugar-sweetened beverage would increase satiety and decrease intakes in the short term. Using a randomized, within-subject cross-over design, thirty non-obese subjects (fifteen women, fifteen men) participated on three occasions, 1 week apart. Following a standard breakfast, subjects consumed a beverage preload 10 min before consuming a lunch ad libitum. Preloads were the same sugar-sweetened beverage (400 ml, 639 kJ) with three levels of carbonation, which were low (1·7 volumes), medium (2·5 volumes) and high (3·7 volumes). Satiety was assessed using visual analogue scales and intakes were measured at the lunch and for the rest of the day. Compared with the beverage with low carbonation, consumption of the beverages with medium and high carbonation led to significantly (P < 0·05) higher satiety until lunch, when intakes of food and energy were significantly (P < 0·05) lower. There were no significant effects on satiety following lunch or on intakes for the rest of the day. This short-term study suggests that the level of carbonation may need to be taken into account when assessing potential effects of beverages on satiety and intake. 3afood intake 3aenergy intake 3amen 3adiet study techniques 3awomen 3asugar content 3asatiety 3aobesity 3acarbonation 3abeverages 2aCarbonated Beverages 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDiet Records 2aDietary Sucrosexadministration & dosage 2aEating 2aEnergy Intake 2aFasting 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aSatiation 2aThirst 0aoverweight 0asugar-sweetened beverages1 aLivingstone, M.B.E.1 aDunne, A.1 aWelch, R.W.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2008 June, v. 99, no. 6 p.1362-1369x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20080806b20080905c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/07/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03294naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110100002300130245014600153300001800299500001500317520184600332650002802178650001802206650001702224650001802241650000802259650002302267650001002290650001802300650002302318650001202341650002202353650003102375650001202406650002102418650001602439650002102455653001502476653001602491700001502507700001402522700001602536700001602552700001502568700001602583700001502599700001402614700001602628773008802644852000902732946001102741655001202752IND4405928420221119053347.0080523s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440592842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

   1 aSalas-Salvadó, J.10aEffect of two doses of a mixture of soluble fibres on body weight and metabolic variables in overweight or obese patients: a randomised trial  ap. 1380-1387.  a2019-12-04  aThe aim of the study was to compare the effect of the administration of a mixture of fibres on body weight-loss, satiety, lipid profile and glucose metabolism. We included 200 overweight or obese patients in a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, who were randomised to receive, in the context of an energy-restricted diet for a period of 16 weeks, a mixed fibre dose (3 g Plantago ovata husk and 1 g glucomannan) twice (b.i.d. group) or three times daily (t.i.d. group) or placebo. Weight change was the primary efficacy endpoint. Satiety, dietary compliance, lipid profile, glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were secondary endpoints. Weight loss tended to be higher after both doses of fibre (-4·52 (sd 0·56) and -4·60 (sd 0·55) kg) than placebo (-0·79 (sd 0·58) kg); the differences in changes between groups were not statistically significant. Postprandial satiety increased in both fibre groups compared to the placebo. The differences between groups in LDL-cholesterol levels were significant (P = 0·03), with greater reductions in the two fibre-supplemented groups (-0·38 (sd 0·10) and -0·24 (sd 0·09) mmol/l in the b.i.d. and t.i.d. groups v. -0·06 (sd 0·09) mmol/l in placebo group). A similar pattern was observed for changes in total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol:LDL-cholesterol ratios. Interventions were well tolerated and had no effects on HDL-cholesterol, glucose and insulin concentrations, glucose tolerance or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. In conclusion, a 16-week dietary supplement of soluble fibre in overweight or obese patients was well tolerated, induced satiety and had beneficial effects on some CVD risk factors, the most important of which was a significant decrease in plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations. 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3adietary fiber 3ablood lipids 3adose response 3amen 3aC-reactive protein 3awomen 3asoluble fiber 3apostprandial state 3aobesity 3ametabolic studies 3arandomized clinical trials 3asatiety 3alipid metabolism 3aweight loss 3alow calorie diet 0aoverweight 0abody weight1 aFarres, X.1 aLuque, X.1 aNarejos, S.1 aBorrell, M.1 aBasora, J.1 aAnguera, A.1 aTorres, F.1 aBullo, M.1 aBalanza, R.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2008 June, v. 99, no. 6 p.1380-1387x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  aNon-US 7aarticle01821naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245018200169300001600351520069800367650001301065650001601078650000901094650001501103650002001118650001401138650001201152653001401164700002001178700002201198773011301220852000901333856008501342930003301427946001101460655001201471IND4437128120221119053448.0100514e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443712812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-009-0636-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavydov, Evgeny A. 14aThe systematic position of Lasallia caroliniana (Tuck.)

According to the new concept, Lasallia is distinguished from Umbilicaria by comprising species which combine large, multicellular, brown ascospores and a pustulate thallus. The functionally significant differences in ascospore morphology justify the current division of Umbilicariaceae into Lasallia and Umbilicaria, although Umbilicaria remains paraphyletic. 3aLasallia 3aUmbilicaria 3aasci 3aascospores 3anew combination 3aparaphyly 3athallus 0aITS nrDNA1 aPeršoh, Derek 1 aRambold, Gerhard 0 tMycological progress.g2010 May, v. 9, no. 2 p.261-266dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1617-416X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-009-0636-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02499naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245014000148300001600288520096100304650001601265650002001281650003801301650002801339650002601367650003201393650003201425650001801457650002001475650001701495650004201512650001801554650002601572650004101598650005801639650005401697650000901751650001101760653003001771653001401801700001801815773009601833852001301929930003301942945000801975946001301983852000901996655001202005991584240760742620221119053428.0921105e199210  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920033562DNAL7 a14149732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasaki, S.10aValue of Food and Agriculture Organization data on food-balance sheets as a data source for dietary fat intake in epidemiologic studies  ap. 716-723.  aThe relationships between the per person supply (expressed as percent of total energy supply) of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) obtained from 1979-1981 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data, and the per person intake obtained from 52 individual dietary surveys performed in 19 countries, were examined. In particular, the ratio of PUFAs to SFAs (P:S) and the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs and PUFAs) to SFAs (U:S) obtained from both data sources were examined. Significant correlations (P < 0.001) were found between the two data sources for the P:S, U:S, SFAs, and MUFAs and PUFAs (P < 0.02) in 19 countries.

The primers were used to generate environmental clone libraries from Puget Sound, Washington, and Vancouver Island, British Columbia, to confirm that the primers were specific for Pseudo-nitzschia and to determine the extent of ITS1 sequence diversity within individual species. All environmental ITS1 sequences generated with PnAll primers displayed the greatest similarity to known Pseudo-nitzschia ITS1 sequences. The length of cloned ITS1 fragments differed among species but was conserved within a species. Intraspecific genotypes exhibited <3% sequence divergence for seven of the 10 species detected in clone libraries. Several ITS1 genotypes unique to the Pacific Northwest were identified in environmental samples, and other genotypes were more broadly distributed. The Pseudo-nitzschia primers were also used to develop an automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) to rapidly identify Pseudo-nitzschia species in environmental samples based on species-specific variation in the length of the targeted ITS1 region. The ARISA peaks were then associated with the environmental clone sequences for Pseudo-nitzschia species. Surveying the genetic composition of communities at both the inter- and intraspecific levels will enhance our understanding of Pseudo-nitzschia bloom dynamics.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillariophyceae 3aDNA primers 3acommunity structure 3agenotype 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alibraries 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aBritish Columbia 3aPuget Sound 3aWashington (state) 0aARISA 0adiversity 0aenvironmental clone libraries 0aITS 0aPseudo-nitzschia 0aPuget Sound 0aVancouver Island1 aRocap, Gabrielle1 aArmbrust, E.

In vitro studies revealed that alpha-tocopheryl succinate (TS) induced differentiation and growth-inhibition in certain animal and human tumor cells in culture, whereas alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T), alpha-tocopheryl acetate (alpha-TA) and alpha-tocopheryl nicotinate (alpha-TN) were ineffective. Alpha-TS also reduced basal and ligand-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, and expression of c-myc and H-ras oncogenes in certain tumor cells in culture. The relative efficacy of various forms of vitamin E in cancer prevention in animal or human models has not been evaluated. Human epidemiologic studies utilizing retrospective and prospective case-control experimental designs are not suitable for evaluating the role of vitamin E in cancer prevention due to several inherent problems associated with these methodologies. Intervention trials utilizing vitamin E with appropriate biological and statistical rationales are most suitable for testing the role of vitamin E in cancer prevention in humans. Some human trials utilizing vitamin E alone or in combination with other nutrients are in progress. 3avitamin E 3aadenylate cyclase 3aneoplasms 3adisease prevention 3acell differentiation 3aAdenoviridae 3aoncogenes 3abiomedical research 2aAnimals 2aCricetinae 2aDrug Interactions 2aFemale 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMice 2aNeoplasmsxprevention & control 2aRats 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 2aVitamin Exadministration & dosagexpharmacokineticsxtherapeutic use. 0atransformation1 aEdwards-Prasad, J.0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g1992 Oct., v. 11, no. 5 p.487-500x0731-57247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02554naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245007500144300001800219520134800237650001801585650001601603650001901619650000901638650001601647650002001663650002101683650001401704650001601718650001201734650003301746650001101779650001801790650002201808650000901830650002001839650001601859650001301875700002001888700001801908700001701926773008601943852000902029939003302038946001302071655001202084IND9201674320221119053321.0920326e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920167432DNAL7 a19386342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMader, T.L.10aType and mixtures of high-moisture corn in beef cattle finishing diets  ap. 3480-3486.  aIn three experiments consisting of three finishing trials each, five corn storage and(or) feeding treatments were evaluated: 1) dry whole (DWC); 2) whole high-moisture (WHMC); 3) mixture (MHMC) of ground (GHMC) or rolled (RHMC) high-moisture corn with WHMC; 4) GHMC stored in a bunker silo; and 5) RHMC, corn stored whole but fed in rolled form. In Exp. 1, gains and feed intakes of steers fed whole corn (DWC vs WHMC) were similar. Steers fed GHMC and RHMC had lower (P <.05) gains and intakes than steers fed whole corn. However, feed to gain ratios were 9% better (P < .10) for steers fed RHMC than for steers fed GHMC. In Exp. 1 and 2, gains of steers fed MHMC were intermediate to gains of steers fed whole (DWC and WHMC) or processed corn (GHMC and RHMC). Feed to gain ratios of steers fed whole or processed corn were similar to feed to gain ratios of steers fed MHMC. In Exp. 3, steers fed 28.6% moisture GHMC had lower (P < .05) intakes and feed to gain ratios than steers fed 22.5% moisture GHMC. Intakes and feed to gain ratios decreased 1.2 and 1.4%, respectively, for each 1% increase in corn moisture. Data are interpreted to mean that the relative effect of corn moisture content on cattle performance depends on form of corn fed; positive associative effects of MHMC are negligible, but RHMC has a greater feed value than GHMC. 3awater content 3abeef cattle 3acattle feeding 3acorn 3afeed intake 3aliveweight gain 3afeed formulation 3afinishing 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgrowth & development 2aEating 2aFood Handling 2aFood Preservation 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aWeight Gain 2aZea mays1 aDahlquist, J.M.1 aBritton, R.A.1 aKrause, V.E.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 Sept., v. 69, no. 9 p.3480-3486x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03880naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010900164300001600273500002400289520267100313650001902984650002003003650002503023650002203048650002103070650002303091650002203114650001503136650001103151650002003162650001903182650001403201650001303215650001303228650001903241700001803260700001903278773010403297852000903401856004803410655001203458IND4426874620221119053408.0091002e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442687462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-009-0109-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhlf, Wolfgang10aIncorporation of metal bioavailability into regulatory frameworks—metal exposure in water and sediment  ap. 411-419.  aIncludes references  aBackground, aim, and scope The cause for this position paper is the impression that risk assessors consider primarily the concentration of free metal ions dissolved in solution controlling metal bioavailability in aquatic systems. Aiming at a more realistic risk assessment of metals, bioavailability has to be discussed under the scope of main uptake routes of metals to organisms. Materials and methods On the basis of a review on the literature relating to bioavailability approaches, this work discusses the incorporation of metal bioavailability into the risk assessment of metals in the context of metal exposure. Results The biotic ligand model (BLM) and the concept of sulfide bound metals described by the ratio of simultaneously extracted metals and acid volatile sulfide concept (AVS) have been developed to consider the bioavailability of metals. Both approaches assume that the free ion concentration is the most relevant exposure pathway. However, apart from geochemical conditions, which control free metal concentration, bioavailability is additionally a result of contaminant/particle interaction and of organisms' activity. Asking for the relevant exposure pathways for inorganic metals to organisms, the compartments' water and sediment have been evaluated and also the importance of contaminated food. Discussion We present a conceptual model of the main processes and sources for uptake of trace metals at a biological membrane. On the basis of this model, we have to consider free metal ions, metal complexes, and particle-bound metals. The BLM approach has been proposed for use in European Union risk assessments. However, the BLM provides a means to predict ecotoxicological effect of metals in the environment, but at present assumes that total significant uptake is from the dissolved phase. It is apparent that dietary accumulation of metals is at least as important as metal uptake from the aqueous phase and in many cases dominates metal accumulation. Conclusions We found evidence in literature that uptake occurs via the dissolved phase, metal complexes, dietary, and particle-bound metals. In this regard, the AVS model, which considers only sedimentary metals in anoxic sediments, was more effective in predicting metal concentrations in pore waters than sediment toxicity in general. Recommendations and perspectives Models will be improved by incorporating chronic metal effects rather than the binding to ligands. The most important for a risk assessment is a broad understanding of the relative importance of different uptake routes and the differential toxicity of metals accumulated by organisms with diverse feeding behavior. 3aEuropean Union 3abioavailability 3aenvironmental impact 3aexposure pathways 3afeeding behavior 3afood contamination 3along term effects 3ametal ions 3ametals 3arisk assessment 3arisk assessors 3asediments 3asulfides 3atoxicity 3atrace elements1 aDrost, Wiebke1 aHeise, Susanne0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2009 Oct., v. 9, no. 5 p.411-419dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-009-0109-6 7aarticle02385naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245014400176300001600320500002400336520135400360650001501714650002001729650001601749650001201765650001001777650001101787650001601798650001301814650001001827700002501837773010001862852000901962856007601971655001202047IND4384117720221119053306.0061007s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438411772DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01662.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVALDIVIA, CARLOS E.10aDo pollinators simultaneously select for inflorescence size and amount of floral scents? An experimental assessment on Escallonia myrtoidea  ap. 897-903.  aIncludes references  aCorrelation among phenotypic traits may be explained by correlational selection, the simultaneous selection of more than one trait, or by genetic and/or developmental factors. In Escallonia myrtoidea, a tree with scented flowers from central Chile, inflorescence size and the amount of floral scents were positively correlated. Independent manipulation of scent and inflorescence size in a factorial design was used to assess the occurrence of pollinator-mediated correlational selection. Dependency on pollinators for seed set was also assessed. If pollinator-mediated correlational selection occurs, nonadditive effects of both traits are expected, albeit only when the effect of manipulating the state of such traits is disadvantageous with respect to the naturally occurring inflorescences, and provided that plants are not limited by pollinators for seed set and pollen export. Escallonia myrtoidea was very strongly pollinator-limited for seed set and pollen export. Pollinator-mediated additive effects were not observed in the frequency of visits by pollinators, pollen export, and seed set of E. myrtoidea after experiencing scent and inflorescence size manipulations. Consequently, there was no support for pollinator-mediated correlational selection between those traits, suggesting the prevalence of genetic and/or developmental factors. 3aEscallonia 3aadditive effect 3acorrelation 3aflowers 3aodors 3apollen 3apollinators 3aseed set 3atrees1 aNIEMEYER, HERMANN M.0 tAustral ecology.g2006 Nov., v. 31, no. 7 p.897-903dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01662.x3electronic resource 7aarticle02276naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245011100149300001600260520103700276650001801313650002401331650002601355650001601381650001701397650002001414650002901434650002101463650003301484650003601517650002601553653002701579653002301606653003001629700001401659700001701673773007601690852001301766939003301779945000801812946001301820852000901833655001201842991584230140742620221119053216.0921105e199210  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920033642DNAL7 a14367682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTobin, D.S.10aCooperative relationships between professional societies and the food industry: opportunities or problems?  ap. 300-304.  aA variety of cooperative relationships may potentially exist between professional or voluntary organizations and food companies: endorsements of food products, health messages, or educational and informational materials; certification of nutrient components of food products that meet a certain standard of a society; and acceptance of food advertising in society publications and the display of food products at society meetings.

Alpine vegetation patterns are influenced by the duration of snow cover including the presence of snowdrifts in summer, but there is little quantitative information on landscape-scale relationships between vegetation patterns and the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer snowdrifts in the Australian alps. We mapped annual changes in summer snowdrifts in the Kosciuszko alpine region, Australia, from Landsat TM images and modelled the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer snowdrifts from long-term records (1954-2003) of winter snow depth. We then compared vegetation composition and structure among four classes that differed in the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer snowdrifts. We found a curvilinear relationship between annual winter snow depth and the area occupied by persistent snowdrifts in the following summer (r2 = 0.9756). Only 21 ha (0.42% of study area) was predicted to have supported summer snowdrifts in 80% of the past 50 years, while 440 ha supported persistent summer snow in 10% of years. Mean cover and species richness of vascular plants declined significantly, and species composition varied significantly, as the frequency of summer snow persistence increased. Cushion plants and rushes were most abundant where summer snowdrifts occurred most frequently, and shrubs, grasses and sedges were most abundant in areas that did not support snowdrifts in summer. The results demonstrate strong regional relationships between vegetation composition and structure and the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer snowdrifts. Reductions in winter snow depth due to global warming are expected to lead to substantial reductions in the extent of persistent summer snowdrifts. As a consequence, shrubs, grasses and sedges are predicted to expand at the expense of cushion plants and rushes, reducing landscape vegetation diversity. Fortunately, few vascular plant species (e.g. Ranunculus niphophilus) appear to be totally restricted to areas where summer snow occurs most frequently.

The labor shortage has potential for retarding the long-term growth of the foodservice industry. However, recruitment and retention of older workers could be a factor in controlling the problem. Therefore, the major purpose of this research was to obtain information from current older foodservice employees to permit the determination of how various aspects of their jobs affect job satisfaction and organizational commitment and, thus, intention to remain on the job by delaying retirement. Non-management-level hospital and college/ university foodservice workers aged 55 years and older (no.=243) were surveyed. Hospital employees were selected from corporate rosters provided by a major contract foodservice company. College and university employees were selected from the roster of the National Association of College and University Food Services (NACUFS). No statistically meaningful relationship (r greater than or equal to .30) between work satisfaction (measured by the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire) and organizational commitment (measured by the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire), as correlated with retirement intention, was found. Although not considered meaningful, a slight statistical relationship was found (r=.15, p<.02) between intrinsic satisfaction and the desire to delay retirement (work intention). 3aelderly 3aemployment opportunities 3ahospital food service 3asurveys 3alabor 3acollege food service 2aAged 2aAttitude 2aFemale 2aFood Service, Hospital 2aFood Services 2aHumans 2aJob Satisfaction 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aResearch Design 2aRetirement 0afood service 0aaging 0aattitudes to work 0awork satisfaction 0aretirement1 aOlsen, M.D.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1988 Aug., v. 88, no. 8 p.921-927x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245012800145300001800273500001500291520180900306650001302115650001202128650002202140650003502162650001402197650001802211650001802229650001402247650001402261650001202275650002002287650001802307650002502325650002302350650002302373650002702396650001102423650004702434650002502481650003202506650002702538650002702565650003002592650003202622653001602654653001002670700001502680700001902695700001602714773008602730852000902816939003302825946001302858655001202871IND9201676820221119053234.0920327e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920167682DNAL7 a16578522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeshin, L.S.14aThe bovine preoptic area and median eminence: sites of opioid inhibition of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone secretion  ap. 3733-3746.  a2019-12-04  aAutoradiography was used to quantify opioid receptors in the median eminence (ME) and preoptic area (POA) of the brain of eight heifers, and in vitro perifusion of ME and POA tissue from seven cows and heifers was used to examine the release of LHRH after administration of naloxone (NAL). For quantitative receptor autoradiography, [3H]NAL was used as the radioligand and NAL or morphine as competitors. Specific binding of [3H]NAL in POA and ME resulted in linear Scatchard plots with similar equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd = 4.2 +/- 1.1 nM) and mean binding site densities in the POA and ME (POA: 80.3 +/- 5.8; ME 67.5 +/- 8.0 fmol/mm2). There were no differences between mean binding site densities of zonas externa and interna of the ME; however, between various regions of the POA within individual animals, binding site densities varied threefold (47.6 to 165.1 fmol/mm2). During in vitro perifusions of isolated POA and ME, basal LHRH secretion from ME decreased (P < .001) from 15.9 +/- 1.8 to 7.3 +/- .8 pg/10 min fraction (500 microliters) but remained constant for POA (3.1 +/-.4 pg/fraction). Injections of medium alone did not affect LHRH secretion. Although there was no significant dose (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) effect, NAL increased (P < .05) LHRH efflux from the ME and POA when administered at 110 min from the initiation of perifusion and again at 200 min for ME but not for POA. All tissues responded to KCl (30 mM) administered at 290 min of perifusion with increased (P < .001) LHRH efflux. Both immunoreactive-LHRH and immunoreactive-beta-endorphin were immunocytochemically localized in neurons from some of these perifused tissues. We suggest that endogenous opioids suppress LHRH secretion by actions on specific opioid receptors located within the POA and ME of the brain. 3analoxone 3aheifers 3ahormone secretion 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ahistology 3apreoptic area 3abinding sites 3anarcotics 3areceptors 2aAnimals 2aAutoradiography 2aBinding Sites 2aBinding, Competitive 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCulture Techniques 2aEndorphinsxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGonadotropin-Releasing Hormonexsecretion. 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMedian Eminencexphysiology 2aMorphinexpharmacology 2aNaloxonexpharmacology 2aPreoptic Areaxphysiology 2aReceptors, Opioidxanalysis 0asuppression 0abrain1 aRund, L.A.1 aKraeling, R.R.1 aKiser, T.E.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 Sept., v. 69, no. 9 p.3733-3746x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03557naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002500128245011900153300001800272500001500290520197200305650002002277650001802297650001302315650001002328650001502338650001202353650001502365650001702380650001002397650003402407650001202441650003302453650002002486650002602506650003902532650002202571650002402593650004202617650002402659650006702683653001502750653001602765653002102781700001602802700001702818700001302835700001402848773008602862852000902948939003302957946001302990655001203003IND9201676320221119053042.0920326e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920167632DNAL7 a17189342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeunier-Salaun, M.C.10aImpact of dietary tryptophan and behavioral type on behavior, plasma cortisol, and brain metabolites of young pigs  ap. 3689-3698.  a2019-12-04  aThe behavioral reactivity in an "open-field" test and plasma cortisol levels were studied in 72 pigs from 12 litters fed for 3 wk one of three diets with different levels of tryptophan: deficient (.14%), adequate (.23%), or excess (.32%). "Open-field" tests were performed three times: 5 d (day W + 5), 23 d (day W + 23) and 45 d (day W + 45) after weaning. The exploration time and the number of grunts provided an adequate measure of the individual emotional reactivity at day W + 5. Significant correlations were obtained between exploration time and the number of grunts at each time (r = -.83 at day W + 5; r = -.46 at day W + 23; r = -.71 at day W + 45). The distinction between animals remained (P < .05) in terms of exploration time at both 23 and 45 d after weaning. At day W + 23, exploration time was lower in the group fed the adequate diet than in the two other groups. This effect was maintained subsequently after feeding all pigs the same adequate diet (day W + 45). In 36 pigs slaughtered at day W + 23, brain TRP concentration was higher with the excess dietary TRP than with deficient or adequate levels. Conversely, other plasma amino acids (particularly threonine) accumulated only in the brains of pigs fed the deficient diet. Plasma cortisol level assayed at weaning (W) and 2 wk later increased with age and was higher in 16-h fasted (day W + 15) than in 3-h fasted (day W + 17) pigs. Correlations were observed within litters in the fasting state, between the cortisol level and behavioral traits measured at day W + 23 (r = .70 for number of grunts, r = -.60 for exploration time). Dietary TRP did not affect the plasma cortisol level irrespective of the nutritional state after weaning. However, an interaction was noted between plasma cortisol and TRP status (P < .05). Although dietary TRP induced large variations in brain amino acids and 5-hydoxyindole concentrations, changes in behavioral and cortisol responses were relatively minor. 3aanimal behavior 3adose response 3acortisol 3abrain 3atryptophan 3afasting 3aHaemulidae 3ablood plasma 3aswine 2aAmino Acidsxanalysisxblood. 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aBrain Chemistry 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aHydroxyindoleacetic Acidxanalysis 2aIndolesxanalysis 2aSerotoninxanalysis 2aSwinexbloodxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aThreoninexanalysis 2aTryptophanxadministration & dosagexdeficiencyxpharmacology. 0areactivity 0aamino acids 0aexploration time1 aMonnier, M.1 aColleaux, Y.1 aSeve, B.1 aHenry, Y.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 Sept., v. 69, no. 9 p.3689-3698x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02484naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001500181245011900196300001800315500002400333506007600357520099700433506003701430650003001467650001301497650002101510650001701531650001501548650001001563650001001573650002001583650001101603650001201614650002601626650001401652650001401666650001401680650002501694650001201719700002501731700002201756773013501778852000901913856008001922655001202002IND4434621620221207063612.0100326e20100401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443462162DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00026-102doi7 aPMC28492522pmcid7 a201393112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehar, Adi10aRickettsia felis Infection in a Common Household Insect Pest, Liposcelis bostrychophila (Psocoptera: Liposcelidae)  ap. 2280-2285.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany species of Rickettsia are well-known mammalian pathogens transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods. However, molecular surveys are continually uncovering novel Rickettsia species, often in unexpected hosts, including many arthropods that do not feed on blood. This study reports a systematic molecular characterization of a Rickettsia infecting the psocid Liposcelis bostrychophila (Psocoptera: Liposcelidae), a common and cosmopolitan household pest. Surprisingly, the psocid Rickettsia is shown to be Rickettsia felis, a human pathogen transmitted by fleas that causes serious morbidity and occasional mortality. The plasmid from the psocid R. felis was sequenced and was found to be virtually identical to the one in R. felis from fleas. As Liposcelis insects are often intimately associated with humans and other vertebrates, it is speculated that they acquired R. felis from fleas. Whether the R. felis in psocids causes disease in vertebrates is not known and warrants further study.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLiposcelis bostrychophila 3aPsocidae 3aRickettsia felis 3aSiphonaptera 3aarthropods 3ablood 3ahosts 3ahousehold pests 3ahumans 3ainsects 3amolecular systematics 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apathogens 3arickettsial diseases 3asurveys1 aMcCormick, Laurie J.1 aPerlman, Steve J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 Apr. 1, v. 76, no. 7 p.2280-2285dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00026-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03558naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002800184245013500212300002000347506007600367520164900443506003702092650001502129650002502144650001002169650001002179650001702189650001402206650001802220650001002238650000902248650001102257650001202268650001802280650001102298650000902309650002502318650001102343650001302354650001102367650002202378700002802400700001802428700002302446700002302469700002302492700002402515700002002539700001602559700002302575700002002598773017602618852000902794856008302803930003302886946001302919655001202932IND4425318420221207063613.0090828e20090825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442531842DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09058401062doi7 aPMC27328382pmcid7 a197065292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanhoutteghem, Amandine10aBasonuclin 2 has a function in the multiplication of embryonic craniofacial mesenchymal cells and is orthologous to disco proteins  ap. 14432-14437.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBasonuclin 2 is a recently discovered zinc finger protein of unknown function. Its paralog, basonuclin 1, is associated with the ability of keratinocytes to multiply. The basonuclin zinc fingers are closely related to those of the Drosophila proteins disco and discorelated, but the relation between disco proteins and basonuclins has remained elusive because the function of the disco proteins in larval head development seems to have no relation to that of basonuclin 1 and because the amino acid sequence of disco, apart from the zinc fingers, also has no similarity to that of the basonuclins. We have generated mice lacking basonuclin 2. These mice die within 24 h of birth with a cleft palate and abnormalities of craniofacial bones and tongue. In the embryonic head, expression of the basonuclin 2 gene is restricted to mesenchymal cells in the palate, at the periphery of the tongue, and in the mesenchymal sheaths that surround the brain and the osteocartilagineous structures. In late embryos, the rate of multiplication of these mesenchymal cells is greatly diminished. Therefore, basonuclin 2 is essential for the multiplication of craniofacial mesenchymal cells during embryogenesis. Non-Drosophila insect databases available since 2008 reveal that the basonuclins and the disco proteins share much more extensive sequence and gene structure similarity than noted when only Drosophila sequences were examined. We conclude that basonuclin 2 is both structurally and functionally the vertebrate ortholog of the disco proteins. We also note the possibility that some human craniofacial abnormalities are due to a lack of basonuclin 2.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aamino acid sequences 3abones 3abrain 3acleft palate 3adatabases 3aembryogenesis 3agenes 3ahead 3ahumans 3ainsects 3akeratinocytes 3alarvae 3amice 3anucleotide sequences 3apalate 3aproteins 3atongue 3azinc finger motif1 aMaciejewski-Duval, Anna1 aBouche, Cyril1 aDelhomme, Brigitte1 aHervé, Françoise1 aDaubigney, Fabrice1 aSoubigou, Guillaume1 aAraki, Masatake1 aAraki, Kimi1 aYamamura, Ken-ichi1 aDjian, Philippe0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Aug. 25, v. 106, no. 34 p.14432-14437dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09058401063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090829b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04458naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190100002100199245011700220300001600337500002400353500001500377520197000392650001802362650002302380650001102403650002802414650001702442650001602459650002302475650001402498650001702512650001902529650001502548650002402563650002702587650001402614650002102628650002302649650001202672650002802684650002802712650002202740650003202762650003302794650002202827650004902849650001102898650008102909650004502990650003203035650001503067650001503082650002903097650001403126651001003140651002503150653002803175653002703203653001603230700002103246700001803267700002103285700002203306700001903328773012203347852000903469856009303478930003303571945002503604946001103629655001203640IND4415911720221119053058.0090206e20090215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441591172DNAL7 a191006432pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2008.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ202 0aQ205 0aQ5061 aMeloni, Domenico10aListeria monocytogenes in RTE foods marketed in Italy: Prevalence and automated EcoRI ribotyping of the isolates  ap. 166-173.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aims of the present study were: (a) to investigate the prevalence and the enumeration of Listeria monocytogenes in 200 samples of ready to eat (RTE) foods of animal and vegetal origin collected from different outlets and processing plants in Sardinia; (b) to characterize the isolates by phenotypical and molecular methods; (c) to analyze a subset of 42 L. monocytogenes by automated EcoRI ribotyping in order to predict the strain's potential virulence for humans. The strains were isolated from: smoked fish products, cooked marinated products, meat products and pre-packaged mixed vegetable salads. Of the samples tested, 22% were positive for Listeria spp. The prevalence of L. monocytogenes was 9.5%, while the level of L. monocytogenes in the positive samples was <10 cfu/g in 94.7% of cases. EcoRI ribotyping differentiated the isolates into 16 distinct ribotypes (similarity>93%), belonging to 17 different DuPont Identification Library Codes (DUP-IDs) clones. The Simpson's numerical index of discrimination was 0.911. Cluster analysis pointed out a high similarity among strains isolated from meat, fish, and vegetables of different origin. These results confirmed the existence of a widespread population of L. monocytogenes, characterized by highly related strains existing in different geographical areas. 65% of these strains belonged to lineage II (serotypes 1/2a and 1/2c), subtypes known to be associated with sporadic human listeriosis outbreaks. The remaining 35% of the isolates (serotypes 1/2b, 3b and 4b) were allocated to lineage I and belong to distinct clonal groups (DUP-ID 1038 and 1042), which again have been associated with several outbreaks of human listeriosis. Neither atypical profiles nor lineage III strains were found. EcoRI ribotyping was confirmed as a rapid and reliable method for L. monocytogenes typing, providing useful data for epidemiologic and clonality surveys of L. monocytogenes strains isolated from RTE foods. 3ameat products 3avegetable products 3asalads 3abacterial contamination 3acooked foods 3asmoked fish 3afood contamination 3aribotypes 3ahuman health 3afood pathogens 3amarinating 3amicrobial detection 3aListeria monocytogenes 3avirulence 3aretail marketing 3aready-to-eat foods 2aAnimals 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aFish Productsxmicrobiology 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aGastroenteritisxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aHumans 2aListeria monocytogenesxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aListeriosisxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aPrevalence 2aRibotyping 2aVegetablesxmicrobiology 2aVirulence 3aItaly 0aItalyxepidemiology. 0amolecular sequence data 0acooked marinated foods 0afood safety1 aGalluzzo, Pietro1 aMureddu, Anna1 aPiras, Francesca1 aGriffiths, Mansel1 aMazzette, Rina0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2009 Feb. 15, v. 129, no. 2 p.166-173dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2008.11.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20110616b20110701c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/02/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03267naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245008500201300002000286506007600306520153000382506003701912650001301949650001601962650001301978650001201991650000902003650001602012650003102028650002302059650000902082650001802091700001602109700002402125700002102149700001902170700001902189700001902208700002202227700002102249700001802270700001702288700001802305700002602323700001902349700001902368773017602387852000902563856008302572930003302655946001302688655001202701IND4425319920221207071839.0090828e20090825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442531992DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09034581062doi7 aPMC27268622pmcid7 a197065382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrgic, Ivica10aRenal fibrosis is attenuated by targeted disruption of KCa3.1 potassium channels  ap. 14518-14523.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProliferation of interstitial fibroblasts is a hallmark of progressive renal fibrosis commonly resulting in chronic kidney failure. The intermediate-conductance Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channel (KCa3.1) has been proposed to promote mitogenesis in several cell types and contribute to disease states characterized by excessive proliferation. Here, we hypothesized that KCa3.1 activity is pivotal for renal fibroblast proliferation and that deficiency or pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 suppresses development of renal fibrosis. We found that mitogenic stimulation up-regulated KCa3.1 in murine renal fibroblasts via a MEK-dependent mechanism and that selective blockade of KCa3.1 functions potently inhibited fibroblast proliferation by G₀/G₁ arrest. Renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in mice was paralleled by a robust up-regulation of KCa3.1 in affected kidneys. Mice lacking KCa3.1 (KCa3.1⁻/⁻) showed a significant reduction in fibrotic marker expression, chronic tubulointerstitial damage, collagen deposition and αSMA⁺ cells in kidneys after UUO, whereas functional renal parenchyma was better preserved. Pharmacological treatment with the selective KCa3.1 blocker TRAM-34 similarly attenuated progression of UUO-induced renal fibrosis in wild-type mice and rats. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that KCa3.1 is involved in renal fibroblast proliferation and fibrogenesis and suggest that KCa3.1 may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of fibrotic kidney disease.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acollagen 3afibroblasts 3afibrosis 3akidneys 3amice 3amitogenesis 3aparenchyma (animal tissue) 3apotassium channels 3arats 3arenal failure1 aKiss, Éva.1 aKaistha, Brajesh P.1 aBusch, Christoph1 aKloss, Michael1 aSautter, Julia1 aMüller, Anja.1 aKaistha, Anuradha1 aSchmidt, Claudia1 aRaman, Girija1 aWulff, Heike1 aStrutz, Frank1 aGröne, Hermann-Josef1 aKöhler, Ralf.1 aHoyer, Joachim0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Aug. 25, v. 106, no. 34 p.14518-14523dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09034581063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090829b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03498naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245011600191300001400307500002400321520167400345650002602019650002702045650001102072650001302083650001202096650001002108650001302118650001502131650002602146650002602172650001502198650001402213650003202227650004302259650003502302650005002337650007302387650003902460650003502499650004402534650007902578650002902657650002802686650003602714700001802750700001602768773010802784852000902892856005502901655001202956IND4448028920221119053059.0110125e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444802892DNAL7 a206496462pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02308.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jin Hyung.10a3-Indolylacetonitrile Decreases Escherichia coli O157:H7 Biofilm Formation and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence  ap. 62-73.  aIncludes references  aIntercellular signal indole and its derivative hydroxyindoles inhibit Escherichia coli biofilm and diminish Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence. However, indole and bacterial indole derivatives are unstable in the microbial community because they are quickly degraded by diverse bacterial oxygenases. Hence, this work sought to identify novel, non-toxic, stable and potent indole derivatives from plant sources for inhibiting the biofilm formation of E. coli O157:H7 and P. aeruginosa. Here, plant auxin 3-indolylacetonitrile (IAN) was found to inhibit the biofilm formation of both E. coli O157:H7 and P. aeruginosa without affecting its growth. IAN more effectively inhibited biofilms than indole for the two pathogenic bacteria. Additionally, IAN decreased the production of virulence factors including 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone (PQS), pyocyanin and pyoverdine in P. aeruginosa. DNA microarray analysis indicated that IAN repressed genes involved in curli formation and glycerol metabolism, whereas IAN induced indole-related genes and prophage genes in E. coli O157:H7. It appeared that IAN inhibited the biofilm formation of E. coli by reducing curli formation and inducing indole production. Also, corroborating phenotypic results of P. aeruginosa, whole-transcriptomic data showed that IAN repressed virulence-related genes and motility-related genes, while IAN induced several small molecule transport genes. Furthermore, unlike bacterial indole derivatives, plant-originated IAN was stable in the presence of either E. coli or P. aeruginosa. Additionally, indole-3-carboxyaldehyde was another natural biofilm inhibitor for both E. coli and P. aeruginosa. 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aauxins 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3agenes 3aglycerol 3ametabolism 3amicroarray technology 3amicrobial communities 3aoxygenases 3avirulence 2aAcetonitrilesxpharmacology 2aAdhesins, Escherichia colixmetabolism 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aBiofilmsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aEscherichia coli O157xdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aIndolesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aRNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aVirulencexdrug effects 2aVirulence Factorsxbiosynthesis1 aCho, Moo Hwan1 aLee, Jintae0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2011 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.62-73dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02308.x 7aarticle02874naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245008100146300001800227500001500245520164000260650001801900650002001918650001601938650001901954650000901973650002101982650001602003650001202019650001302031650002102044650001102065650001402076650004302090650001202133650002602145653001602171653002502187700001602212700001602228700001902244773008602263852000902349939003302358946001302391655001202404IND9201674420221119051738.0920326e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920167442DNAL7 a19386352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShurson, G.C.10aTraits affecting postweaning weight gain and feed intake of primiparous sows  ap. 3487-3493.  a2019-12-04  aSeventy-six primiparous Duroc and Landrace sows from two genetic lines with or without selection for improved sow productivity were used to identify sow traits that affect postweaning gain (positive or negative) and feed intake. Sows lost weight (P < .01) and consumed less feed (P < .01) during wk 1 postweaning (37 d) compared with wk 2, 3, and 4. Sows gained more weight during wk 2 and 3 (P < .01) than during wk 4. Weekly feed consumption was similar during wk 2 and 4 and highest during wk 3 (P < .05). Sow weight gain postweaning was predicted by sow weaning weight (P < .01) and adjusted 21-d litter weight (P < .05) during wk 1, wk 1 to 2, and wk 1 to 4 feeding periods. Feed consumption was best predicted by adjusted litter weaning weight (P < .01), sow weaning weight (P < .01), average backfat at farrowing (P < .01), average backfat change (P < .05), and adjusted 21-d litter weight (P < .05). Feed intake was positively correlated (P < .01; r = .77) and sow weight at breeding, farrowing, and weaning was negatively correlated (P < .05; r = -.23, -.21, and -.26, respectively) with sow weight gain. Average backfat at weaning was negatively correlated (P < .05) with gain and feed intake during each period. Adjusted 21-d litter weight and adjusted litter weaning weight were positively correlated with postweaning feed intake (P < .05; r = .22 and .23, respectively). These results suggest that sows that weigh less at weaning, wean heavier litters, or lose more backfat during lactation gain more weight and consume more feed postweaning than sows that are less productive, weigh more at weaning, or have more backfat. 3alitter weight 3aliveweight gain 3afeed intake 3aweaning weight 3asows 3aline differences 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aEatingxgenetics 2aFemale 2aPregnancy 2aSwinexgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aWeaning 2aWeight Gainxgenetics 0abody weight 0apostweaning interval1 aIsler, G.A.1 aIrvin, K.M.1 aPeterson, G.A.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 Sept., v. 69, no. 9 p.3487-3493x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03038naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011700145300001800262520167500280650001201955650002201967650001401989650001602003650001302019650001602032650002002048650001502068650001902083650002502102650001202127650001302139650002102152650001102173650001102184650001702195650001602212650001102228650004502239650001202284650001202296650001602308653001102324653002502335700001902360773008602379852000902465939003302474946001302507655001202520IND9201674520221119053321.0920326e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920167452DNAL7 a19386362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzimba, C.E.10aComparison of rabbit breed types for postweaning litter growth, feed efficiency, and survival performance traits  ap. 3494-3500.  aPostweaning data on 643 rabbits from 122 litters representing four breed types, New Zealand White (NZW) and Californian (CAL) purebreds, CAL X NZW (CXN), and Flemish Giant (FG) crossbreds (the latter group was a collection of FG X CAL, FG X Champagne D'Argent [CHA], and 1/2 FG X 1/4 CAL X 1/4 CHA), were gathered over five seasons and compared for growth, feed efficiency, and survival-related performance traits. Evaluation criteria included litter size and weight at weaning (28 d); 28- to 70-d fitter feed intake, weight gain, feed efficiency, and mortality rate; and litter and average market weight (70 d). The least squares model included main effects of breed type, season of birth of the litter and parity of dam, litter size at weaning as a linear covariate, and the random error. Breed-type differences were not detected for litter size and weight at weaning and feed efficiency. Purebred NZW and CAL litter trait performances were comparable (P > .05). Purebred NZW litters consumed less feed than CXN and FG crosses, gained weight less rapidly than FG crosses, and weighed less per fryer at 70 d than CXN and FG crosses (P < .05). Feed intake was lower and average market weight was lighter for CAL purebred litters than for CXN and FG crossbred litters (P < .05). The CXN and FG crossbreds only differed (P < .05) for average market weight (2,078 vs 2,192 g). Mortality rate was lower (P < .05) in CXN crossbred litters than in CAL purebred litters. Results of this study provide corroborative evidence in support of terminal crossbreeding using CAL sires mated to NZW dams or FG purebred or crossbred sires mated to CAL and CHA purebred or crossbred dams. 3arabbits 3abreed differences 3amortality 3afeed intake 3acrossing 3alitter size 3afeed conversion 3acrossbreds 3aweaning weight 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aEating 2aFemale 2aHybrid Vigor 2aLitter Size 2aParity 2aRabbitsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSeasons 2aWeaning 2aWeight Gain 0agrowth 0apostweaning interval1 aLukefahr, S.D.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 Sept., v. 69, no. 9 p.3494-3500x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02509naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245012100124300001600245520139100261650002201652650002401674650002101698650001601719650002001735650001501755650001301770650001501783650001401798650001201812650002301824650002101847653001801868653000901886700001601895700001601911773010401927852000902031930003302040945001302073946001302086655001202099IND2321699420221119051733.0010623s2001    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232169942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEymar, E.10aFoliar nutrient reference levels obtained in hydroponic cultures as preliminary norms for DRIS to fertigate conifers  ap. 267-282.  aPreliminary norms for foliar tissue were developed for Cupressus glabra grown on a sand culture for use in the diagnosis and recommendation integrated system (DRIS). These norms were generated from macronutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) of high-quality plants growing in hydroponics cultures in controlled conditions. The values were those of foliar tissues from three periods of the growing cycle (July, September, and November). These norms were applied to perform DRIS in plants growing in five artificial potting mixes with different physico-chemical properties. The results show that hydroponics are a good system to obtain nutrient reference levels at a lower analytical cost than that of a survey for its use in DRIS. DRIS indices obtained by using hydroponic norms are much higher than those obtained for other crops by using survey norms, due to luxury consumption of some nutrients with the hydroponic system. The physico-chemical properties of the potting mixes have a great influence by changing significant nutrient concentrations in tissues and consequently diagnosis and interpretation. DRIS is able to detect nutrient imbalances caused by the own composition of the substrate (i.e., K and Ca limitation in substrates with sepiolite-release Mg-in their composition, or P limitation in substrates with high pH and Ca). 3adisease diagnosis 3aCupressus arizonica 3anutrient content 3ahydroponics 3adecision making 3aguidelines 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3acalcium 3aseasonal variation 3anutrient balance 0agrowth period 0adris1 aCadahia, C.1 aSanchez, A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2001, v. 32, no. 1/2 p.267-282x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02491naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245010700153300001800260500002400278520123600302650001901538650002001557650001901577650001301596650001601609650001501625650001601640650001101656650004301667650001201710650001301722650002201735650001701757650001401774650001801788651001601806700002001822700002401842773010501866852000901971856007701980655001202057IND4464216320221119051608.0121001s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446421632DNAL7 a10.1021/jf02607472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haibo10aCharacterization of Anthocyanins in Grape Juices by Ion Trap Liquid Chromatography−Mass Spectrometry  ap. 1839-1844.  aIncludes references  aA reverse phase HPLC and electrospray interface with ion trap mass spectrometer method was developed for the characterization of anthocyanins in Concord, Rubired, and Salvador grape juices. Rubired and Salvador grapes are hybrids from Vitis vinifera and Vitis rupestris. Concord grape is a grape from the native American cultivar Vitis labrusca. Individual anthocyanins in these three varieties were identified on the basis of UV−vis and MS spectra and further elucidated by MS/MS spectra. Anthocyanins in Salvador and Concord grapes were 3-O-glucosides, 3-O-(6‘ ‘-O-p-coumaroyl)glucosides, 3-O-(6‘ ‘-O-p-acetyl)glucosides, 3,5-O-diglucosides, and 3-O-(6‘ ‘-O-p-coumaroyl)-5-O-diglucosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin. Vitisin B was detected in Salvador grape juice. Anthocyanins in Rubired grape juice were primarily anthocyanin diglucosides: peonidin 3,5-O-diglucoside, malvidin 3,5-O-diglucoside, peonidin 3-O-(6‘ ‘-O-p-coumaroyl)-5-O-diglucoside, and malvidin 3-O-(6‘ ‘-O-p-coumaroyl)-5-O-diglucoside are the four major anthocyanins. The presence of pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside, not previously reported, has been established for the first time in all three juices. 3aVitis labrusca 3aVitis rupestris 3aVitis vinifera 3acyanidin 3adelphinidin 3aglucosides 3agrape juice 3agrapes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahybrids 3amalvidin 3amass spectrometry 3apelargonidin 3apetunidin 3aspectrometers 3aEl Salvador1 aRace, Edward J.1 aShrikhande, Anil J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 Mar. 26, v. 51, no. 7 p.1839-1844x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf02607473Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03285naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001400195245015100209300001600360500002400376520156100400650002701961650001501988650001202003650000902015650001702024650002002041650002202061650002002083650001302103650001502116650001102131650004102142650003202183650003602215650002102251650004302272650001702315650006002332650003802392700001702430700002002447773009702467852000902564856008902573930003302662945002502695946001102720655001202731IND4415907020221119051606.0090206e20090219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441590702DNAL7 a191006322pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF841 0aM0011 aZeng, Jin10aCadmium and zinc uptake and toxicity in two strains of Microcystis aeruginosa predicted by metal free ion activity and intracellular concentration  ap. 212-220.  aIncludes references  aMicrocystis aeruginosa is an important cyanobacteria widely found in numerous freshwater lakes. In this study, we examined the uptake and toxic effects of cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) in non-toxic (Ma 469) and toxic (Ma 905) strains of Microcystis based on the metal free ion and cellular concentrations. We compared their uptake rates, pulse-amplitude-modulated parameters (maximum photosystem II quantum yield and operational quantum yield), cell-specific growth rates, and intracellular metal concentrations at different free Cd or Zn ion concentrations. Both strains exhibited a first-order uptake kinetics during the short-term (4h) uptake experiment no matter whether ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) was added. The free ion activity model (FIAM) explained the short-term uptake of Cd or Zn, but failed to predict the long-term (48h) toxicity of Cd or Zn in the two strains. In contrast, the intracellular Cd or Zn concentration was more effective in explaining Cd or Zn toxicity in the two strains, indicating that the biotic ligand model (BLM) may be used to predict Cd or Zn toxicity in M. aeruginosa. Furthermore, the two strains exhibited similar sigmoid relationships between toxicity effects and intracellular Zn concentrations, but the Ma 905 was more tolerant of intracellular Cd toxicity than the Ma 469. Different Microcystis strains might have similar tolerance towards intracellular Zn toxicity. Our study provided important information for the assessment of metal toxicity in freshwater cyanobacteria. 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3amicroalgae 3acadmium 3azinc 3aheavy metals 3awater pollution 3auptake mechanisms 3abioaccumulation 3atoxicity 3aprediction 3amodels 2aCadmiumxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aIntracellular Spacexmetabolism 2aIonsxmetabolism 2aMicrocystisxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aZincxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity.1 aYang, Liuyan1 aWang, Wen-Xiong0 tAquatic toxicology.g2009 Feb. 19, v. 91, no. 3 p.212-220dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.11.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03533naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169072000900178100002300187245008100210300001600291500002400307500001500331520173200346650001702078650001202095650002502107650002102132650001002153650001702163650001602180650001902196650001802215650001102233650002002244650001702264650001802281650001802299650003702317650001502354650001302369650001402382650001702396650001802413650001602431653002102447700003602468700002402504700003102528700002802559700002402587773011502611852000902726856009102735930003302826945002502859946001102884655001202895IND4415906320221119051529.0090206e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441590632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2008.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF841 0aW000 0aF900 0aM0011 aPaiva, Luisa Brito10aEcophysiological responses of water hyacinth exposed to Cr³⁺ and Cr⁶⁺  ap. 403-409.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDue to its wide industrial use, chromium (Cr) is considered a serious environmental pollutant of aquatic bodies. In order to investigate the ecophysiological responses of water hyacinth [Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms] to Cr treatment, plants were exposed to 1 and 10mM Cr₂O₃ (Cr³⁺) and K₂Cr₂O₇ (Cr⁶⁺) concentrations for two or 4 days in a hydroponic system. Plants exposed to the higher concentration of Cr⁶⁺ for 4 days did not survive, whereas a 2 days treatment with 1mM Cr³⁺ apparently stimulated growth. Analysis of Cr uptake indicated that most of the Cr accumulated in the roots, but some was also translocated and accumulated in the leaves. However, in plants exposed to Cr⁶⁺ (1mM), a higher translocation of Cr from roots to shoots was observed. It is possible that the conversion from Cr⁶⁺ to Cr³⁺, which immobilizes Cr in roots, was not total due to the presence of Cr⁶⁺, causing deleterious effects on gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence and photosynthetic pigment contents. Chlorophyll a was more sensitive to Cr than chlorophyll b. Cr³⁺ was shown to be less toxic than Cr⁶⁺ and, in some cases even increased photosynthesis and chlorophyll content. This result indicated that the F v/F ₀ ratio was more effective than the F v/F m ratio in monitoring the development of stress by Cr⁶⁺. There was a linear relationship between qP and F v/F m. No statistical differences were observed in NPQ and chlorophyll a/b ratio, but there was a tendency to decrease these values with Cr exposure. This suggests that there were alterations in thylakoid stacking, which might explain the data obtained for gas exchanges and other chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters. 3agas exchange 3acations 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aapplication rate 3aroots 3afluorescence 3ahydroponics 3aphotosynthesis 3anoxious weeds 3aleaves 3awater pollution 3aplant growth 3aaquatic weeds 3aecotoxicology 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3apollutants 3achromium 3amortality 3aplant stress 3aphytotoxicity 3achlorophyll 0aplant physiology1 ade Oliveira, Jurandi Gonçalves1 aAzevedo, Ricardo A.1 aRibeiro, Douglas Rodrigues1 ada Silva, Marcelo Gomes1 aVitória, Angela P.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2009 Mar., v. 65, no. 2-3 p.403-409dElsevier Sciencex0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2008.11.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20090325b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03620naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100001200204245008500216300001600301500002400317520167000341650001402011650001602025650000902041650001802050650001802068650001902086650001402105650002502119650002002144650001202164650002802176650002402204650003702228650003402265650005002299650004002349650003702389650004602426650003102472650002202503650004102525650002602566700001602592700001302608700001202621700001602633700001702649700001702666700001102683773009702694852000902791856008902800930003302889945002502922946001102947655001202958IND4415907220221119051844.0090206e20090219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441590722DNAL7 a191103242pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL810 0aL600 0aM0011 aLi, Dan10aDevelopmental mechanisms of arsenite toxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos  ap. 229-237.  aIncludes references  aArsenic usually accumulates in soil, water and airborne particles, from which it is taken up by various organisms. Exposure to arsenic through food and drinking water is a major public health problem affecting some countries. At present there are limited laboratory data on the effects of arsenic exposure on early embryonic development and the mechanisms behind its toxicity. In this study, we used zebrafish as a model system to investigate the effects of arsenite on early development. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to a range of sodium arsenite concentrations (0-10.0mM) between 4 and 120h post-fertilization (hpf). Survival and early development of the embryos were not obviously influenced by arsenite concentrations below 0.5mM. However, embryos exposed to higher concentrations (0.5-10.0mM) displayed reduced survival and abnormal development including delayed hatching, retarded growth and changed morphology. Alterations in neural development included weak tactile responses to light (2.0-5.0mM, 30hpf), malformation of the spinal cord and disordered motor axon projections (2.0mM, 48hpf). Abnormal cardiac function was observed as bradycardia (0.5-2.0mM, 60hpf) and altered ventricular shape (2.0mM, 48hpf). Furthermore, altered cell proliferation (2.0mM, 24hpf) and apoptosis status (2.0mM, 24 and 48hpf), as well as abnormal genomic DNA methylation patterning (2.0mM, 24 and 48hpf) were detected in the arsenite-treated embryos. All of these indicate a possible relationship between arsenic exposure and developmental failure in early embryogenesis. Our studies suggest that the negative effects of arsenic on vertebrate embryogenesis are substantial. 3aarsenites 3aDanio rerio 3afish 3aanimal models 3aembryogenesis 3aembryotoxicity 3amortality 3aabnormal development 3aDNA methylation 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aArsenitesxtoxicity 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aDNA Methylationxdrug effects 2aEmbryo, Nonmammalianxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aEmbryonic Developmentxdrug effects 2aHeartxdrug effectsxembryology. 2aNervous Systemxdrug effectsxembryology. 2aSodium Compoundsxtoxicity 2aSurvival Analysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 2aZebrafishxembryology1 aLu, Cailing1 aWang, Ju1 aHu, Wei1 aCao, Zongfu1 aSun, Daguang1 aXia, Hongfei1 aMa, Xu0 tAquatic toxicology.g2009 Feb. 19, v. 91, no. 3 p.229-237dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.11.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090309b20090508c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03799naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100002100204245014300225300001600368500002400384500001500408520203500423650002002458650001802478650001902496650001902515650001702534650001902551650001102570650002302581650002102604650001902625650001202644650002602656650003202682650001202714650002302726650002102749650002602770650002102796650004102817653002202858653001302880700001902893700002102912773009702933852000903030856008903039930003303128945002503161946001103186655001203197IND4415907120221119051850.0090206e20090219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441590712DNAL7 a191113572pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP200 0aL810 0aM0011 aKozlova, Tatiana14aThe effect of water chemistry on the acute toxicity of nickel to the cladoceran Daphnia pulex and the development of a biotic ligand model  ap. 221-228.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of water chemistry parameters on the acute toxicity of waterborne Ni to Daphnia pulex in soft waters and using this information to develop a biotic ligand model. The effects of Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, pH (two differently buffered sets) and natural organic matter (NOM) from two sources were evaluated in standardized 48h acute toxicity tests. Increases in Ca²⁺ had a protective effect on Ni toxicity, suggesting that this ion competes with Ni at the site of biological uptake. Increased waterborne Mg²⁺ also reduced Ni toxicity, but to a lesser degree compared with Ca²⁺. EC50 values increased at higher pH when the organic buffer 3-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid was used to adjust test pH, however in tests series where pH was varied using HCO₃ ⁻ the results were equivocal. Other testing showed that Na, K and Cl did not influence the toxicity response of D. pulex to Ni. Complexation of Ni by NOM reduced toxicity but Nordic Reservoir NOM was much more protective compared to Suwannee River NOM. Geochemical modeling of organic matter complexation of Ni was done using the HydroQual Biotic Ligand Model (BLM ver. 2.3.3; research mode) and the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM ver 6.0). Results showed dramatic differences between the two models in dissolved organic matter complexation. Modelling of Ni geochemistry for test solutions other than those containing NOM showed consistent and minor differences between the WHAM and the BLM. The latter model was used to develop a comprehensive prediction model of Ni toxicity. log K values developed for competitive cationic effects showed that Ca and Mg have a much higher protective effect in soft water compared to models developed for Daphnia magna in hard water. The BLM developed for this species in soft water provided good predictions of toxicity across a wide range of Ni concentrations but also highlighted the need for an improved understanding of the effects of NOM and pH on Ni toxicity in soft waters. 3awater pollution 3aDaphnia pulex 3aacute toxicity 3aorganic matter 3aheavy metals 3awater hardness 3anickel 3aaquatic arthropods 3atoxicity testing 3ahydrochemistry 2aAnimals 2aDaphniaxdrug effects 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aLigands 2aModels, Biological 2aNickelxtoxicity 2aToxicity Tests, Acute 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0achemical elements 0aelements1 aWood, Chris M.1 aMcGeer, James C.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2009 Feb. 19, v. 91, no. 3 p.221-228dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.11.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090309b20090508c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02252naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005300126300001800179500001500197520111300212650002301325650002101348650002001369650002001389650002401409650002001433650001101453650001501464650001401479650001501493653002401508653002101532653001501553653002001568653001101588700002101599700002201620773010801642852000901750930003301759945001301792946001301805655001201818IND2322336420221119051916.0010801s2000    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232233642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWells, K.L.10aEffect of phosphite phosphorus on alfalfa growth  ap. 2707-2715.  a2019-12-05  aPhosphite (PO3(-3)-P) was compared to phosphate (PO4(-3)-P) at 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg P kg(-1)) in a P-deficient soil in a greenhouse pot study with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Alfalfa growth (g dry matter pot(-1)) and P accumulation (g P pot(-1)) were measured by clipping each pot 3 times on 30-day intervals. Although there was a significant (P less than or equal to .05) growth response to P during the first 30-day growth period, it was significantly less from PO3(-3) than from PO4(-3)-P at the 10, 20, and 40 mg kg(-1) rate. The growth response to P continued through the next 60 days with only the 40 mg kg(-1) PO3(-3)-P being significantly lower than PO4(-3)-P. During the first and second growth periods, there were no significant effects of PO3(-3)-P on total P uptake, as compared to PO4(-3)-P, except at 40 mg kg(-1). Tissue concentrations of PO3(-3)-P at 40 mg kg(-1) dropped successively from 150, to 50, to 10 ppm during the first, second, and third growth periods. This suggests that 40 mg kg(-1) of soil-applied PO3(-3)-P had largely oxidized to PO4(-3)-P by 90 days after application. 3atemporal variation 3anutrient content 3aMedicago sativa 3anutrient uptake 3achemical speciation 3aphosphoric acid 3aanions 3aphosphates 3aoxidation 3aphosphorus 0apot experimentation 0aphosphorous acid 0adry matter 0ainorganic acids 0agrowth1 aDollarhide, J.E.1 aMundell, R.E.

This investigation could lead to changes in facility design to better suit the biological needs of captive animals. The aim of this study was to investigate the specific effects of group size (GS), and enclosure size (ES) on the movement and use of space of captive animals. We used the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus) as our animal model. Eight groups of 40 male chickens were used for this study. Each group was temporarily divided into three GS (5, 10 and 20 birds) and tested in three different ES (5, 10 and 20m²). Locations of focal birds were collected through instantaneous scan sampling. From these we calculated net and total distance moved, mean, and maximum step-lengths, and sample angular dispersion of the path of movement. To calculate longer-term space use, three replications for each of three experimental GS were placed in nine 10m² enclosures for 1 week. Locations of focal birds in each group were collected by ad libitum scan sampling for 1h and data were used to calculate core areas by kernel estimates (freeware Octave). Our analyses showed that birds in larger ES of 20m² had longer net distances (P <0.001), and mean (P <0.001) and maximum step-length (P <0.0001) than individuals in 5 and 10m² enclosures. Total distance travelled was longer (P <0.05) in 20m² enclosures when compared to 5m². GS had fewer expected effects that were only reflected in longer net distances in GS 20 as compared with GS 5 (P <0.05). Core areas at 30th (0.16±0.01m²), 50th (0.43±0.02m²) and 90th (1.65±0.08m²) percentiles were similar across GS (P >0.05). These results support the idea that the amount of available space has far larger effects in the short-term movement patterns of the domestic fowl as compare to the minor GS effects. 3abroiler chickens 3alocomotion 3aanimal space requirements 3aarea 3aspatial distribution 3agroup size 3agroup effect 0achickens 0acore areas 0aanimal confinement 0aspace use1 aMiller, Curtis1 aChristman, Mary C.1 aEstevez, Inma0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2009 Feb., v. 117, no. 1-2 p.28-34dElsevier Sciencex0168-15917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2008.11.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090218b20090301c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/02/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02226naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013300126300001800259520118500277650001901462650002601481650003501507650001501542650001501557650001801572650002301590650002001613650001201633651001301645653001601658653001401674773010801688852000901796930003301805945001301838946001301851655001201864IND2322335520221119051521.0010801s2000    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232233552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIndiati, R.10aAddition of phosphorus to soils with low to medium phosphorus retention capacities.

In this research, soils with low to medium P retention capacity were equilibrated for 90 days with soluble P (KH2PO4) at rate of 100 mg P kg(-1) soil. After this period, soil samples both with and without the P addition were analyzed using six conventional methods: 1) Olsen, 2) Bray1, 3) Mehlich3, 4) Egner, 5) Houba, dilute CaCl2 solution, and 6) distilled water, and three "innovative" P-sink methodologies: 1) Fe oxide-coated paper strip, 2) anion exchange resin membrane, and 3) cation-anion exchange resin membrane. The soils without P addition had low levels of extracted P as determined by all nine procedures. Net increases in the amount of P extracted from the soils with added P ranged from 4.2 mg kg(-1) (CaCl2 extraction) to 57.6 mg kg(-1) (cation-anion resin membrane extraction). Relationships between change in extracted P and i) physical and chemical characteristics, and ii) soil P sorption properties are also presented and discussed. 3asoil fertility 3anutrient availability 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3aextraction 3aphosphorus 3asoil analysis 3aanalytical methods 3agrassland soils 3atesting 3aSardinia 0acomparisons 0aretention0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2000, v. 31, no. 15/16 p.2591-2606x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02543naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008400126300001800210520118600228650002201414650002101436650000901457650001101466650001401477650003501491650001201526650001601538650001101554650001901565650002101584650001501605650002101620650002001641650001101661650002601672650002801698650002601726650003601752650002201788653001301810653003101823700001901854773010801873852000901981930003301990945001302023946001302036655001202049IND2322335720221119051547.0010801s2000    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232233572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhurana, N.10aDeficiency of manganese is alleviated more by low zinc than low copper in wheat  ap. 2617-2625.  aWheat (Triticum aestivum L.) var.

The deficiency of Mn decreased the biomass, concentration of Mn, chlorophyll, sugars, Hill reaction activity, acid phosphatase activity, and increased that of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase. The magnitude of Mn deficiency effects was mitigated to variable extent when Mn was deficient along with deficient Cu and/or deficient Zn. The effects of either Cu or Zn deficiency viz., intensification of foliar symptoms, decrease in biomass, leaf Cu/Zn, seed yield and starch content were increased further in combined deficiency of Cu and Zn. The stimulation in acid phosphatase and decrease in the activity of polyphenol oxidase and carbonic anhydrase in Cu or Zn deficient leaves were further aggravated when both Cu and Zn were deficient together.

Our objective was to use this reaction to determine molybdenum (Mo) in Mehlich 1 (1:10) soil test extracts. A 350-nm wavelength and 10-minute reaction time were selected for the determination and absorbance was linear for 0.0 to 0.15 mg L(-1) Mo. Ten samples of a LEd-Iturama soil were extracted with Mehlich 1 and Mo determined. These extracts were also mixed and Mo determined on 10 aliquots of the mixture. Molybdenum concentration in the soil had a coefficient of variation (CV) of 23.5%, whereas that for the mixture was 3.95%. The low CV for the mixture indicates good precision for this method. The higher CV for the individual extracts indicates that most of the variation comes from the extraction phase of individual samples. To show the practical utility of the method, Mo maximum adsorption capacities (MoMAC) of 16 soils, primarily Oxisols, from Minas Gerais, Brazil were determined. The MoMAC varied from 0.15 to 2.02 mg g(-1) and there were good correlations between MoMAC and soil clay content as well as between MoMAC and soil organic carbon content. From our experience, use of the KI+H2O2 reaction is a practical method of determining Mo in Mehlich 1 soil test extracts. 3aspectroscopy 3amolybdenum 3asoil fertility 3asoil analysis 3apotassium iodide 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aOxisols 3aadsorption 3aextracts 3aBrazil 0amolydbenum maximum adsorption capacity1 aDallpai, D.L.1 aBraga, J.M.1 aAlvarez V, V.H.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2000, v. 31, no. 15/16 p.2671-2683x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02617naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245012200183300001400305500002400319520131600343650001101659650003701670650003301707650001401740650001301754650001001767650001201777650002601789650002201815650003801837650001401875650002301889650002401912651001101936651001001947651001101957700001601968700002101984773010902005852000902114856004802123655001202171IND4451588220221119051931.0110401e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445158822DNAL7 a211537542pmid7 a10.1007/s10493-010-9419-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChao, Li-lian.10aSpecies identification of Ixodes granulatus (Acari: Ixodidae) based on internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences  ap. 51-63.  aIncludes references  aTo investigate the genetic specificity of Ixodes granulatus ticks collected from Taiwan, the genetic identities and phylogenetic relationships were analyzed by comparing the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region obtained from 27 strains of ticks representing twelve species of Ixodes. Five major clades can be easily distinguished by neighbour-joining analysis and were congruent by maximum-parsimony method. All these I. granulatus ticks collected from Taiwan and Japan were genetically affiliated to a monophyletic group with highly homogeneous sequences (95.8-99.5% similarity), and can be discriminated from other species and subgenera of Ixodes ticks with a sequence divergence ranging from 13.6% to 62.9%. Moreover, interspecific analysis revealed that four distinct lineages are evident between Ixodes ticks, and all these I. granulatus ticks collected from Taiwan and Japan belong to the same lineage. Our results provide the first investigation on the genetic specificity of I. granulatus ticks, and demonstrate that all these I. granulatus ticks represent a unique lineage distinct from other species and subgenera of Ixodes ticks. The feasibility of ITS2-based genetic analysis for species-specific identification of I. granulatus ticks around East Asia was highly anticipated. 3aIxodes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3ataxonomy 3aticks 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacer 2aGenetic Variation 2aIxodesxclassificationxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Alignment 2aSpecies Specificity 3aTaiwan 0aJapan 0aTaiwan1 aWu, Wen-Jer1 aShih, Chien-Ming0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2011 May, v. 54, no. 1 p.51-63dSpringer Netherlandsx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-010-9419-z 7aarticle03879naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100001300204245013400217300001600351500002400367500001500391520194300406650001702349650001802366650001202384650002002396650002802416650002302444650002102467650001402488650002702502650002002529650002102549650001402570650002402584650002902608650001602637650003202653650006402685650003802749650004002787650004102827653001702868700001802885700001402903700002102917700002202938700001702960773009702977852000903074856008903083930003303172945002503205946001103230655001203241IND4415907620221119051923.0090206e20090219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441590762DNAL7 a191311202pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF840 0aF600 0aM0011 aHong, Yu10aGramine-induced growth inhibition, oxidative damage and antioxidant responses in freshwater cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa  ap. 262-269.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn recent years, the exploration and development of the effective methods of treatment and prevention to algal blooms, especially Microcystis aeruginosa blooms has been an important issue in the field of water environment protection. Allelochemicals (natural plant toxins) are considered promising sources of algicides to control algal blooms. The objective of this study is to determine the inhibitory effects and potential mechanisms of a well-known allelochemical gramine (N,N-dimethyl-3-amino-methylindole) on bloom-forming cyanobacterium M. aeruginosa. The results showed that this indole alkaloid effectively inhibited the growth of M. aeruginosa. The effective concentration causing a 50% inhibition at 3 d (EC₅₀, ₃ d) increased with the initial algal density (IAD) increasing. When IAD increased from 5x10⁴ to 5x10⁵ cellsmL⁻¹, the values of EC₅₀, ₃ d increased from 0.5 to 2.1mgL⁻¹. In the cells of M. aeruginosa, gramine caused an obvious increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The lipid-peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) increased significantly in gramine-treated cells. The effects of gramine on enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants were in different manners. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was decreased after gramine exposure. The catalase (CAT) activity was increased after 4h but decreased from 60h. Both the contents and the regeneration rates of ascorbic acid (AsA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were increased after 4h of exposure to gramine. However, only GSH content was still increased after 40h of exposure. These results suggested that the activation of antioxidants in M. aeruginosa played an important role to resist the stress from gramine at initial time, the inactivation of SOD is crucial to the growth inhibition of M. aeruginosa by gramine, and the phytotoxicity of gramine on M. aeruginosa may be due to oxidative damage via oxidation of ROS. 3aalgal blooms 3aphytotoxicity 3agramine 3aallelochemicals 3areactive oxygen species 3alipid peroxidation 3amicrobial growth 3aoxidation 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aenzyme activity 3aoxidative stress 3aalgicides 2aAlkaloidsxtoxicity 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aFresh Water 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aMicrocystisxchemistryxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aOxidation-Reductionxdrug effects 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0aantioxidants1 aHu, Hong-Ying1 aXie, Xing1 aSakoda, Akiyoshi1 aSagehashi, Masaki1 aLi, Fengmin.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2009 Feb. 19, v. 91, no. 3 p.262-269dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.11.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02066naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245010600167300001600273500002400289500001500313520096100328650001101289650000801300650001701308650001001325650001901335650002201354651001601376653001901392653001601411653001301427653002301440653002701463700002201490773011101512852000901623856004801632655001201680IND4398534820221119051639.0071209e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439853482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-007-9191-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAugust, Stella M.10aWater temperature and upstream migration of glass eels in New Zealand: implications of climate change  ap. 195-205.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aGlass eels migrating upstream in a New Zealand river showed a clear preference for water temperatures between 12 and 20°C, with an optimum of 16.5°C. Water temperatures <12°C and >22°C almost completely inhibited migration, which implies that warmer temperatures associated with global climate change might have a detrimental impact on glass eel recruitment in their current ranges. We established this by trapping glass eels of shortfin, Anguilla australis, and longfin, A. dieffenbachii, eels nightly from September to November. Eels caught in 2001 (50,287) outnumbered those caught in 2002 (19,954); shortfin glass eels dominated catches in both years, comprising 91-93% of the catch. Longfins were larger than shortfins, and size and pigmentation in both species increased as the seasons progressed. Temperatures within the migratory season in 2001 showed ~14-day intervals between maxima that appeared to be associated with the new and full moons. 3arivers 3aeel 3apigmentation 3aglass 3aclimate change 3awater temperature 3aNew Zealand 0aFreshwater eel 0arecruitment 0aInvasion 0aAnguilla australis 0aAnguilla dieffenbachii1 aHicks, Brendan J.0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2008 Feb., v. 81, no. 2 p.195-205dSpringer Netherlandsx0378-19097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-007-9191-z 7aarticle02459naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011300124300001600237520136800253650001901621650001901640650002101659650001901680650002601699650001301725650002201738650002801760650002101788653000901809653003701818700001601855700001601871700001401887773010401901852000902005930003302014945001302047946001302060655001202073IND2202949820221119051607.0000310s1999    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220294982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabib, L.10aRape response to a Syrian phosphate rock and its mixture with triple superphosphate on a limed alkaline soil  ap. 449-456.  aA greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the agronomic effectiveness of a Syrian phosphate rock (PR) and its mixture with triple superphosphate (TSP) (at a P ratio = 50:50) for rape (Brassica napus L.) grown on an alkaline soil (pH 7.72). The P rates applied were 0, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg P kg(-1) as TSP or Syrian phosphate rock. Lime was applied at rates of 10%, 20%, and 30% of CaCO(3) to evaluate rape response under alkaline and calcareous conditions. For the PR + TSP mixture, the same rates were used except for 12.5 mg P kg(-1) that was not included. The rape was grown to flowering stage for 85 days before harvest. The dry-matter yield obtained with each source was fitted to a semi-log response function that was used to assess the effectiveness of each P source under different liming conditions. The relative agronomic effectiveness (RAE) of PR and the mixture, PR + TSP, with respect to TSP was calculated as the ratio of the slopes of the response function. The results showed that the RAE values of Syrian PR were 55%, 42%, 26%, and 19% for soil treated with, 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% of CaCO(3), respectively. The corresponding RAE values of the PR + TSP mixture were 101%, 101%, 98%, and 97%, respectively. The results of P uptake by rape showed that the effectiveness followed the order of TSP greater than or equal to (PR + TSP) > PR. 3aBrassica napus 3aalkaline soils 3acalcareous soils 3arock phosphate 3atriple superphosphate 3amixtures 3acalcium carbonate 3adry matter accumulation 3aapplication rate 0alime 0arelative agronomic effectiveness1 aChien, S.H.1 aCarmona, G.1 aHenao, J.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1999, v. 30, no. 3/4 p.449-456x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle01724naa a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002000133245007400153300001600227520017000243650001400413650002700427650001800454650006400472650001000536650001600546650000900562650006500571650002900636650002000665650003400685650002600719650001100745650001100756650006100767650000900828650001600837650003500853651001300888651001300901653002500914700002100939700001900960700002300979773014101002852000901143939003301152945000801185946001301193655001201206991584203210742620221119051449.0830411e198209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830037252DNAL7 a62876562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuttijudata, P.12aA clinical study of cholangiocarcinoma caused cholestasis in Thailand  ap. 373-376.  acholangiocarcinoma-caused cholestasis, human, clinical study, closely associated with Opisthorchis viverrini and carcinogenic agents (nitrosamines) in food: Thailand 3aneoplasms 3aOpisthorchis viverrini 3abiliary tract 2aAdenoma, Bile Ductxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aBile Duct Neoplasmsxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aBile Ducts, Intrahepatic 2aCholangiography 2aCholelithiasisxcomplications 2aCholestasisxetiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLiver Neoplasmsxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOpisthorchiasisxcomplications 3aThailand 0aThailand 0aPathology, Trematoda1 aChiemchaisri, C.1 aPalavatana, C.1 aChurnratanakul, S.0 tSurgery gynecology & obstetrics.

Although these chemicals have been detected in environmental samples and human tissues, there is little information about human exposure to PBDEs through the diet. In the present study, we determined the concentrations of PBDEs in a number of food samples acquired in Catalonia (Spain) during 2000. The dietary intake of PBDEs was estimated for the general population living in this Spanish region. The highest PBDE concentrations were found in oils and fats, fish and shellfish, meat and meat products, and eggs, while the lowest levels corresponded to fruits, vegetables, and tubers. The dietary intake of PBDEs for an adult male was 97.3 ng/day (assuming not detected (ND) = 1/2 limit of detection (LOD)) or 81.9 ng/day (assuming ND = 0) The greatest contribution to these values corresponded to fish and shellfish, with approximately one-third of the total intake. TetraBDEs and pentaBDEs were the homologues showing the highest percentages of contribution to the sum of total PBDEs. The comparison of the current dietary intake with the suggested lowest observed adverse effect level value of 1 mg/kg/day for the most sensitive endpoints for toxic effects of PBDEs results in a safety factor over 5 orders of magnitude in relation to PBDE exposure from food. 3aadults 3adetection limit 3adiet 3aeggs 3afabrics 3afish 3aflame retardants 3afruits 3ahumans 3alipids 3ameat 3ano observed adverse effect level 3aoils 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolymers 3asafety factor 3ashellfish 3atubers 3avegetables 3aSpain1 aLlobet, J.M.1 aDomingo, J.L.1 aCorbella, J.1 aTeixido, A.1 aCasas de Puig, C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 May 7, v. 51, no. 10 p.3191-3195x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf03409163Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02003naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001900163245011000182300001600292500002400308500001500332520056700347650001300914650001900927650001200946650001700958650003600975650001901011650002101030650001701051650003201068653002301100653001401123653001101137700003101148700001901179700001401198700002201212700002201234773009001256852000901346856008501355930003301440945002501473946001101498655001201509IND4411308020221119051555.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441130802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-008-9674-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aNagai, Chifumi10aProduction of a new low-caffeine hybrid coffee and the biochemical mechanism of low caffeine accumulation  ap. 133-142.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe GCAs are new tetraploid interspecific hybrids developed in Madagascar from Coffea eugenioides, C. canephora and C. arabica.

The European pear culture is concentrated in an area with geographical and climatological advances which results in a very good fruit quality. The European pear production is concentrated in five production area: Europe, North America, South America, South Africa and Oceania. Europe is the most important pear producer but there is a small reduction in pear area, mainly due to the phytosanitary problems like the bacterial disease fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) in some production area. In the near future a small extension of about 3 % in the pear growing area in Europe is expected. There is a strong need for new pear cultivars, which can combine good taste quality for fresh consumption with a capacity for industrial processing of the fruits. The interspecific crosses between European pear (Pyrus communis, L.) and Nashi pear (Pyrus serotina) can combine the excellent flavour characteristics of the European pear with the firm, crispy fruit quality of the nashi pear. They could bring a complete new fruit type with good commercial possibilities when introduced correctly. During the last decade, integrated pest management (IPM) has become the standard plant protection system of European pear growing. In IPM pear production, the control of the codling moth (Cydia pomonella, L.) is based on pheromone mating disruption and the control of Cacopsylla sp. is made by anthocoridae naturally present or artificially introduced in an orchard. But IPM is more than insect control alone: for scab (Venturia inaequalis) control is based on warning systems trying to reduce the number of fungicide applications. In Southern Europe brown spot (Steinphyllicum Vesicarium) is a major concern and also for this fungal problem special prediction systems are in study. There is an increasing interest for organic pear production. In many pear production area organic pear production with the standard pear cultivars is very difficult but in area with a low yearly precipitation and with sufficient water availability for irrigation, organic pear production will increase strongly in the near future. The right management of the nitrogen nutrition and the weed control programs are crucial cultural measures in the organic pear production. 3aCacopsylla 3aCydia pomonella 3aErwinia amylovora 3aPyrus communis 3aPyrus pyrifolia 3aVenturia inaequalis 3acrossing 3acultivars 3aflavor 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aindustry 3aintegrated pest management 3airrigation 3amating disruption 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3apears 3apesticide application 3aplant protection 3aprediction 3aprocessing technology 3ataste 3aweed control 3aEurope 3aNorth America 3aPacific Ocean Islands 3aSouth Africa 3aSouth America 3aSouthern European region1 aSchoofs, H.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Oct., , no. 587 p.37-54dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.587.13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02138naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002100137245007900158300001800237500002400255520107300279650001401352650001801366650001401384650001101398650001601409650004301425650002201468650001201490650001601502700002101518700002601539700002101565773010401586852000901690856007701699655001201776IND4464212320221119051249.0121001s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446421232DNAL7 a10.1021/jf021105j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamkha, Mohamed10aPhenolic Composition of Champagnes from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir Vintages  ap. 3179-3184.  aIncludes references  aNineteen phenolic compounds including hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonoids, phenolic alcohols, and phenolic aldehydes have been identified and quantified in two monovarietal champagnes, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, by using a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system coupled with diode array detection. The identification of four hydroxycinnamic tartaric esters (caftaric, coutaric, fertaric, and 2-S-glutathionylcaftaric acids), two flavanonols (astilbin and engeletin), and some other compounds was confirmed by HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry. Caftaric acid and tyrosol were the major phenols. Hydroxybenzoic acids and flavonoids were present at low concentrations. The phenolic compositions of 2000 and 2001 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir vary quantitatively according to the year and the variety, but the chemical natures of the molecules are the same. The total phenolic content determined by colorimetric measurement ranges from 176 to 195 mg/L of gallic acid equivalent and is similar to that described in white wines. 3aaldehydes 3acaftaric acid 3achampagne 3aesters 3agallic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aphenols 3awhite wines1 aCathala, Bernard1 aCheynier, Véronique.1 aDouillard, Roger0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 May 7, v. 51, no. 10 p.3179-3184x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf021105j3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03669naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001900182245010300201300001600304500002400320506007600344520164600420506003702066650001602103650001402119650001202133650002502145650001502170650002402185650001402209650001302223650002202236650001102258650001402269650001202283650001302295650001302308650001602321650001402337650002102351650001602372650004202388650002602430650002502456650002202481650003502503650003902538650004102577700002102618700002402639700002302663700002002686700002102706700002102727700002302748773011302771852000902884856008102893856003302974655001203007IND4380947320221207051214.0060612e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438094732DNAL7 a166036652pmid7 aPMC14754382pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.106.0777012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, John P.10aResponse of the Leaf Cell Wall to Desiccation in the Resurrection Plant Myrothamnus flabellifolius  ap. 651-662.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Myrothamnus flabellifolius leaf cell wall and its response to desiccation were investigated using electron microscopic, biochemical, and immunocytochemical techniques. Electron microscopy revealed desiccation-induced cell wall folding in the majority of mesophyll and epidermal cells. Thick-walled vascular tissue and sclerenchymous ribs did not fold and supported the surrounding tissue, thereby limiting the extent of leaf shrinkage and allowing leaf morphology to be rapidly regained upon rehydration. Isolated cell walls from hydrated and desiccated M. flabellifolius leaves were fractionated into their constituent polymers and the resulting fractions were analyzed for monosaccharide content. Significant differences between hydrated and desiccated states were observed in the water-soluble buffer extract, pectin fractions, and the arabinogalactan protein-rich extract. A marked increase in galacturonic acid was found in the alkali-insoluble pectic fraction. Xyloglucan structure was analyzed and shown to be of the standard dicotyledonous pattern. Immunocytochemical analysis determined the cellular location of the various epitopes associated with cell wall components, including pectin, xyloglucan, and arabinogalactan proteins, in hydrated and desiccated leaf tissue. The most striking observation was a constitutively present high concentration of arabinose, which was associated with pectin, presumably in the form of arabinan polymers. We propose that the arabinan-rich leaf cell wall of M. flabellifolius possesses the necessary structural properties to be able to undergo repeated periods of desiccation and rehydration.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMyrothamnus 3aarabinose 3abuffers 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3aelectron microscopy 3aelectrons 3aepitopes 3agalacturonic acid 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3apectins 3apolymers 3aproteins 3arehydration 3ashrinkage 3avascular tissues 3axyloglucans 2aMagnoliopsidaxchemistryxphysiology. 2aCell Wallxphysiology 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxphysiology.1 aNguema-Ona, Eric1 aChevalier, Laurence1 aLindsey, George G.1 aBrandt, Wolf F.1 aLerouge, Patrice1 aFarrant, Jill M.1 aDriouich, Azeddine0 tPlant physiology.g2006 June, v. 141, no. 2 p.651-662dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.106.0777013Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/ 7aarticle02082naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009600127300001800223500001500241520087400256650001601130650001501146650001801161650002801179650001501207650001801222650002001240650002201260650002001282650001801302650002001320651001301340653002201353653001201375653001801387700002101405700001901426700001701445773010601462852000901568930003301577945001301610946001301623655001201636IND2202933120221119051259.0000309s1999    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220293312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDillon, C.R.10aEconomic assessment of irrigated and nonirrigated soybean cropping rotations on a clay soil  ap. 1165-1182.  a2019-12-05  aExperiments were conducted in Keiser, Arkansas on a Sharkey silty clay soil for three years to examine soybean, wheat, and grain sorghum rotations.

Three antisera were raised from rabbits immunized with the hapten−KLH conjugate. On the basis of the computational analysis of hapten candidates, the hapten with a spacer arm on the thiazolyl ring of thiamethoxam was synthesized to elicit thiamethoxam-specific antisera. The hapten was 3-[2-(2-carboxyethylthio)-5-ylmethyl]-5-methyl-4-nitroimino-1,3,5-oxadiazinane. Antisera were characterized with indirect competitive ELISA. Cross-reactivity and effects of organic solvents, pH, and ionic strengths were evaluated. The antiserum was specific for thiamethoxam and tolerant of up to 5% acetonitrile and 5% acetone. Various ionic strengths and pH values in the tested ranges had negligible effect on the assay performance. Under the optimized conditions, the half-maximal inhibition concentration (IC50) and the limit of detection were approximately 9.0 and 0.1 μg/L of thiamethoxam, respectively. ELISA analysis of stream and tap water samples showed an excellent correlation with the fortification levels. 3aacetone 3aantiserum 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahaptens 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3apH 3arabbits 3asolvents 3atap water 3athiamethoxam1 aLiu, Shangzhong1 aKeum, Young-Soo1 aLi, Qing X.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 Mar. 26, v. 51, no. 7 p.1823-1830x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf02104723Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02910naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010900128300001600237520176700253650001802020650001002038650001502048650002102063650001202084650001902096650001502115650002602130650002802156650001102184650001002195650002102205650002702226653001102253653001802264700001702282700001702299773010402316852000902420930003302429945001302462946001302475655001202488IND2321698620221119051248.0010623s2001    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232169862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMullins, G.L.10aEffect of seed phosphorus concentration, soil pH, and soil phosphorus status on the yield of white lupin  ap. 127-137.  aPrevious research has suggested that successful establishment of narrow-leaf lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) in the field may be limited by low phosphorus (P) content of the seed. This relationship has not been evaluated for white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) and thus the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of seed P concentration on the growth of a winter-hardy white lupin (cultivar, "Tifwhite-78"). A large pot study was conducted to evaluate the effects of lupin seed P concentration, soil pH and P fertilizer rate on the growth of white lupin. The study was conducted using an inherently acidic (pH 4.5), P infertile Troup loamy sand (loamy, siliceous, thermic, Grossarenic Kandiudult). Treatments included three lupin seed P concentrations (0.25, 0.43, and 0.91% P), two initial soil pH levels (4.5 and 6.5) and three rates of P fertilizer (0, 50, and 100 mg P kg-1 soil). The test was conducted outside using pots having an inside diameter of 25.4 cm and a length of 67 cm and the plants were allowed to grow until physiological maturity. As expected, addition of P to this P deficient soil increased lupin seed yield, total dry matter production of shoots and roots, and the concentration of P in the various plant parts of the lupin plant. Results of this study show that lupin seed yields may be affected by the concentration of P in the planted seed, but only under high or optimum P fertility conditions. Soil pH had only minor effects on lupin seed and dry matter production. At the highest rate of applied P (100 mg P kg-1), slightly higher yields were observed at the lowest pH. Results of this study suggest that low seed P concentrations should have minimal effects on the growth and production of winter-hardy white lupin. 3aLupinus albus 3aseeds 3aphosphorus 3anutrient content 3asoil pH 3asoil fertility 3acrop yield 3anutrient availability 3adry matter accumulation 3ashoots 3aroots 3aapplication rate 3acontainer-grown plants 0agrowth 0aestablishment1 aReeves, D.W.1 aSchwab, R.L.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2001, v. 32, no. 1/2 p.127-137x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02700naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012100129300001300250500001500263520166900278650002101947650001601968650001401984650001901998650001402017650001502031651001602046653001602062653001502078700001802093700002102111700002502132773010102157852000902258930003302267945001302300946001302313655001202326IND2321697720221119051131.0010623s2001    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232169772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErp, P.J. van.10aRelationship between magnesium extracted by 0.01 M calcium chloride extraction procedure and conventional procedures  ap. 1-18.  a2019-12-05  aA multinutrient soil extraction procedure in routine soil testing is attractive. Therefore, it has been suggested to convert conventional soil testing programs into a 0.01 M calcium chloride (CaCl2) multinutrient soil testing program using the relationship between test values of the 0.01 M CaCl2 extractant and those of the various conventional extractants. However, these relationships are often weak and an interpretation of the coefficient(s) is almost impossible. Therefore, a fundamental relationship has been deduced relating magnesium (Mg) extracted by conventional methods, (Mg-ext)a, with Mg extracted by the 0.01 M CaCl2 method (Mg-ext)CaCl2:(Mg-ext)a = alpha + [beta*(Mg-ext)CaCl2,t=t] + [lambda*(Mg-ext)CaCl2,t=t * (Q-re)CaCl2]. In this relationship, alpha, beta, and lambda are related to characteristics of the extraction procedure and Mg-fractions in the soils. The (Q-re)CaCl2 is the actual cation exchange capacity of the soil during the CaCl2 extraction. To test the usefulness of this relationship, 39 agricultural soils with widely differing soil characteristics were extracted with 0.01 M CaCl2 and seven conventional Mg extractants. For six conventional methods, the explained variance of the fundamental relationships was more than 0.92. The explained variance of the relationship among 0.01 M CaCl2 and the 0.1 N ammonium-lactate/0.4 N acetic acid extractant buffered at pH 3.75 was poor when the soils contained carbonates. We conclude that the derived fundamental relationship can be used for the design of a CaCl2 soil testing program for Mg. Preferably, this CaCl2 soil testing program should be validated in pot and field experiments. 3acalcium chloride 3acalibration 3aequations 3asoil chemistry 3amagnesium 3aextraction 3aNetherlands 0amethodology 0aevaluation1 aHouba, V.J.G.1 aReijneveld, J.A.1 aBeusichem, M.L. van.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2001, v. 32, no. 1/2 p.1-18x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02832naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001400151245013000165300001600295500018600311500002400497520132000521650000801841650002001849650002001869650001301889650001101902650001301913650002001926650001201946650001601958650001001974650001101984650004701995650001402042650001002056700001502066700001502081700003102096700001902127773014002146852000902286856009102295655001202386IND4464215820221119051128.0121001s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446421582DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.587.252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, E.10aProduction of apomict-like seedling through intergeneric cross between Japanese pear and apple by means of pollen irradiation  ap. 211-215.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Asian Pears Commemorating the 100th Anniversary of "Nijisseiki" Pear, volume 1, held August 25-29, 2001, Kurayoshi, Tottori, Japan.  aIncludes references  aApomixis may provide a new possibility for pear genetics, breeding and propagation. In this experiment we tried to produce apomictic seedlings in Japanese pear through an intergeneric cross between Japanese pear and apple by means of pollen irradiation. The false hybrid can be efficiently selected in this intergeneric crossing. Because the true intergeneric hybrid potent genetic lethal system, only the false hybrid with the possibility of apomixis should survive in the crossing. Japanese pear (Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai) ‘Kousui’ and apple (Malus pumila Mill.) ‘Fuji’ were used for the intergeneric cross. The apple pollen was irradiated by gamma ray from 60Co and pollinated on the Japanese pear. A total of fourteen intergeneric seedlings at 10Gy/h (50 and 80Gy) and 20Gy/h (60 and 120Gy) developed from 155 seeds, and an individual at 80Gy (10Gy/h) and five individuals at 120Gy (20Gy/h) survived without exhibiting lethal symptoms. Plant type and morphological characters of five apomict-like seedlings at 120Gy were similar to those of Japanese pear. Their RAPD markers were only inherited from Japanese pear and their DNA contents estimated by FCM were also similar to those of Japanese pear. From the above results, we conclude that five apomict-like seedlings may be true apomicts in Japanese pear. 3aDNA 3aMalus domestica 3aPyrus pyrifolia 3aapomixis 3aapples 3acrossing 3agamma radiation 3ahybrids 3airradiation 3apears 3apollen 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aseedlings 3aseeds1 aSakuma, F.1 aKasumi, M.1 aHara, Hiroshi,d1911-1986,1 aTsukihashi, T.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Oct., , no. 587 p.211-215dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.587.253Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02331naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245011700131300001600248520136100264650001401625650000901639650001501648650001501663650002001678650001001698650002601708650002001734650002101754700001801775700001601793773010401809852000901913930003301922945001301955946001301968655001201981IND2202950120221119051112.0000310s1999    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220295012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, P.C.10aAdsorption-desorption of zinc in mollisols and their relationship with uptake of fertilizer-applied zinc by rice  ap. 471-481.  aZinc (Zn) adsorption in mollisols conformed to the linear form of Freundlich equation. The log K values were positively correlated with silt, clay, and carbonate contents and soil pH, but negatively correlated with sand content. Sequential desorption of adsorbed Zn in 0.05M Ca(NO(3))2, 0.1M Mg(NO(3))2, 0.005M DTPA, and 0.1M HCl revealed that weakly and specifically bound fractions of added Zn, which could easily equilibrate with soil solution, were low and decreased with silt and carbonate contents and soil pH. Weakly bound fraction increased with sand content. Strongly bound and complexed fraction of applied Zn was the maximum and increased with clay, soil organic carbon and carbonate contents and specific surface area, but decreased with sand content. The mineral bound fraction of applied Zn was intermediate and increased with silt, clay and carbonate contents, and soil pH and specific surface area. Zinc uptake due to added Zn fertilizer by rice crop (Y) negatively correlated with log K, but positively related to Zn content in the equilibrium soil extract and Zn desorbed in 0.05M Ca(NO(3))2. Both log K and 1/n values together explained 59.5% of the total variation in Y, while Zn content in the equilibrium soil extract, Zn desorbed in 0.05M Ca(NO(3))2, 0.005M DTPA and 0.1M HCl collectively accounted 79.6% of the total variation in Y. 3aMollisols 3azinc 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3asoil properties 3aOryza 3anutrient availability 3anutrient uptake 3azinc fertilizers1 aGangwar, M.S.1 aSingh, V.P.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1999, v. 30, no. 3/4 p.471-481x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03160naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011100144300001800255520161100273650001501884650001201899650001701911650001101928650002301939650001801962650001601980650001701996650001202013650005802025650002802083650002702111650001102138650001102149650005902160650004202219650004002261650002502301650002202326650006502348650002302413650001602436653001402452700001802466700001702484773008602501852000902587939003302596946001302629655001202642IND9201677720221119051121.0920327e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920167772DNAL7 a19386612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHouse, W.A.10aUtilization of sulfur and other mineral elements by growing dairy heifers treated with bovine somatotropin  ap. 3817-3825.  aApparent absorption and retention of Ca, P, Mg, K, Cu, Mn, Zn, and S were determined in Holstein heifers treated with recombinant bovine somatotropin (bST). Six heifers (initial BW averaged 104 kg) were assigned to various doses of bST in a 6 X 6 Latin square design with six consecutive 21-d periods. Treatments were daily i.m. injections of 0, 6.7, 33.3, 66.7, 100, or 200 microgram of bST/kg of BW on d 8 to 21 of each period. All heifers were fed a hay-concentrate diet, and nutrient digestibilities and balances were determined on d 14 to 20 of each period. Mineral concentrations in feed, water, excreta, and blood plasma were determined with an inductively coupled argon plasma-emission spectrometer. Exogenous bST did not affect apparent absorption or retention of Ca, P, Mg, K, Cu, Mn, or Zn. Plasma CU concentration was greater (P < .05) in heifers receiving bST (82 microgram of Cu/dl) than in those receiving excipient (73 microgram of Cu/dl); plasma concentrations of other elements were not affected by bST. Injection of bST did not affect S absorption, but urinary S excretion decreased (P < .05) and S retention increased (P < .05) as dose of bST increased. The amount of S retained (1.5 g/d) when the heifers received the largest dose of bST was approximately 50% greater than the amount retained when heifers received excipient. These results demonstrate that bST affects the postabsorptive metabolism of S. Generally, bST did not affect nutrient digestibilities. Effects of bST on dietary mineral requirements were not determined because of the relatively short (14 d) treatment periods. 3adairy cows 3aheifers 3asomatotropin 3asulfur 3amineral metabolism 3adose response 3afeed intake 3ablood plasma 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDigestionxdrug effects 2aDrinkingxdrug effects 2aEating 2aFemale 2aGrowth Hormonexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aInjections, Intramuscularxveterinary 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aMineralsxmetabolism 2aRandom Allocation 2aRecombinant Proteinsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aSulfurxmetabolism 2aWeight Gain 0aretention1 aCrooker, B.A.1 aBauman, D.E.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 Sept., v. 69, no. 9 p.3817-3825x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02242naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245007500200300002000275506007600295520093100371506003701302650001201339650002601351650001801377650002001395700003401415700002101449700002301470700003001493700001901523773017601542852000901718856008301727930003301810946001301843655001201856IND4425575020221207064020.0090905e20090901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442557502DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09007421062doi7 aPMC27364132pmcid7 a197064182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiemer, Jan12aA luminal flavoprotein in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation  ap. 14831-14836.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) discriminates between native and nonnative proteins. The latter are degraded by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Whereas many cytosolic and membrane components of this system are known, only few luminal players have been identified. In this study, we characterize ERFAD (ER flavoprotein associated with degradation), an ER luminal flavoprotein that functions in ERAD. Upon knockdown of ERFAD, the degradation of the ERAD model substrate ribophorin 332 is delayed, and the overall level of polyubiquitinated cellular proteins is decreased. We also identify the ERAD components SEL1L, OS-9 and ERdj5, a known reductase of ERAD substrates, as interaction partners of ERFAD. Our data show that ERFAD facilitates the dislocation of certain ERAD substrates to the cytosol, and we discuss the findings in relation to a potential redox function of the protein.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acytosol 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aflavoproteins 3aredox potential1 aAppenzeller-Herzog, Christian1 aJohansson, Linda1 aBodenmiller, Bernd1 aHartmann-Petersen, Rasmus1 aEllgaard, Lars0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Sept. 1, v. 106, no. 35 p.14831-14836dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09007421063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02533naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245010500201300002000306506007600326520112500402506003701527650002101564650001601585650001901601650001301620650001601633650001601649650002701665700001701692700001601709700001401725700001301739700001701752700001601769773017601785852000901961856008301970930003302053946001302086655001202099IND4425575120221207072225.0090905e20090901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442557512DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09032891062doi7 aPMC27364472pmcid7 a197064482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaochun10aCleavage of RseA by RseP requires a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic amino acid following DegS cleavage  ap. 14837-14842.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRegulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) by the Site-2 protease (S2P) results in the release of a transmembrane signaling protein. Curiously, however, S2P cleavage must be preceded by the action of the Site-1 protease (S1P). To decipher the underlying mechanism, we reconstituted sequential, in vitro cleavages of the Escherichia coli transmembrane protein RseA by DegS (S1P) and RseP (S2P). After DegS cleavage, the newly exposed carboxyl-terminal residue Val-148 of RseA plays an essential role for RseP cleavage, and its mutation to charged or dissimilar amino acids crippled the Site-2 cleavage. By contrast, the identity of residues 146 and 147 of RseA has no impact on Site-2 cleavage. These results explain why Site-1 cleavage must precede Site-2 cleavage. Structural analysis reveals that the putative peptide-binding groove in the second, but not the first, PDZ domain of RseP is poised for binding to a single hydrophobic amino acid. These observations suggest that after DegS cleavage, the newly exposed carboxyl terminus of RseA may facilitate Site-2 cleavage through direct interaction with the PDZ domain.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acids 3ahydrophobicity 3amutation 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3atransmembrane proteins1 aWang, Boyuan1 aFeng, Lihui1 aKang, Hui1 aQi, Yang1 aWang, Jiawei1 aShi, Yigong0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Sept. 1, v. 106, no. 35 p.14837-14842dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09032891063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02189naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245010000156300001800256500002400274520117000298650002001468650001801488650001601506650001101522650001301533650001401546650003001560700002401590700002601614700002001640773010501660852000901765856007701774655001201851IND4464214320221119051651.0121001s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446421432DNAL7 a10.1021/jf021099r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkawa, Miyoshi10aUtilization of Folin−Ciocalteu Phenol Reagent for the Detection of Certain Nitrogen Compounds  ap. 1811-1815.  aIncludes references  aTo determine in more detail the reaction of Folin−Ciocalteu phenol reagent with nitrogen compounds, a number of hydroxylamine-related compounds and a large number of guanidine-containing compounds were tested. In general, guanidine compounds did not react strongly unless they were hydroxyamino or hydrazino derivatives. The non-hydroxyamino paralytic shellfish poison saxitoxin, however, reacted to a significant extent. This may be due to the presence of a five-membered ring structure and its analogy to 2-aminopurines, which react strongly. A number of simpler amines were also tested. Tertiary aliphatic amines, but not primary, secondary, or quaternary amines, reacted strongly with the reagent. Primary, secondary, and tertiary aromatic amines all reacted strongly with the reagent. Reactivity was extended to pyrroles and indole derivatives but not to imidazole and benzimidazole derivatives. Defining the reactivity of Folin−Ciocalteau phenol reagent with nitrogen compounds extends the usefulness of the reagent for the detection and determination of certain nitrogen compounds in basic extracts by colorimetric means and by thin-layer chromatography. 3aaromatic amines 3abenzimidazole 3acolorimetry 3aphenol 3apyrroles 3ashellfish 3athin layer chromatography1 aSchaper, Timothy D.1 aDollard, Catherine A.1 aSasner, John J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 Mar. 26, v. 51, no. 7 p.1811-1815x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf021099r3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02503naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245004400125300001800169520142700187650000901614650001501623650001201638650001901650650001501669650001501684650002101699650001401720650002901734650001801763650001401781650002401795651001001819653002001829700001601849700002201865700001801887773010801905852000902013930003302022945001302055946001302068655001202081IND2322335320221119051448.0010801s2000    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232233532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRupa, T.R.10aTime-dependent zinc desorption in soils  ap. 2547-2563.  aTime dependent zinc (Zn) desorption in eight benchmark soils of India was studied in relation to various pH values and ionic strengths. Soil samples were equilibrated in solutions containing 10 microgram Zn g-1 soil at pH 5.5, 6.5, and 7.5 for 48 h at 25+/-2 degrees C, and adsorbed Zn extracted with calcium chloride (CaCl2) for various periods of time. Desorption of Zn decreased with increasing pH, and the desorption rate decreased abruptly at pH 7.5. In contrast, an increase in the equilibration period and ionic strength of the background electrolyte increased Zn desorption. Four rival kinetic models were fitted and evaluated for their suitability for describing the Zn desorption process. Reaction rate constant (beta) calculated from the Elovich model for the different soils ranged from 9.99 to 25 (mg Zn kg-1)-1. The different kinetic models tested indicated that Zn desorption in soils was a diffusion controlled process. The desorption was rapid in the first 4 h, followed by slower phase in the rest of the time at all the pH values indicating a biphasic desorption, characteristic of a diffusion controlled process. The beta value for the Elovich equation showed a strong association with soil clay content and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Further, the best prediction of Zn desorption reaction rate constant could be made using multiple-regression equation with soil clay content and CEC as variables. 3azinc 3adesorption 3asoil pH 3aionic strength 3aadsorption 3aextraction 3acalcium chloride 3asolutions 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay fraction 3aequations 3amathematical models 3aIndia 0abenchmark soils1 aTomar, K.P.1 aDamodar Reddy, D.1 aSubba Rao, A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2000, v. 31, no. 15/16 p.2547-2563x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02009naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245011100156300001800267500002400285520098800309650001001297650002501307650001601332650001201348650001101360650003301371650001001404650001301414700003001427700002301457773010501480852000901585856007701594655001201671IND4464214220221119051329.0121001s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446421422DNAL7 a10.1021/jf026068a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Joong-Ho10aOptimization of Microwave-Assisted Extraction (MAP) for Ginseng Components by Response Surface Methodology  ap. 1807-1810.  aIncludes references  aResponse surface methodology (RSM) was applied to predict optimum conditions for microwave-assisted extractiona MAP technologyof saponin components from ginseng roots.

The main functions of GreenPhylDB are to assign O. sativa and A. thaliana sequences to gene families using a semi-automatic clustering procedure and to create 'orthologous' groups using a phylogenomic approach. To date, GreenPhylDB comprises the most complete list of plant gene families, which have been manually curated (6421 families). GreenPhylDB also contains all of the phylogenomic relationships computed for 4375 families. A total of 492 TAIR, 1903 InterPro and 981 KEGG families and subfamilies were manually curated using the clusters created with the TribeMCL software. GreenPhylDB integrates information from several other databases including UniProt, KEGG, InterPro, TAIR and TIGR. Several entry points can be used to display phylogenomic relationships for A. thaliana or O. sativa sequences, using TAIR, TIGR gene ID, family name, InterPro, gene alias, UniProt or protein/nucleic sequence. Finally, a powerful phylogenomics tool, GreenPhyl Ortholog Search Tool (GOST), was incorporated into GreenPhylDB to predict orthologous relationships between O. sativa/A. thaliana protein(s) and sequences from other plant species. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aOryza sativa 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3agenes 3agenomics 3anucleic acids1 aGaillard, S.1 aLanau, N.1 aRouard, M.1 aPérin, C.0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Jan., v. 36, no. suppl_1 p.D991-D998x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080120b20080202c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02949naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001500159245014200174300001600316500002400332520160500356650002201961650001001983650002201993650002402015650002302039650001902062650002102081650002002102650002602122650001502148653001602163653002902179700001802208700001802226773010302244852000902347856009002356930003302446945002502479946001102504655001202515IND4415916320221119051156.0090206e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441591632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aWu, Huimei10aIdentification and analysis of genes encoding a novel ER-localised Cyclophilin B in wheat potentially involved in storage protein folding  ap. 420-432.  aIncludes references  aThe storage protein deposition processes in cereal endosperm follow a strict script involving protein folding and refolding, assortment and protein body deposition by two distinct pathways. The endoplasmic reticulum-localised enzymes called peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases) are expected to play crucial 'foldase' and chaperone roles in the deposition of wheat prolamins due to their proline-rich nature. The storage protein quality of wheat is important for nutritional and food technological purposes; however, little information exists on genetic control of protein sorting and deposition processes. In this study, CypB genes encoding an ER-localised cyclophilin (a PPIase) have been characterised from common wheat (Triticum aestivum L. AABBDD) and its progenitors for the first time. The full-length genes contain seven exons and six introns, the exons being significantly more conserved. The putative CypB protein contains all PPIase signature sites including the putative active site and cyclosporin-binding residues, but an atypical ER localisation signal. Using the sequence variations, the common wheat genes were localized to chromosomes 7AL, 7BL and 7DL. The promoters of wheat genes were identified by inverse-PCR and show a number of potential tissue specific regulatory elements. The wheat genes are similar in structure to rice CypB and the putative proteins are 83% identical. Further, certain QTLs related to protein quality occur at the rice and wheat CypB loci. The results support this enzyme being a strong candidate for regulating storage protein quality in wheat. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3asequence analysis 3aconserved sequences 3achromosome mapping 3aplant proteins 3astorage proteins 3aprotein folding 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aisomerases 0acyclophilin 0apeptidylprolyl Isomerase1 aWensley, Emma1 aBhave, Mrinal0 tPlant science.g2009 Mar., v. 176, no. 3 p.420-432dElsevier Science Ireland Ltd.x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.12.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/04/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03369naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245006500131300001800196520160000214650002701814650003301841650001301874650002601887650002101913650001901934650002301953650001401976650001001990650001002000650001102010650001302021650002402034650002302058650001402081650001402095650001802109650001702127650002902144650001602173650001302189700001702202700001502219700002402234700002302258700001502281700002202296700001702318700002602335700001702361700002102378700002002399700002302419700002402442700001602466773008802482852000902570856007302579930003302652946001102685990002302696655001202719IND4400321220221119051222.0080120e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440032122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Zuoshuang10aVIOLIN: vaccine investigation and online information network  ap.

The vaccine investigation and online information network (VIOLIN) is a web-based central resource, allowing easy curation, comparison and analysis of vaccine-related research data across various human pathogens (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Plasmodium falciparum) of medical importance and across humans, other natural hosts and laboratory animals. Vaccine-related peer-reviewed literature data have been downloaded into the database from PubMed and are searchable through various literature search programs. Vaccine data are also annotated, edited and submitted to the database through a web-based interactive system that integrates efficient computational literature mining and accurate manual curation. Curated information includes general microbial pathogenesis and host protective immunity, vaccine preparation and characteristics, stimulated host responses after vaccination and protection efficacy after challenge. Vaccine-related pathogen and host genes are also annotated and available for searching through customized BLAST programs. All VIOLIN data are available for download in an eXtensible Markup Language (XML)-based data exchange format. VIOLIN is expected to become a centralized source of vaccine information and to provide investigators in basic and clinical sciences with curated data and bioinformatics tools for vaccine research and development.

In this study, anatomy, ultrastructure and lignin distribution in stone cells from the fruit of two Pyrus species (Pyrus bretschneideri cv. 'Jingaisu' and Pyrus pyrifolia cv. 'Kousui') were examined by using light microscopy (LM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as well as autofluorescence analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first time this combined method has been used to analyze the stone cells in pear fruit. Sections stained with phloroglucinol-HCl revealed the presence of lignin in stone cells, and showed that stone cells were distributed in a mosaic pattern in the flesh, with larger stone cells concentrated around the core and smaller ones in the pericarp. There were no obvious differences in stone cell structure between the two varieties, but stone cell size and content was much greater in 'Jingaisu' than in 'Kousui'. Further, lignin accounted for 29.8% of stone cell composition in 'Jingaisu', a significantly higher proportion than in 'Kousui' (24.6%); this result was confirmed by autofluorescence analysis. More detailed information on lignin distribution across the cell wall was obtained by TEM combined with the KMnO₄ staining technique. In TEM images, cell walls of both pear varieties were typically divided into four layers: compound middle lamella (CML), secondary wall 1 (S1), outer secondary wall 2 (S2L) and secondary wall 2 (S2), with different staining intensities for different lignin concentrations in those regions. 3acell walls 3aplant anatomy 3aPyrus pyrifolia 3atissue distribution 3apears 3aultrastructure 3alignin 0aPyrus bretschneideri 0aPyrus1 aKhanizadeh, Shahrokh1 aZhang, Hua1 aZhang, Shaoling0 tPlant science.g2009 Mar., v. 176, no. 3 p.413-419dElsevier Science Ireland Ltd.x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.12.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/04/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02563naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245005500146300001600201520130400217650002101521650002301542650002701565650002801592650001101620650001701631650001301648650003901661650001601700650002401716650002701740650006301767650003501830650001701865650002401882700002201906773014701928852000902075930003302084945001302117946001102130655001202141IND2328052520221119051521.0020716e20020215ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232805252DNAL7 a119971392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWijn, R. de.14aThe rate of charge recombination in Photosystem II  ap. 302-308.  aLoss by recombination of the charge separated state P680+Q(A)- limits the performance of Photosystem II (PS II) as a photochemical energy converter. Time constants reported in literature for this process are mostly either near 0.17 ms or near 1.4 ms. The shorter time is found in plant PS II when reduction of P680+ by the secondary electron donor Tyrosine Z cannot occur because Y(Z) is already oxidized. The 1.4 ms recombination is seen in Y(Z)-less mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. However, the rate of P680+Q(A)- recombination that actually competes with the stabilization of the charge separation has not been previously reported. We have measured the kinetics of the flash-induced fluorescence yield changes in the microsecond time domain in Tris-washed spinach chloroplasts. In this way the kinetics and yield of P680+ reduction by Y(Z) were obtained, and the rate of the competing P680+Q(A)- recombination could be evaluated. The recombination time was less than 0.5 ms; the best-fitting time constant was 0.1 ms. The presence of Y(Z)ox slightly decreased the efficiency of excitation trapping but did not seem to accelerate P680+Q(A)- recombination. The two P680+Q(A)- lifetimes in the literature probably reflect a significant difference between plant and cyanobacterial PS II. 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 2aChlorophyllxchemistry 2aChloroplastsxchemistry 2aDiuron 2aFluorescence 2aKinetics 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexes 2aMathematics 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPheophytinsxchemistry 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxchemistry 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complex 2aTromethamine 2aTyrosinexchemistry1 aGorkom, H.J. van.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g2002 Feb. 15, v. 1553, no. 3 p.302-308x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02138naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245006600130300001800196500001500214520118400229650001301413650001901426650002101445650001401466650001401480650001201494650002101506653001601527653001901543700002401562700001501586773010701601852000901708930003301717945001301750946001301763655001201776IND2202829320221119051402.0000302s1998    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220282932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamshuddin, J.10aLongevity of ground magnesium limestone applied to an Ultisol  ap. 1299-1313.  a2019-12-05  aSoils in the upland areas of Malaysia are mostly weathered (Ultisols and Oxisols), having high aluminum (Al), but calcium (Ca) and/or magnesium (Mg) deficient. Magnesium limestone is available in large quantities in Malaysia and is frequently being used to alleviate acidity in the upland soils. This study aimed at assessing the longevity of the limestone applied to an highly weathered acid soil under conditions prevailing in the tropics. The experiment consisted of two phases; in the first phase the plots were treated with various rates of lime, while in the second phase some plots were left as residual treatments. The results of the study showed that an acid Ultisol of Malaysia can be ameliorated by annual limestone application of 1 t/ha for maize (Zea mays L.) production. The beneficial effects of liming with ground magnesium limestone (GML) at 4 t/ha were observed for about eight years. The critical soil pH and exchangeable Al for maize production were found to be 5 and 0.7 cmol(c)/kg soil, respectively. The Ca and Mg from the limestone were mostly found in the topsoils because of the increase in cation exchange capacity (CEC) resulting from the pH increase. 3aUltisols 3atropical soils 3aresidual effects 3amagnesium 3alimestone 3asoil pH 3aapplication rate 0apersistence 0asoil chemistry1 aSharifuddin, H.A.H.1 aBell, L.C.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1998, v. 29, no. 9/10 p.1299-1313x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02558naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002400129245012900153300001200282520123800294650001901532650001901551650002101570650002301591650002401614650001801638650002301656650002001679650001701699650003801716650002801754650002301782650003501805700002101840700001501861700001501876700002401891773014301915852000902058930003302067945001302100946001102113655001202124IND2332773120221119051654.0030527e20011111ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233277312DNAL7 a117188942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArechaga-Ocampo, E.10aCloning and expression analysis of hemoglobin genes from maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis)  ap. 1-8.  aWith the exception of barley and rice, little is known about the existence of hemoglobins (Hbs) in cereals. This work reports the cloning and analysis of hb genes from maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis). Coding sequences of maize and teosinte hb genes (hbm and hbt, respectively) are highly similar to each other and are interrupted by three introns located at identical positions as other plant hb genes. Sequences of predicted Hbm and Hbt proteins are identical. The hydropathic profile of Hbm and Hbt is highly similar to that of rice Hb1, suggesting that Hbm, Hbt and Hb1 have the same tertiary structure and biochemical properties. Expression analysis showed that low levels of Hb transcripts, but considerable levels of Hb proteins exist in maize embryonic organs. No Hb transcripts and proteins were detected in teosinte embryonic organs. Low levels of Hb proteins, but no Hb transcripts, were detected in maize and teosinte vegetative organs. These observations suggest that the regulation of hb genes is different in maize and teosinte embryonic organs, and that the expression of hb genes is down- or up-regulated in maize and teosinte, respectively, from germination to vegetative growing. 3aplant genetics 3aplant breeding 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Plant 2aHemoglobinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Alignment 2aZea maysxchemistryxgenetics.1 aSaenz-Rivera, J.1 aSarath, G.1 aKlucas, R.1 aArredondo-Peter, R.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g2001 Nov. 11, v. 1522, no. 1 p.1-8x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02852naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245013900203300002000342506007600362520105100438506003701489650003201526650002101558650001201579650002201591650003401613650001501647650001301662650001201675650001301687650001801700650001201718650002101730650002001751650001401771700001801785700001901803700001601822700001801838700002001856700001801876700001801894700001901912700002001931700002101951773017601972852000902148856008302157930003302240946001302273655001202286IND4425321920221207045852.0090828e20090825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442532192DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09075021062doi7 aPMC27328342pmcid7 a197065502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Yong-Seok10aIdentification of a serotonin receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase involved in learning-related heterosynaptic facilitation in Aplysia  ap. 14634-14639.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSerotonin (5-HT) plays a critical role in modulating synaptic plasticity in the marine mollusc Aplysia and in the mammalian nervous system. In Aplysia sensory neurons, 5-HT can activate several signal cascades, including PKA and PKC, presumably via distinct types of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the molecular identities of these receptors have not yet been identified. We here report the cloning and functional characterization of a 5-HT receptor that is positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase in Aplysia neurons. The cloned receptor, 5-HTapAC₁, stimulates the production of cAMP in HEK293T cells and in Xenopus oocytes. Moreover, the knockdown of 5-HTapAC₁ expression by RNA interference blocked 5-HT-induced cAMP production in Aplysia sensory neurons and blocked synaptic facilitation in nondepressed or partially depressed sensory-to-motor neuron synapses. These data implicate 5-HTapAC₁ as a major modulator of learning related synaptic facilitation in the direct sensory to motor neuron pathway of the gill withdrawal reflex.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aRNA interference 3aXenopus 3aadenylate cyclase 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3acyclic AMP 3alearning 3amammals 3amolluscs 3amotor neurons 3aoocytes 3aprotein kinase C 3asensory neurons 3aserotonin1 aChoi, Sun-Lim1 aLee, Seung-Hee1 aKim, Hyoung1 aPark, Hyungju1 aLee, Nuribalhae1 aLee, Sue-Hyun1 aChae, Yeon-Su1 aJang, Deok-Jin1 aKandel, Eric R.1 aKaang, Bong-Kiun0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Aug. 25, v. 106, no. 34 p.14634-14639dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09075021063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090829b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03025naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001800172245007300190300001600263500002400279500001500303520156200318650002001880650002001900650001501920650002001935650001701955650002101972650001901993650001402012650002102026650001502047650001102062650002002073651001902093653002202112653002002134653001102154653001802165700001502183700001602198773011802214852000902332856008502341930003302426945002502459946001102484655001202495IND4421000620221119051451.0090526e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442100062DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596090085082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL105 0aL300 0aL1001 aGregory, N.G.10aCattle handling and welfare standards in livestock markets in the UK  ap. 345-354.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSome fast food restaurants have introduced a trade embargo on beef sold through livestock markets on the grounds that welfare standards associated with live auction markets are worse than standards associated with direct sale to abattoirs. The current study examined the handling difficulties and welfare standards at 24 UK cattle and calf markets, and comparisons were made according to class of animal (mainly store or finished) and according to throughput of the market, <100 livestock units (LSU) per week, 100-300 LSU per week and >300 LSU per week. Handling problems examined included refusal to move, balking, slips, falls, impacts, inappropriate handling such as excessive use of a stick, hazardous jumping and confusion while loading onto vehicles. The most common difficulties were impacts, slips and falls during grading and when putting cattle up to the sale ring. Slipping was also common in finished cattle while they were in the ring, and they were prone to impacts when returning to a holding pen. Refusing to load onto vehicles after the sale was common in both finished and store cattle. Calves were prone to going down on their knees when moving onto the tailboards of vehicles. Of the markets, 0·47 had potential bruising or impact points in the grading facilities and 0·67 of the markets did not have a way of ensuring that legs did not get trapped between gates and gateposts if cattle attempted to jump out of a holding pen. In most other respects the prevalence of weaknesses in the facilities and problems during handling was low. 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal injuries 3alocomotion 3aslaughterhouses 3afood animals 3alivestock prices 3aanimal welfare 3afrequency 3aanimal transport 3aprevalence 3acalves 3aanimal handling 3aUnited Kingdom 0alivestock markets 0aanimal auctions 0acattle 0alive auctions1 aBenson, T.1 aMason, C.W.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2009 June, v. 147, no. 3 p.345-354dCambridge University Pressx0021-85967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596090085083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090708b00000000c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/06/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02071naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245006900167300001600236520092900252650002201181650002201203650002401225650002001249653002001269653001601289653002901305653003801334653002201372700002301394700003601417773013401453852000901587856006901596930003301665946001101698655001201709IND4387470820221119051457.0070204e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438747082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-006-9046-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoailly, Joëlle.10aSpatial Evolution of Social Norms in a Common-Pool Resource Game  ap. 113-141.  aWe study the conditions for the emergence of cooperation in a spatial common-pool resource (CPR) game. We consider three types of agents: cooperators, defectors and enforcers. The role of enforcers is to punish defectors for overharvesting the resource. Agents are located on a circle and they only observe the actions of their two nearest neighbors. Their payoffs are determined by both local and global interactions and they modify their actions by imitating the strategy in their neighborhood with the highest average payoffs on average. Using theoretical and numerical analysis, we find a large diversity of equilibria to be the outcome of the game. In particular, we find conditions for the occurrence of equilibria in which the three strategies coexist. We also derive the stability of these equilibria. Finally, we show that introducing resource dynamics in the system favors the occurrence of cooperative equilibria. 3aconsumer behavior 3anatural resources 3aresource management 3asocial behavior 0acommon property 0acooperation 0aevolutionary game theory 0alocal and global interaction game 0aself-organization1 aWithagen, Cees A. 1 avan den Bergh, Jeroen C.

The closest known relative of P. falciparum is a chimpanzee parasite, Plasmodium reichenowi, of which one single isolate was previously known. The co-speciation hypothesis suggests that both parasites evolved separately from a common ancestor over the last 5-7 million years, in parallel with the divergence of their hosts, the hominin and chimpanzee lineages. Genetic analysis of eight new isolates of P. reichenowi, from wild and wild-born captive chimpanzees in Cameroon and Côte d'Ivoire, shows that P. reichenowi is a geographically widespread and genetically diverse chimpanzee parasite. The genetic lineage comprising the totality of global P. falciparum is fully included within the much broader genetic diversity of P. reichenowi. This finding is inconsistent with the co-speciation hypothesis. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that all extant P. falciparum populations originated from P. reichenowi, likely by a single host transfer, which may have occurred as early as 2-3 million years ago, or as recently as 10,000 years ago. The evolutionary history of this relationship may be explained by two critical genetic mutations. First, inactivation of the CMAH gene in the human lineage rendered human ancestors unable to generate the sialic acid Neu5Gc from its precursor Neu5Ac, and likely made humans resistant to P. reichenowi. More recently, mutations in the dominant invasion receptor EBA 175 in the P. falciparum lineage provided the parasite with preference for the overabundant Neu5Ac precursor, accounting for its extreme human pathogenicity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPan troglodytes 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aancestry 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3ahosts 3ahumans 3ainfectious diseases 3amalaria 3amutation 3aparasites 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3asialic acids 3aCameroon 3aCote d'Ivoire1 aLeendertz, Fabian H.1 aXu, Guang1 aLeBreton, Matthew1 aDjoko, Cyrille F.1 aAminake, Makoah N.1 aTakang, Eric E.1 aDiffo, Joseph L.D.1 aPike, Brian L.1 aRosenthal, Benjamin M.1 aFormenty, Pierre1 aBoesch, Christophe1 aAyala, Francisco J.1 aWolfe, Nathan D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Sept. 1, v. 106, no. 35 p.14902-14907dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09077401063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03074naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002200177245015300199300001600352500002400368500001500392520148400407650003201891650003301923650001101956650001401967650001801981650003001999650001902029650001402048650001502062650002002077650003102097653001702128653002402145653001802169700001902187700002202206700002502228700003202253773010302285852000902388856009002397930003302487945002502520946001102545655001202556IND4415915620221119051542.0090206e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441591562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aJ5001 aTsiri, Dimitroula14aThe origin of copper-induced medicarpin accumulation and its secretion from roots of young fenugreek seedlings are regulated by copper concentration  ap. 367-374.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIsoflavonoid pterocarpans, like medicarpin (M), are produced by leguminous plants in response to biotic or abiotic elicitation from either their glycosidic conjugate pools or by de novo synthesis. In an attempt to clarify M origin in response to copper elicitation, intact Trigonella foenum-graecum (fenugreek) seedlings and cell suspension cultures were treated with CuCl₂, and the accumulated isoflavonoid aglycones and their glycosides were determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Our results show that copper induces the de novo synthesis of M in a concentration dependent manner. In roots, where copper accumulated in high amounts, only part of M was formed de novo, while another part was formed at the expense of its malonyl glucoside (MGM). In contrast, when tissue copper concentration was low, like in shoots, or in roots treated with low CuCl₂, M was formed only by de novo synthesis. The increase of phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity (PAL) as well as the accumulation of chalcone synthase (CHS) and vestitone reductase (VR) specific transcripts are consistent with the de novo synthesis of M induced by copper. The non-linear negative correlation of the studied copper concentrations to the amount of M excreted in the seedling growth medium suggests the existence of an M secretion process which is regulated by copper concentration. The possible involvement of an ATP-dependent transporter in the copper-induced M excretion is discussed. 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3acopper 3aseedlings 3aroot exudates 3aTrigonella foenum-graecum 3acultured cells 3afenugreek 3amedicarpin 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression regulation 0apterocarpans 0avestitone reductase 0aisoflavonoids1 aChinou, Ioanna1 aHalabalaki, Maria1 aHaralampidis, Kosmas1 aGanis-Spyropoulos, Caroline0 tPlant science.g2009 Mar., v. 176, no. 3 p.367-374dElsevier Science Ireland Ltd.x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.12.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090416b20090508c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/04/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03515naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100003000177245018700207300001600394500002400410520191900434650001702353650000902370650001902379650002902398650003102427650002302458650002802481650002502509650001202534650001102546650001602557653003002573653004402603700002802647700002602675700002202701700002702723773010302750852000902853856009002862930003302952945002502985946001103010655001203021IND4415915220221119051415.0090206e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441591522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aJ5001 aUdomchalothorn, Thanikarn14aThe role of the bifunctional enzyme, fructose-6-phosphate-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, in carbon partitioning during salt stress and salt tolerance in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 334-341.  aIncludes references  aA fructose-6-phosphate-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (F6P2K/F26BPase) gene was found to exhibit different transcript expression levels after 48h of salt treatment between the salt-tolerant rice line, LPT123-TC171, and its original cultivar, LPT123, by differential RNA display and confirmed by RT-PCR. DNA sequence similarity analysis suggests this is the F6P2K/F26BPase gene located on chromosome 5. During 9 days of salt stress induced by inclusion of 85mM NaCl in the nutrient solution, the growth of LPT123, but not LPT123-TC171, was inhibited with reduced dry and fresh weights, suggesting the higher salt tolerance of LPT123-TC171. Under these saline conditions, both rice cultivars significantly increased leaf sucrose levels and decreased the proportion of carbon assimilated to starch, but this was significantly more marked in the salt-tolerant LPT123-TC171 cultivar. Under normal culture conditions F6P2K/F26BPase transcripts could not be detected in LPT123 leaves, but were readily detected in LPT123-TC171. Salt stress for 72h induced and up-regulated F6P2K/F26BPase expression levels in LPT123 and LPT123-TC171 cultivars, respectively, with higher levels of F6P2K/F26BPase transcripts being found in LPT123-TC171. Correspondingly, an increase in F6P2K and F26BPase enzymatic activities were observed in LPT123, but in LPT123-TC171, only a significant increase in F26BPase activity was seen, leading to a significant reduction in the F6P2K/F26BPase activity ratio after 9 days of salt treatment in LPT123-TC171. In correlation with the observed F6P2K/F26BPase activity ratios, the average leaf F26BP levels significantly decreased after 9 days salt-stress while the sucrose levels increased. These data support the role of a decrease in F26BP levels leading to an increased partition of carbon to sucrose, and suggest that this may contribute to salt-stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.). 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3asalt tolerance 3a6-phosphofructo-2-kinase 3agene expression regulation 3achromosome mapping 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acarbohydrate content 3asucrose 3astarch 3asalt stress 0afructose-2,6-bisphosphate 0afructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase1 aManeeprasobsuk, Somporn1 aBangyeekhun, Eakaphan1 aBoon-Long, Preeda1 aChadchawan, Supachitra0 tPlant science.g2009 Mar., v. 176, no. 3 p.334-341dElsevier Science Ireland Ltd.x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.11.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090416b20090508c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/04/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03439naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110072002000130100001600150245007300166300001800239500002800257520212400285650001802409650001502427650001102442650001502453650001502468650002502483650002002508650001802528650002102546650002502567650001402592650002302606650002402629650000902653651001302662653001602675653001902691700001802710700001802728700002002746700001902766700001702785773012102802852000902923946001302932655001202945IND4411250820221119051131.0081010s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441125082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The distribution of Klebsiella species was compared among isolates from teat ends, legs, and cases of clinical mastitis obtained from 2 dairy farms in New York State, with 850 and 1,000 cows, respectively. Farms were visited twice approximately 4 wk apart in August and September 2007 to obtain cleanliness scores and swabs from legs and teats. Isolates of Klebsiella clinical mastitis from each farm were collected from July through October 2007. Two studies were conducted. In the first study, whole-cow cleanliness of a purposive sample of 200 lactating cows was scored using a 4-point scale, and swabs were taken from their lower hind legs. In the second study, udder cleanliness of a separate convenience sample of 199 lactating cows was scored in the milking parlor, and swabs were taken from their teat ends before and after premilking udder preparation. Prevalence of Klebsiella spp. on legs and teat ends before udder preparation was 59 and 60%, respectively. Logistic regression was used to explore the association between isolation of Klebsiella spp. and cleanliness scores. Cow cleanliness scores and udder cleanliness scores were not associated with detection of Klebsiella on legs and on teats before udder preparation, respectively. After udder preparation, 43% of previously Klebsiella positive teat end samples remained positive, with significant differences between farms and months. Teats from dirty udders were significantly more likely to test positive for Klebsiella after udder preparation than teats from clean udders. The proportion of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates was similar for isolates from teat end swabs and clinical mastitis cases, supporting the notion that the presence of Klebsiella on teat ends may lead to opportunistic intramammary infections. Udder cleanliness scores could be used as a management tool to monitor the risk of exposure to Klebsiella spp. on teat ends. 3aanimal health 3asanitation 3audders 3aKlebsiella 3adairy cows 3aclinical examination 3abovine mastitis 3adairy farming 3aon-farm research 3adisease surveillance 3alactation 3adisease prevalence 3amicrobial detection 3alegs 3aNew York 0acleanliness 0aanimal hygiene1 aBennett, G.J.1 aAhlström, C.1 aGriffiths, H.M.1 aSchukken, Y.H.1 aZadoks, R.N.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2008 Oct., v. 91, no. 10 p.3908-3916dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle02665naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012500127300001800252520159100270650001901861650001401880650001401894650001501908650002501923650002301948650001501971650001301986650000901999651001302008653002202021653002402043653001702067653002102084773010602105852000902211930003302220945001302253946001302266655001202279IND2202932020221119051159.0000309s1999    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220293202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYohannes, F.10aImprovement of water application efficiency by moisture conservation methods for establishment of planted tree seedlings  ap. 1119-1125.  aThe survival rate of transplanted tree seedlings in the afforestation and reforestation programs of Ethiopia has been very often low due to, among others, inadequate soil moisture particularly during the establishment period. Irrigation of seedlings and conserving moisture at the early stage of growth in areas with inadequate rainfall can improve survival. The efficiency of water application can be improved not only through technical and technological consideration of the irrigation hardware (equipment and structures), but also through the application of appropriate soil water management practices. The principles underlying soil moisture movement under different soil conditions were applied on improvement of irrigation application efficiency for the establishment of transplanted tree seedlings at Alemaya Research Station. The principle that a coarser soil layer underlying a given soil prevents, in an unsaturated condition, its penetration by the moisture front, was used in Acacia saligna seedlings. This method of moisture conservation using a sand layer was also tested in combination with surface and vertical organic mulching. Three liters of water was applied to the individual seedlings planted in 2 x 2 m at a four-day interval. A higher fresh biomass yield, plant height, and collar diameter were observed using the sand layer. Surface mulching used in combination with sand layer showed the highest value. The soil moisture content measured at 20 cm and 40 cm of the root depth was lower in the control treatment of tree seedlings without sand layer and mulching. 3aAcacia saligna 3aseedlings 3amortality 3airrigation 3awater use efficiency 3awater conservation 3asoil water 3amulching 3asand 3aEthiopia 0avertical mulching 0astand establishment 0asand barrier 0asurface mulching0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1999, v. 30, no. 7/8 p.1119-1125x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02205naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002100137245010700158300001800265500002400283500001500307520110000322650001401422650003201436650001401468650003301482650001901515650002201534650001201556650002001568650001001588651001001598653001001608700002201618773010501640852000901745856007701754655001201831IND4464213520221119051230.0121001s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446421352DNAL7 a10.1021/jf020821i2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaundun, Shiv S.10aIdentification of Processed Japanese Green Tea Based on Polymorphisms Generated by STS−RFLP Analysis  ap. 1765-1770.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aIn Japan, tea is generally sold blended, though 90% of the total production is clonal. Due to the increasingly strict consumer need and taste, however, more and more Japanese green teas are being sold under their particular cultivar name. Moreover, tea made from Yabukita, a much appreciated cultivar originally developed in Japan, has recently been produced and imported from a neighboring country. This paper describes a simple and inexpensive methodology capable of identifying fresh and processed Japanese green teas to discourage its fraudulent commercialization. The study was based on 46 main tea cultivars, and polymorphism detected through STS−RFLP analysis of the coding and noncoding DNA regions of three genes, namely phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, chalcone synthase, and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, for which nucleotide information was available. All 46 tea cultivars analyzed could be easily distinguished using a combination of codominant DNA markers. Yabukita displayed a unique profile when PAL intron was digested with DdeI, thus allowing its rapid authentication at low cost. 3acultivars 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3agreen tea 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aintergenic DNA 3acommercialization 3aintrons 3agenetic markers 3ataste 3aJapan 0agenes1 aMatsumoto, Satoru0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 Mar. 26, v. 51, no. 7 p.1765-1770x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf020821i3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle06371naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001600150245007600166300001600242500018600258500002400444520421900468650002504687650000804712650003004720650001004750650001404760650001004774650001904784650001404803650002004817650002304837650001304860650001204873650001204885650001804897650001004915650002604925650001904951650001204970650001904982650001605001650001605017650001805033650001905051650001405070650001005084650001005094650001305104650001005117650001505127650001605142650001105158650002105169650001405190650001505204650001805219650001505237650001405252650001105266650001205277650001005289650001305299650000905312651001005321651001005331651002105341773014005362852000905502856009005511655001205601IND4464213320221119051213.0121001s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446421332DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.587.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKajiura, I.10aStudies on the recent advances and future trends in Asian pear in Japan  ap. 113-124.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Asian Pears Commemorating the 100th Anniversary of "Nijisseiki" Pear, volume 1, held August 25-29, 2001, Kurayoshi, Tottori, Japan.  aIncludes references  aCompared with Pyrus spp. in the world, the one in Japan shows some unique features. As pears in Japan have been diffused from the original place of genus Pyrus to the eastern margin of the Eurasian continent, some growing characters and disease resistance are different from those of pears in the western part. Although hybridization between these two has been tried to introduce disease resistance of western species into Asian pears, unfortunately, no success has been obtained. In Japan, over 1,200 names of cultivars have been recorded, and escaped and wild trees are still preserved. Among them, wide genetic diversities are observed. These facts indicate the ancient introduction of pears from continental China and Korean peninsula and complex hybridization among domestic and introduced ones. Recent results from DNA analysis and discovery of a new S-genotype of self-incompatibility strongly support these diversities. In the near future, genetic relationship among pear sps. in Asia should be clarified. In addition, almost all-recent commercial cultivars are genetically derived from cv. Nijisseiki and some local cultivars originated in the Southern Kanto districts. Consequently, they seem to be genetically close to each other. From the recent breeding program to introduce the distant gene from a different gene group, some cultivars have been released. As the growing area in Japan is located under a typhoon course, trellis training system is indispensable to prevent strong wind damage. That is why dwarf rootstock is not studied. Under humid climate conditions, chemicals are sprayed frequently to control insects and diseases. Fruit have been bagged to control this damage way back from the end of the Edo era. Three serious diseases as rust (Gymnosporangium asiaticum), black spot (Alternaria alternata) and scab (Venturia nashicola) are recorded. However, rust has been overcome by emasculating the intermediate host plants and the use of effective chemicals. Black spot is also controlled by newly bred resistant cultivars. Scab is left as a difficult disease to control. In orchards developed in the forestry region, fruit are attacked by birds, fruit-piercing stinkbugs and piercing moths. To control them, the use of yellow fluorescent lamps for piercing moths and netting over the orchard for birds and stinkbugs are practiced. For Nashi, Japanese consumers ask sweetness, juiciness and soft and non-gritty texture as well as cheap price. Therefore, practical orchard management has to be improved to obtain high quality fruit with low management cost. Recent progress on fruit maturation revealed sugar-related enzymes and their related genes, and cultivar differences in shelf life and their related enzymes and genes. In the future, gene modifying of Nashi quality should succeed after successful induction of redifferentiated explants. For reducing production costs and intensive work, a new breeding program has been started to introduce self-compatibility for non-artificial pollination, self-thinning ability for non-fruit thinning one and scab resistance. In addition, to reduce chemicals, pheromones for moths are now in practice. In the 21st century, four important changes should be pointed out for Nashi cultivation in Japan. First, the population of Japan is estimated to decrease from the year 2008. Unless the consumption of fresh fruit by consumers increases, severe competitive condition of imported fresh fruit, beverages and sweets will occur, and the growers should be limitedly selected. Second, growers' age will be older than before because the rate of aged people will increase. Therefore, hard and intensive work on managing trees and handling fruit should be improved. Third, global warming may induce the transfer of the growing area to the north, and film-protected cultivation and oil heating should be controlled to decrease carbon dioxide release. In the future, a new type of Nashi, having a low level of dormancy, should be bred. Fourth, consumers' concern about the preservation of earth environment should be strictly changed. So to conclude, decreasing chemical applications as well as oil products may develop more friendly management of cultivation. 3aAlternaria alternata 3aDNA 3aGymnosporangium asiaticum 3aPyrus 3abeverages 3abirds 3acarbon dioxide 3acultivars 3adisease control 3adisease resistance 3adormancy 3aelderly 3aenzymes 3afruit quality 3agenes 3agenetic relationships 3aglobal warming 3agrowers 3aheat treatment 3ahost plants 3ahumid zones 3ahybridization 3ainsect control 3ajuiciness 3alamps 3amoths 3aorchards 3apears 3apheromones 3apollination 3aprices 3aproduction costs 3araw fruit 3arootstocks 3arust diseases 3ashelf life 3asweetness 3asweets 3atexture 3atrees 3atyphoons 3awind 3aChina 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Oct., , no. 587 p.113-124dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.587.93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03734naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002800156245013900184300001800323500002400341500001500365520182100380650001302201650001202214650002202226650001002248650001602258650001102274650002302285650001702308650001102325650002302336650002002359650001402379650000902393650003102402650001102433650001302444650002202457650001102479650001202490650001202502650002302514650004102537650002102578650001102599650002102610650001102631650000902642650002402651650002402675650001002699650004102709651001802750653001702768653001702785700003302802700002002835700001302855773013102868852000902999856004003008655001203048IND4458908420221119051300.0110610e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445890842DNAL7 a214458902pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.43542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKollmannsberger, Hubert10aVolatile and capsaicinoid composition of ají (Capsicum baccatum) and rocoto (Capsicum pubescens), two Andean species of chile peppers  ap. 1598-1611.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Ají (Capsicum baccatum L. var. pendulum) and rocoto (Capsicum pubescens R. & P.) are two species of chile pepper used for millennia in Andean cuisine. The introduction of these relatively unknown Capsicum species to new markets requires an understanding of their flavour-related compounds. Thus both heat level (Scoville method and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)) and, particularly, aroma (headspace solid phase microextraction and GC/MS/olfactometry) were studied in different accessions of ají and rocoto and a C. chinense control. RESULTS: Ajíes and rocotos are mildly pungent compared with C. chinense (13-352 vs 1605 mg kg⁻¹ total capsaicinoids). More than 200 volatiles were detected and marked differences in volatile pattern were found between the studied accessions. The powerful fruity/exotic aroma of the C. chinense control is due to esters such as ethyl 4-methylpentanoate, norcarotenoids such as β-ionone and the hydrocarbon ectocarpene. In contrast, the Andean peppers had more earthy/vegetable/bell pepper-like aromas. Rocotos also exhibited a distinct additional cucumber odour, while one of the ajíes had a distinctive sweet/fruity note. The aroma of C. pubescens fruits is mainly due to substituted 2-methoxypyrazines and lipoxygenase cleavage products (e.g. 2-nonenals, 2,6-nonadienal). 2-Heptanethiol, 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine and several phenols (e.g. guaiacol) and terpenoids (e.g. α-pinene, 1,8-cineol, linalool) are the basis of C. baccatum aroma, with some 3-methyl-2-butyl esters contributing to fruity notes. CONCLUSION: In this study the compounds responsible for heat and aroma in the Andean peppers C. baccatum and C. pubescens were identified. The results will be of use to inspire future studies aimed at improving the flavour of these species. 3aguaiacol 3apeppers 3amass spectrometry 3aodors 3anew markets 3asweets 3aheadspace analysis 3aolfactometry 3aesters 3aCapsicum pubescens 3amicroextraction 3acucumbers 3aheat 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aflavor 3alinalool 3aCapsicum baccatum 3afruits 3acineole 3acuisine 3agas chromatography 2aCapsicumxchemistryxclassification. 2aEstersxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFruitxchemistry 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTaste 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysis 0aSouth America 0ahydrocarbons 0alipoxygenase1 aRodríguez-Burruezo, Adrián1 aNitz, Siegfried1 aNuez, F.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2011 July, v. 91, no. 9 p.1598-1611dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.4354 7aarticle03339naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245011300132300001600245500001500261520230200276650001602578650002602594650002002620650001502640650001502655650002102670650001502691653001802706653001802724700001602742700001702758700001802775773010402793852000902897930003302906945001302939946001302952655001202965IND2202930220221119051435.0000309s1999    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220293022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, M.L.V.10aSoil properties affecting phosphorus extraction from Portuguese soils by conventional and innovative methods  ap. 921-936.  a2019-12-05  aThe conventional Bray 1, Egner-Riehm, Olsen, and the innovative cation/anion exchange resin membranes (CAERM) and iron oxide-impregnated filter paper strips (Pi) procedures were compared as phosphorus (P) extractants from 73 representative Portuguese soils. The soils were characterized by wide variability of their pedological, physical, and chemical properties. Eleven FAO-UNESCO soil units, with prevailing Anthrosol, Calcisol, Cambisol, Fluvisol, Leptosol, Luvisol, and 10 different textural classes, with prevailing loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, silty loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, were recognized. The soils showed the following properties: CaCO(3) 0.0-50.9 g 100 g(-1), organic matter 0.4-8.4 g 100 g(-1), pH-CaCl(2) 3.9 to 7.9, cation exchange capacity 1.5-57.6 cmol(c) kg(-1). Soil-P (mg kg(-1)) ranges were: 0.2-185.9 for Bray 1, 0.6-307.7 for Egner-Riehm, 1.0-100.5 for Olsen, 1.1-69.4 for Pi, and 0.4-48.8 for CAERM. The P extraction efficiency decreased along with the order Bray 1 > Egner-Riehm > Olsen > Pi > CAERM, with mean values of 39.7, 34.6, 20.5, 19.0, and 14.8 mg P kg(-1) soil, respectively. All methods, with the relevant exception of Egner-Riehm, were almost uniformly affected by the considered pedological, chemical and physical features of soils, and well correlated each other. The following conversion equations, by simple linear regressions, were calculated: Olsen-P=4.118+0.412*Bray 1-P, R(2)=0.737; Olsen-P=-1.300+1.144*Pi-P, R(2)=0.677; Olsen-P=0.760+1.330*CAERM-P, R(2)=0.559;Bray 1-P=-3.064+2.249*Pi-P, R(2)=0.602; Bray 1-P=-0.630+2.722*CAERM-P, R(2)=0.538; Pi-P=3.417+1.053*CAERM-P, R(2)=0.677. After performing multiple regressions including the CEC as accessory variable, we obtained significant equations only for the conversions between Egner-Riehm-P and Pi-P or CAERM-P values, as it follows: Egner-Riehm-P=-24.600+1.630*Pi-P+1.928*CEC, adj. R(2)=0.587; Egner-Riehm-P=-23.303+2.183*CAERM-P+1.747*CEC, adj. R(2)=0.606. Thus, the innovative Pi-strips and the cation/anion exchange resin membranes procedures could represent suitable tools for the assessment of soil-P status and for P fertilizer recommendations. As the future research step, we will verify the reliability of the contrasted soil-P tests in predicting plant P uptake and yield response. 3acorrelation 3anutrient availability 3asoil properties 3asoil types 3aextraction 3asoil test values 3aphosphorus 0asoil analysis 0adetermination1 aIndiati, R.1 aCoutinho, J.1 aBuondonno, A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1999, v. 30, no. 7/8 p.921-936x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02425naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110072002000130072002000150072002000170100001600190245008900206300001800295500002800313500001500341520122400356650001701580650002201597650002101619650002401640650002701664650002601691650002801717650002301745650002101768651001801789653001801807653002001825700001501845773012101860852000901981946001301990655001202003IND4411253120221119051452.0081010s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441125312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Efficient breeding of cows and heifers has become increasingly difficult as fertility has decreased because of a correlated negative response with milk yield. Dairy farm survey results were used to parameterize the economic analyses of reproductive management programs. Reproductive management program costs and the levels of reproductive performance achieved with such programs varied significantly among farms and were especially sensitive to on-farm labor costs. For example, visual heat detection requires more hours of labor per cow than use of an estrus synchronization program. Therefore, visual heat detection programs were relatively more sensitive to labor costs than synchronization programs. In addition, past reproductive performance was found to affect the determination of which reproductive program was optimal. Farms that had attained high levels of labor efficiency for visual heat detection in the past had less incentive to adopt a synchronization program than farms with less efficient visual heat detection. 3afarm surveys 3aeconomic analysis 3aanimal husbandry 3aanimal reproduction 3aestrus synchronization 3adairy farm management 3areproductive efficiency 3aanimal performance 3acommercial farms 3aUnited States 0adairy farming 0aanimal breeding1 aWolf, C.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2008 Oct., v. 91, no. 10 p.4082-4091dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle01966naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245010200132300001600234520104100250650001501291650001201306650001501318650001501333650002301348650002001371650001501391653001301406653001801419700001901437773010401456852000901560930003301569945001301602946001301615655001201628IND2202949320221119051511.0000310s1999    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220294932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBussetti, S.G. de10aConcentration effect of dicamba on adsorption in soils, montmorillonite, bayerite, and silica gel  ap. 407-417.  aThe process of adsorption-desorption of the dicamba herbicide (3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid) by 10 soils southwest of Buenos Aires (Argentine) and by calcium (Ca)-montmorillonite, bayerite, and silica gel, was studied as a function of the applied concentration. Only two of soils studied readily adsorbed dicamba. The most important parameters in the soil with greater adsorption are lower pH (5.15) and high organic matter content (5.6%). The remaining soils show negative adsorption and hydrophility of the soil colloids could account for this by preferential adsorption of water. The Ca-montmorillonite, aluminum oxide, bayerite, and silica gel adsorbed dicamba. The extent of adsorption is small and the quantity adsorbed was characterized by Freundlich adsorption constants, which were used as an index to compare adsorbents and treatments. The analysis of the adsorption constants (k) and (1/n) shows that the reaction is irreversible and the adsorption is in the following order: bayerite > silica gel > Ca-montmorillonite. 3asoil types 3adicamba 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3asorption isotherms 3amontmorillonite 3asilica gel 0abayerite 0aconcentration1 aFerreiro, E.A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1999, v. 30, no. 3/4 p.407-417x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03526naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100002300191245004700214300001600261500002400277520129000301650001501591650002301606650000801629650001501637650002601652650002501678650001701703650002501720650002301745650001901768650002101787650001101808650002201819650002401841650002301865650001601888650001801904650002001922650002001942650002601962650001301988650002802001650000902029650001602038650004702054650001202101650002302113650001302136650002402149650004002173650001102213650006302224650002602287650003402313650003302347650003702380653002302417700001902440700001902459773011502478852000902593856008502602930003302687945002502720946001102745655001202756IND4421032420221119051418.0090529e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442103242DNAL7 a187750982pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145080515562doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aR3001 aRagaller, Veronika10aFolic acid in ruminant nutrition: a review  ap. 153-164.  aIncludes references  aFolic acid plays an essential role in DNA and methionine metabolism. Micro-organisms in the rumen can synthesise folates, but it has not been verified that these amounts are sufficient to achieve the best efficiency of dairy cows. However, the amount of folates synthesised in the rumen could possibly, to some extent, be affected by the forage:concentrate ratio. Degradation of orally supplemented folic acid in the rumen seems to be very high (about 97 %), as supplementation of folic acid hardly increases folate concentrations in the digesta at the duodenum. However, it must be considered that dietary supplements of folic acid higher than 0·5 mg/kg body weight increased serum folate concentrations in all available studies and milk folate concentrations in most studies. Additionally, milk production tended to be increased in some studies. Therefore, degradation of folic acid in the rumen may be overestimated as folates can be absorbed at the proximal duodenum. For future research it is necessary to consider the whole flow and the metabolic pathways of folates from the rumen to duodenum, blood, tissue, milk and transfer to calf to declare requirement values for cows.

D582-D587.  aWith over 100 000 species and a large community of evolutionary biologists, population ecologists, pest biologists and genome researchers, the Lepidoptera are an important insect group. Genomic resources [expressed sequence tags (ESTs), genome sequence, genetic and physical maps, proteomic and microarray datasets] are growing, but there has up to now been no single access and analysis portal for this group. Here we present ButterflyBase (http://www.butterflybase.org), a unified resource for lepidopteran genomics. A total of 273 077 ESTs from more than 30 different species have been clustered to generate stable unigene sets, and robust protein translations derived from each unigene cluster. Clusters and their protein translations are annotated with BLAST-based similarity, gene ontology (GO), enzyme classification (EC) and Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) terms, and are also searchable using similarity tools such as BLAST and MS-BLAST. The database supports many needs of the lepidopteran research community, including molecular marker development, orthologue prediction for deep phylogenetics, and detection of rapidly evolving proteins likely involved in host-pathogen or other evolutionary processes. ButterflyBase is expanding to include additional genomic sequence, ecological and mapping data for key species. 3aLepidoptera 3adata collection 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agene ontology 3agenomics 3ainsects 3amicroarray technology 3anucleic acids 3apests 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3atranslation (genetics) 3aunigenes1 aGebauer-Jung, Steffi1 aBlaxter, Mark L.1 aOwen McMillan, W.1 aJiggins, Chris D.0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Jan., v. 36, no. suppl_1 p.D582-D587x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080120b20080202c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04766naa a2200889 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001700182245006400199300001400263506007600277520196100353506003702314650002402351650002802375650001402403650001802417650002702435650002202462650001702484650002002501650001802521650001902539650002202558650002502580650001202605650001902617650001202636650001802648650001202666650002502678650002402703650001602727650003102743650002402774650003502798650003802833650003702871650002802908650005202936650001102988650003102999650002503030650003603055650002803091650000903119650002803128650003303156650002403189650002703213650003103240650000903271650006103280650005203341650001703393653002503410653002803435653001503463700001403478700001403492700002403506700001303530700001503543700001903558773013703577852000903714856008203723930003303805945001303838946001303851655001203864IND2332047120221207071306.0030418e20020108dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233204712DNAL7 a117736172pmid7 aPMC1175102pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0123188992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiang, A.S.10aInsect NMDA receptors mediate juvenile hormone biosynthesis  ap. 37-42.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn vertebrates, the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDAR) appears to play a role in neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and pituitary activity. However, functional NMDAR have not yet been characterized in insects. We have now demonstrated immunohistochemically glutamatergic nerve terminals in the corpora allata of an adult female cockroach, Diploptera punctata. Cockroach corpus allatum (CA) cells, exposed to NMDA in vitro, exhibited elevated cytosolic [Ca(2+)], but not in culture medium nominally free of calcium or containing NMDAR-specific channel blockers: MK-801 and Mg(2+). Sensitivity of cockroach corpora allata to NMDA changed cyclically during the ovarian cycle. Highly active glands of 4-day-old mated females, exposed to 3 micromolar NMDA, produced 70% more juvenile hormone (JH) in vitro, but the relatively inactive glands of 8-day-old mated females showed little response to the agonist. The stimulatory effect of NMDA was eliminated by augmenting the culture medium with MK-801, conantokin, or high Mg(2+). Having obtained substantive evidence of functioning NMDAR in insect corpora allata, we used reverse transcription PCR to demonstrate two mRNA transcripts, DNMDAR1 and DNMDAR2, in the ring gland and brain of last-instar Drosophila melanogaster. Immunohistochemical labeling, using mouse monoclonal antibody against rat NMDAR1, showed that only one of the three types of endocrine cells in the ring gland, CA cells, expressed rat NMDAR1-like immunoreactive protein. This antibody also labeled two brain neurons in the lateral protocerebrum, one neuron per brain hemisphere. Finally, we used the same primers for DNMDAR1 to demonstrate a fragment of putative NMDA receptor in the corpora allata of Diploptera punctata. Our results suggest that the NMDAR has a role in regulating JH synthesis and that ionotropic-subtype glutamate receptors became specialized early in animal evolution.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDiploptera punctata 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3areceptors 3aaspartic acid 3aamino acid derivatives 3ajuvenile hormones 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3acorpora allata 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aneurons 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 3aanimal glands 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCockroaches 2aCorpora Allataxmetabolism 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aDNA, Complementaryxmetabolism 2aDizocilpine Maleatexpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrosophila melanogaster 2aExcitatory Amino Acid Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aJuvenile Hormonesxbiosynthesis 2aMagnesiumxpharmacology 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMollusk Venomsxpharmacology 2aNeuronsxmetabolism 2aPeptidesxpharmacology 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRats 2aReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartatexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTime Factors 0an-methyl-d-aspartate 0amolecular sequence data 0aring gland1 aLin, W.Y.1 aLiu, H.P.1 aPszczolkowski, M.A.1 aFu, T.F.1 aChiu, S.L.1 aHolbrook, G.L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Jan. 8, v. 99, no. 1 p.37-42x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0123188993Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02296naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002100137245010800158300001800266500002400284520135100308650002601659650001301685650001301698650001101711650001001722700002001732700001501752700002401767773010501791852000901896856007701905655001201982IND4464218120221119051518.0121001s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446421812DNAL7 a10.1021/jf02108312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyazawa, Mitsuo10aLytic Activity of l-Menthol Derivatives against the Snow Blight Disease Fungus, Micronectriella nivalis  ap. 1880-1883.  aIncludes references  aLytic activity of l-menthol (1) derivatives [(−)-(1S,3R,4S,6S)-6-hydroxymenthol (2), (−)-(1S,3R,4S)-1-hydroxymenthol (3), and (+)-(1S,3R,4R,6S)-6,8-dihydroxymenthol (4)] against the snow blight disease fungus, Micronectriella nivalis was investigated. Compounds 2, 3, and 4 had 85.0, 63.9, and 81.9% lytic activity, respectively, at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. The activity of each of the three compounds increased in a dose−response manner. To study the structure−activity relationship, acetyl esters of 1−4 [(−)-menthyl acetate (1Ac), (−)-6-hydroxymenthyl diacetate (2Ac), (−)-1-hydroxymenthyl 3-monoacetate (3Ac), and (−)-6,8-dihydroxymenthyl 3,6-diacetate (4Ac)] were synthesized with yields of 80.2−99.8% and were also assayed. The acetyl esters of 1Ac, 2Ac, 3Ac, and 4Ac had 51.2, 91.5, 66.0, and 95.2% lytic activity, respectively, at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL, and these compounds showed further high lytic activity compared with the alcohols of 1−4. These acetyl esters also showed higher lytic activity as their concentration was increased. Of particular interest is the fact that 2Ac and 4Ac both had higher lytic activity at 0.05−0.2 mg/mL compared with copper 8-hydroxyquinolate, a standard chemical widely used to control snow blight. This is the first report on lytic activity of l-menthol derivatives. 3aMonographella nivalis 3aacetates 3aalcohols 3ablight 3afungi1 aKawazoe, Hideki1 aSumi, Yuji1 aHyakumachi, Mitsuro0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 Mar. 26, v. 51, no. 7 p.1880-1883x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf02108313Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02164naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245011700133300001800250520108900268650001301357650001401370650001401384650001001398650001301408650001901421650001801440650001101458650001801469650003501487650001101522700002101533700002201554773008801576852000901664856007301673930003301746946001101779655001201790IND4400315520221119051403.0080120e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440031552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSullivan, James C.10aUpgrades to StellaBase facilitate medical and genetic studies on the starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis  ap.

StellaBase, the Nematostella Genomics Database (http://stellabase.org), was developed in 2005 as a resource to support the Nematostella research community. Recently, it has become apparent that Nematostella may be a particularly useful system for studying (i) microevolutionary variation in natural populations, and (ii) the functional evolution of human disease genes. We have developed two new databases that will foster such studies: StellaBase Disease (http://stellabase.org/disease) is a relational database that houses 155 904 invertebrate homologous isoforms of human disease genes from four leading genomic model systems (fly, worm, yeast and Nematostella), including 14 874 predicted genes from the sea anemone itself. StellaBase SNP (http://stellabase.org/SNP) is a relational database that describes the location and underlying type of mutation for 20 063 single nucleotide polymorphisms. 3aAnthozoa 3adatabases 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahuman diseases 3ainvertebrates 3amodels 3anucleic acids 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3ayeasts1 aReitzel, Adam M.1 aFinnerty, John R.0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Jan., v. 36, no. suppl_1 p.D607-D611x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080120b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02113naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010100127300001800228500001500246520119700261650001701458653002801475653001701503653001901520700001601539700002101555700001601576700001901592773011001611852000901721930003301730945001301763946001101776655001201787IND2055972320221119051443.0970318e199510  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205597232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasson, J.Y.12aA new chitosanase gene from a Nocardioides sp. is a third member of glycosyl hydrolase family 46  ap. 2629-2635.  a2019-12-05  aStrain N106, a newly isolated soil actinomycete classified in the genus Nocardioides on the basis of its chemotaxonomy, produced an extracellular chitosanase and was highly active in chitosan degradation. A gene library of Nocardioides sp. N106 was constructed in the shuttle vector pFD666 and recombinant plasmids carrying the chitosanase gene (csnN106) were identified using the 5'-terminal portion of the chitosanase gene from Streptomyces sp. N174 as a hybridization probe. One plasmid, pCSN106-2, was used to transform Streptomyces lividans TK24. The chitosanase produced by S. lividans(pCSN106-2) is a protein of 29.5 kDa, with a pl 8.1, and hydrolyses chitosan by an endo-mechanism giving a mixture of dimers and trimers as end products. N-terminal sequencing revealed that the mature chitosanase is a mixture of two enzyme forms differing by one N-terminal amino acid. The csnN106 gene is 79.5% homologous to the csn gene from Streptomyces sp. N174. At the amino acid level, both chitosanases are homologous at 74.4% and hydrophobic cluster analysis revealed a strict conservation of structural features. This chitosanase is the third known member of family 46 of glycosyl hydrolases. 3asoil biology 0amolecular sequence data 0asoil science 0agenbank/l404081 aBoucher, I.1 aNeugebauer, W.A.1 aRamotar, D.1 aBrzezinski, R.0 tMicrobiology.g1995 Oct., v. 141, no. pt.10 p.2629-2635aMicrobiology (Reading, England)x1350-08727nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02258naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009700128300001600225520143500241650002501676650001801701650002001719653001901739700001501758700002201773773010701795852000901902930003301911945001301944946001101957655001201968IND2206945220221119051416.0000926e200002  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220694522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangari, F.J.14aThe genes for erythritol catabolism are organized as an inducible operon in Brucella abortus  ap. 487-495.  aErythritol utilization is a characteristic of pathogenic Brucella abortus strains. The attenuated vaccine strain B19 is the only Brucella strain that is inhibited by erythritol, so a role for erythritol metabolism in virulence is suspected. A chromosomal fragment from the pathogenic strain B. abortus 2308 containing genes for the utilization of erythritol was cloned taking advantage of an erythritol-sensitive Tn5 insertion mutant. The nucleotide sequence of the complete 7714 bp fragment was determined. Four ORFs were identified in the sequence. The four genes were closely spaced, suggesting that they were organized as a single operon (the ery operon). The first gene (eryA) encoded a 519 aa putative erythritol kinase. The second gene (eryB) encoded an erythritol phosphate dehydrogenase. The function of the third gene (eryC) product was tentatively assigned as D-erythrulose-1 phosphate dehydrogenase and the fourth gene (eryD) encoded a regulator of ery operon expression. The operon promotor was located 5' to eryA, and contained an IHF (integration host factor) binding site. Transcription from this promoter was repressed by EryD, and stimulated by erythritol. Functional IHF was required for expression of the operon in Escherichia coli, suggesting a role for IHF in its regulation in B. abortus. The results obtained will be helpful in clarifying the role of erythritol metabolism in the virulence of Brucella spp. 3abacterial infections 3aanimal health 3aanimal diseases 0agenbank/u571001 aAguero, J.1 aGarcia-Lobo, J.M.0 tMicrobiology.g2000 Feb., v. 146, no. pt.2 p.487-495aMicrobiology (Reading, England)x1350-08727nnas  aDNAL  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03967naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001400182245014000196300002000336500001500356506007600371520141200447506003701859650002901896650001801925650002501943650002001968650001001988650001701998650001402015650002402029650002802053650001402081650001202095650003202107650002502139650005902164650006302223650003002286650003302316650003702349650005002386650002402436650002902460650003102489650002302520650003002543650002102573650004002594650004802634650006002682650003602742650001502778653001302793653002302806653001102829653000802840653001702848700001102865700001902876700001902895773014502914852000903059856008203068930003303150945001303183946001303196655001203209IND2331988920221207051021.0030415e20021210dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233198892DNAL7 a124568852pmid7 aPMC1385822pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.2523428992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirby, K.10aRNA interference-mediated silencing of Sod2 in Drosophila leads to early adult-onset mortality and elevated endogenous oxidative stress  ap. 16162-16167.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOxidative stress has been widely implicated as an important factor in the aging process. Because mitochondrial respiration is the principal source of reactive oxygen within cells, the mitochondrially localized superoxide dismutase (SOD) 2 is thought to play an important front-line defensive role against aging-related oxidative stress. Although genetic studies with mutants deficient in SOD1, the predominantly cytosolic isoform of SOD, have been instrumental in elucidating the role of reactive oxygen metabolism in aging in Drosophila, the lack of available mutations in the Sod2 gene has hampered an equivalent analysis of the participation of this important antioxidant enzyme in the Drosophila aging model. Here we report that ablation of mitochondrial SOD2 through expression of a GAL4-regulated, inverted-repeat Sod2 RNA-interference transgene in an otherwise normal animal causes increased endogenous oxidative stress, resulting in loss of essential enzymatic components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, enhances sensitivity to applied oxidative stress, and causes early-onset mortality in young adults. In sharp contrast, ablation of SOD2 has no overt effect on the development of larvae and pupae, which may reflect a fundamental transition in oxygen utilization and/or reactive oxygen metabolism that occurs during metamorphosis from larval to adult life.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelectron transport chain 3amessenger RNA 3asuperoxide dismutase 3agene expression 3agenes 3amitochondria 3aoxidation 3aaconitate hydratase 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aCitric Acid Cyclexgenetics 2aDNA-Binding Proteins 2aDrosophila Proteinsxdeficiencyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDrosophila melanogasterxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrug Resistancexgenetics 2aElectron Transportxgenetics 2aIron-Sulfur Proteinsxdeficiency 2aIsoenzymesxdeficiencyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aLongevityxgenetics 2aMitochondriaxenzymology 2aOxidative Stressxgenetics 2aParaquatxtoxicity 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRNA Interference 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgenetics 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexdeficiencyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2aTransgenes 0afumarase 0agenetic regulation 0astress 0aRNA 0ahydro-lyases1 aHu, J.1 aHilliker, A.J.1 aPhillips, J.P.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Dec. 10, v. 99, no. 25 p.16162-16167x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2523428993Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01679naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001700151245009800168300001600266500014600282500002400428520055600452650002101008650001101029650001301040650001601053650001901069650001601088650002101104773014001125852000901265856009101274655001201365IND4464209420221119051123.0121001s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446420942DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2003.603.962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaydu, Zsolt10aSelection of paraquat resistant grapevine lines in bud culture and preliminary investigations  ap. 693-696.  aPaper presented at the Eighth International Conference on Grape Genetics and Breeding, volume 2, held August 26-31, 2002, Kecskemet, Hungary.  aIncludes references  aParaquat resistant plants were selected in bud cultures.

One common concern shared by many of these studies is the postmortem delay in obtaining reproductive tissues and the effect this may have on RNA dependent studies. To address this concern, bovine ovarian, oviduct and uterine tissue samples, collected over intervals ranging from 0 to 96 h postmortem to freeze storage, were analysed to determine the potential effects on RNA quantity and quality. The analysis showed that total RNA yields were not changed significantly by postmortem interval up to 96 h while 28S ribosomal RNA remained intact up to 24 h postmortem. Specific messenger RNA transcripts encoding beta-actin, GAPDH and transforming growth factor-beta were detected in all tissues up to 96 h postmortem using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Northern analysis indicated no detectable mRNA degradation up to 24 h postmortem. Finally, using poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from ovarian tissues frozen 2 h postmortem, we constructed corpus luteum and ovarian cortex cDNA libraries containing 7.65 x 10(4) and 1.9 x 10(6) primary transformants with average cDNA lengths of 2.3 and 1.6 kb respectively. Taken together, these data show that a postmortem delay of up to 24 h does not significantly affect the yield or quality of RNA prepared from bovine reproductive tissues. 3aanimal reproduction 2aActinsxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aCryopreservation 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistry 2aFemale 2aGene Library 2aGlyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenasesxgenetics 2aOvaryxmetabolism 2aOviductsxmetabolism 2aRNAxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aRNA, Messenger, Storedxchemistry 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTime Factors 2aTransforming Growth Factor betaxgenetics 2aUterusxmetabolism 0aanimal physiology1 aCasey, O.M.1 aMorris, D.1 aSmith, T.1 aPowell, R.1 aSreenan, J.M.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g2002 Feb. 20, v. 1574, no. 1 p.10-14x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle03150naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245013200173300001600305520197400321653001302295653001702308653002702325700001602352700001902368700001802387700001902405700001402424700001402438700001902452700001602471700001302487700001602500773010302516852000902619856009202628930003302720946001102753655001202764IND4434811520221119051358.0100402e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443481152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02277.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiardiello, M.A.10aBiochemical, immunological and clinical characterization of a cross-reactive nonspecific lipid transfer protein 1 from mulberry  ap. 597-605.  aTo cite this article: Ciardiello MA, Palazzo P, Bernardi ML, Carratore V, Giangrieco I, Longo V, Melis M, Tamburrini M, Zennaro D, Mari A, Colombo P. Biochemical, immunological and clinical characterization of a cross-reactive nonspecific lipid transfer protein 1 from mulberry. Allergy 2010; 65: 597-605. Mulberry (Morus spp.) is a genus comprising several species of deciduous trees whose fruits are commonly eaten in southern Europe. Subjects with severe systemic reaction have been described. The aim of this study was to isolate the allergens of this species. A nonspecific lipid transfer protein 1 (ns-LTP1) was purified from black mulberry by ion exchange and reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and the primary structure was elucidated by direct protein sequencing. Its allergenic activity was evaluated in vivo by skin prick test and in vitro by Western Blot, CD203c basophil activation assay and high throughput multiplex inhibition method on immunosolid-phase allergen chip (ISAC). Mulberry ns-LTP (Mor n 3) comprises 91 amino acids producing a molecular mass of 9246 Da. This protein shows high sequence identity with several allergenic ns-LTP1. Immunoblot analysis and CD203c activation assay demonstrated its allergenic activity in symptomatic subjects and in ns-LTP allergic patients who are not mulberry consumers. Immunological co-recognition was studied in vivo on a selected group of well-characterized ns-LTP allergic patients showing a high percentage of nMor n 3⁺ subjects (88.46%) even in patients who have never eaten mulberry before. IgE inhibition on ISAC micro-array demonstrated an almost complete cross-reactivity to nArt v 3, rCor a 8 and a very high percentage of inhibition to nPru p 3. Mor n 3 is the first allergen isolated in black mulberry and immunologically characterized. It displayed allergenic activity among symptomatic and nonconsumer patients and a pattern of cross-reactivity to other plant-derived LTPs. 0aallergen 0afood allergy 0alipid transfer protein1 aPalazzo, P.1 aBernardi, M.L.1 aCarratore, V.1 aGiangrieco, I.1 aLongo, V.1 aMelis, M.1 aTamburrini, M.1 aZennaro, D.1 aMari, A.1 aColombo, P.0 tAllergy.g2010 May, v. 65, no. 5 p.597-605dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02277.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100402b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02598naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184100002400193245009100217300001600308500002400324520119100348650001901539650001401558650002001572650001401592650001001606650000901616650001901625650001701644650002901661650002201690650002201712653002301734653001801757653003101775700001601806773011601822852000901938856008801947930003302035945002502068946001102093655001202104IND4415914020221119051421.0090206e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441591402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2008.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM120 0aB100 0aX750 0aX200 0aX1001 aMakālaṭcumi, Pa.10aMahalanobis Taguchi System based criteria selection for shrimp aquaculture development  ap. 192-197.  aIncludes references  aAquaculture development suitable location is not formulated from one criterion but from multiple criteria. A list of criteria was selected by reviewing the literature and consultation with aquaculture experts and then classified into five categories namely; water, soil, support, infrastructure and risk factor. Using these criteria a Mahalanobis Taguchi System (MTS) based tool was developed to facilitate the selection of prime set of criteria, which is a subset of the original criteria for suitable aquaculture site identification. Mahalanobis Distance (MD) was used for constructing a measurement scale for the aquaculture system. The principles of Taguchi method was used for screening the important criteria in the system. The information required to make an assessment was entered into the computer program. The computer program then processes the information and produces the prime set of criteria for each category. The software program is a valuable tool for the identification of prime set of criteria within each category. One can use these prime set of criteria within each category instead of all criteria for the identification of optimal location in shrimp aquaculture. 3ashrimp culture 3ageography 3adecision making 3ascreening 3awater 3asoil 3ainfrastructure 3arisk factors 3adecision support systems 3acomputer analysis 3acomputer software 0aliterature reviews 0asite location 0aMahalanobis Taguchi System1 aGanesan, K.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2009 Mar., v. 65, no. 2 p.192-197dElsevier Sciencex0168-16997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2008.09.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20110602b20110701c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/08/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03362naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100001700184245007700201300001600278500002400294500001500318520197300333650001102306650001802317650002202335650001702357650001102374650000902385650002102394650001402415650002602429650001502455653001202470653002002482653002702502700001602529700001502545700001402560773011602574852000902690856008802699930003302787945002502820946001102845655001202856IND4415913920221119051305.0090206e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441591392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2008.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aN200 0aX100 0aX2001 aEhsani, M.R.10aTwo fruit counting techniques for citrus mechanical harvesting machinery  ap. 186-191.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTwo fruit counting methods were developed for citrus mechanical harvesting machineries. The first method relied on the flow of fruits forming a random arrival process (Poisson process), whereas the second method relied on counting singulated fruits. The first approach was based on a method developed earlier targeted at measuring the flow rate and mean particle diameter of granular fertilizer particles. A similar approach was used in this research, where a large time of flight device was developed that measured the lengths of clumps of fruits falling through the time of flight device. The clump lengths were subsequently used to estimate the number of fruits passing the sensor per time unit. This method can only work accurately if the flow of fruits constitutes an independent arrival process (Poisson process). The advantage of this method is that it is non-intrusive, founded on theory and does not require calibration. However, during experiments it became evident that the flow of fruits directly after being transported from a conveyor belt was not Poisson driven, and therefore the method failed. As an alternative, a second method was developed which did not rely on any assumptions about the flow regime and is also virtually non-intrusive. This method uses a flow separation section which funnels and singulates the flow of fruits into five channels. The fruits in these channels were counted individually using laser-based photo-interruption sensors. This method, although more rudimentary than the Poisson-based approach, yielded good accuracy: during laboratory tests, where a total of 2000 fruits passed the sensor, 1996 were counted, yielding an error of 0.2%. This result was obtained with an unrefined sensor, and further increase in accuracy may be possible. Testing is planned on a full size canopy shaker fruit harvester under field conditions to assess the robustness and to develop methods to resolve potential errors introduced by debris. 3acanopy 3acitrus fruits 3ameasuring devices 3atree shakers 3alasers 3aflow 3afruit harvesters 3aconveyors 3amechanical harvesting 3adimensions 0asensors 0aPoisson process 0afruits (plant anatomy)1 aGrift, T.E.1 aMaja, J.M.1 aZhong, D.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2009 Mar., v. 65, no. 2 p.186-191dElsevier Sciencex0168-16997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2008.09.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20110602b20110701c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/08/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02231naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245005700164300001500221520125100236650002301487650001101510650001701521650002301538653001601561653002401577653002201601700002701623773013301650852000901783856006901792930003301861946001101894655001201905IND4387471520221119051328.0070204e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438747152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-006-9042-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulder, Peter 10aSectoral Energy- and Labour-Productivity Convergence  ap. 85-112.  aThis paper empirically investigates the development of cross-country differences in energy- and labour productivity. The analysis is performed at a detailed sectoral level for 14 OECD countries, covering the period 1970-1997. A σ-convergence analysis reveals that the development over time of the cross-country variation in productivity performance differs across sectors as well as across different levels of aggregation. Both patterns of convergence as well as divergence are found. Cross-country variation of productivity levels is typically larger for energy than for labour. A β-convergence analysis provides support for the hypothesis that in most sectors lagging countries tend to catch up with technological leaders, in particular in terms of energy productivity. Moreover, the results show that convergence is conditional, meaning that productivity levels converge to country-specific steady states. Energy prices and wages are shown to positively affect energy- and labour-productivity growth, respectively. We also find evidence for the importance of economies of scale, whereas the investment share, openness and specialization play only a modest role in explaining cross-country variation in energy- and labour-productivity growth. 3aeconomies of scale 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3alabor productivity 0aconvergence 0aenergy productivity 0asectoral analysis1 aDe Groot, Henri L.

Atrazine chlorohydrolase or ADP had no effect on the degradation of metolachlor. The half-lives of atrazine in the freshly added soils and in the aged soils after the treatment with atrazine chlorohydrolase or ADP markedly decreased as compared with those in the uninoculated soils. The half-lives of metolachlor in the aged soils were much longer than those of freshly added metolachlor. The percentage atrazine degraded in the freshly treated soils was much higher than that in the aged soils. This indicates that aging significantly decreased the bioavailability of atrazine. Vegetation significantly decreased the concentration of metolachlor.

Details of carotenoid to chlorophyll energy transfer mechanisms and their dependence on structural variability of carotenoids are as yet poorly understood. Here, we employ femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to reveal energy transfer pathways in the peridinin-chlorophyll-a-protein (PCP) complex containing the highly substituted carotenoid peridinin, which includes an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state in its excited state manifold. Extending the transient absorption spectra toward near-infrared region (600-1800 nm) allowed us to separate contributions from different low-lying excited states of peridinin. The results demonstrate a special light-harvesting strategy in the PCP complex that uses the ICT state of peridinin to enhance energy transfer efficiency.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmphidinium 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aabsorbance 3alight harvesting complex 3aelectron transfer 0aamphidinium carterae1 aHiller, R.G.1 aSundstrom, V.1 aPolivka, T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Dec. 24, v. 99, no. 26 p.16760-16765x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2625375993Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle
